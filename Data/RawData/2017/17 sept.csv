                आजादी के 75 वर्ष पूर्ण होने पर देशवासियों को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं। बहुत-बहुत बधाई। न सिर्फ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का हर कोना, लेकिन दुनिया के हर कोने में आज किसी न किसी रूप में भारतीयों के द्वारा या भारत के प्रति अपार प्रेम रखने वालों के द्वारा विश्‍व के हर कोने में यह हमारा तिरंगा आन-बान-शान के साथ लहरा रहा है। मैं विश्‍वभर में फैले हुए भारत प्रेमियों को, भारतीयों को आजादी के इस अमृत महोत्‍सव की बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। 

आज का यह दिवस ऐतिहासिक दिवस है। एक पुण्‍य पड़ाव, एक नई राह, एक नये संकल्‍प और नये सामर्थ्‍य के साथ कदम बढ़ाने का यह शुभ अवसर है। आजादी के जंग में गुलामी का पूरा कालंखड संघर्ष में बीता है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का कोई कोना ऐसा नहीं था, कोई काल ऐसा नहीं था, जब देशवासियों ने सैकड़ों सालों तक गुलामी के खिलाफ जंग न किया हो। जीवन न खपाया हो, यातनाएं न झेली हो, आहूति न दी हो। आज हम सब देशवासियों के लिए ऐसे हर महापुरूष को, हर त्‍यागी को, हर बलिदानी को नमन करने का अवसर है। उनका ऋण स्‍वीकार करने का अवसर है और उनका स्‍मरण करते हुए उनके सपनों को जल्‍द से जल्‍द पूरा करने का संकल्‍प लेने का भी अवसर है। हम सभी देशवासी कृतज्ञ है, पूज्‍य बापू के, नेता जी सुभाष चंद्र बोस के, बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर के, वीर सावरकर के, जिन्‍होंने कर्तव्‍य पथ पर जीवन को खपा दिया। कर्तव्‍य पथ ही उनका जीवन पथ रहा। यह देश कृतज्ञ है, मंगल पांडे, तात्‍या टोपे, भगत सिंह, सुखदेव, राजगुरू, चंद्रशेखर आजाद, अशफाक उल्ला खां, राम प्रसाद बिस्मिल अनगिनत ऐसे हमारे क्रांति वीरों ने अंग्रेजों की हुकुमत की नींव हिला दी थी। यह राष्‍ट्र कृतज्ञ है, उन वीरांगनाओं के लिए, रानी लक्ष्‍मीबाई हो, झलकारी बाई, दुर्गा भाभी, रानी गाइदिन्ल्यू, रानी चेनम्‍मा, बेगम हजरत महल, वेलु नाच्चियार, भारत की नारी शक्ति क्‍या होती है। 

भारत की नारी शक्ति का संकल्‍प क्‍या होता है। भारत की नारी त्‍याग और बलिदान की क्‍या पराकाष्‍ठा कर सकती है, वैसी अनगिनत वीरांगनाओं का स्‍मरण करते हुए हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी गर्व से भर जाता है। आजादी का जंग भी लड़ने वाले और आजादी के बाद देश बनाने वाले डॉ. राजेन्‍द्र प्रसाद जी हों, नेहरू जी हों, सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल, श्‍यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी, लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री, दीनदयाल उपाध्‍याय, जय प्रकाश नारायण, राम मनोहर लोहिया, आचार्य विनाबाभावे, नाना जी देशमुख, सुब्रह्मण्‍यमभारती, अनगिनत ऐसे महापुरुषों को आज नमन करने का अवसर है।

हम आजादी की जंग की चर्चा करते हैं तो हम उन जंगलों में जीने वाले हमारे आदिवासी समाज का भी गौरव करना हम नहीं भूल सकते हैं। भगवान बिरसा मुंडा, सिद्धू कान्हू, अल्लूरी सीताराम राजू, गोविंद गुरू, अनगिनत नाम हैं जिन्‍होंने आजादी के आंदोलन की आवाज बनकर के दूर-सदूर जंगलों में भी.... मेरे आदिवासी भाई-बहनों, मेरी माताओं, मेरे युवकों में मातृभूमि के लिए जीने-मरने के लिए प्रेरणा जगाई। ये देश का सौभाग्‍य रहा है कि आजादी की जंग के कई रूप रहे हैं और उसमें एक रूप वो भी था जिसमें नारायण गुरू हो, स्‍वामी विवेकानंद हो, महर्षि अरविंदो हो, गुरुदेव रविन्‍द्र नाथ टैगोर हो, ऐसे अनेक महापुरुष हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने में, हर गांव में भारत की चेतना को जगाते रहे। भारत को चेतनमन बनाते रहे। 

अमृत महोत्‍सव के दौरान देश ने.... पूरे एक साल से हम देख रहे हैं। 2021 में दांढी यात्रा से प्रारंभ हुआ। स्‍मृति दिवस को संवरते हुए हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर जिले में, हर कोने में देशवासियों ने आजादी के अमृत महोत्‍सव के लक्ष्‍यावृद्धि कार्यक्रम किए। शायद इतिहास में इतना विशाल, व्‍यापक, लंबा एक ही मकसद का उत्‍सव मनाया गया हो वो शायद ये पहली घटना हुई है और हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने में उन सभी महापुरुषों को याद करने का प्रयास किया गया जिनको किसी न किसी कारणवंश इतिहास में जगह ने मिली या उनको भूला दिया गया था। आज देश ने खोज-खोज करके हर कोने में ऐसे वीरों को, महापुरुषों को, त्‍यागियों को, बलिदानियों को सत्‍या‍वीरों को याद किया, नमन किया। अमृत महोत्‍सव के दरम्यिान इन सभी महापुरुषों को नमन करने अवसर रहा। कल 14 अगस्‍त को भारत ने विभाजन विभिषिका स्‍मृति दिवस भी बड़े भारी मन से हृदय के गहरे घावों को याद करते हुए उन कोटि-कोटि जनों ने बहुत कुछ सहन किया था, तिरंगे की शान के लिए सहन किया था। मातृभूमि की मिट्टी से मोहब्‍बत के कारण सहन किया था और धैर्य नहीं खोया था। भारत के प्रति प्रेम ने नई जिंदगी की शुरूआत करने का उनका संकल्‍प नमन करने योग्‍य है, प्रेरणा पाने योग्‍य है। 

आज जब हम आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव मना रहे हैं तो पिछले 75 साल में देश के लिए जीने मरने वाले, देश की सुरक्षा करने वाले, देश के संकल्‍पों को पूरा करने वाले; चाहे सेना के जवान हों, पुलिस के कर्मी हों, शासन में बैठे हुए ब्‍यूरोक्रेट्स हों, जनप्रतिनिधि हों, स्‍थानीय स्‍वराज की संस्‍थाओं के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों, राज्‍यों के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों, केंद्र के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों; 75 साल में इन सबके योगदान को भी आज स्‍मरण करने का अवसर है और देश के कोटि-कोटि नागरिकों को भी, जिन्‍होंने 75 साल में अनेक प्रकार की कठिनाइयों के बीच भी देश को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए अपने से जो हो सका वो करने का प्रयास किया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

75 साल की हमारी ये यात्रा अनेक उतार-चढ़ाव से भरी हुई है। सुख-दु:ख की छाया मंडराती रही है और इसके बीच भी हमारे देशवासियों ने उपलब्धियां की हैं, पुरुषार्थ किया है, हार नहीं मानी है। संकल्‍पों को ओझल नहीं होने दिया है। और इसलिए, और ये भी सच्‍चाई है कि सैंकड़ों सालों के गुलामी के कालखंड ने भारत के मन को, भारत के मानवी की भावनाओं को गहरे घाव दिए थे, गहरी चोटें पहुंचाई थीं, लेकिन उसके भीतर एक जिद भी थी, एक जिजीविषा भी थी, एक जुनून भी था, एक जोश भी था। और उसके कारण अभावों के बीच में भी, उपहास के बीच में भी और जब आजादी की जंग अंतिम चरण में था तो देश को डराने के लिए, निराश करने के लिए, हताश करने के लिए सारे उपाय किए गए थे। अगर आजादी आई अंग्रेज चले जाएंगे तो देश टूट जाएगा, बिखर जाएंगे, लोग अंदर-अंदर लड़ करके मर जाएंगे, कुछ नहीं बचेगा, अंधकार युग में भारत चला जाएगा, न जाने क्‍या—क्‍या आशंकाएं व्‍यक्‍त की गई थीं। लेकिन उनको पता नहीं था ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की मिट्टी है, इस मिट्टी में वो सामर्थ्‍य है जो शासकों से भी परे सामर्थ्‍य का एक अंतरप्रभाव लेकर जीता रहा है, सदियों तक जीता रहा है और उसी का परिणाम है, हमने क्‍या कुछ नहीं झेला है, कभी अन्‍न का संकट झेला, कभी युद्ध के शिकार हो गए। 

आंतकवाद ने डगर-डगर चुनौतियां पैदा कीं, निर्दोष नागरिकों को मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। छद्म युद्ध चलते रहे, प्राकृतिक आपदाएं आती रही, सफलता विफलता, आशा निराशा, न जाने कितने पड़ाव आए हैं। लेकिन इन पड़ाव के बीच भी भारत आगे बढ़ता रहा है। भारत की विविधता जो औरों को भारत के लिए बोझ लगती थी। वो भारत की विविधता ही भारत की अनमोल शक्ति है। शक्ति का एक अटूट प्रमाण है। दुनिया को पता नहीं था कि भारत के पास एक inherent सामर्थ्य है, एक संस्कार सरिता है, एक मन मस्तिष्क् का, विचारों का बंधन है। और वो है भारत लोकतंत्र की जननी है, Mother of Democracy है और जिनके जहन में लोकतंत्र होता है वे जब संकल्प कर के चल पड़ते हैं, वो सामर्थ्य दुनिया की बड़ी-बड़ी सल्तनतों के लिए भी संकट का काल लेकर के आती है। ये Mother of Democracy, ये लोकतंत्र की जननी, हमारे भारत ने सिद्ध कर दिया कि हमारे पास एक अनमोल सामर्थ्य है।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

हिमालय की कन्दराएँ हो, हर कोने में महात्मा गांधी का जो सपना था आखिरी इंसान की चिंता करने का, महात्मा गांधी जी की जो आकांक्षा थी अंतिम छोर पर बैठे हुए व्यक्ति को समर्थ बनाने की, मैंने अपने आप को उसके लिए समर्पित किया है, और उन 8 साल का नतीजा और आजादी के इतने दशकों का अनुभव आज 75 साल के बाद जब अमृत काल की ओर कदम रख रहे हैं, अमृत काल की ये पहली प्रभात है तब मैं एक एैसे सामर्थ्य को देख रहा हूं। और जिससे में गर्व से भर जाता हूं।

देशवासियों, 

मैं आज देश का सबसे बड़ा सौभाग्य ये देख रहा हूं। कि भारत का जनमन आकांक्षित जनमन है। Aspirational Society किसी भी देश की बहुत बड़ी अमानत होती है। और हमें गर्व है कि आज हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में, हर समाज के हर वर्ग में, हर तबके में, आकांक्षाएं उफान पर हैं। देश का हर नागरिक चीजें बदलना चाहता है, बदलते देखना चाहता है, लेकिन इंतजार करने को तैयार नहीं है, अपनी आंखों के सामने देखना चाहता है, कर्तव्‍य से जुड़ कर करना चाहता है। वो गति चाहता है, प्रगति चाहता है। 75 साल में संजोय हुए सारे सपने अपनी ही आंखों के सामने पूरा करने के लिए वो लालयित है, उत्‍साहित है, उतावला भी है। 

कुछ लोगों को इसके कारण संकट हो सकता है। क्‍योंकि जब aspirational society होती है तब सरकारों को भी तलवार की धार पर चलना पड़ता है। सरकारों को भी समय के साथ दौड़ना पड़ता है और मुझे विश्‍वास है चाहे केन्‍द्र सरकार हो, राज्‍य सरकार हो, स्थानीय स्‍वराज्‍य की संस्‍थाएं हों, किसी भी प्रकार की शासन व्‍यवस्‍था क्‍यों न हो, हर किसी को इस aspirational society को address करना पड़ेगा, उनकी आकांक्षाओं के लिए हम ज्‍यादा इंतजार नहीं कर सकते। हमारे इस aspirational society ने लंबे अरसे तक इंतजार किया है। लेकिन अब वो अपनी आने वाली पीढ़ी को इंतजार में जीने के लिए मजबूर करने को तैयार नहीं हैं और इसलिए ये अमृत काल का पहला प्रभात हमें उस aspirational society के आकांक्षाओं को पूरा करने के लिए बहुत बड़ा सुनहरा अवसर लेकर के आई है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

हमने पिछले दिनों देखा है एक और ताकत का हमने अनुभव किया है और वो है भारत में सामूहिक चेतना पुनर्जागरण हुआ है। एक सामूहिक चेतना का पुनर्जागरण आजादी के इतने संघर्ष में जो अमृत था, वो अब संजोया जा रहा है, संकलित हो रहा है। संकल्‍प में परिवर्तित हो रहा है, पुरुषार्थ की पराकाष्ठा जुड़ रही है और सिद्धि का मार्ग नजर आ रहा है। ये चेतना, मैं समझता हूं कि चेतना का जागरण ये पुनर्जागरण ये हमारी सबसे बड़ी अमानत है। और ये पुनर्जागरण देखिए 10 अगस्‍त तक लोगों को पता तक नहीं होगा शायद कि देश के भीतर कौन सी ताकत है। लेकिन पिछले तीन दिन से जिस प्रकार से तिरंगे झंडे को लेकर के तिरंगा की यात्रा को लेकर करके देश चल पड़ा है। बड़े-बड़े social science के experts वे भी शायद कल्‍पना नहीं कर सकते कि मेरे भीतर के अंदर कि मेरे देश के भीतर कितना बड़ा सामर्थ है, एक तिरंगे झंडे ने दिखा दिया है। ये पुनर्चेतना, पुनर्जागरण का पल है। ये लोग समझ नहीं पाएं हैं। 

जब देश जनता कर्फ्यू के लिए हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का हर कोना निकल पड़ता है, तब उस चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। जब देश ता‍ली, थाली बजाकर के corona warriors के साथ कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर के खड़ा को जाता है, तब चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। जब दीया जलाकर के corona warrior को शुभकामनाएं देने के लिए देश निकल पड़ता है, तब उस चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। दुनिया कोरोना के काल खंड में वैक्सिन लेना या न लेना, वैक्सिन काम की है या नहीं है, उस उलझन में जी रही थी। उस समय मेरे देश के गांव गरीब भी दो सौ करोड़ डोज दुनिया को चौंका देने वाला काम करके दिखा देते हैं। ये ही चेतना है, ये ही सामर्थ्य है इस सामर्थ्य ने आज देश को नई ताकत दी है।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयों-बहनों 

इस एक महत्‍वपूर्ण सामर्थ्य को मैं देख रहा हूं जैसे aspirational society, जैसे पुनर्जागरण वैसे ही आजादी के इतने दशकों के बाद पूरे विश्‍व का भारत की तरफ देखने का नजरिया बदल चुका है। विश्‍व भारत की तरफ गर्व से देख रहा है, अपेक्षा से देख रहा है। समस्‍याओं का समाधान भारत की धरती पर दुनिया खोजने लगी है दोस्‍तों। विश्‍व का यह बदलाव, विश्‍व की सोच में यह परिवर्तन 75 साल की हमारी अनुभव यात्रा का परिणाम है।

हम जिस प्रकार से संकल्‍प को लेकर चल पड़े है दुनिया इसे देख रही है, और आखिरकार विश्‍व भी उम्‍मीदें लेकर जी रहा है। उम्‍मीदें पूरी करने का सामर्थ्‍य कहां पड़ा है वो उसे दिखने लगा है। मैं इसे स्‍त्री शक्ति के रूप में देखता हूं। तीन सामर्थ्‍य के रूप में देखता हूं, और यह त्रि-शक्ति है aspiration की, पुनर्जागणरण की और विश्‍व के उम्‍मीदों की और इसे पूरा करने के लिए हम जानते हैं दोस्‍तों आज दुनिया में एक विश्‍वास जगने में मेरे देशवासियों की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका है। 130 करोड़ देशवासियों ने कई दशकों के अनुभव के बाद स्थिर सरकार का महत्‍व क्‍या होता है, राजनीतिक स्थिरता का महत्‍व क्‍या होता है, political stability दुनिया में किस प्रकार की ताकत दिखा सकती है। 

नीतियों में कैसा सामर्थ्‍य होता है, उन नीतियों पर विश्‍व का कैसे भरोसा बनता है। यह भारत ने दिखाया है और दुनिया भी इसे समझ रही है। और अब जब राजनीतिक स्थिरता हो, नीतियों में गतिशीलता हो, निर्णयों में तेजी हो, सर्वव्‍यापकता हो, सर्वसमाजविश्‍वस्‍ता हो, तो विकास के लिए हर कोई भागीदार बनता है। हमने सबका साथ, सबका विकास का मंत्र लेकर हम चलें थे, लेकिन देखते ही देखते देशवासियों ने सब‍का विश्‍वास और सबके प्रयास से उसमें और रंग भर दिए हैं। और इसलिए हमने देखा है हमारी सामूहिक शक्ति को, हमारे सामूहिक सामर्थ्‍य को हमने देखा है। आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव जिस प्रकार से मनाया गया, जिस प्रकार से आज हर जिले में 75 अमृत सरोवर बनाने का अभियान चल रहा है, गांव-गांव के लोग जुड़ रहे हैं, कार्य सेवा कर रहे हैं। अपने प्रयत्‍नों से अपने गांव में जल संरक्षण के लिए बड़ा अभियान चला रहे हैं। और इसलिए भाईयों-बहनों, चाहे स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान हो, चाहे गरीबों के कल्‍याण का काम हो, देश आज पूरी शक्ति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। 

लेकिन भाईयों-बहनों हम लोग आजादी के अमृतकाल में हमारी 75 साल की यात्रा को उसका गौरवगान ही करते रहेंगे, अपनी ही पीठ थपथपाते रहेंगे, तो हमारे सपने कहीं दूर चले जाएंगे। और इसलिए 75 साल का कालखंड कितना ही शानदार रहा हो, कितने ही संकटों वाला रहा हो, कितने ही चुनौतियों वाला रहा हो, कितने ही सपने अधूरे दिखते हो उसके बावजूद भी आज जब हम अमृतकाल में प्रवेश कर रहे हैं अगले 25 वर्ष हमारे देश के लिए अत्‍यंत महत्‍वपूर्ण है और इसलिए जब मैं आज मेरे सामने लाल किले पर से 130 करोड़ देशवासियों के सामर्थ्‍य का स्‍मरण करता हूं, उनके सपनों को देखता हूं, उनके संकल्‍प की अनुभूति करता हूं तो साथियों मुझे लगता है आने वाले 25 साल के लिए हमें उन पंचप्रण पर अपनी शक्ति को केंद्रित करनी होगा। अपने संकल्‍पों को केंद्रित करना होगा। अपने सामर्थ्‍य को केंद्रित करना होगा। और हमें उन पंचप्रण को लेकर के, 2047 जब आजादी के 100 साल होंगे आजादी के दिवानों के सारे सपने पूरे करने का जिम्‍मा उठा करके चलना होगा। 

जब मैं पंचप्रण की बात करता हूं तो पहला प्रण अब देश बड़े संकल्‍प लेकर ही चलेगा। बहुत बड़े संकल्‍प लेकर के चलना होगा। और वो बड़ा संकल्‍प है विकसित भारत, अब उससे कुछ कम नहीं होना चाहिए। बड़ा संकल्‍प- दूसरा प्रण है किसी भी कोने में हमारे मन के भीतर, हमारी आदतों के भीतर गुलामी का एक भी अंश अगर अभी भी कोई है तो उसको किसी भी हालत में बचने नहीं देना है। अब शत-प्रतिशत, शत-प्रतिशत सैंकड़ों साल की गुलामी ने जहां हमें जकड़ कर रखा है, हमें हमारे मनोभाव को बांध करके रखा हुआ है, हमारी सोच में विकृतियां पैदा करके रखी हैं। हमें गुलामी की छोटी से छोटी चीज भी कहीं नजर आती है, हमारे भीतर नजर आती है, हमारे आस-पास नजर आती है हमें उससे मुक्ति पानी ही होगी। ये हमारी दूसरी प्रण शक्ति है। तीसरी प्रण शक्ति, हमें हमारी विरासत पर गर्व होना चाहिए, हमारी विरासत के प्रति क्‍योंकि यही विरासत है जिसने कभी भारत को स्‍वर्णिम काल दिया था। और यही विरासत है जो समयानुकूल परिवर्तन करने आदत रखती है। यही विरासत है जो काल-बाह्य छोड़ती रही है। नित्‍य नूतन स्‍वीकारती रही है। और इसलिए इस विरासत के प्रति हमें गर्व होना चाहिए। चौथा प्रण वो भी उतना ही महत्‍वपूर्ण है और वो है एकता और एकजुटता। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों में एकता, न कोई अपना न कोई पराया, एकता की ताकत, ‘एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत’ के सपनों के लिए हमारा चौथा प्रण है। और पांचवां प्रण, पांचवां प्रण है नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य, नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य, जिसमें प्रधानमंत्री भी बाहर नहीं होता, मुख्‍यमंत्री भी बाहर नहीं होता वो भी नागरिक है। नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य। ये हमारे आने वाले 25 साल के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए एक बहुत बड़ी प्रण शक्ति है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

जब सपने बड़े होते हैं, जब संकल्‍प बड़े होते हैं तो पुरुषार्थ भी बहुत बड़ा होता है। शक्ति भी बहुत बड़ा मात्रा में जुड़ जाती है। अब कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता है कि देश उस 40-42 के काल खंड को याद कीजिए, देश उठ खड़ा हुआ था। किसी ने हाथ में झाड़ू लिया था, किसी ने तकली ली थी, किसी ने सत्‍याग्रह का मार्ग चुना था, किसी ने संघर्ष का मार्ग चुना था, किसी ने काल क्रांति की वीरता का रास्‍ता चुना था। लेकिन संकल्‍प बड़ा था ‘आजादी’ और ताकत देखिए बड़ा संकल्‍प था तो आजादी लेकर रहे। हम आजाद हो गये। अगर संकल्‍प छोटा होता, सीमित होता तो शायद आज भी संघर्ष करने के दिन चालू रहते, लेकिन संकल्‍प बड़ा था, तो हमने हासिल भी किया। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

अब आज जब अमृत काल की पहली प्रभात है, तो हमें इन पच्‍चीस साल में विकसित भारत बना कर रहना है। अपनी आंखों के सामने और 20-22-25 साल के मेरे नौजवान, मेरे देश के मेरे सामने है, मेरे देश के नौजवानों जब देश आजादी के 100 साल मनाएगा। तब आप 50-55 के हुए होंगे, मतलब आपके जीवन का ये स्‍वर्णिम काल, आपकी उम्र के ये 25-30 साल भारत के सपनों को पूरा करने का काल है। आप संकल्‍प ले करके मेरे साथ चल पड़िए साथियों, तिंरगे झंडे की शपथ ले करके चल पड़िए, हम सब पूरी ताकत से लग जाएं। महासंकल्‍प, मेरा देश विकसित देश होगा, developed country होगा, विकास के हरेक पैरामीटर में हम मानवकेंद्री व्‍यवस्‍था को विकसित करेंगे, हमारे केंद्र में मानव होगा, हमारे केंद्र के मानव की आशा-आकांक्षाएं होंगी। हम जानते हैं, भारत जब बड़े संकल्‍प करता है तो करके भी दिखाता है।

जब मैंने यहां स्‍वच्‍छता की बात कही थी मेरे पहले भाषण में, देश चल पड़ा है, जिससे जहां हो सका, स्‍वच्‍छता की ओर आगे बढ़ा और गंदगी के प्रति नफरत एक स्‍वभाव बनता गया है। यही तो देश है, जिसने इसको करके दिखाया है और कर भी रहा है, आगे भी कर रहा है; यही तो देश है, जिसने वैक्‍सीनेशन, दुनिया दुविधा में थी, 200 करोड़ का लक्ष्‍य पार कर लिया है, समय-सीमा में कर लिया है, पुराने सारे रिकॉर्ड तोड़ करके कर लिया है, ये देश कर सकता है। हमने तय किया था देश को खाड़ी के तेल पर हम गुजारा करते हैं, झाड़ी के तेल की ओर कैसे बढ़ें, 10 प्रतिशत इथेनॉल ब्लेडिंग का सपना बड़ा लगता था। पुराना इतिहास बताता था संभव नहीं है, लेकिन समय से पहले 10 प्रतिशत इथेनॉल ब्लेडिंग करके देश ने इस सपने को पूरा कर दिया है।

भाइयों-बहनों,

ढाई करोड़ लोगों को इतने कम समय में बिजली कनेक्‍शन पहुंचाना, छोटा काम नहीं था, देश ने करके दिखाया। लाखों परिवारों के घर में ‘नल से जल’ पहुंचाने का काम आज देश तेज गति से कर रहा है। खुले में शौच से मुक्ति, भारत के अंदर आज संभव हो पाया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

अनुभव कहता है कि एक बार हम सब संकल्‍प ले करके चल पड़ें तो हम निर्धारित लक्ष्‍यों को पार कर सकते हैं। Renewable energy का लक्ष्‍य हो, देश में नए मेडिकल कॉलेज बनाने का इरादा हो, डॉक्‍टरों की तैयारी करवानी हो, हर क्षेत्र में पहले से गति बहुत बढ़ी है। और इसलिए मैं कहता हूं अब आने वाले 25 साल बड़े संकल्‍प के हों, यही हमारा प्रण, यही हमारा प्रण भी होना चाहिए। 

दूसरी बात मैंने कही है, उस प्रण शक्ति की मैंने चर्चा की है कि गुलामी की मानसिकता, देश की सोच सोचिए भाइयो, कब तक दुनिया हमें सर्टिफिकेट बांटती रहेगी? कब तक दुनिया के सर्टिफिकेट पर हम गुजारा करेंगे? क्‍या हम अपने मानक नहीं बनाएंगे? क्‍या 130 करोड़ का देश अपने मानकों को पार करने के लिए पुरुषार्थ नहीं कर सकता है। हमें किसी भी हालत में औरों के जैसा दिखने की कोशिश करने की जरूरत नहीं है। हम जैसे हैं वैसे, लेकिन सामर्थ्‍य के साथ खड़े होंगे, ये हमारा मिजाज होना चाहिए। हमें गुलामी से मुक्ति चाहिए। हमारे मन के भीतर दूर-दूर सात समंदर के नीचे भी गुलामी का तत्‍व नहीं बचे रहना चाहिए साथियों। और मैं आशा से देखता हूं, जिस प्रकार से नई राष्‍ट्रीय शिक्षा नीति बनी है, जिस मंथन के साथ बनी है, कोटि-कोटि लोगों के विचार-प्रवाह को संकलित करते हुए बनी है और भारत की धरती की जमीन से जुड़ी हुई शिक्षा नीति बनी है, रसकस हमारी धरती के मिले हैं। हमने जो कौशल्य पर बल दिया है, ये एक ऐसा सामर्थ्‍य है, जो हमें गुलामी से मुक्ति की ताकत देगा।

हमने देखा है कभी-कभी तो हमारा टेलेंट भाषा के बंधनों में बंध जाता है, ये गुलामी की मानसिकता का परिणाम है। हमें हमारे देश की हर भाषा पर गर्व होना चाहिए। हमें भाषा आती हो या न आती हो, लेकिन मेरे देश की भाषा है, मेरे पूर्वजों ने दुनिया को दी हुई ये भाषा है, हमें गर्व होना चाहिए।

मेरे साथियों,

आज डिजिटल इंडिया का रूप हम देख रहे हैं। स्टार्ट अप देख रहे हैं। कौन लोग हैं? ये वो टैलेंट है जो टीयर-2, टीयर-3 सीटी में किसी गांव गरीब के परिवार में बसे हुए लोग हैं। ये हमारे नौजवान हैं जो आज नई-नई खोज के साथ दुनिया के सामने आ रहे हैं। गुलामी की मानसिकता हमें उसे तिलांजलि देनी पड़ेगी। अपने सामर्थ्य पर भरोसा करने होगा। 

दूसरी एक बात जो मैंने कही है, तीसरी मेरी प्रणशक्ति की बात है वो है हमारी विरासत पर। हमें गर्व होना चाहिए। जब हम अपनी धरती से जुड़ेंगे, जब हम अपनी धरती से जुड़ेंगे, तभी तो ऊंचा उड़ेंगे, और जब हम ऊंचा उड़ेंगे तो हम विश्व को भी समाधान दे पाएंगे। हमने देखा है जब हम अपनी चीजों पर गर्व करते हैं। आज दुनिया holistic health care की चर्चा कर रही है लेकिन जब holistic health care की चर्चा करती है तो उसकी नजर भारत के योग पर जाती है, भारत के आयुर्वेद पर जाती है, भारत के holistic lifestyle पर जाती है। ये हमारी विरासत है जो हम दुनिया का दे रहे हैं। दुनिया आज उससे प्रभावित हो रही है। अब हमारी ताकत देखिए। हम वो लोग हैं जो प्रकृति के साथ जीना जानते हैं। प्रकृति को प्रेम करना जानते हैं। आज विश्व पर्यावरण की जो समस्या से जूझ रहा है। हमारे पास वो विरासत है, ग्लोबल वार्मिंग की समस्याओं के समाधान का रास्ता हम लोगों के पास है। हमारे पूर्वजों ने दिया हुआ है। 

जब हम lifestyle की बात करते हैं, environment friendly lifestyle की बात करते हैं, हम life mission  की बात करते हैं तो दुनिया का ध्यान आकर्षित करते हैं। हमारे पास ये सामर्थ्य है। हमारा बड़ा धान मोटा धान मिलेट, हमारे यहां तो घर-घर की चीज रही है। ये हमारी विरासत है, हमारे छोटे किसानों के परिश्रम से छोटी-छोटी जमीन के टुकड़ों में फलने फुलने वाली हमारी धान। आज दुनिया अंतराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर millet year मनाने के लिए आगे बढ़ रही है। मतलब हमारी विरासत को आज दुनिया, हम उस पर गर्व करना सीखें। हमारे पास दुनिया को बहुत कुछ देना है। हमारे family values विश्व के सामाजिक तनाव की जब चर्चा हो रही है। व्यक्तिगत तनाव की चर्चा होती है, तो लोगों को योग दिखता है। सामुहिक तनाव की बात होती है तब भारत की पारिवारिक व्यवस्था दिखती है। संयुक्त परिवार की एक पूंजी सदियों से हमारी माताओं-बहनों के त्याग बलिदान के कारण परिवार नाम की जो व्यवस्था विकसित हुई ये हमारी विरासत है। इस विरासत पर हम गर्व कैसे करें। हम तो वो लोग हैं जो जीव में भी शिव देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नर में नारायण देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नारी का नारायणी कहते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो पौधे में परमात्मा देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नदी को मां मानते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो हर कंकर में शंकर देखते हैं। ये हमारा सामर्थ्य है हर नदी में मां का रूप देखते हैं। पर्यावरण की इतनी व्यापकता विशालता ये हमारा गौरव जब विश्व के सामने खुद गर्व करेंगे तो दुनिया करेगी। 

भाईयों बहनों,

हम वो लोग हैं जिसने दुनिया को वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् का मंत्र दिया है। हम वो लोग हैं जो दुनिया को कहते हैं ‘एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति।’ आज जो ‘holier than thou’ का संकट जो चल रहा है, तुझसे बड़ा मैं हूँ, ये जो तनाव का कारण बना हुआ है दुनिया को एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति का ज्ञान देने वाली विरासत हमारे पास है। जो कहते हैं सत्य एक है जानकार लोग उसको अलग-अलग तरीके से कहते हैं। यह गौरव हमारा है। हम लोग हैं, जो कहते हैं यत् पिण्डे तत् ब्रह्माण्डे, कितनी बड़ी सोच है, जो ब्रह्माण्ड में है वो हर जीव मात्र में है। यत् पिण्डे तत् ब्रह्माण्डे, यह कहने वाले हम लोग हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जिसने दुनिया का कल्याण देखा है, हम जग कल्याण से जन कल्याण के राही रहे हैं। जन कल्याण से जग कल्याण की राह पर चलने वाले हम लोग जब दुनिया की कामना करते हैं, तब कहते हैं- सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः। सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः। सबके सुख की बात सबके आरोग्य की बात करना यह हमारी विरासत है। और इसलिए हम बड़ी शान के साथ हमारी इस विरासत का गर्व करना सीखे, यह प्रण शक्ति है हमारी, जो हमें 25 साल के सपने पूरा करने के लिए जरुरी है। 

उसी प्रकार से मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

एक और महत्वपूर्ण विषय है एकता, एकजुटता। इतने बड़े देश को उसकी विविधता को हमें सेलिब्रेट करना है, इतने पंथ और परंपराएं यह हमारी आन-बान-शान है। कोई नीचा नहीं, कोई ऊंचा नहीं है, सब बराबर हैं। कोई मेरा नहीं, कोई पराया नहीं सब अपने हैं। यह भाव एकता के लिए बहुत जरुरी है। घर में भी एकता की नींव तभी रखी जाती है जब बेटा-बेटी एकसमान हो। अगर बेटा-बेटी एकसमान नहीं होंगे तो एकता के मंत्र नहीं गुथ सकते हैं। जेंडर इक्वैलिटी हमारी एकता में पहली शर्त है। जब हम एकता की बात करते हैं, अगर हमारे यहां एक ही पैरामीटर हो एक ही मानदंड हो, जिस मानदंड को हम कहे इंडिया फर्स्ट मैं जो कुछ भी कर रहा हूँ, जो भी सोच रहा हूँ, जो भी बोल रहा हूँ इंडिया फर्स्ट के अनुकुल है। एकता का रास्ता खुल जाएगा दोस्त। हमें एकता से बांधने का वो मंत्र है, हमें इसको पकड़ना है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है, कि हम समाज के अंदर ऊंच-नीच के भेदभावों से मेरे-तेरे के भेदभावों से हम सबकी पुजारी बनें। श्रमेव जयते कहते हैं हम श्रमिक का सम्मान यह हमारा स्वभाव होना चाहिए। 

लेकिन भाइयों-बहनों,

मैं लाल किले से मेरी एक पीड़ा और कहना चाहता हूँ, यह दर्द मैं कहे बिना नहीं रह सकता। मैं जानता हूँ कि शायद यह लाल किले का विषय नहीं हो सकता। लेकिन मेरे भीतर का दर्द मैं कहाँ कहूँगा। देशवासियों के सामने नहीं कहूँगा तो कहाँ कहूंगा और वो है किसी न किसी कारण से हमारे अंदर एक ऐसी विकृति आयी है, हमारी बोलचाल में, हमारे व्यवहार में, हमारे कुछ शब्दों में हम नारी का अपमान करते हैं। क्या हम स्वभाव से, संस्कार से, रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में नारी को अपमानित करने वाली हर बात से मुक्ति का संकल्प ले सकते हैं। नारी का गौरव राष्ट्र के सपने पूरे करने में बहुत बड़ी पूंजी बनने वाला है। यह सामर्थ्य मैं देख रहा हूँ और इसलिए मैं इस बात का आग्रही हूँ।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

मैं पांचवीं प्रणशक्ति की बात करता हूँ। और वो पांचवीं प्रणशक्ति है-नागरिक का कर्तव्य। दुनिया में जिन-जिन देशों ने प्रगति की है। जिन-जिन देशों ने कुछ achieve किया है, व्यक्तिगत जीवन में भी जिसने achieve किया है, कुछ बातें उभर करके सामने आती हैं। एक अनुशासित जीवन, दूसरा कर्तव्य के प्रति समर्पण। व्यक्ति के जीवन की सफलता हो, समाज की हो, परिवार की हो, राष्ट्र की हो। यह मूलभूत मार्ग है, यह मूलभूत प्रणशक्ति है।

दुनिया में जिन-जिन देशों ने प्रगति की है, जिन-जिन देशों ने कुछ achieve किया है। व्‍यक्तिगत जीवन में भी जिसने achieve किया है। कुछ बातें उभर करके सामने आती है। एक अनुशासित जीवन, दूसरा कर्तव्‍य के प्रति समपर्ण। व्‍यक्ति के जीवन की सफलता हो, समाज की हो, परिवार की हो, राष्‍ट्र की हो, यह मूलभूत मार्ग है। यह मूलभूत प्रणशक्ति है और इसलिए हमें कर्तव्‍य पर बल देना ही होगा। यह शासन का काम है कि बिजली 24 घंटे पहुंचाने के लिए प्रयास करे, लेकिन यह नागरिक का कर्तव्‍य है कि जितनी ज्‍यादा यूनिट बिजली बचा सकते है बचाएं। हर खेत में पानी पहुंचाना सरकार की जिम्‍मेदारी है, सरकार का प्रयास है, लेकिन ‘per drop more crop’ पानी बचाते हुए आगे बढ़ना मेरे हर खेत से आवाज़ उठनी चाहिए। केमिकल मुक्‍त खेती, ऑर्गेनिक फार्मिंग, प्राकृतिक खेती यह हमारा कर्तव्‍य है। 

साथियों, चाहे पुलिस हो, या पीपुल हो, शासक हो या प्रशासक हो, यह नागरिक कर्तव्‍य से कोई अछूता नहीं हो सकता। हर कोई अगर नागरिक के कर्तव्‍यों को निभाएगा तो मुझे विश्‍वास है कि हम इच्छित लक्ष्‍य को प्राप्‍त करने में समय से पहले सिद्धि प्राप्‍त कर सकते हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

आज महर्षि अरबिंदों की जन्‍म जयंती भी है। मैं उस महापुरूष के चरणों में नमन करता हूं। लेकिन हमें उस महापुरूष को याद करना होगा जिन्‍होंने कहा था स्‍वदेशी से स्‍वराज, स्‍वराज से सुराज। यह उनका मंत्र है हम सबको सोचना होगा कि हम कब तक दुनिया के और लोगों पर निर्भर रहेंगे। क्‍या हमारे देश को अन्‍न की आवश्‍यकता हो, हम out source कर सकते हैं क्‍या? जब देश ने तय कर लिया कि हमारा पेट हम खुद भरेंगे, देश ने करके दिखाया या नहीं दिखाया, एक बार संकल्‍प लेते हैं तो होता है। और इसलिए आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत यह हर नागरिक का, हर सरकार का, समाज की हर ईकाई का यह दायित्‍व बन जाता है। यह आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत यह सरकारी एजेंडा, सरकारी कार्यक्रम नहीं है। यह समाज का जन आंदोलन है, जिसे हमें आगे बढ़ाना है।

मेरे साथियों, आज जब हमने यह बात सुनी, आजादी के 75 साल के बाद जिस आवाज़ को सुनने के लिए हमारे कान तरस रहे थे, 75 साल के बाद वो आवाज़ सुनाई दी है। 75 साल के बाद लाल किले पर से तिरंगे को सलामी देने का काम पहली बार Made In India तोप ने किया है। कौन हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी होगा, जिसको यह बात, यह आवाज़ उसे नई प्रेरणा, ताकत नहीं देगी। और इसलिए मेरे प्‍यारे भाई-बहनों में आज मेरे देश के सेना के जवानों का हृदय से अभिनंदन करना चाहता हूं। मेरी आत्‍मनिर्भर की बात को संगठित स्‍वरूप में, साहस के स्‍वरूप में मेरी सेना के जवानों ने सेना नायकों ने जिस जिम्‍मेदारी के साथ कंधे पर उठाया है। मैं उनको जितनी salute करूं, उतनी कम है दोस्‍तों। उनको आज मैं सलाम करता हूं। क्‍योंकि सेना का जवान मौत को मुट्ठी में ले करके चलता है। मौत और जिंदगी के बीच में कोई फासला ही नहीं होता है, और तब बीच में वो डट करके खड़ा होता है। और वो मेरे सेना का जवान तय करे कि हम तीन सौ ऐसी चीजें अब list करते हैं जो हम विदेश से नहीं लाएंगे। हमारे देश का यह संकल्‍प छोटा नहीं है। 

मुझे इस संकल्‍प में भारत के ‘आत्‍मनिर्भर’ भारत के उज्‍जवल भविष्‍य के वो बीज मैं देख रहा हूं जो इस सपनों को वट वृक्ष में परिवर्तित करने वाले हैं। Salute! Salute! मेरे सेना के अधिकारियों को Salute. मैं मेरे छोटे छोटे बालकों को 5 साल 7 साल की आयु के बालक, उनको भी Salute करना चाहता हूं। उनको भी सलाम करना चाहता हूं। जब देश के सामने चेतना जगी, मैंने सैंकड़ों परिवारों से सुना है, 5-5, 7 साल के बच्‍चे घर में कह रहें हैं कि अब हम विदेशी खिलौने से नहीं खेलेंगे। 5 साल का बच्‍चा घर में विदेशी खिलौने से नहीं खेलेंगे, ये जब संकल्‍प करता है ना तब आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत उसकी रगों में दौड़ता है। आप देखिए पीएलआई स्‍कीम, एक लाख करोड़ रुपया, दुनिया के लोग हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में अपना नसीब आजमाने आ रहे हैं। टेक्‍नोलॉजी लेकर के आ रहे हैं। रोजगार के नये अवसर बना रहे हैं। भारत मैन्‍यूफैक्चिरिंग हब बनता जा रहा है। आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत कि बुनियाद बना रहा है। आज electronic goods manufacturing हो, मोबाइल फोन का manufacturing हो, आज देश बहुत तेजी से प्रगति कर रहा है। जब हमारा ब्रह्मोस दुनिया में जाता है, कौन हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी होगा जिसका मन आसमान को न छूता होगा दोस्तों। आज हमारी मेट्रो coaches, हमारी वंदे भारत ट्रेन विश्‍व के लिए आकर्षण बन रहा है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

हमें आत्‍मनिर्भर बनना है, हमारे एनर्जी सेक्‍टर में। हम कब तक एनर्जी के सेक्‍टर में किसी और पर dependent रहेंगे और हमें सोलार का क्षेत्र हो, विंड एनर्जी का क्षेत्र हो, रिन्यूएबल के और भी जो रास्‍ते हों, मिशन हाइड्रोजन हो, बायो फ्यूल की कोशिश हो, electric vehicle पर जाने की बात हो, हमें आत्‍मनिर्भर बनकर के इन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को आगे बढ़ाना होगा। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

आज प्राकृ‍तिक खेती भी आत्‍मनिर्भर का एक मार्ग है। फर्टीलाइज़र से जितनी ज्‍यादा मुक्ति, आज देश में नेनो फर्टीलाइज़र के कारखाने एक नई आशा लेकर के आए हैं। लेकिन प्राकृ‍तिक खेती, केमिकल फ्री खेती आत्‍मनिर्भर को ताकत दे सकती है। आज देश में रोजगार के क्षेत्र में ग्रीन जॉब के नए-नए क्षेत्र बहुत तेजी से खुल रहे हैं। भारत ने नीतियों के द्वारा ‘स्‍पेस’ को खोल दिया है। ड्रोन की बहुत दुनिया में सबसे प्रगतिशील पॉलिसी लेकर के आए हैं। हमने देश के नौजवानों के लिए नए द्वार खोल दिए हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाईओ-बहनों, 

मैं प्राइवेट सेक्‍टर को भी आह्वान करता हूं आइए... हमें विश्‍व में छा जाना है। आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत का ये भी सपना है कि दुनिया को भी जो आवश्‍यकताए हैं उसको पूरा करने में भारत पीछे नहीं रहेगा। हमारे लघू उद्योग हो, सूक्ष्‍म उद्योग हो, कुटीर उद्योग हो, ‘जीरो डिफेक्‍ट जीरो इफेक्‍ट’ हमें करके दुनिया में जाना होगा। हमें स्‍वदेशी पर गर्व करना होगा। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

हम बार-बार लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री जी को याद करते हैं, जय जवान-जय किसान का उनका मंत्र आज भी देश के लिए प्रेरणा है। बाद में अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जी ने जय विज्ञान कह करके उसमें एक कड़ी जोड़ दी थी और देश ने उसको प्राथमिकता दी थी। लेकिन अब अमृतकाल के लिए एक और अनिवार्यता है और वो है जय अनुसंधान। जय जवान-जय किसान-जय विज्ञान-जय अनुसंधान- इनोवेशन। और मुझे मेरे देश की युवा पीढ़ी पर भरोसा है। इनोवेशन की ताकत देखिए, आज हमारा यूपीआई-भीम, हमारा डिजिटल पेमेंट, फिनटेक की दुनिया में हमारा स्‍थान, आज विश्‍व में रियल टाइम 40 पर्सेंट अगर डिजिटली फाइनेशियल का ट्रांजेक्‍शन होता है तो मेरे देश में हो रहा है, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान ने ये करके दिखाया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

अब हम 5जी के दौर की ओर कदम रख रहे हैं। बहुत दूर इंतजार नहीं करना होगा, हम कदम मिलाने वाले हैं। हम ऑप्टिकल फाइबर गांव-गांव में पहुंचा रहे हैं। डिजिटल इंडिया का सपना गांव से गुजरेगा, ये मुझे पूरी जानकारी है। आज मुझे खुशी है हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के चार लाख कॉमन सर्विस सेंटर्स गांवों में विकसित हो रहे हैं। गांव के नौजवान बेटे-बेटियां कॉमन सर्विस सेंटर चला रहे हैं। देश गर्व कर सकता है कि गांव के क्षेत्र में चार लाख Digital Entrepreneur का तैयार होना और सारी सेवाएं लोग गांव के लोग उनके यहां लेने के लिए आदी बन जाएं, ये अपने-आप में टेक्‍नोलॉजी हब बनने की भारत की ताकत है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

ये जो डिजिटल इंडिया का मूवमेंट है, जो सेमीकंडक्‍टर की ओर हम कदम बढ़ा रहे हैं, 5जी की ओर कदम बढ़ा रहे हैं, ऑप्टिकल फाइबर का नेटवर्क बिछा रहे हैं, ये सिर्फ आधुनिकता की पहचान है, ऐसा नहीं है। तीन बड़ी ताकतें इसके अंदर समाहित हैं। शिक्षा में आमूल-चूल क्रांति- ये डिजिटल माध्‍यम से आने वाली है। स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य सेवाओं में आमूल-चूल क्रांति डिजिटल से आने वाली है। कृषि जीवन में भी बहुत बड़ा बदलाव डिजिटल से आने वाला है। एक नया विश्‍व तैयार हो रहा है। भारत उसे बढ़ाने के लिए और मैं साफ देख रहा हूं दोस्तों ये Decade, मानव जाति के लिए tecahade का समय है, टेक्‍नोलॉजी का Decade है। भारत के लिए तो ये tecahade , जिसका मन टेक्‍नोलॉजी से जुड़ा हुआ है। आईटी की दुनिया में भारत ने अपना एक लोहा मनवा लिया है, ये tecahade का सामर्थ्‍य भारत के पास है।

हमारा अटल इनोवेशन मिशन, हमारे incubation centre, हमारे स्‍टार्टअप एक नया, पूरे क्षेत्र का विकास कर रहे हैं, युवा पीढ़ी के लिए नए अवसर ले करके आ रहे हैं। स्‍पेस मिशन की बात हो, हमारे Deep Ocean Mission की बात हो, समंदर की गहराई में जाना हो या हमें आसमान को छूना हो, ये नए क्षेत्र हैं, जिसको ले करके हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

हम इस बात को न भूलें और भारत ने सदियों से देखा हुआ है, जैसे देश में कुछ नमूना रूप कामों की जरूरत होती है, कुछ बड़ी-बड़ी ऊंचाइयों की जरूरत होती है, लेकिन साथ-साथ धरातल पर मजबूती बहुत आवश्‍यक होती है। भारत की आर्थिक वि‍कास की संभावनाएं धरातल की मजबूती से जुड़ी हुई हैं। और इसलिए हमारे छोटे किसान-उनका सामर्थ्‍य, हमारे छोटे उद्यमी-उनका सामर्थ्‍य, हमारे लघु उद्योग, कुटीर उद्योग, सूक्ष्‍म उद्योग, रेहड़ी-पटरी वाले लोग, घरों में काम करने वाले लोग, ऑटो रिक्‍शा चलाने वाले लोग, बस सेवाएं देने वाले लोग, ये समाज का जो सबसे बड़ा तबका है, इसका सामर्थ्‍यवान होना भारत के सामर्थ्‍य की गारंटी है और इसलिए हमारे आर्थिक विकास की ये जो मूलभूत जमीनी ताकत है, उस ताकत को सर्वाधिक बल देने की दिशा में हमारा प्रयास चल रहा है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों 

हमारे पास 75 साल का अनुभव है, हमने 75 साल में कई सिद्धियां भी प्राप्‍त की हैं। हमने 75 साल के अनुभव में नए सपने भी संजोए हैं, नए संकल्प भी लिए हैं। लेकिन अमृत काल के लिए हमारे मानव संसाधन का आप्टिमम आउटकम कैसे हो? हमारी प्राकृतिक संपदा का आप्टिमम आउटकम कैसे हो? इस लक्ष्य को लेकर के हमें चलना है। और तब मैं पिछले कुछ सालों के अनुभव से कहना चाहता हूँ। आपने देखा होगा, आज अदालत के अंदर देखिए हमारी वकील के क्षेत्र में काम करने वाली हमारी नारीशक्ति किस ताकत के साथ नजर आ रही है। आप ग्रामीण क्षेत्र में जनप्रतिनिधि के रूप में देखिए। हमारी नारीशक्ति किस मिजाज से समर्पित भाव से अपनी गांवों की समस्याओं को सुलझाने में लगी हुई हैं। आज ज्ञान का क्षेत्र देख लीजिए, विज्ञान का क्षेत्र देख लीजिए, हमारे देश की नारीशक्ति सिरमौर नजर आ रही है। 

आज हम पुलिस में देखें, हमारी नारीशक्ति लोगों की सुरक्षा की जिम्मेदारी उठा रही है। हम जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में देखें, खेल-कूद का मैदान देखें या युद्ध की भूमि देखें, भारत की नारी शक्ति एक नए सामर्थ्य, नए विश्वास के साथ आगे आ रही है। मैं इसको भारत की 75 साल की जो यात्रा में जो योगदान है, उसमें अब कई गुना योगदान आने वाले 25 साल मैं मेरी नारीशक्ति का देख रहा हूं, मेरी माताओं–बहनों का मेरी बेटियों का देख रहा हूं, और इसलिए ये सारे हिसाब–किताब से ऊपर है। सारे आपके पैरामीटर से अतिरिक्त है। हम इस पर जितना ध्यान देंगे, हम जितने ज्यादा अवसर हमारी बेटियों को देंगे, जितनी सुविधाएं हमारी बेटियों के लिए केंद्रित करेंगे, आप देखना वो हमें बहुत कुछ लौटाकर करके देंगी। वो देश को इस ऊंचाई पर ले जाएगी। इस अमृत काल में जो सपने पूरे करने में जो मेहनत लगने वाली है, अगर उसमें हमारी नारी शक्ति की मेहनत जुड़ जाएगी, व्यापक रूप से जुड़ जाएगी तो हमारी मेहनत कम होगी हमारा समय सीमा भी कम हो जाएगा, हमारे सपने और तेजस्वी होंगे, और ओजस्वी होंगे, और दैदीप्यमान होंगे 

और इसलिए आइये साथियों,

हम जिम्मेदारियों को लेकर आगे बढ़ें। मैं आज भारत के संविधान के निर्माताओं का भी धन्यवाद करना चाहता हूं कि उन्होंने जो हमें federal structure दिया है, उसके स्पिरिट को बनाते हुए, उसकी भावनाओं का आदर करते हुए हम कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर के इस अमृतकाल में चलेंगे तो सपने साकार होकर के रहेंगे। कार्यक्रम भिन्न हो सकते हैं, कार्यशैली भिन्न हो सकती है लेकिन संकल्प भिन्न नहीं हो सकते, राष्ट्र के लिए सपने भिन्न नहीं हो सकते। 

आइए हम एक ऐसे युग के अंदर आगे बढ़ें। मुझे याद है जब मैं गुजरात का मुख्यमंत्री था। केंद्र में हमारे विचार की सरकार नहीं थी, लेकिन मेरे गुजरात में हर जगह पर मैं एक ही मंत्र लेके के चलता था कि भारत के विकास के लिए गुजरात का विकास। भारत का विकास हम कहीं पर भी हों, हम सबके मन मस्तिष्क में रहना चाहिए। हमारे देश के कई राज्य हैं, जिन्होंने देश को आगे बढ़ाने में बहुत भूमिका अदा की है, नेतृत्व किया है, कई क्षेत्रों में उदाहरणीय काम किए हैं। ये हमारे federalism को ताकत देते हैं। लेकिन आज समय की मांग है कि हमें cooperative federalism के साथ-साथ cooperative competitive federalism की जरूरत है, हमें विकास की स्पर्धा की जरूरत है। 

हर राज्‍य को लगना चाहिए कि वो राज्‍य आगे निकल गया। मैं इतनी मेह‍नत करूंगा कि मैं आगे निकल जाऊंगा। उसने यह 10 अच्‍छे काम किए हैं मैं 15 अच्‍छे काम कर के दिखाऊंगा। उसने तीन साल में पूरा किया है मैं दो साल में कर के दिखाऊंगा। हमारे राज्‍यों के बीच में हमारी service सरकार की सभी इकाइयों के बीच में वो स्‍पर्धा का वातावरण चाहिए, जो हमें विकास की नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने के लिए प्रयास करे।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

इस 25 वर्ष का अमृतकाल के लिए जब हम चर्चा करते हैं, तब मैं जानता हूं चुनौतियां अनेक है, मर्यादाएं अनेक हैं, मुसीबतें भी हैं, बहुत कुछ है, हम इसको कम नहीं आंकते। रास्‍ते खोजते हें, लगातार कोशिश कर रहे हैं लेकिन दो विषयों को तो मैं यहां पर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। चर्चा अनेक विषयों पर हो सकती है। लेकिन मैं अभी समय की सीमा के साथ दो विषयों पर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। और मैं मानता हूं हमारी इन सारी चुनौतियों के कारण, विकृतियों के कारण, बिमारियों के कारण इस 25 साल का अमृत काल उस पर शायद अगर हमने समय रहते नहीं चेते, समय रहते समाधान नहीं किए तो ये विकराल रूप ले सकते हैं। और इसलिए मैं सब की चर्चा न करते हुए दो पर जरूर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। एक है भ्रष्‍टाचार और दूसरा है भाई-भतीजावाद, परिवारवाद। भारत जैसे लोकतंत्र में जहां लोग गरीबी से जूझ रहे हैं जब ये देखते हैं, एक तरफ वो लोग हैं जिनके पास रहने के लिए जगह नहीं है। दूसरी ओर वो लोग हैं जिनको अपना चोरी किया हुआ माल रखने के लिए जगह नहीं है। यह स्थिति अच्‍छी नहीं है दोस्तों। और इ‍सलिए हमें भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ पूरी ताकत से लड़ना है। पिछले आठ वर्षों में direct benefit transfer के द्वारा आधार, mobile इन सारी आधुनिक व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का उपयोग करते हुए दो लाख करोड़ रुपये जो गलत हाथों में जाते थे, उसको बचाकर के देश की भलाई के लिए लगाने में हम सफल हुए। जो लोग पिछली सरकारों में बैंकों को लूट-लूट कर के भाग गए, उनकी सम्‍पत्त्यिां जब्‍त कर के वापिस लाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। कईयों को जेलों में जीने के लिए मजबूर कर के रखा हुआ है। हमारी कोशिश है जिन्‍होंने देश को लूटा है उनको लौटना पड़े वो स्थिति हम पैदा करेंगे।

भाईयो और बहनों, अब भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ मैं साफ देख रहा हूं कि हम एक निर्णायक कालखंड में कदम रख रहे हैं। बड़े-बड़े भी बच नहीं पाएंगे। इस मिजाज के साथ भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ एक निर्णायक कालखंड में अब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान कदम रख रहा है। और मैं लाल किले की प्राचीर से बड़ी जिम्मेवारी के साथ कह रहा हूं। और इसलिए, भाईयों-बहनों भ्रष्‍टाचार दीमक की तरह देश को खोखला कर रहा है। मुझे इसके खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़नी है, लड़ाई को तेज करना है, निर्णायक मोड़ पर इसे लेकर के ही जाना है। तब मेरे 130 करोड़ देशवासी, आप मुझे आर्शिवाद दीजिए, आप मेरा साथ दीजिए, मैं आज आप से साथ मांगने आया हूं, आपका सहयोग मांगने आया हूं ताकि मैं इस लड़ाई को लड़ पाऊं। इस लड़ाई को देश जीत पाए और समान्‍य नागरिक की जिंदगी भ्रष्‍टाचार ने तबाह करके रखी हुई है। मैं मेरे इन समान्‍य नागरिक की जिंदगी को फिर से आन, बान, शान के लिए जीने के लिए रास्‍ता बनाना चाहता हूं। और इसलिए, मेरे प्‍यारे दशवासियों यह चिंता का विषय है कि आज देश में भ्रष्‍टाचार के प्रति नफरत तो दिखती है, व्‍यक्‍त भी होती है लेकिन कभी-कभी भ्रष्‍टाचारियों के प्रति उदारता बरती जाती है, किसी भी देश में यह शोभा नहीं देगा। 

और कई लोग तो इतनी बेशर्मी तक चले जाते हैं कि कोर्ट में सजा हो चुकी हो, भ्रष्‍टाचारी सिद्ध हो चुका हो, जेल जाना तय हो चुका हो, जेल गुजार रहे हो, उसके बावजूद भी उनका महिमामंडन करने में लगे रहते हैं, उनकी शान-ओ-शौकत में लगे रहते हैं, उनकी प्रतिष्‍ठा बनाने में लगे रहते हैं। अगर जब तक समाज में गंदगी के प्रति नफरत नहीं होती है, स्‍चछता की चेतना जगती नहीं है। जब तक भ्रष्‍टाचार और भ्रष्‍टाचारी के प्रति नफरत का भाव पैदा नहीं होता है, सामाजिक रूप से उसको नीचा देखने के लिए मजबूर नहीं करते, तब तक यह मानसिकता खत्‍म होने वाली नहीं है। और इसलिए भ्रष्‍टाचार के प्रति भी और भ्रष्‍टाचारियों के प्रति भी हमें बहुत जागरूक होने की जरूरत है। 

दूसरी एक चर्चा मैं करना चाहता हूं भाई-भतीजावाद, और जब मैं भाई-भतीजावाद परिवारवाद की बात करता हूं तो लोगों को लगता है मैं सिर्फ राजनीति क्षेत्र की बात करता हूं। जी नहीं, दुर्भाग्‍य से राजनीति क्षेत्र की उस बुराई ने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की हर संस्‍थाओं में परिवारवाद को पोषित कर दिया है। परिवारवाद हमारी अनेक संस्‍थाओं को अपने में लपेटे हुए है। और इसके कारण मेरे देश के talent को नुकसान होता है। मेरे देश के सामर्थ्‍य को नुकसान होता है। जिनके पास अवसर की संभावनाएं हैं वो परिवारवाद भाई-भतीजे के बाद बाहर रह जाता है। भ्रष्‍टाचार का भी कारण यह भी एक बन जाता है, ताकि उसका कोई भाई-भतीजे का आसरा नहीं है तो लगता है कि भई चलो कहीं से खरीद करके जगह बना लूं। इस परिवारवाद से भाई-भतीजावाद से हमें हर संस्‍थाओं में एक नफरत पैदा करनी होगी, जागरूकता पैदा करनी होगी, तब हम हमारी संस्‍थाओं को बचा पाएंगे। संस्‍थाओं के उज्ज्वल भविष्‍य के लिए बहुत आवश्‍यक है। उसी प्रकार से राजनीति में भी परिवारवाद ने देश के सामर्थ्‍य के साथ सबसे ज्‍यादा अन्‍याय किया है। परिवारवादी राजनीति परिवार की भलाई के लिए होती है उसको देश की भलाई से कोई लेना-देना नहीं होता है और इसलिए लालकिले की प्राचीर से तिरंगे झंडे के आन-बान-शान के नीचे भारत के संविधान का स्‍मरण करते हुए मैं देशवासियों को खुले मन से कहना चाहता हूं, आइये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की राजनीति के शुद्धिकरण के लिए भी, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सभी संस्‍थाओं की शुद्धिकरण के लिए भी हमें देश को इस परिवारवादी मानसिकता से मुक्ति दिला करके योग्‍यता के आधार पर देश को आगे ले जाने की ओर बढ़ना होगा। यह अनिवार्यता है। वरना हर किसी का मन कुंठित रहता है कि मैं उसके लिए योग्‍य था, मुझे नहीं मिला, क्‍योंकि मेरा कोई चाचा, मामा, पिता, दादा-दादी, नाना-नानी कोई वहां थे नहीं। यह मन:स्थिति किसी भी देश के लिए अच्‍छी नहीं है।

मेरे देश के नौजवानों मैं आपके उज्ज्वल भविष्‍य के लिए, आपके सपनों के लिए मैं भाई-भतीजावाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई में आपका साथ चाहता हूं। परिवारवादी राजनीति के खिलाफ लड़ाई में मैं आपका साथ चाहता हूं। यह संवैधानिक जिम्‍मेदारी मानता हूं मैं। यह लोकतंत्र की जिम्‍मेदारी मानता हूं मैं। यह लालकिले के प्राचीर से कही गई बात की ताकत मैं मानता हूं। और इसलिए मैं आज आपसे यह अवसर चाहता हूं। हमने देखा पिछले दिनो खेलों में, ऐसा तो नहीं है कि देश के पास पहले प्रतिभाएं नहीं रहीं होंगी, ऐसा तो नहीं है कि खेल-कूद की दुनिया में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के नौजवान हमारे बेटे-बेटियां कुछ कर नहीं रहे। लेकिन selection भाई-भतीजेवाद के चैनल से गुजरते थे। और उसके कारण वो खेल के मैदान तक उस देश तक तो पहुंच जाते थे, जीत-हार से उन्‍हें लेना-देना नहीं था। लेकिन जब transparency आई योग्‍यता के आधार पर खिलाडि़यों का चयन होने लगा पूर्ण पारदर्शिता से खेल के मैदान में सामर्थ्‍य का सम्‍मान होने लगा। आज देखिए दुनिया में खेल के मैदान में भारत का तिरंगा फहरता है। भारत का राष्‍ट्रगान गाया जाता है। 

गर्व होता है और परिवारवाद से मुक्ति होती है, भाई भतीजावाद से मुक्ति होती है तो यह नतीजे आते हैं। मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों यह ठीक है, चुनौतियां बहुत है, अगर इस देश के सामने करोड़ों संकट है, तो करोड़ों समाधान भी हैं और मेरा 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों पर भरोसा है। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासी निर्धारित लक्ष्‍य के साथ संकल्प के प्रति समर्पण के साथ जब 130 करोड़ देश‍वासी एक कदम आगे रखते हैं न तो हिन्‍दुस्‍तान 130 कदम आगे बढ़ जाता है। इस सामर्थ्‍य को लेकर के हमें आगे बढ़ना है। इस अमृतकाल में, अभी अमृतकाल की पहली बेला है, पहली प्रभात है, हमें आने वाले 25 साल के एक पल भी भूलना नहीं है। एक-एक दिन, समय का प्रत्‍येक क्षण, जीवन का प्रत्‍येक कण, मातृभूमि के लिए जीना और तभी आजादी के दीवानों को हमारी सच्‍ची श्रं‍द्धाजलि होगी। तभी 75 साल तक देश को यहां तक पहुंचाने में जिन-जिन लोगों ने योगदान दिया, उनका पुण्‍य स्‍मरण हमारे काम आयेगा।

मैं देशवासियों से आग्रह करते हुए नई संभावनाओं को संजोते हुए, नए संकल्‍पों को पार करते हुए आगे बढ़ने का विश्‍वास लेकर आज अमृतकाल का आरंभ करते हैं। आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव, अब अमृतकाल की दिशा में पलट चुका है, आगे बढ़ चुका है, तब इस अमृतकाल में सबका प्रयास अनिवार्य है। सबका प्रयास ये परिणाम लाने वाला है। टीम इंडिया की भावना ही देश को आगे बढ़ाने वाली है। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों की ये टीम इंडिया एक टीम के रूप में आगे बढ़कर के सारे सपनों को साकार करेगी। इसी पूरे विश्‍वास के सा‍थ मेरे साथ बोलिए 

जय हिन्‍द। 

जय हिन्‍द। 

जय हिन्‍द।

भारत माता की जय,

भारत माता की जय, 

भारत माता की जय

वंदे मातरम, 

वंदे मातरम, 

वंदे मातरम,

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the National Tourism Awards today (September 27, 2017) at a function held in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that tourism is one of the largest industries in the world. Its evolution can be estimated from the fact that the number of tourists all over the world has increased from 2.5 crore in 1950 to 123 crore in 2016. The tourism industry contributes 10.2 percent of the world's GDP. It is estimated that every 10th person in the world works in the tourism industry.

The President said that in India too the livelihood of a very large number of people is linked to the tourism industry. In the year 2016, tourism’s contribution to GDP was 9.6 percent and 9.3 percent to total employment. The tourism industry can contribute significantly in generating permanent employment opportunities and eliminating poverty. According to an assessment, an investment of Rs. 10 lakh in tourism industry provides employment to about 90 people, while about 45 in agriculture, and about 13 people in manufacturing.

The President said that inclusive tourism development can strengthen inclusive economic development. Every citizen should strive to provide a good experience to tourists at his or her own level. In a tourism conscious society, the role of the government is only to provide direction and a facilitating environment.

The President said that 'Adopt a Heritage Project' which was launched today, with the efforts of the Tourism Ministry, Culture Ministry and Archaeological Survey of India, has great potential to make our rich and diverse heritage monuments, tourist-friendly. He expressed hope that this project will help in the maintenance of our heritage with a partnership of the public and private sectors.

                It gives me great pleasure to be here on the 76th Foundation Day of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and on an occasion that concludes the platinum jubilee celebrations of India’s apex science and technology institution. Congratulations to all of you and particularly to the dedicated scientists of CSIR and the award winners today. Thank you for your hard work. The country is very proud of you.

I have just visited an exhibition of significant achievements of CSIR researchers and technologists. It was extremely impressive. CSIR has been instrumental in bringing about sustainable improvements in the quality of life of our fellow citizens, as well as in helping business and industry with specific applications of science and technology. In the areas of food and agriculture, generic drugs, leather, chemicals and petrochemicals, and biopharmaceuticals, among others, several technologies developed by you have been embraced by the market.

It is very telling that the staff of CSIR constitutes only about three to four per cent of India’s scientific manpower – but contributes nearly 10 per cent of India’s scientific output. This is extremely creditable and emphasises how important CSIR is to the nation building process. When a scientist works hard in the lab, with integrity and sincerity and with the larger dream of helping society, he or she is playing the role of nation builder.

From the earliest days of our Independence, our country has been clear about the use and deployment of science and technology to achieve the goals of social development. This has meant both exploiting India’s rich wealth of traditional knowledge and intellectual property – of which CSIR is the custodian – as well as being open to the latest in science and technology, not being afraid of cutting-edge research and its discoveries, and where possible using these to help our common citizens.

This aspiration remains important as ever as we strive to achieve a New India by 2022, when we complete 75 years as a free country. Our ambitious national programmes – such as Start-up India, Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and the Smart Cities Mission – cannot be successful without our scientists and our technology incubators, particularly CSIR, contributing. The true test of scientific research lies in its ability to help our society leap frog social sector gaps, whether in health and hygiene, sanitation, education or agriculture, and make us a middle-income country in one human lifetime.

In all these areas, the need for socially inclusive and yet cost-effective applications and products of science and technology are a national priority. Once these are realised, they can become a model for other developing countries. For us, this has always been and will always be a paramount goal. For India, science and technology is a force multiplier in the quest for development.

In this context, I am pleased to note the widespread social benefits of the two CSIR technologies that are being dedicated to the nation today. The first is a hand-held milk tester that will allow us to more easily identify adulterants in milk. The second is Waterless Chrome-Tanning Technology that eliminates the use of water in two processes before and after tanning – and also reduces the solids dissolved in wastewater during tanning. This has an obvious environmental impact.

I have also been informed that CSIR’s anaerobic digester is making a big difference to the Swachh Bharat mission, as it converts biodegradable kitchen waste to biogas and manure that can be used for family kitchen gardens. Each anaerobic digester has the capacity to convert up to three kg waste per day and produce 400 litre of biogas, which can be used as a clean fuel.

Another commendable CSIR creation I have been told about is DivyaNayan - a reading device for the visually challenged. Inventions and innovations such as these provide simple and user-friendly solutions to the most underprivileged and deprived sections of our people. They make science and technology so meaningful – and I should say potentially so magical – as India seeks to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

I must point out here that none of our developmental goals has any meaning without gender parity – and without equal opportunities for our daughters and girl-children. In the past seven decades, CSIR as a body and India as a society have made enormous progress. Yet, the participation of women in science in our country is distressingly small. Less than two of every 10 scientific researchers in India are women. Of those who join the Indian Institutes of Technology each year, just about 10 per cent are women.

These numbers are simply not acceptable. We have to take accelerated steps to promote the participation of girl students and of women in science and technology. If this disparity is not addressed, our scientific achievements will always be less than perfect and less than desirable.

Friends

Technology has taken human society to the edge of a brave new age. Dazzling technological products are changing our lives almost in real time. And the Fourth Industrial Revolution is set to transform our world in ways we still cannot imagine. We are entering an era of Artificial Intelligence and robotics, 3D manufacture and custom-made biological and pharmaceutical products, even driverless cars. The relationship between human and machine is evolving before our eyes.

In the midst of all this, we cannot let the excitement of technology and newer and newer products divert our attention from basic science research. For that remains fundamentally important.

In both of these areas – in helping our country navigate and adapt to the arrival of so many new technologies as well as continuing to strengthen basic scientific research – CSIR is the guide we all turn to. It is for CSIR to continue to make new technologies as well as basic research relevant to our developmental hopes, and to the well-being of our poorest and most deprived fellow citizens.

I look forward to this treasured national institution marching proudly towards its centenary

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the concluding ceremony of the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) in New Delhi today (September 26, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that it is very creditable that the staff of CSIR constitutes only about three to four per cent of India’s scientific manpower – but contributes nearly 10 per cent of India’s scientific output. This emphasises how important CSIR is to the nation building process. When a scientist works hard in the lab, with integrity and sincerity and with the larger dream of helping society, he or she is playing the role of nation builder.

The President said that from the earliest days of our Independence, our country has been clear about the use and deployment of science and technology to achieve the goals of social development. This has meant both exploiting India’s rich wealth of traditional knowledge and intellectual property – of which CSIR is the custodian – as well as being open to the latest in science and technology, not being afraid of cutting-edge research and its discoveries, and where possible using these to help our common citizens. This aspiration remains important as ever as we strive to achieve a New India by 2022, when we complete 75 years as a free country.

The President said that our ambitious national programmes – such as Start-up India, Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and the Smart Cities Mission – cannot be successful without our scientists and our technology incubators, particularly CSIR, contributing. The true test of scientific research lies in its ability to help our society leap frog social sector gaps, whether in health and hygiene, sanitation, education or agriculture, and make us a middle-income country in one human lifetime.

The President said that none of our developmental goals has any meaning without gender parity. The participation of women in science in our country is distressingly small. Less than two of every 10 scientific researchers in India are women. Of those who join the Indian Institutes of Technology each year, just about 10 per cent are women. These numbers are simply not acceptable. We have to take accelerated steps to promote the participation of girl students and of women in science and technology.

                A group of students from Chirang district of Assam attending an Operation Sadbhavana tour organised by the 7 SIKH LI called on the President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, at RashtrapatiBhavan today (September 25, 2017).

 Welcoming the students, the President urged the young participants of Operation Sadbhavana to strive for national integration. He said that knowledge of languages other than their mother tongue, Assamese, would help them to link themselves with fellow citizens of the country.

 Wishing them a great future ahead, the President asked the students to share the experiences of their tour with their classmates, relatives, elders and others when they return to their State. 

 This Sadbhavana tour has been organised by the 7 SIKH Light Infantry battalion of the Indian Army with the aim of providing students an insight into the rich and diverse culture of the country and fostering national integration. The students are visiting Delhi, Jaipur, Ajmer and Udaipur.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited the Divya Prem Sewa Mission, Haridwar, today (September 23, 2017). 

The President received a rousing reception amid heavy rain. Speaking on the occasion, he said that this is his first visit to ‘Devbhoomi’ Uttarakhand after assuming the office of President. He commended the state for its natural beauty and spiritual heritage. 

The President also praised the national contribution of famous political leaders from the state, such as G.B. Pant and H.N. Bahuguna. 

The President highlighted the legacy and efforts of the state in the area of ecological conservation. He said illustrious people from Uttarakhand, such as Sundarlal Bahuguna, have set an example for the world on how to preserve and protect nature and the environment. People associated with the 'Chipko Andolan' used to sing a song that goes, ‘Our soil, Our water, Our forest; Our forefathers nurtured these. We will certainly save them'. Uttarakhand has to achieve its development goals within this framework of environmental protection. There is need to maintain the right balance between conservation and development. 

The President said that the 'Namami Gange' mission will travel to the plains of India and end in West Bengal, but it begins in Uttarakhand. Therefore, the movement to clean and preserve the Ganga should also start in Uttarakhand. 

The President praised the work done by the Divya Prem Seva Mission in the service of leprosy patients. He expressed hope that people of our country will draw inspiration from the efforts of the Divya Prem Seva Mission and dedicate themselves in the service of humanity.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the Suresh Bhat Natya Sabhagrah at Nagpur today (September 22, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that this is his first visit to Maharashtra after assuming the office of President. Maharashtra is the ‘karmabhoomi’ of many revolutionaries, social reformers and saints. The list of great social and political leaders produced by the state, from their many streams, is a long one and includes Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sahu Ji, Samarth Guru Ramdas, Tatya Tope, Sant Eknath, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram, Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, and Pandita Ramabai Saraswati to Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Y.B. Chavan and Baba Amte. 

The President said that Maharashtra was one of the main centres of the freedom struggle. Many important chapters of the freedom movement, including the 'Quit India Movement' of 1942, were written in Maharashtra. Mahatma Gandhi regarded Gokhale as his Guru and made Wardha in the Nagpur division his work place. 

The President said that Maharashtra is not only a hub of industry and business of the country but that of its culture and art as well. Mumbai is described as the economic capital of India. By linking its heritage of education and culture with trade and technology, Maharashtra is giving strength to the entire country in the 21st century. In the quest for development and economic change, we have to take care to keep our cultural moorings intact. In this context, Maharashtra is setting an example for the nation.

The President appreciated the rapid development of modern infrastructure which has taken place in Nagpur. He noted that there is a project to make Nagpur a Smart city. 'Zero Mile' Nagpur, traditionally regarded the geographical centre of the country, has the potential to become the centre of development of India as well.

                A group of youth from the Gurez Valley of Jammu & Kashmir, participating in Operation Sadbhavana, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (September 20, 2017). 

Welcoming the youth, the President said that young people are the future of Jammu & Kashmir and it's their responsibility to play a role in the development of the state. He stated that successive Indian governments had worked for the welfare of the people of the State. He asked the youth to learn from the discipline of the Indian Army. He also congratulated the Army on the Sadbhavana initiative and wished the programme all success. 

The Sadbhavana tour was organised by the 109 Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army with an aim to develop trust among and reignite the minds of youth towards national integration. As part of this tour, these youth are visiting Srinagar, Delhi, Lansdowne, Rishikesh and Dehradun.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind addressed the inaugural function of the golden jubilee celebrations of Jesus & Mary College in New Delhi today (September 20, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Jesus and Mary College was a matter of honour for him. This institution has contributed enormously to the cause of education in New Delhi and in our country. For five decades, it has taught and prepared young women to break glass ceilings, to achieve their potential, contribute to society and to the economy, and become part of the process of nation building.

The President said that the Christian community – whose history in India goes back 2,000 years and which has contributed so much to our shared culture – has carved a special role for itself in education. Missionary institutions such as this one have become symbols of scholarship, dedicated teaching and academic excellence. This is so appropriate. For all religions in their essence urge us to constantly learn and evolve and grow, to acquire knowledge and gain wisdom. And so become better human beings.

The President said that the goal of education is not just to acquire knowledge. That is only a starting point. It is much more critical to use the knowledge one gets from education to enhance the welfare of the less-privileged among us. The truly educated are not those who collect degrees, but those who use those degrees and the underlying scholarship to become nation builders in our society. Jesus and Mary College is a role model for others. It is a matter of great happiness that the college has chosen its golden jubilee to partner with a nearby NDMC school and facilitate the development of the school and its children. This is a praiseworthy example of giving back to society. It can be adopted by other colleges too.

The President said that India is in the midst of multiple transformations. We are an old civilisation but a young people. In the first half of the 21st century, we will have the largest young population in any country of the world. It is crucial to harness the energy of our young people and use it to make our country a developed society. Education is fundamental to this effort – calling for both access to education and quality of education.

The President said that the nature of our economy and the very concept of a workplace is also changing. The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the advances in digitisation and robotics will together make certain types of jobs obsolete and also create many new opportunities. How our society copes with these dramatic changes will be dependent on how our leading institutions of higher learning – institutions such as Jesus and Mary College – will respond. We need to upgrade our higher educational system and, to the extent possible, make it future proof. Our education infrastructure, curricula and modes of teaching have to become 21st century compatible and be nimble and dynamic enough to constantly embrace change.

                It is a matter of honour and happiness for me to be here today at the inauguration of the golden jubilee celebrations of Jesus and Mary College. This institution has contributed enormously to the cause of education in New Delhi and in our country. For five decades, it has taught and prepared young girls – young women, I should say – to break glass ceilings, to achieve their potential, contribute to society and to the economy, and become part of the process of nation building.

The enterprise of nation building involves all of us. It is not limited to just the government. It requires participation by private and public institutions, religious and lay people, and each of us as individuals, irrespective of what we do. After all in a country of such immense and rich diversity, the very nature of nation building calls for diverse actions as well.

Here I must note that the Christian community – whose history in India goes back 2,000 years and which has contributed so much to our shared culture – has carved a special role for itself in education. Missionary institutions such as this one have become symbols of scholarship, dedicated teaching and academic excellence.

This is so appropriate. For all religions in their essence urge us to constantly learn and evolve and grow, to acquire knowledge and gain wisdom. And so become better human beings.

In the Gospel According to John, chapter eight, verse 12, Jesus is quoted as saying, “I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”

In an echo of this sentiment, there is a memorable verse in the Upanishads:

असतो मा सद्गमय

तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय

 

Lead me from falseness to truth

Lead me from darkness to light

 

This invoking of “light” as a metaphor for wisdom and for the awakening of our minds can be linked to the sacred task of education. Irrespective of our faith and identity, the work of education is truly the work of God. And I commend the community here at the Jesus and Mary College for carrying on this good work.

The goal of education is not just to acquire knowledge. That is only a starting point. It is much more critical to use the knowledge one gets from education to enhance the welfare of the less-privileged among us. The truly educated are not those who collect degrees, but those who use those degrees and the underlying scholarship to become nation builders in our society.

I would further emphasise that the real goal of education has to be to produce the best human being. This could be a great service not only to the nation but to entire humanity. If you are the best human being, you will always be a believer in the best in your life, wherever you are positioned. For example, if you happen to be a teacher, you are bound to be the best teacher. If you happen to be an administrator, you are bound to be the best administrator. If you happen to be a doctor, you are bound to be the best doctor, and so on.

Education of girls is much more important than we realise. An educated girl contributes to the economy and at work. She also ensures that other children in her family, as well as the family she may be married into, are educated. The next generation is made responsible and educated through the education of the girl. In this way, the larger social impact of girls’ education is significant.

In turn, this is dependent on the values and the culture that a college or educational institution holds dear and imparts to its students. Here Jesus and Mary College is a role model for others. It is a matter of great happiness that the college has chosen its golden jubilee to partner with a nearby NDMC school and facilitate the development of the school and its children. This is a praiseworthy example of giving back to society. It can be adopted by other colleges too.

I am also told that Jesus and Mary College regularly organises blood donation camps, in which staff members and students participate with enthusiasm. The most recent blood donation camp was organised on September 14. I just saw the photographs of this blood donation camp in the exhibition outside. On the previous day, September 13, the college had organised an organ donation camp in which many students registered. I am deeply moved by this sense of compassion and of social responsibility. Such actions reinforce our faith in our young people.

India is in the midst of multiple transformations. We are an old civilisation but a young people. In the first half of the 21st century, we will have the largest young population in any country of the world. It is crucial to harness the energy of our young people and use it to make our country a developed society. Education is fundamental to this effort – calling for both access to education and quality of education.

The nature of our economy and of the very concept of a workplace is also changing. The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the advances in digitisation and robotics will together make certain types of jobs obsolete and also create many new opportunities. How our society copes with these dramatic changes will be dependent on how our leading institutions of higher learning – institutions such as Jesus and Mary College – will respond.

We need to upgrade our higher educational system and, to the extent possible, make it future proof. Our education infrastructure, curricula and modes of teaching have to become 21st century compatible and be nimble and dynamic enough to constantly embrace change. As visitor of the University of Delhi and of over a hundred other universities, these are issues that concern me. In the days ahead, I look forward to meaningful discussions on such subjects with our academic community.

Friends

I understand this is a moment of double celebration and commemoration for Jesus and Mary College. While the college marks its golden jubilee, the Congregation of the Religious of Jesus and Mary, the holy order that has founded and runs this institution and so many others in our country and elsewhere, is entering the year of its bicentenary.

I am also told that Sister Monica Joseph, the Superior General of this global order of nuns, is not only from India but is a graduate from this very college. It must make this a special anniversary for all of you, and I congratulate you again. I would also like to wish Jesus and Mary College another 50 years – and longer – of teaching and learning, of academic excellence and scholarly fulfilment.

God bless you all

Jai Hind!

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, launched a nationwide sanitation campaign, ‘Swachhta hi Seva’, at Ishwariganj village in Kanpur today (September 15, 2017). He also administered the ‘Swachhta hi Seva’ pledge to all present there whereby they resolved to create a clean, healthy and new India. The President honoured village-level champions who contributed to making Ishwariganj village ‘Open Defecation Free’.  

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said India is fighting a decisive battle for cleanliness and hygiene. Today, all of them had taken an oath that committed them to ensuring public hygiene, personal hygiene and environmental hygiene. Cleanliness is not the responsibility of only sanitation personnel and government departments; it is a multi-stakeholder national movement. Together we should make the effort to clean our houses, public places, villages and cities. The aim is all-round cleanliness and hygiene everywhere, with implications for health and sanitation and overall prosperity of our people. Achieving the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission expeditiously will be an appropriate tribute to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

 

 Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik; Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath; Sushri Uma Bharati, Union Minister of Drinking Water & Sanitation, and Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, Lok Sabha MP from Kanpur. 

 

Earlier in the day, the President visited the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Smriti Vatika in Lucknow and paid his respects at the statue of the late social thinker and political leader Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited his ""home state"" of Uttar Pradesh for the first time as the President of India today (September 14, 2017). He commenced his visit to the State by paying tributes at the Dr. Ambedkar Mahasabha (Asthi Kalash) in Lucknow. 

Later in the day, the President was felicitated at a Civic Reception in Lucknow in the presence of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik; Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath; Dy. Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh Shri Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr. Dinesh Sharma; Speaker of Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha, Shri Hridya Narayna Dikshit and other dignitaries. 

Speaking at the Civic Reception, the President said that this is his first visit to Uttar Pradesh after assuming the office of President of India. He stated that Uttar Pradesh is the ""heartland"" of India. Prominent streams of religion, culture, literature, art and politics have flowed from this State. Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim traditions find representation in Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi, Chitrakoot, Sarnath and Fatehpur Sikri, among other places. Uttar Pradesh is the State of both the Kumbh Mela and the Taj Mahal. 

The President said that great politicians from Uttar Pradesh, including Madan Mohan Malaviya, Acharya Narendra Dev, Purushottam Das Tandon, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Choudhary Charan Singh, gave a new direction to our national life. This State, with a population of 22 crore, offers enormous opportunities and has the potential to decide the future of India.

Your Excellency, Mr. Alexander Lukashenko, President of the Republic of Belarus,

Distinguished members of the Belarusian Delegation,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

 I extend a warm welcome to you, President Lukashenko and to your delegation.  India is not new to you. You have been here earlier. But this visit is very special. We are together celebrating the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between our two countries this year.

And as we mark this momentous occasion, I am reminded of another milestone in our bilateral ties - the visit of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, who gave us our national anthem, to the capital of Belarus- Minsk in 1931. 

Excellency,

Our bilateral partnership so far has been laced with much warmth and friendship; our ties going into the future look equally promising. 

As two nations with a shared global vision, India and Belarus have stood for respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of all nations.

We both support peace and stability in the world and seek peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts.

We both forcefully condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and are committed to a strong global response to combat the evil.

Excellency,

Since your last visit in 2007, India has made many strides.

In recent years, India has seen rapid economic progress and initiated a series of flagship programs. It is heartening that Belarus is keen to partner us in our Make In India initiative. Indian companies too are exploring new opportunities in Belarus.

We are happy that the India-Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement negotiations would begin soon.  Once concluded, it would catapult our economic engagement.

Excellency, our farmers owe a lot to your country, be it for the potash we import or the famed Belarusian tractors. These have helped them in agriculture and raised their yields.  It has also contributed to our food security.

Our science and technology collaboration is on course. The Grodno power project that we helped set-up, and the role Belarus played in establishing the Advance Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials in Hyderabad are shining examples of what we can achieve together.  

We must also bring to bear our scientific knowledge to bequeath a healthier planet to our future generations. Your lush coniferous forests and our clean energy efforts can do wonders for a climate smart world.

 Excellency, our people to people relations are strong. We share many commonalities. We both play hockey, though on different surfaces.  And we both like Bollywood, though with different sub-titles.

And while you draw upon the vigor of Yoga to make your gymnasts do the perfect vault, we strive to capture the beauty of ballet to the rhythm of Tabla.

I am also happy that you would soon begin teaching Hindi at the Belarusian State University.

Excellency, you have been visiting India at an interval of 10 years; you came here in 1997, then in 2007 and now in 2017. I hope we will not have to wait for another 10 years to welcome you in India again!

Excellency,

I once again extend to you a warm welcome and wish you and the members of your delegation the very best.

With these words, Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you to join me in raising a toast to:

- the good health and well-being of President Lukashenko;

- the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Belarus; and

- the ever-lasting friendship between Belarus and India.

Thank You.

Welcoming the President of Belarus, the President said that his visit to India has a special importance as year 2017 is the silver jubilee year of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Belarus.

The President said that there is a huge opportunity to diversify the bilateral trade between India and Belarus. India is keen to strengthen its trade and investment partnership with Belarus. The ‘Make in India’ programme provides opportunities to companies of both countries for cooperation in the field of defence. Belarus is a great source of potash and India hopes for partnerships in this sector.

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that our bilateral partnership so far has been laced with much warmth and friendship; our ties going into the future look equally promising. As two nations with a shared global vision, India and Belarus have stood for respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of all nations. We both support peace and stability in the world and seek peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. The two countries also forcefully condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.

                A group of probationers of 67th (2015) batch of the Indian Revenue Service (Customs & Central Excise) called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind today (September 6, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Addressing the probationers, the President said that collection of revenue is critical to the task of nation building. The revenue collected by the officers is used for the development of the country. He said that tax collection should be a smooth process and there should be minimum discomfort to the tax-payer. He advised them to remember what Chanakya had said about tax collection in the Arthashastra that a government should collect taxes like a honeybee, which collects just the right amount of honey from the flower so that both can survive.

The President said that in a sense the young officers would drive GST — which is one of India’s biggest economic reforms since independence. He stated that this is the age of globalization and technological advance. This throws up enormous opportunities for trade and investment. It also, unfortunately, creates avenues for fraud and money laundering. It is their job to promote economic activity and curb fraud. Both these goals are important. He said that the work they do has implications for India and for India’s reputation in the world — as a trusted business destination, with a fair and predictable tax regime. He asked them to be mindful of this big responsibility.

He wished the officers all success in their future career and told them that their integrity is not negotiable. A credible tax system can only be built by credible tax officers.

The probationers are currently undergoing professional training at the National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes & Narcotics, Faridabad.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind received 319 recipients of ‘National Awards to Meritorious Teachers’ at RashtrapatiBhavan today (September 5, 2017). This is the first time that a high tea has been hosted for award winning teachers by the President of India on Teachers' Day at RashtrapatiBhavan. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the award winning teachers who had received awards earlier today. He said that Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, former President of India, was an illustrious teacher. On his birth anniversary which is celebrated as Teachers’ Day, we pay our respect and regards to teachers. He said that in Indian culture, teachers are seen as equivalent to God. 

The President said that Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and Shri Pranab Mukherjee became Presidents but are cherished as teachers. Even Gandhiji taught English to underprivileged children in Delhi. Teachers have the very important responsibility of laying the foundation of a child’s future. He urged the teaching fraternity to embrace the importance of their profession and ensure that there is no decline in standards of education. He stated that he was confident that they would fulfil their responsibilities earnestly. He said that Dr. Radhakrishnan had once observed that “When we think we know, we cease to learn”. It is therefore, important that all of us, including teachers, should never stop learning. 

The President said that India is a land of diversity. Children in schools are from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Teachers need to take care of this. They should make an effort to understand the child’s family background and minimise disparity among the students of a class. 

The President said that we all need to give back to society. In our tradition imparting education has been termed as ‘VidyaDaan’. Teachers build the next generation. They can be role models for their students with their actions and deeds. It is for teachers to bring out the best in their children. Quoting Kabir, the President stated that the status of teachers is very high. They shape a child’s life. It is important that our children should be taught to be good human beings first and imbibe the values of honesty and integrity. Only then will they excel in the profession they choose. Thus, he said that teachers are the most important nation builders. 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister for Human Resource Development and Dr. Satyapal Singh, Minister of State for Human Resource Development. Students from National Bal Bhavan also presented a cultural performance.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted teachers across the country on the eve of Teachers’ Day.

In a message, the President has said, “The birth anniversary of former President of India Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and an illustrious teacher, on 5th September, is celebrated every year as Teachers’ Day.

Our nation has a warm tradition of the Guru Shishya parampara by which teachers impart their knowledge to students and empower them. It is our moral responsibility to pay respect and regard to teachers, as they are role models who guide children to become good and productive human beings. Teachers also develop the creativity of children and kindle a desire in them to be innovative.

On this occasion, I pay my homage to Dr. Radhakrishnan and extend my heartiest greetings to all teachers of our great nation”.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind was the chief guest at the launch of various social welfare programmes in Mehsana (Gujarat) today (September 3, 2017) on the occasion of the 83rd birthday of Acharya Padmasagarsuriji.

Following is the full text of President’s address on the occasion:

“राष्ट्रपति का कार्यभार सँभालने के बाद यह मेरी पहली गुजरात यात्रा है। लेकिन गुजरात से मेरा नाता लगभग पैंतालीस वर्ष पुराना है। मैं लगातार यहाँ आता रहा हूँ। मुझे अपनी युवावस्था के दौरान प्रधानमंत्री मोरारजी देसाई के साथ काम करने का सौभाग्य प्राप्त हुआ था। मैंने उनके साथ भी गुजरात को नजदीक से देखा था। यहाँ मुझे अपनेपन का सहज अनुभव होता है। मेरा जन्म उत्तर प्रदेश में हुआ, लेकिन गुजरात मेरे लिए दूसरा घर है।

गुजरात का सौभाग्य है कि इस राज्य ने देश को दो प्रधानमंत्री दिए हैं।  दक्षिण गुजरात के वलसाड जिले में  मोरारजी देसाई का जन्म हुआ था। वे सन 1977 में  प्रधानमंत्री बने। भारत के वर्तमान प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्द्र मोदी  उत्तर गुजरात के इसी मेहसाणा की धरती से आते हैं। मेहसाणा के किसानों ने पूरे देश में अपनी अलग पहचान बनाई है। यहाँ के फार्मर को-ऑपरेटिव सारे देश के लिए उदहारण हैं। यहाँ के लोग गुजरात ही नहीं, पूरे देश का गौरव हैं।

हाल ही में उत्तर गुजरात को बाढ़ की विभीषिका से जूझना पड़ा है। मैंने राष्ट्रपति पद की शपथ लेने के बाद मुख्यमंत्री श्री रूपाणीजी से फोन पर बातचीत की। वे बाढ़ प्रभावित क्षेत्रों में पांच-छ: दिनों तक कैंप करते रहे। यह राज्य के लोगों के प्रति उनकी चिंता, प्रेम और निष्ठा का प्रमाण है।

भारत की पावन धरती हमेशा से ऋषि-मुनियों एवं संतों की भूमि रही है। आचार्यजी  उसी परंपरा को आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं। आज उनके 83वें जन्म-दिन के शुभ अवसर पर उपस्थित होना सौभाग्य की बात है। आचार्यजी से मेरा व्यक्तिगत परिचय सन 1994 में हुआ था। वे दिल्ली से बंगाल तक की पदयात्रा पर थे। मेरा परम सौभाग्य है कि उन्होंने मेरे निवास पर मध्याह्न के भोजन के रूप में गुरुचरी ग्रहण करना स्वीकार किया था। मुझे बताया गया है कि आचार्यजी समग्र भारत एवं नेपाल में लगभग एक लाख किलोमीटर की पदयात्रा कर चुके हैं। उन्होने लोगों में सत्य, अहिंसा, सादगी, सदाचार, परोपकार, करुणा एवं आपसी सौहार्द का संदेश प्रसारित किया है।

भगवान महावीर द्वारा प्रवर्तित जैन-दर्शन में अहिंसा को परम धर्म माना गया है। अहिंसा की भावना भारत के राष्ट्र-पिता महात्मा गाँधी की राजनीति का आधार थी। और  यही भावना हमारे देश की ओर से समूचे विश्व के लिए एक अनमोल सौगात है। अहिंसा के साथ-साथ परोपकार की भावना पर बल देना भी जैन आचार्यों की परंपरा रही है।

आचार्यजी ने लोगों में सत्य, अहिंसा, सादगी, सदाचार, परोपकार, करुणा एवं आपसी प्रेम का संदेश फैलाया है। आज के युग में उनकी शिक्षा, जीवन को बेहतर बनाने और सामाजिक सौहार्द को स्थापित करने के लिए अत्यंत प्रासंगिक है।

किसी भी व्यक्ति की परख उसके द्वारा किये गए कार्यों से होती है। मुझे यह जानकर प्रसन्नता हुई है कि आचार्यजी की प्रेरणा से बड़े पैमाने पर व्यसन-मुक्ति, वंचितों को शिक्षा, दीन-दुखियों को सहारा, पशु-पक्षियों की सेवा, संस्कृति की रक्षा जैसे अनेक कार्य  प्रभावी ढंग से हो रहे हैं।

मुझे बताया गया है कि आचार्यजी के अनुयायी  नियमित रूप से शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में, दिव्यांगों के हित में, अनाथों और गरीबों के कल्याण के लिए अनेक कार्य कर रहे हैं।

इसी क्रम में आज मानव- कल्याण की विभिन्न योजनाओं का शुभारम्भ होने जा रहा है। इस पावन अवसर पर ऐसे ही कार्यों का संकल्प लेना संतो के प्रति सच्ची श्रद्धा है।

आचार्यश्री ने भारत की प्राचीन विरासत को सँजोने वाली दुर्लभ पांडुलिपियों को नष्ट  होने से बचाया है और उन्हें विदेशों में जाने से भी बचाया है। देश के कोने-कोने में जा कर, लगभग दो लाख पाण्डुलिपियों को एकत्र कर, इस अमूल्य धरोहर को कोबा– गांधीनगर स्थित इस ज्ञान मंदिर में संरक्षित किया है।

यह शायद भारतीय पांडुलिपियों का विश्व में सबसे बड़ा संग्रहालय बन गया है। इस संग्रहालय को देखने का मुझे भी सौभाग्य प्राप्त हुआ है।

पाण्डुलिपियों का शोध करना, उनका संग्रह करना और उन्हें व्यवस्थित रूप से सूचीबद्ध करना एक महान सांस्कृतिक योगदान है।

आज, ""कैलास श्रुतसागर-ग्रंथ-सूची"" के 23वें भाग के लोकार्पण में उपस्थित होने पर मुझे प्रसन्नता हो रही है। मैं इस पावन व गौरवशाली कार्य से जुड़े हर व्यक्ति की हृदय से सराहना करता हूँ।

मैं यह कामना करता हूँ कि ईश्वर आचार्यश्री को आरोग्य और दीर्घायु प्रदान करे तथा उनके हर कार्य में उन्हें सफलता प्रदान करे।

जय हिन्द !”

“On the occasion of Onam, I offer my greetings and good wishes to the people of the country, particularly to our brothers and sisters from Kerala.

Coinciding with the beginning of the harvest season, Onam celebrates the hard work and toil of our farmers. May this festival be an occasion for celebration and sharing joy with our families, while not forgetting to reach out to those in need. Let us work unitedly to promote harmony and fraternity in our society”.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind addressed a civic reception hosted for him at SV Arts College Ground, Tirupati today (September 1, 2017). He also laid the foundation stone for BR Ambedkar Skill Training Academy and gave sanction letters to beneficiaries of the Stand up India initiative and the Land Purchase Scheme of the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes Co-operative Finance Corporation. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the people and history of Andhra Pradesh are a pride for every one of us in India. This is a land of great heroes and great achievements. From the Satavahana Empire of ancient times to the leadership of people like T. Prakasam, whom we remember with reverence as “Andhra Kesari”, this region has given the country so much. In recent times, Andhra Pradesh has been fortunate to have given birth to at least two far-sighted political leaders – the late Chief Minister Shri N.T. Rama Rao and our former Prime Minister, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao. Andhra Pradesh’s social and economic achievements in the past few years mirror the transformation of India. Yet, as we march forward, we must ensure that this is a journey for all – and not just a journey for some.

The President said that the Ambedkar Skills and Training Academy is planned as a modern marvel in Tirupati – a world-class job-oriented centre that will focus on youth from marginalised communities. It will train them in skills that will help them get employment in government and private organisations.

The President said that Stand-Up India is a very important initiative – because it provides poor people the chance to become job creators. In Andhra Pradesh, entrepreneurship is in the DNA of society. This is the energy of youth that Stand-up India seeks to channel.

The President said that the Land Purchase Scheme of the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes Co-operative Finance Corporation provides agricultural land to women members of traditionally marginalised communities. It boosts the earning potential of women, and gives them a solid economic asset in the form of a land holding. It also empowers them socially and within the family.

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan and Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Earlier in the day, the President visited the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, within which is the Sri Padmavathi Medical College for Women and inaugurated a new hospital building.

This is only my second visit outside Delhi since being elected as the President of India. My first visit had taken me to our valiant soldiers in Leh, in Jammu and Kashmir. And I am honoured that my second trip has brought me to Andhra Pradesh, which is one of our most dynamic and cherished states. I am doubly blessed at the opportunity of coming to the sacred soil of Tirupati and getting a darshan of Lord Balaji.

 

The people and history of Andhra Pradesh are a pride for every Indian. This is a land of great heroes and great achievements. From the Satavahana Empire of ancient times to the leadership of people like T. Prakasam, whom we remember with reverence as “Andhra Kesari”, this region has given the country so much. In recent times, Andhra Pradesh has been fortunate to have given birth to at least two far-sighted political leaders – the late Chief Minister Shri N.T. Rama Rao and our former Prime Minister, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao. This region has produced three Presidents in the past Late Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Late Shri V.V. Giri and Late Shri Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy.  You have also given me an invaluable colleague – Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu as Vice President. 

 

Three years ago, Andhra Pradesh made a new beginning. Under the capable leadership of Shri Chandrababu Naidu, it is making rapid progress in many fields. The Union government is giving all-out support for the welfare and uplift of the people of Andhra Pradesh. I had recently visited Vijayawada and was very impressed by its development. I am looking forward to one day visiting the new capital of Amaravati, which is being built as a city with 21st century technology.

 

In so many areas of human endeavour, the people of Andhra Pradesh are role models for the country. Farmers from this region have contributed substantially to our rice production, among other crops. In adoption of technology for social development programmes, Andhra Pradesh has shown the way to the rest of India. Andhra IT and infrastructure companies are famous nationally and internationally.

 

All over the world, Telugu people are shining success stories. In the United States, the dedication and accomplishments and doctors from Andhra Pradesh have won widespread recognition. This makes all of us proud.

 

Friends

Andhra Pradesh’s social and economic achievements in the past few years mirror the transformation of India. Yet, as we march forward, we must ensure that this is a journey for all – and not just a journey for some. I am happy that the Government of Shri Chandrababu Naidu is taking all measures for the welfare of the poorer and marginalised sections of society.

 

This is a vision that is in keeping with what the Father of our Constitution, Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, taught us. He emphasised the values of education and human dignity. Benefits of all welfare schemes must reach the last house in the village. And the Government of India and the Government of Andhra Pradesh are jointly striving in this direction.

 

That is why the purpose of my visit here is so personally satisfying for me. The Ambedkar Skills and Training Academy is planned as a modern marvel in Tirupati – a world-class job-oriented centre that will focus on youth from marginalised communities. It will train them in skills that will help them get employment in government and private organisations.

 

This function also commemorates two other parallel initiatives of the Government. The first is Stand-Up India, a Government of India scheme that is facilitating bank loans from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore to individual entrepreneurs or small enterprises belonging to those from marginalised sections.

 

This is a very important scheme – because it provides poor people the chance to become job creators. In Andhra Pradesh, entrepreneurship is in the DNA of society. This is the energy of youth that Stand-up India seeks to channel.

 

The second parallel initiative is the Land Purchase Scheme of the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes Co-operative Finance Corporation. This provides agricultural land to women members of traditionally marginalised communities. It boosts the earning potential of women, and gives them a solid economic asset in the form of a land holding. It also empowers them socially and within the family.

 

I congratulate the Andhra Pradesh government for this initiative. This scheme will not just change the life of an individual woman, but that of an entire family. Women, nurturing the family at home and toiling in the fields or workplace, are the backbone of our society. Economic empowerment of women will bring about social change.

Friends

Earlier today, I was privileged to visit the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, within which is the Sri Padmavathi Medical College for Women. There I inaugurated a new hospital building. I wish and pray that the hospital and its team of dedicated doctors, nurses and care-givers ensure the good health and well-being of the people of Tirupati and surrounding areas.

 

May Lord Venkateswara bless us all!

 

Thank you

 

Jai Hind

Your Excellency Doris Leuthard, President of the Swiss Confederation,

Distinguished members of the Swiss delegation,

Ladies and gentlemen,

 

I am delighted to welcome you, Madam President, as well as members of your delegation, to India. Your visit assumes special significance as this year marks a milestone in bilateral relations. Our countries enter the 70th year of the Friendship and Establishment Treaty. India itself is celebrating the 70th anniversary of Independence.

Your Excellency, relations between the two countries have been faithful to the words inscribed in the treaty: “There shall be perpetual peace and unalterable friendship.” From the quest for clean energy to the quest for a cleaner financial system, our goals are extremely compatible. On the tennis court, Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza have shown us what Switzerland and India can do together. We have to take inspiration from that partnership in other areas.

In this context, your visit and Prime Minister Modi’s visit in 2016 showcase the desire of both nations to maintain close contacts at the highest level. You are the fourth Swiss President to visit India. I cannot help but note, you are also the first Swiss President to come to India in a month other than November! I am glad this has given you the chance to enjoy the Indian monsoon.

Excellency, both of us represent democratic and plural societies that believe in the principles of “respect for differences” and “unity in diversity”. Switzerland is India’s seventh largest trading partner and 11th largest foreign investor. On its part, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world. A GDP growth rate of seven per cent, with strong economic fundamentals, is supported by a reform momentum, fiscal consolidation and a low current account deficit.

There is so much we can do with Switzerland. Your economy is among the world’s most innovative and competitive. It is backed by the acclaimed Swiss dual-track education system, with its emphasis on vocational training. These attributes, along with Switzerland’s environmental best practices, provide us a number of opportunities.

We can grow and diversify our trade, investment and technological exchanges. Our countries need to pursue even closer business partnerships in priority sectors such as precision and high technology manufacturing, infrastructure, skill development, renewable energy and clean-tech research.

There is scope for creating partnerships between R&D labs and institutions. We value your country’s recognition of Ayurveda as a system of traditional medicine. Here too there is room to cooperate further.

Excellency, in a sense our governments are only building on strong people-to-people and business links between our countries. In India, Switzerland is the land of cheese, chocolates and Roger Federer. Given our population, he probably has more fans in India than he has at home.

Your country’s beauty is familiar to many Indians as the backdrop for some of our best-known films. This has added to the attraction that Switzerland holds as a tourist destination. In our country, we wish and wait for a similar response from Swiss tourists.

India offers visitors a rich heritage of historical and religious monuments, and a diverse canvas of natural beauty. We are glad you are here, but we want you to come back, and more often!

Excellency, like your country, India is committed to multilateralism. Yet, the multilateral order needs to undergo multiple transformations; namely:

·         Reform and restructuring of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions;

 

·         Tackling urgent challenges of international terrorism and radicalism, as well as of financial and cyber-crimes and of Internet governance; and

 

·         Meeting pressing concerns of climate change and attaining the Sustainable Development Goals.

India is keen to build synergies with Switzerland in all of these endeavours, while working within the framework of the rules-based multilateral system.

Excellency, we believe your visit will add substantially to the energy that relations between our countries have acquired. We are different societies, and yet so similar. We share and cherish the same values. This is a partnership of the Alps and the Himalayas. There is no reason why it cannot soar to greater heights.

On this optimistic note,

Ladies and Gentlemen please join me in a toast to the:

·         Health and happiness of President Leuthard;

 

·         Progress and prosperity of the people of Switzerland, and;

 

·         Further strengthening of relations between Switzerland and India

 

Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, yesterday (August 31, 2017) received Her Excellency Ms. Doris Leuthard, the President of the Swiss Confederation, at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also hosted a banquet in her honour.

Welcoming the Swiss President, the President said that Switzerland and India are natural partners. Switzerland is one of the oldest democracies and India is the largest democracy. A Treaty of Friendship between India and Switzerland signed in New Delhi in August 1948 was one of the first treaties to be signed by independent India.

The President said that Switzerland is an important trade and investment partner for India. India is a preferred destination for FDI as it is the world’s fastest growing large economy. He stated that India has made great progress on the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and in creating a unified market through GST and other measures. Swiss companies are ideally positioned to take advantage. He invited Swiss technology companies to take part in initiatives like Make in India, Start-Up India, Swachh Bharat and Skill India.

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that the visit of the Swiss President assumes special significance as this year marks a milestone in bilateral relations. India and Switzerland enter the 70th year of the Friendship and Establishment Treaty. Both India and Switzerland represent democratic and plural societies that believe in the principles of “respect for differences” and “unity in diversity”. Switzerland is India’s seventh largest trading partner and 11th largest foreign investor.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Indian people have the right to know how decision-making happens at the highest level and what national security entails. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘Securing India: The Modi Way' authored by Shri Nitin Gokhale, here today. The Minister of State for Defence, Dr. Subhash Ramrao Bhamre and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 The Vice President said that the book provides the most intimate and sweeping account yet of the NDA Government’s approach to national security and foreign policy initiatives. He further said that drawing on internal memos, as yet classified information, meeting notes and hundreds of hours of interviews with key players in the national security team, Shri Gokhale brings alive inside stories of decision-making at the highest levels in the government.

The Vice President said that the book details hitherto unknown aspects of the planning and execution of the surgical strikes, revamping of New Delhi's policy towards China and Pakistan, India's renewed global policy focus on Middle East, Prime Minister Modi's attempt to leverage the Indian diaspora worldwide, besides focusing on some small but far-reaching steps taken to secure India in every possible way - on land, space, cyber and maritime domains.

 The Vice President said that the issue of terrorism is at the fore front of government’s foreign policy world over. He further said that terrorism has no religion; it’s a threat to humanity and it should be curbed and we must be humane and sensitive in our approach while interacting with others. If there is tension there can’t be attention towards development, this should bear the basic principle, he added.

 The Vice President said that in democracy violence has no place and bullet cannot bring change where as ballot can. The policy of government should be zero tolerance towards terrorism and corruption both will eat away the vitals of our system, he added.

 Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 “I am pleased to release the book ‘Securing India: The Modi Way', written by senior journalist, Shri Nitin Gokhale.

 Normally, matters relating to defence and security aspects are kept shrouded in a veil of secrecy and not put in public domain by most nations the world over. Understandably, in most cases utmost precautions are taken not to make public important decisions and their processes in order to protect security and national interests.

 No doubt, legitimate security concerns could be the reason for maintaining complete secrecy in such matters. However, a balanced view has to be taken on the extent to which such information could be made available to the public as complete lack of transparency would give scope to corruption.

In this background, the book by Shri Gokhale  provides the most intimate and sweeping account yet of the NDA Government’s approach to national security and foreign policy initiatives.

 Drawing on internal memos, as yet classified information, meeting notes and hundreds of hours of interviews with key players in the national security team, Shri Gokhale brings alive inside stories of decision-making at the highest levels in the government.

Painstakingly researched, the book details hitherto unknown aspects of the planning and execution of the surgical strikes, revamping of New Delhi's policy towards China and Pakistan, India's renewed global policy focus on Middle East, Prime Minister Modi's attempt to leverage the Indian diaspora worldwide, besides focusing on some small but far-reaching steps taken to secure India in every possible way --on land, space, cyber and maritime domains.

 The book provides an authentic account of the Modi government' decision making process on vital issues. This is by no means an analytical document. In fact, it is mostly factual and narrated from the point of view of those involved. In that respect, some might view this book as an incomplete account. It’s a start nevertheless. Till then, read the book for what it is: a journalistic record of some of the bold and unconventional decisions taken by the Modi government since 2014.

 There is no denying the fact that this book has gained immensely by the trust reposed in the author by people in very sensitive appointments. For the first time, people holding sensitive positions have spoken on record about some major incidents like the Pathankot Operation, the two surgical strikes - one in Myanmar and one in PoK - and the standoff at Doklam.

 The book contains interviews with Former Defence Minister, Shri Manohar Parrikar, the National Security Adviser, Shri Ajit Doval, current and former Army Chiefs, Special Forces officers and men, NSG commandos and IAF personnel.  

 By writing this book, Shri Gokhale has brought the complicated subject of national security to the common citizen. Indian people have the right to know how decision-making happens at the highest level and what national security entails. This book provides rare insight into that process. I commend the author for accomplishing this task in a short time and bringing to light some of the unknown aspects of governance.

I am a happy that issue of terrorism is at the fore front of government’s foreign policy world over.

Terrorism has no religion; it’s a threat to humanity. It should be curbed and we must be humane and sensitive in our approach while interacting with others but at the same time we must be firm in assuring and maintaining Indians unity, integrity and internal security.

If there is tension there can’t be attention towards development, this should bear the basic principle. We have to secure our borders and also assure the internal security so that the government and the administration can focus on development.

 In democracy violence has no place. Bullet cannot bring change where as ballot can. This has been witnessed world over. The policy of government should be zero tolerance towards terrorism and corruption both will eat away the vitals of our system.

 

Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the first step towards a developed India is to create a clean and hygienic and therefore a healthy India. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating “Swachhta Hi Seva” and “Shouchalayakkagi Samara” (A Crusade For Toilets) Programmes in Konnur Village, Gadag District, Karnataka, today. The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, the Minister of State for Drinking Water & Sanitation, Shri Ramesh Chandappa Jigajinagi, the Minister of Rural Development & Panchayat Raj, Government of Karnataka, Shri H.K. Patil and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that every Indian should become part of this “Jan Andolan” with a missionary zeal so that the goal of a “Clean India” is achieved by 2nd October, 2019 - the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He further said that the dream of the Father of the Nation could be realized through ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ if everybody from celebrities to common man selflessly participate and take ownership of the programme. 

 

The Vice President said that good sanitation can save Rs.50,000 per year per family, as said by UNICEF, and over 1,00,000 children die every year in India due to diarrhea. He further said that lack of sanitation also contributes to physical and cognitive stunting in children. Besides, women and girls face a serious threat to their safety when they resort to open defecation, he added. 

 

The Vice President said that the number of Indians defecating in the open in rural and urban areas is estimated to have reduced to 30 crore, from about 60 crore in 2014. He further said that he was sure ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign will give a big thrust to the momentum of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’.

 

The Vice President said that this campaign aims to mobilise people from across the country, especially government functionaries across all levels, local leaders, youth groups, women, school children, defence personnel, corporate, celebrities, faith organizations and citizens at large to offer shramdaan to construct twin-pit toilets and clean public places like railway stations, bus stands, parks, markets, hospitals, schools etc. He further said that recognizing the need to preserve the sanctity and cleanliness of our natural endowments and places of cultural heritage like places of worship, heritage sites and beaches, they are likely to be given a face lift. We should collectively search for innovative solutions that will make a tangible difference to the lives of the people, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am very pleased to be here in Karnataka on the occasion of declaration of Naragund block of Gadag district, as a part of the Swachhata Hi Seva fortnight and Shouchalayakkagi Samara. I would like to congratulate the residents of Naragund, and also the district administration and Government of Karnataka. 

Every Indian should become part of this “Jan Andolan” with a missionary zeal so that the goal of a “Clean India” is achieved by 2nd October, 2019 - the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

Gandhiji accorded highest priority to sanitation and cleanliness and had famously said “Sanitation is more important than political freedom”, He had also pointed out that “the cause of many of our diseases is the condition of our lavatories and our bad habit of disposing of excreta anywhere and everywhere”.

I have recalled these telling statements made by Gandhiji to drive home the point that the dream of the Father of the Nation could be realized through ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ if everybody from celebrities to common man selflessly participate and take ownership of the programme, rather than treating it as a government-driven campaign.

According to UNICEF, good sanitation can save Rs.50,000 per year per family. Over 1,00,000 children die every year in India due to diarrhea. 

Lack of sanitation also contributes to physical and cognitive stunting in children. Besides, women and girls face a serious threat to their safety when they resort to open defecation. These are all serious issues and can no longer be ignored by adopting a status quoist mindset.

A World Bank report had said that lack of sanitation costs over six per cent of our GDP.

Ever Since Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi launched ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan” with a call to achieve ‘ Clean India’ by 2019, there no doubt has been tremendous response from different sections of the people as also various State Governments, local bodies, public representatives, NGOs and local communities.

Overall, the Swachh Bharat Mission has made remarkable progress and has transformed the sanitation situation in the country. 

The number of Indians defecating in the open in rural and urban areas is estimated to have reduced to 30 crore, from about 60 crore in 2014. 

Over 2,45,000 villages, 1300 cities, 200 districts and 5 states have been declared open defecation free (ODF). All villages along the banks of the Ganga have been declared ODF. 

Over 50% of urban wards have door to door collection of municipal solid waste. Nearly 100 megawatts energy is being produced from waste in the country. 

Over 5 crore toilets have been constructed in rural and urban areas. There is some distance to travel, and we are all committed to achieving a clean and open defecation free India by October 2019. 

In 2014, the household sanitation coverage in Karnataka was only 30%.Since then, the State showed remarkable progress achieving over 72% coverage today. The state has also declared nearly 12,000 villages, 50 blocks and 7 districts Open Defecation Free.The program called “Shouchalayakkaagi Samara” (Crusade for Toilets) is being implemented across the state of Karnataka as a people’s movement to stop open defecation on a war foot basis. , I compliment the government of Karnataka for the same

I am sure ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign will give a big thrust to the momentum of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’. 

This campaign aims to mobilise people from across the country, especially government functionaries across all levels, local leaders, youth groups, women, school children, defence personnel, corporate ,celebrities, faith organizations and citizens at large to offer shramdaan to construct twin-pit toilets and clean public places like railway stations, bus stands, parks, markets, hospitals, schools etc. 

Recognizing the need to preserve the sanctity and cleanliness of our natural endowments and places of cultural heritage like places of worship, heritage sites and beaches, they are likely to be given a face lift. 

We cannot achieve sustained progress if we adopt a business as usual approach. We should collectively search for innovative solutions that will make a tangible difference to the lives of the people. 

This is the responsibility that all municipal and village Panchayats must take as a sacred mission, not a mere job or chore. It is possibly the best and the most sincere tribute to the father of the nation who was so passionate about it. It is an opportunity for each one of us to show that we care, that we care about our country and our fellow citizens. 

Friends!

These kind of achievementsare possible only when the community comes together to achieve public health outcomes through engaging and motivating public, generating demand for toilets and using them. Few such examples:

On this occasion let me share with you all the story of a spirited 105-year-old Kunwar Bai from Chhattisgarh. She is an inspiration for all of us to emulate. Her zeal and actions for a better life made her sell off all her goats to build toilets in the house. She was felicitated by the Hon’ble Prime Minister himself and is now the mascot for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

Mondrita Chatterjee a class VI student of Hill Top School, Telco, spent her pocket money to build toilets for poor people in Potka block of East Singhbhum district. 

Somari Devi started ‘Lota chhino, Siti Bajao and Damru Bajao’ abhiyan to prevent people from defecating in the open. She went along with the Nigrani Samiti at 5 AM and again after 5 PM. As a result of such initiatives, Religarha East Panchayat in hazaribagh dist was declared ODF on December 15, 2016.

Examples from Karnataka include:

A teenager lavanya in Karnataka went on a 3-day fast demanding toilets in each house in her village. She finally called it off when officials promised to construct toilets in the village.

Dr.Manjula, IAS, the former CEO of Bangalore rural achieved ODF in 48 GPs in 6 months which was a record time in Karnataka. 

Over the past month, 45 year old vegetable vendor, Sharanamma has been giving away one kilogram of tomatoes for free; to each home that has a toilet in the Dhanapur village of Gangavathi Taluk in Koppal District of Karnataka.

16-year-old Mallamma from Koppal district in northern Karnataka recently went on a hunger strike to pressurise her mother to build a toilet at home.

AkkammaHarawal, an SHG member from Gulbarga who also represented the Swachh Shakti in March 2017 at New Delhi who motivated communities to build and use toilets. 

Tanuja Gouda, who hails from Uttar Kannada district comes from an all-women household who dug the toilet pit all by herself investing in her family’s health

Women and girls are taking a stand against marriage into families without toilet facilities.

Friends!

Through the past week, and especially on 17th September - Seva Diwas, several Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers, State Ministers, MPs, MLAs and Sarpanches have offered shramdaan to inspire their constituents. 

The Prime Minister himself offered shramdaan for the construction of a twin-pit toilet in a village in his Parliamentary constituency Varanasi. 

Movie stars, sports personalities, corporates, artists and faith leaders have offered shramdaan in different parts of urban and rural India. 

We have seen amazing examples of service for cleanliness even by the institutions which are the epitome of service – the armed forces and police forces across the country. 

The Indian army organized a cleanliness drive in the Siachen glacier, showing their commitment to fighting the country’s biggest enemy – filth. 

School children and youth groups like the NCC, NSS and NYKS have led the movement from the front. They have come out in large numbers and taken Swachhata pledges, held cleanliness drives, Swachhata rallies and have written essays, made paintings and short films on Swachh Bharat. Over 2.6 crore essays, over 2 crore paintings and over 3 lakh short films on Swachh Bharat have been received. 

Swachhata Hi Seva has provided a further boost to the sanitation and cleanliness movement in the country.I appeal to everyone to come forward and get involved with Swachhta Hi Seva, keep up the momentum beyond the fortnight of campaign on a continuous basis so that the nation takes a leap towards a Swachh Bharat. 

The first step towards a developed India is to create a clean and hygienic and therefore a healthy India. Let us ensure that this jan andolan intensifies every day and every citizen plays his part. 

Jai Hind""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the media has to avoid sensationalism and maintain its credibility while disseminating news. He was addressing the gathering after presenting the 14thShailikaar Prabhakar Samman Award to eminent journalist Smt. Anuradha Prasad, here today. The award was instituted in memory of well-known Hindi writer, journalist and freedom fighter, Pt. Kanhaiya Lal Misra ‘Prabhakar’. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the credibility was the most important thing in journalism and said, “Information with confirmation is more than ammunition”. He further said that any content that offends the sensibilities of the people was a matter of concern and self-regulation was the best way to address such a problem.

Recalling the pioneering role of journalism in freeing India from colonial rule and subsequently in strengthening democracy in post-Independent India, the Vice President said that a vibrant electronic and print media were continuing to play an important role in moulding public opinion. He further said that news values appear to have changed over the years. What would not have been considered to be even a filler in the past was becoming ‘Breaking News’ today and many a time, an off-the-cuff remark becomes a screaming headline, he added.

Asserting that he was not advocating any censorship, the Vice President pointed out that the media because of its reach and impact has a huge responsibility in ensuring that the people were not swayed or agitated by controversies which are best ignored. He further said that the cinema too must avoid obscenity, vulgarity, violence and double meaning dialogues. Of late there was a tendency of mixing news and views, he added.

Referring to freedom of expression, the Vice President said that it is best utilized when the value of such freedom was fully appreciated. He called upon newspapers and channels to refocus on developmental journalism so that different social and economic issues affecting the people and the country get highlighted and even bring about policy changes at the highest level. Development journalism was all the more relevant in a country like India to unravel various complexities and put things in the right perspective, he added.

The Vice President said that we need to accord importance to mother tongue, while pursuing English as the link language. Describing various Indian languages including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Assamese, Oriya and Gujarati as national languages, he said that proficiency in the mother tongue was vital before learning other languages.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that a collective, coordinated action is needed to strengthen the eco-system for promoting SC & ST Entrepreneurs in the country. He was addressing the National SC-ST Hub Confluence organized by the Union Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, here today. The Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the Union Minister for Tribal Affairs, Shri Jual Oram, the Minister of State for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (I/C), Shri Giriraj Singh, the Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the country will be developed when the downtrodden and under-privileged sections are uplifted. He further said that we need to have an integrated, multi-dimensional developmental agenda for the development of the country.

The Vice President said that setting up of Industries is important for the development of our country and it will solve the unemployment problem and increase the income. He further said that industry and agriculture are two important factors for the overall development of the country.

The Vice President while referring to the national discourse today, Stand-up, Start-up, Incubation, Innovation said that this should get further momentum and tempo. He further said that Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India – all these programmes should reach every section and everybody must get their due. Capacity building is important; credit availability is important, technology up-gradation is also important, he added.

The Vice President said that the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Sector (MSME) is the bulwark of the Indian economy and one of the largest employers after agriculture. He further said that it is also one of the major contributors to the country’s GDP. With Make in India envisaging to push contribution of the manufacturing sector to 25 per cent of the GDP by 2022, the MSME sector will be required to play a critical role in achieving the goal, he added.

The Vice President said that skill up gradation is one area that requires top attention for the overall development of SC/ST entrepreneurs. He congratulated the National SC/ST Hub for signing MoUs with Sector Skill Councils to skill over 2,000 entrepreneurs and said that the associations and incubators have a huge role to play in supporting the objectives of National SC/ST Hub. Each association must extend support in building capacities and mentoring entrepreneurs in its respective sector, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

I am really delighted to participate in a programme organized by the Union Ministry of MSME to interact with stake holders of National SC/ST Hub Confluence. Country will be developed when the downtrodden and under-privileged sections of this country are uplifted. Only then will the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, government’s ambition of ‘Sabka saath - Sabka Vikas’ are fulfilled. Unless all the sections of the society are developed, we cannot shape a developed country. There is no meaning for development unless it reaches everybody. Everyone should feel that he or she has a stake in the development of the country. We need to have an integrated, multi-dimensional developmental agenda for the development of the country.   

Setting up of industries is important for the development of our country. This will solve the unemployment problem and increase the income. Industry and agriculture are the two eyes of the people. Both of them are important for the overall development of the country. There is a need to encourage small industries along with big ones to full-fill the dream of ‘Sab ka Saath – Sab ka Vikas’.

I am happy to know that we have about 22 lakh small scale industries in our country and the number is increasing every year. In 2007 about 2 lakh small scale industries were set up in the country. This number went on increasing year after year and at present about 4 lakh small and medium industries are coming up in our country. Mainly small, micro industries are coming up. If we look at number of SC and STs in this, there is only about 4 lakh. This number has to be increased. It is important to encourage them and provide technical knowledge and market to sell the finished products. With this aim, the government has come up with SC/ST Hub.

The government has made a policy that whatever the items they purchase, they should be at least 4 per cent should be from SC/ST units. But today, we have less than half per cent being procured from SC/ST units.

The national discourse today has changed. We talk of Stand-up, Start-up, Incubation and Innovation. This focus on skills, entrepreneurial development should get further momentum. Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India – all these programmes should reach every section of our society and everybody must get their due. Only then will the development have meaning. If you do not reach certain sections of the people, then the development is incomplete. Capacity building is important; credit availability is important, technology up-gradation is also important.

Empowering women is empowering entire humanity, because women constitute 50 per cent of the population. We cannot claim to be a developed country unless women are given equal opportunities. In the same way, we cannot claim our country is developed when there are sections which are deprived, and have been denied the opportunity to join the developmental stream. So this is the duty of any government to uplift those sections.

This effort is for the overall development of India. All have to take part in this. This should be taken as a sacred responsibility. Only then will the development of SC/ST will take place.  

The Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Sector (MSME) is the bulwark of the Indian economy and one of the largest employers after agriculture. It is also one of the major contributors to the country’s GDP.

In spite of ups and downs, MSME sector showed resilience and maintained a good growth rate ranging from11.77 per cent in 2007-08 to 17 per cent in 2015. It showed an impressive growth of 18.74 per cent from April-September 2015.

With Make in India envisaging to push contribution of the manufacturing sector to 25 per cent of the GDP by 2022, the MSME sector will be required to play a critical role in achieving the goal.

This sector not only contributes to industrialization of backward and rural areas, but also helps in reducing regional imbalances. By its very nature, this sector acts as an equalizer and offers vast opportunities to people from all walks of life to become successful entrepreneurs and achieve their dreams.

As a result, there have been many entrepreneurs from the marginalized communities. But lack of proper guidance and resources is hampering their economic success and this led to policy intervention from the Government.

As you are all aware, the Public Procurement Policy was introduced with a stipulation that 20 per cent of total procurement of goods and services by Central Ministries, Departments and Central Public Sector Enterprises must be made from MSEs and 20 per cent (four per cent of total) of such procurement from SC/ST owned MSEs.

Although, the procurement policy for sourcing four per cent from SC/ ST was introduced in 2012, the response has not been very encouraging and less than 0.5 per cent of goods were procured. As a result, the government established National SC/ST Hub to provide professional support to entrepreneurs coming from such communities and promote “enterprise culture” among SC/ST population.

I am told that the Hub was tasked to facilitate credit linkages for SC/ST entrepreneurs, provide SC/ST MSEs with access to new markets, and gather data about SC/ST Enterprises, work with the CPSEs, industry associations and SC/ST Enterprises to effectively participate in procurement.

Skill up gradation is one area that requires top attention for the overall development of SC/ ST enterprises. I am glad that today the National SC ST Hub will be signing MoUs with Sector Skill Councils to skill over 2,000 entrepreneurs.

Today, we have amongst us the top industry associations and incubators, who have been working together to empower the marginalized communities of the country. This is the true essence and tradition of our country where everyone works collectively to help the less fortunate.

The associations and incubators have a huge role to play in supporting the objectives of National SC ST Hub. Each association must extend support in building capacities and mentoring entrepreneurs in its respective sector, while the incubators must ensure that the dreams of the aspiring entrepreneurs are turned into reality.

I am sure that the associations and incubators will raise to the occasion and come out with innovative strategies so that the Public Procurement Policy is not only successfully implemented but an effective ecosystem is created for SC/ ST entrepreneurs to thrive and make a significant contribution to the growth of the economy.

I think various State Governments should also come out with Procurement Policies on the lines of the Central Government’s scheme to give a boost to MSME sector in general and SC/ ST enterprises in particular.

I once again thank the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises for initiating this very crucial dialogue and I do hope this will be followed up through a time bound action plan to give the much required impetus for SC and ST entrepreneurs to take up new and bigger ventures.

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi was a legendary and iconic figure who mesmerized everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to common man. He was addressing the gathering at an event to inaugurate an Exhibition on Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi and release a Commemorative Coin on the occasion of her Birth Centenary Commemoration, here today. The Minister of State for Culture (I/C) and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that India is a land of rich cultural heritage with music in diverse genres representing the truly myriad mosaic of plurality. He further said that what defines India is this rich heritage of music and its unifying role in bringing people together cutting across religions, regions, castes and communities.

 

The Vice President said that the roots of Indian music can be traced to Vedic literature, Sama Veda in particular and as such every note and cadence associated with our ancient music systems have to be preserved and propagated. He further said that this is our bounden duty to see such cultural heritage is preserved which is given to us by our fore fathers and pass it on to the next generation.

 

The Vice President said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi’s music is immortal and everyone in this country was influenced and thrilled by her music. He further said that music acquired a divine dimension when she lent her voice to various compositions. She was the first musician to be awarded Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour and first Indian musician to have performed at the United Nations General Assembly, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“India is a land of rich cultural heritage with music in diverse genres representing the truly myriad mosaic of plurality - from the two main fountainheads of classical music - Carnatic and Hindustani - to a variety of folk music from every nook and corner to Sufi music, Qawwalis, Rabindra Sangeet to popular film music.

 

What defines India is this rich heritage of music and its unifying role in bringing people together cutting across religions, regions, castes and communities.

 

Friends! The roots of Indian music can be traced to Vedic literature, Sama Veda in particular and as such every note and cadence associated with our ancient music systems have to be preserved and propagated. This is our bounden duty to see such cultural heritage is preserved which is given to us by our fore fathers. We have to preserve it and pass it on to the next generation. I am happy that the Indira Gandhi National Cultural Centre has taken up this responsibility and the Ministry of Culture is supporting it. I would like to compliment the Minister of Culture, Shri Mahesh Sharma for taking this initiative of celebrating Birth Centenary of this noble daughter of this country. Her music is immortal. Everyone in this country influenced and thrilled by her music. Even Mahatma Gandhi was spell-bound when he listen her rendition of ‘Vaishnav Janatho’.

 

The first Prime Minister of India, Pt. Jawaharlal said about M.S. Subbulakshmi that ‘I am an ordinary Prime Minister in front of the Queen of Music’. The titans in the opposite sides of those days, the ideology like Pt. Jawarlal Nehru on one side and Rajaji on the other side and both of them acclaimed her great qualities and they stand together when they came to appreciate the Music from her.

 

Music has no barriers or boundaries. This Sanskrit saying शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गान रसं फणि: (Sisurvetti pasurvetti, vetti gana rasam phanihi) aptly sums up the magical power of music. Metaphysical and spiritual love finds sublime expression in the keertanas of Thyagaraja or Annamacharya, the bhajans of Meera or Tulsidas, among many highly evolved seers and sages of our literary and musical tradition. As Saint Thyagaraja said: “Sangeetha Gnanamu Bhakthi Vina Sanmargam Kaladhe”, which could be roughly translated as “unless you are able to blend devotion with music, it may not lead us to the blissful plane”

 

Music acquired a divine dimension when somebody like legendary Carnatic singer, late M S Subbulakshmi lent her voice to various compositions.

 

It will be perhaps an understatement to say that M.S. Subbulakshmi is a well-known name not only in India but across the world. 

 

She was a cult figure, who had mesmerized everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to the common man with her mellifluous voice. Upon Gandhiji’s insistence, she recorded his favourite Meera bhajan ‘Hari Tum Haro’ overnight and sent it to him on his birthday in 1947.

 

She was the first musician to be awarded Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour. She was also the first Indian musician to have performed at the United Nations General Assembly and the first Indian musician to be conferred with the Ramon Magsaysay award for public service.

 

She was called the ‘Nightingale of India’ by Sarojini Naidu and “Tapaswini” by Lata Mangeshkar, while Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan described her as “Suswaralakshmi Subbulakshmi. Apart from UN, she performed at the Edinburg International Festival and for Queen Elizabeth-II at the Royal Albert Hall, London. She mostly sang in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Meera Bhajans in Hindi.

 

For many decades now, it has been a common practice in most South Indian homes for people to wake up in the morning to the strains of M S Subbulakshmi’s rendition of Bhaja Govindam, the popular devotional composition written by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, Vishnu Sahasranaamam and Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam, among others. Her Venkateswara Suprabhatham is played in Tirumala temple daily as part of the ritual.

 

She also made a huge contribution to popularizing Annanmacharya Kritis.

 

She also undertook more than 200 charity concerts and donated the royalties she had earned on devotional albums to the Tirumala temple. 

 

I deem it a great honour to have inaugurated the exhibition on the iconic M.S. Subbulakshmi, who lives through her immortal legacy of music.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that a national effort is needed to further strengthening country’s democratic foundations. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book ‘Loktantra ke utsav ki ankahi kahani’ authored by Dr. S.Y.Quraishi, here today. The Chief Election Commissioner, Shri A.K. Joti and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President underscrored the need for people to vote for candidates based on the four positive Cs – ‘Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct’ and not on the basis of three negative Cs – ‘Caste, Community and Cash’. He further said that there should be a debate on electoral reforms that can transform India into a more vibrant democracy. We must make our political democracy a social democracy, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“On this International Day of Democracy, let me extend my warmest greetings and good wishes to all of you and all the people of India who are shaping the largest democracy of the world.

I am also very happy to release, on this occasion, Loktantra ke utsav ki ankahi kahani,the Hindi version of Shri S.Y. Khuraishiji’s book “An undocumented wonder: The making of the great Indian Election”.

It is a very lucid account of the extraordinary manner in which elections are conducted in our country. The Election Commission of India has rightfully gained worldwide appreciation for its extremely professional conduct of elections in a complex and vast country like India.

The author has shared his insights and experiences in a gripping narrative that captures the challenges and achievements of election management. It is a book that can provide valuable guidance to those conducting elections as well as enhance general awareness about the systematic and systemic way in which the Election Commission of India addresses all the key challenges. It also reflects the agility and responsiveness of the Commission that keeps innovating to respond to new challenges.Transparency and accountability are the hallmarks of a functioning democracy. The proposal to introduce Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trial (VVPAT) in all polling booths from 2019 elections is another step in the direction of strengthening our democracy, which has to be nurtured and preserved by constantly reforming the electoral system.

I compliment Dr S Y Quraishi ji on this excellent publication and the National Book Trust for bringing out the Hindi translation. I wish and hope that the National Book Trust will make this book available in all other Indian languages so that the information and ideas contained in this book reach a wider public.

Conducting elections well is an important and integral part of democracy. Each citizen must be able to vote for the candidate and the party she or he likes without any fear of intimidation. Nor should there be any inducement. Each individual is important in a democracy and each vote is important. In a robust democracy, the voice of the people is heard and the choice of the people is respected. The transfer of power takes place peacefully based on the popular mandate.

Brothers and Sisters, we should be proud of the fact that we are not only the largest democracy in the world but also that we are constantly striving to make it more meaningful. We gave universal franchise right from the time we became independent and decided to adopt a democratic form of government. As compared to many fledgling democracies, we have been able to hold elections to the national Parliament and State Assemblies as well as to the local bodies fairly regularly.

However, a little critical introspection and honest review of the past and current electoral processes makes us realize how much we all collectively need to do to improve the system. Clearly, there are a number of areas in which we have to bring about changes.

On this International Day of Democracy, my thoughts turn to the quality of our polity. How well are we nurturing and nourishing this plant of democracy sown with great expectations by the founding fathers of our constitution?Are we living up to those ideals? Are our thoughts and actions breathing life into the constitution we gave ourselves in 1950?

India has  committed to the United Nations Charter that aims to build a world on the values of ‘peace’, ‘justice’, ‘respect’, human rights’, and ‘tolerance ’and ‘solidarity’.

India’s glorious cultural heritage is also dotted with a number of thought leaders who have eloquently espoused these values for over a million years. The village republics and the Bhikshu Sanghas of ancient India, as Dr.B.R.Ambedkar points out, functioned on democratic principles.

The essence of all religions is the quest for peace and harmony. A few days ago, we commemorated the 125thanniversary of Swami Vivekananda’shistoric speech at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago.  In that speech, Swami Vivekananda touched upon the essence of Hinduism as “a religion which will have no place for persecution or intolerance in its polity, which will recognize divinity in every man and woman.”

Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had forewarned against the temptation to break up our world into fragments by erecting narrow domestic walls. But we are still grappling with the divisions based on caste, creed, religion, sex and language. It is, however, heartening that the youth of our country is aspiring to see a new India where these distinctions become irrelevant. We are trying to create a new India wherekey democratic principles are actively practiced in daily life.

The India we want is a democratic, developed, inclusive, peaceful, harmonious India that celebrates diversity and plurality not merely tolerates them.

I want each citizen of our country to strive continuously through thought and action to transform our country into a vibrant democracy. A democracy in which leaders should be elected on the basis of character, calibre, capacity and conduct and voters should choose the candidates who have discipline, dynamism, dedication and devotion. Politics of caste, community and cash should be totally rejected.

Elections are the touchstone for a democracy. The regularity and the fairness of elections is an indication of the health of any democracy. Elections are an expression of individual freedom and potentially give each Indian a sense of participation in the governance of the country.

We must deepen this bond between people and leaders through a respectful responsiveness to public opinion. We must enhance the trust and confidence in the citizens that the political executive will deliver on the promises made during election campaigns.

All this requires a rethinking about our electoral processes. I would suggest that we, as a nation,should engage in this collective reflection and ponder over five aspects I wish to outline.

First,I feel the time has come to take a serious look at the possibility of conductingsimultaneous elections for the parliament and various Assemblies. The current practice of conducting elections in one State or the other at different times tends to focus the attention of the country away from development and slows down progress.

As the former President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee had stated:

“Throughout the year, some election or the other is happening and regular work comes to a standstill with the code of conduct being implemented. The time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after Independence when elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously.It is for the Election Commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties.”

Second, if the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments have to be implemented in letter and spirit, we should ensure that elections to local bodies should be held every five years. Ours is a three tiered democratic polity and we must strengthen democracy at the Union, State and local body levels.

Third, I would suggest that we should have a time limit to dispose of election petitions. If necessary, special election tribunals must be set up for disposing of election petitions.

The fourth aspect and perhaps the most important of all is the need to curb the influence of money power in elections to set a truly level playing field. Various solutions have to be thought of including State-funding. In addition, the new trend of paid news has to be completely eliminated.

The fifth aspect is an imperative need for revisiting the Anti-Defection law. We must examine as to what extent it has served its purpose. If needed, it has be amended further and made more stringent.

We are at the cross roads of our country’s history. The citizens, especially the youth, are looking for a future that guarantees them the freedom to grow, to contribute to and be a part of the new India’s growth story. The country is looking for a new paradigm in governance that focuses on achieving tangible development outcomes. The direction set by the government seeks to make a collective effort to transform the development trajectory encapsulated in the overarching principle of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. As Dr. B.R.Ambedkar in his closing speech of the first Constituent Assembly said: 

“If we wish to maintain democracy not only in form but also in fact, what must we do? We must make our political democracy a social democracy. It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life”.

Free and fair election process is the foundation for a political democracy. The ultimate purpose of democratic governance is social democracy, to ensure inclusive development and improvement in the quality of life of all citizens; especially those who are the poorest of the poor and those who have been left out of the democratic processes.

I do hope the book will stimulate further thoughts and action. Inspired by the Prime Minister’s mantra of “reform, perform, transform” as the guiding principles, the people and their elected representatives have the ability to transform our largest democracy into a more lively democracy that welcomes people’s participation in all spheres of nation building.Let us accelerate this process by moving from precept to practice and collectively shape the India we all want.”

The Vice President of India and the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the population control, poverty alleviation and environmental protection are the key issues to the development of any country. He was addressing the Delegation of Asian Population and Development Association, consisting of Parliamentarians from 15 countries, four sitting MPs, one former MP and two MLAs from India, who called on him, here today. The Deputy Chairperson of Rajya Sabha, Dr. P.J. Kurien and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the fruits of development should reach the poorest of the poor. He further said that active participation of Legislators is also very important in this regard. 

The Vice President while reiterating India’s stand on 2030 Agenda, said that Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) mirror India’s own vision of development and the centrality and overarching objective of poverty eradication in the new Agenda is something India consider extremely important. India’s premier think tank National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog is leading the efforts to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the SDGs, he added. 

The Vice President said that India is finalizing a set of national indicator framework to monitor the domestic achievement of SGDs, and is also engaged in the UN process to evolve a framework of global indicators to monitor the achievements of SDGs. He further said that India submitted its Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the High-Level Political Forum in New York in July 2017. India outlined various initiatives and programmes that are currently being implemented by the Government in this regard, he added. 

The Vice President said that India welcome all countries which are expected to take measurable actions to implement the 2030 Agenda. He further said that Global partnership is a key to the achievement of goals and targets contained in the Agenda. India appreciate that this has been recognized upfront in the document with a standalone goal on financial, technical and systemic support required for developing countries, he added. 

Parliamentarians from 15 countries who are part of the Delegation have commended the pioneering role India played in the process of 2030 Agenda, and said that sustainable efforts will lead to the success of the implementation of this Agenda. 

The Delegation after elaborate discussion on the issues has submitted the Delhi Declaration to the Chairman, Rajya Sabha.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that people in the country, particularly the younger generation to be fully acquainted with the roots of Indian culture, ethos and history. He was addressing the gathering after releasing a documentary film ‘Kumbh’ based on Kumbh Mela produced by India Inspires Foundation in association with the Indus University, here today.

The Vice President said that knowledge, understanding and history about the country to most people were known through the perspective of foreign writers. He further said that Kumbh Mela illustrates that India is the spiritual capital of the world and it is an event where great spiritual integration of people takes place. Unfortunately, over the past many years the projection of Kumbh Mela was not positive and accurate, he pointed. There was a great need for comprehensive information from an authenticated Indian viewpoint about the origin, history, significance of the Kumbh Mela, he added.

Describing Kumbh Mela as a glowing symbol of India’s rich spiritual heritage, the Vice President said that it is the world’s biggest gathering of pilgrims at any one event. He further said that millions from across India and abroad gather to purify themselves of their past sins and seek salvation. It is believed that a dip in the holy waters cleanses the mind and body of the past sins and paves the way for Moksha, he added.

The Vice President said that culture and religion were not the same. “When we talk of culture, we are not talking of religion. Culture is a way of living while religion is a way of worship”, he added.

The Vice President complimented the makers of the Kumbh Mela documentary, and said there was a need to go back to Indian roots, culture, heritage and values for harmonious living of the people. He further said that the film showcases the origin of Kumbh Mela and how it became a torch-bearer of Sanatana Dharma. It seeks to provide an understanding of the tradition of saints and sages of India, among others, he added.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that every city in the country should become Smart City and we must put efforts in that direction. He was addressing the gathering after performing Bhoomi Poojan for the Ranchi Smart City, in Ranchi, Jharkhand today. He also laid foundation stone for Urban Civic Tower, Convention Centre and Jharkhand Urban Planning and Management Institute in the Campus of Ranchi Smart City Area. The Governor of Jharkhand, Smt. Droupadi Murmu, the Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shri Raghubar Das, the Minister for Urban Development and Housing Department, Government of Jharkhand, Shri C.P. Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the state of Jharkhand is adorned with natural beauty and forty percent of India's mineral wealth is in the state. He further said that mineral resources of Jharkhand should be used for public welfare, especially for the person standing last in the line. For the success of the Smart City transparency and order in the system is also required, he added. 

The Vice President said that the Smart City means beautiful, where all types of facilities are available to the citizens. He further said that electricity, drinking water, better education, medical and transportation facilities are available. For the smart city, the role of public representatives and general public with the government is crucial and together, all should contribute for the formulation of this. 

The Vice President said that there is no place for violence in democracy and those who commit violence should never be encouraged. The security of each person is very important and peace needed for the development, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""Friends, I am extremely delighted to lay the foundation stone of Ranchi Smart City. 

A total of 90 cities have been selected for smart cities in the entire country and Ranchi in Jharkhand became the first city in the country where Bhoomi Poojan Program for building smart city is concluded, in the coming days Ranchi will become an inspirational city in the country. Selection of Ranchi is not merely selected as I was Urban Development Minister, but Ranchi has all those points which were necessary for the selection of a Smart City. All citizens of the state should discharge their responsibility for the construction of this smart city and decide your role in the task. The people will participate in the programme if the government is transparent, accountable and trustworthy. 

No plan can be successful without the participation of the people. Smart City project is given to Ranchi with the efforts of citizens of Ranchi. Ranchi will be the country's first Green Field Smart City. This city will be an inspiration for entire Jharkhand. 

Jharkhand is having 40% of country's minerals, abundant natural resources and a visionary Chief Minister. Just make the people of the state smart and take advantage of this opportunity to ensure their participation. 

If the world is moving then why should we stay behind? It is necessary for the country that all the cities of India are smart and this is also the goal of our Prime Minister. People need to change their thinking. People think that what will happen if we become a smart city, they come out from such a thinking. The smart city will work for the state as a light house and help people to move in the right direction, as in the ocean the light house indicates the ships the correct path. 

If Smart City is there, then there will be other necessary facilities, including better health, education, basic amenities. The Center and the State Government are providing 500-500 crore rupees for the construction of Smart City, but all of us have to dedicate ourselves to the resources to build it. 

Smart City means beautiful city, where all facilities are available for citizens. Facilities like electricity, drinking water, education, medical, transportation etc. It will be a success only when we work with transparency and accountability. Jharkhand has to give a message to the whole country by completing the Ranchi Smart City in time. 

When I was the Minister of Rural Development in the then Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Government, he thought of strengthening the National Highway, which was also opposed why tax payers money is spent for the road construction. But Shri Vajpayee created the four National Highways and facilitated the movement of people, everyone accepted it and welcomed the change. Later I told Shri Vajpayee the plan to build roads in the village, it was also opposed. But the Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojana was launched by showing his zeal for the development of the village and went on joining the village to the city. It is necessary to understand that we need to change with time. Center, state government, panchayat and general public all should discharge their responsibilities. 

State will develop as long as the law and order in the state is normal. The theory and ideology are different. Those who oppose should convince the people with their ideology and come out through elections and become Chief Minister, Prime Minister and People Representatives. It will be acceptable to all but it is not your right to do this with the gun. The Vice President said that violence has diminished in Jharkhand to a large extent. Human rights activists raise voice only when the Maoists are killed, but they should also raise their voice when a Policeman martyrs. Those who commit violence should not get encouragement.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that literacy provides the first essential step towards building a participative, vibrant, and a more inclusive democracy. He was addressing an event organised on the occasion of International Literacy Day, here today. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javdekar, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development and Water Resoources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr. Satyapal Singh, the Secretary, Department of School Education & Literacy, Shri Anil Swarup and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President Said that the Literacy Day reminds us of the importance of literacy in the development architecture of all countries and its crucial, central role as a development accelerator. He further said that literacy helps individuals to access and exercise various rights and entitlements provided to them under the Constitution. Literacy a  stepping stone for all forms of formal learning as well as lifelong education, literacy enables individuals to access and avail economic, political and social benefits, he added.


 The Vice President suggested ways to achieve universal literacy; firstly to improve the quality of pre-primary and school education; secondly, we must provide opportunities for learning to those who have never been to school or have dropped out of school.




 The Vice President said that Neo-literates, majority of who are women, will be the ambassadors of our programme leading towards making Saakshar Bharat a Saksham Bharat. He further said that we must use technology to make the literacy programmes more effective. Digital learning materials can address the diverse learning needs of different age groups more effectively, he added.



 The Vice President said that literacy learning can be made more meaningful if it is linked to the daily lives of the learners. He further said that community learning centres can become the hubs of literacy learning and community empowerment. Let us create a new India built on the strengthened base of a literate, educated, empowered population, he added.



 Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""I am extremely happy to be with all of you in the national celebration of the 51st International Literacy Day.

Today is a very special day dedicated to literacy that has been celebrated world over ever since UNESO accepted the recommendation of the World Congress of Ministers of Education held at Tehran in 1965.

This day reminds us of the importance of literacy in the development architecture of all countries and its crucial, central role as a development accelerator. It is a day when we recollect our freedom struggle and the words of Mahatma Gandhi who had said that mass illiteracy is a sin and shame which must be liquidated. It is a day when we reflect on our progress over the last 70 years, as Pandit Nehru so eloquently put it on the midnight of 15th August 1947, “to bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman”.

As we take stock of what we have achieved over the years, we can look back with pride at the many milestones we have crossed in our journey. Only 18 percent of our population could read and write in 1947. Today, nearly 74 percent of our population have acquired the basic literacy skills. Over 95 percent of children are in school and nearly 86 percent of young people are functionally literate.  It is not a small achievement. However, we have to draw inspiration from our past successes and move forward in the years to come.

We certainly have a long way to go. We cannot ignore the fact that today nearly 35 crore youth and adults are outside the literate world and therefore are unable to participate effectively in contemporary India’s development and growth. Add to this about 40 percent of our school children are not acquiring the basic literacy skills proficiently enough even after completing the cycle of elementary education. We have a formidable challenge that needs to be recognized and systematically addressed.

Today provides an opportunity for us to celebrate our collective achievements. It is an inspiring saga of untiring efforts.  Many individuals and institutions have contributed to this national effort. The enlightened rulers of Travancore and Baroda expanded education opportunities. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Welthy Fisher and Laubach set up Literacy House in Lucknow in 1953. There were active campaigns for adult literacy like Grama Shikshana Mohim in 1959. Excellent momentum was generated through the 1990s by the Government of India’s National Literacy Mission. Thanks to these efforts, nearly three fourths of our population today can read and write.

However, the challenge still remains and acquires a sense of urgency in the current Indian and global context. The government believes, as Prime Minister Modiji reiterated at the BRICS conference in Xiamen, China on 5thof September, 2017: “The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”- that is : Collective effort, inclusive growth”. The country is also embarking on a faster development trajectory to shape a new India in the next five years. Globally, we have committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all nations at the United Nations in January 2016. The global agenda envisages a “world with universal literacy” and one of the targets set in the agenda, to be achieved by 2030, is specifically focused on youth and adult literacy.

Target 4.6 of the Sustainable Development Goals is as follows:

“By 2030, ensure that all youth and substantial proportion of adults both men and women achieve literacy and numeracy”.

If we have to move at a faster pace and achieve a literate world by 2030 and India has to ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults acquire these skills, we may have to review our past strategies and after an assessment of what has worked and what has not, learn from successful examples from within our country and outside. We may have to chalk out new ways to reach out to those learners who have not been reached till now.

Clearly, this has to be a collective effort with the government leading the process but with the active involvement of civil society and the private sector.

It has to be a societal mission with a clearer understanding of the catalytic role literacy can play in shaping a new India.

I recall the words of a famous Telugu poet Gurajada Apparao who had said: ""Deshamante Matti Kaadoy, Deshamante Manushuloi” (Country is not the land under our feet but it is the people who live on the land). It is the quality of life of the people which characterizes a country. It is the equality that determines how the fruits of development are shared. We have a commitment to inclusive growth. We consciously adopt the ‘antyodaya’ approach to reach out to the poorest of the poor. We design programmes that don’t leave any one behind. Against this backdrop and underlying guiding principle of ‘Sabka Vikas’, it is obvious that literacy provides the first essential step towards building a participative, vibrant, and a more inclusive democracy. 

Literacy helps individuals to access and exercise various rights and entitlements provided to them under the Constitution. It is seen that problems like poverty, infant mortality, population growth, gender inequality are better resolved by a literate society.  Besides being the stepping stone for all forms of formal learning as well as lifelong education, literacy enables individuals to access and avail economic, political and social benefits.

In the Indian context, literacy can play an important role of empowering, transforming and improving quality of life of individuals as well as society, especially women and those belonging to disadvantaged groups of society.

We should continue to strive to achieve universal literacy through the two pronged approach we have been following earlier. First, we must improve the quality of pre-primary and school education to ensure that all children graduating from school have the necessary literacy skills. Second, we must provide opportunities for learning to those who have never been to school or have dropped out of school and those young people and adults who need to acquire basic skills to expand their livelihood opportunities. 

Keeping in view the importance of literacy in the individual’s life and society as a whole, the Government of India have adopted Saakshar Bharat and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan as key programme instruments which are being  implemented in the country. The Saakshar Programme is primarily focused on promotion of literacy in rural areas of low female literacy districts and this has also helped in establishment of an institutional framework for promotion of adult education centres right up to the Gram Panchayat level.  I am glad that the focus has been on female literacy because of its potential multiplier effect on societal development as a whole leading to better health outcomes and nutritional status.

It is indeed heartening to note that every year more than one crore adult learners appear in the bi-annual Learners Assessment Tests held across the country and that  around 6.66 crore learners  have successfully passed the Assessment Test conducted by National Institute of Open Schooling up to March 2017, of which about 70 per cent are women. I firmly believe that these neo-literates, majority of who are women, will be the ambassadors of our programme leading towards making Saakshar Bharat a Saksham Bharat.

I am happy to learn that National Literacy Mission Authority (NLMA) is not only engaged in imparting basic literacy to the adult learners but has also ventured to forge convergence and partnerships with various agencies to link literacy with other dimensions of socio-economic development like electoral, financial and legal literacy, primarily amongst rural women. I am told that under financial literacy, a special drive was undertaken in Saakshar Bharat Districts to mobilize more than one crore Saakshar Bharat learners to open and operate their bank accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. NLMA also participated in Suraksha Bandhan drive for Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. NLMA’s state partners such as State Literacy Mission Authorities (SLMAs), State Resource Centres and Jan Shiksha Sansthans successfully motivated over one crore beneficiaries to avail benefits of this scheme.

I have been informed that apart from these initiatives, NLMA has also taken proactive initiative for alignment of Saakshar Bharat with Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) in achieving cent percent literacy in respective Gram Panchayats. Large number of Members of Parliament, who had visited the Saansad Adarsh Grams adopted in Saakshar Bharat Districts reportedly, had the opportunity to appreciate these efforts and give guidance to these activities. Concerted efforts in Saansad Adarsh Grams have yielded good results and hopefully such efforts would be gradually extended to cover other Gram Panchayats.

Literacy programmes can add significant value if they can be creatively linked to the ongoing initiatives of the government like Swachh Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, PM Suraksha Bima Yojana, PM Ujjawala Yojana, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Digital India Mission and Skill India Mission.

Significant achievement in terms of literacy rates as reflected in Census data over the decade is primarily on account of expansion of elementary education supplemented with implementation of a series of adult education programmes especially Saakshar Bharat. In addition, enforcement of RTE Act, for all children has also helped in reducing the pool of adult illiterate population. However, despite all these significant policy interventions, India continues to have a large population of illiterates. We are home to one third of the total illiterate population of the world.

I think it is an opportune time for all of us to undertake a comprehensive review of the programme/ activities undertaken and to identify the critical areas which still need to be addressed.

I am happy to learn that Human Resource Development Ministry has decided to redesign the Saakshar Bharat programme to make it more focused and to ensure that all children, youth and adults acquire the literacy and numeracy skills required for more effective functioning by 2022. I am equally happy to learn that in the new variant of the Saakshar Bharat Programme, the school/college students are likely to be involved, for teaching their illiterate parents, grandparents and their neighbours.

We must use technology to make the literacy programmes more effective. Digital learning materials can address the diverse learning needs of different age groups more effectively. Literacy learning can be made more meaningful if it is linked to the daily lives of the learners. Community learning centres can become the hubs of literacy learning and community empowerment.

 I am glad to note that India is a part of the UNESCO-led initiative called the ‘Global Alliance for Literacy within the Framework of Lifelong Learning’.  India can take a lead in contributing to this global effort to transform the literacy landscape of the world in the next 15 years.

 Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate all those who have received the Saakshar Bharat Awards for their outstanding contribution in the field of adult literacy.  The good work done by the awardees can be an inspiration for others to carry forward the programme in other Gram Panchayats, Districts and States. I take this opportunity to call upon all stakeholders, including State Governments, Civil Society Organizations, NGOs, Corporate Bodies, the intelligentsia and my fellow citizens to join hands in transforming India to a fully literate society. I would also like to exhort all the stakeholders and beneficiaries in the field of literacy to fulfil the vision of Mahatma Gandhi and the founding fathers of our constitution. Let us create a new India built on the strengthened base of a literate, educated, empowered population. Let us realize that heaven of freedom dreamt of by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore: “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free; where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls”.

Jai Hind""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we need teachers who have the required competence, confidence and commitment to make a difference to the educational landscape of our country. He was addressing the gathering after giving away the National Award to Teachers – 2016, here today. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar, the Ministers of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha, Dr. Satya Pal Singh, the Secretary, Department of School Education & Literacy, Shri Anil Swarup and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that today, on Teachers' Day, we reverentially remember first Vice President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan a great teacher, an intellectual giant and an eloquent exponent of Hindu thought, on his birth anniversary. He congratulated all teachers who were receiving National Award to Teachers - 2016. He further said that he appreciate the work of numerous unsung heroes in classrooms of our country. The ‘real education’ to foster all round development of students is what should aim for and there should be holistic development of students with equal emphasis on academic excellence and skills for self-employment or gainful employment, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the teachers, are the ‘Bharata Bhagya Vidhatas’ (shapers of India’s development) and they are dedicating their time and energy to shape individuals for creating New India. He further said that the teachers have a formidable responsibility for India to achieve 100 per cent literacy in next five years. India was once known as “Vishwa Guru” with people from across the globe flocking to our ancient seats of learning like Nalanda and Takshashila, he added.  

 

The Vice President said that India’s value system, culture and heritage should be accorded due importance in the syllabus. Today all teachers must pledge to transform classrooms into hubs of joyful learning and raise the education system to a much higher level, he advised.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to be present amongst you today on the occasion of Teachers' Day, a day when the nation celebrates the extraordinary contribution teachers are making to national development, a day when we reverentially remember on his birth anniversary, the first Vice President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a great teacher, an intellectual giant and an eloquent exponent of Hindu philosophy.

I am extremely delighted to share with you some thoughts against the backdrop of the cultural and educational heritage of our ancient land.

Indian education development is intertwined with the freedom movement and reflects the deep commitment of our founding fathers to providing universal access to good quality education. To name only a few, Gandhiji, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Dr B.R.Amebdkar, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Dr. Zakir Husain have clearly emphasised education as the most crucial foundation for national development.

In fact, today is a day to recall with pride the rich cultural and intellectual heritage we have collectively inherited. Ours is a country that has given a central place to teachers and given them the appellation of ‘gurus’, a Sanskrit word that connotes ‘a source of illumination’.  In fact, the respect and veneration a teacher receives in our culture is well depicted in the lines:

“Gurur Brahmaa,  Gurur Vishnuh, Gurur Devo Maheshwarah Guru Saakshaat Parabrahma Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah— ‘Guru is like Brahma the Creator initiating us into learning,  Vishnu the Preserver nurturing our talents and Maheshwara the Destroyer dispelling doubts and negative thoughts.  Guru is the Supreme God and my salutation to such a Guru’.

 We are the inheritors of the system of gurukulas where the teachers and the students lived together and pursued studies in a caring environment, the system of educational inquiry that was based on a constant dialogue between the teacher and students and the concept of ‘Vidya’ as a process of discovery.

You are all blessed to have the unique opportunity to shape the destiny of our nation in your classrooms every day and every minute through your interaction with students. Through your knowledge, skills and attitude, you are determining the course of India’s future.

It is an onerous task. It is a challenging task. And when it is well done, it is the most satisfying task. You, teachers, are all, in my view, the ‘Bharata Bhagya Vidhatas’(shapers of India’s development) who are tirelessly dedicating their time and energy to shape individuals who will in turn be creating the New India we are all dreaming of. Shaping the character of the young and impressionable minds through your words and deeds should be accorded the highest priority by the teaching community. “Literary education is of no value, if it is not able to build up a sound character”, said Mahatma Gandhi.

We, in India, have come a long way after we made the tryst with destiny to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity. Today, 95 percent of children are in schools and we have more universities and institutions of excellence than we had in 1947.

Nearly 70 lakh teachers are teaching 20 crore children in 15 lakh elementary schools across the country. The literacy rate has been steadily improving from a mere 18 percent in 1947 to nearly 80 percent at present.

The foreign rulers never bothered to teach us, educate us, because they are not interested in the future of our country. The literacy rate is now steadily improving, and it should improve further. I hope that government will take all necessary steps that no children is out of school, that should be mission of the government, that should be the duty of all the people. This is not only the duty of teacher alone. It is the duty of all enlightened citizens, the parents, the public representatives and everybody should get involved into this and see to it that we achieve 100 per cent literacy.

It is needless to say that teachers have a formidable responsibility if India has to achieve 100 per cent literacy over the next five years.

But there is still a long way to go and it should be a matter of concern that the learning outcomes of students have shown an overall decline in the recent years as reflected in the National Achievement Surveys. The academic standards in institutions of higher learning by and large need considerably improvement.

One of the most important issues facing school education today is the need to improve quality in education and learning. It is admirable that enormous strides towards establishing schools within the reach of every habitation have been achieved.

The Right to Education Act has strengthened the resolve and lent a supporting hand to the continuous efforts of bringing each and every child to school. However, children who have dropped out of school need special attention and careful planning to bring them back to school and here, teachers need to be sensitive to their needs. But the onus of bringing children to school lies not just on teachers but collectively with the community and parents also who should work actively with schools. 

Today, we felicitate teachers for their contribution towards education and their achievements by honouring them with the national awards in recognition of their commendable and exceptional contribution to the noble cause of teaching. I am sure there are many more teachers who are not here but have been doing excellent work.

I congratulate all of you who are receiving the awards today and I also sincerely appreciate the work of numerous unsung heroes in the classrooms of our country.

Today, I read an article written by a serving IPS Officer from Talangana, Dr. P.S. Praveen Kumar, and he writes that ‘we live because of teachers’, and further says ‘good teachers are now an endangered species’.  Honestly, whatever I am today because of teachers. They way I speak, read, dress and work are deeply influenced by my teachers, Mr. Praveen Kumar wrote. In all the skills they have taught have helped me to navigate, to preach the values of life. Great teachers live through us, beyond us, and we live because of them. They are immortal, he said.

People should be judged, should be selected, should be elected, should be elected on the basis of character, calibre, capacity and conduct, discipline, dynamism, dedication, devotion.

As per a 1996 Report to UNESCO of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first century, there are four pillars of learning:

Learning to know: to provide the cognitive tools required to better comprehend the world

Learning to do: to provide the skills that would enable individuals to effectively participate in the global economy and society.

Learning to be: to provide self analytical and social skills to enable individuals to develop to their fullest potential for a all-round complete person.

Learning to live together: to expose individuals to the values implicit within human rights, democratic principles, intercultural understanding and respect and peace at all levels of society and human relationships to enable individuals and societies to live in peace and harmony.

Today, the entire world is facing the problem of terrorism. Terrorism of the enemy of the nation. We must teach our children from the beginning. Terrorism of any kind, it has no religion, it has no region, it is a menace to the humanity. And all our minds should be developed in such a way they should be put down with an iron hand. All countries are now realizing the difficulty. BRICS leaders have collectively condemned the terrorism.

We must also make the children to understand and behave that they are all one. Irrespective of caste, creed, sex, religion and region, India is one. One nation, one country, one people. You may be having different languages. You may be speaking different languages. You may dress differently, belief in different religions; religion is a way of worship. We need not bother about it, it is left to the individuals. What we need to focus is on culture. Culture is a way of life. We must focus on teaching the mother tongue.

Many successful teachers, of which you are shining examples, have transformed schools into places of joyful learning through their knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Dr. Radhakrishnan had said: “Teachers should be the best minds in the country”. Good teachers are good learners. They keep learning new things all the time and acquiring knowledge from different sources.

In addition to sound knowledge, teachers should have the skills to communicate that knowledge effectively to the students. They should have the ability to stimulate the curiosity, open up opportunities for dialogue in the classrooms and encourage the children to discover, think and express.  They should creatively link classroom learning with the learners’ lives. In recent times, technology has become inexpensive and all pervasive.

It is heartening to note that 44 percent of rural secondary schools in India have computers. Technology can be a very powerful tool for assisting the teachers. Many teachers are using these tools effectively. Some of them are creating ‘Apps’ as well. We must encourage these innovations that enrich the learning process.

Excellent teachers who leave an indelible impression on the students have been the role models exemplifying through their attitudes and behaviour, the values and behaviour they wish to impart in the children.

It is said that values are caught. They cannot be taught. Ideal behaviour is important than ideology. Children learn to be kind, compassionate if the teachers are kind and compassionate. The students will learn the value of patience, tolerance and democratic functioning in a class where the teacher embodies these values and where her/his actions in the classroom reflect these values.

The teachers have to hone their skills to develop among children critical, creative, and reflective and problem solving abilities.  In fact, this is the most crucial aspect of a teacher’s work.

As has been said:

“The mediocre teacher tells;

The good teacher explains;

The superior teacher demonstrates;

The great teacher inspires.”

What we need today are more and more great teachers. We need inspirational, transformational leaders in our classrooms.

It is not merely the grand building that makes a school good but the dedication and commitment of teachers that makes it great.

In this context, I would like to recall the words of Swami Vivekananda, who said ‘If you are not pure and you know all the sciences of the world. That will not help you at all, you may be buried in all books you read, but that will not be of much use. It is the heart that reaches the goal. Follow the heart. A pure heart sees beyond the intellect, it gets inspired”.  The teacher who loves the children from her/his heart is the real nation builder, who can lay the solid foundation of a nation committed to growth and development.

We need more child-friendly schools with caring, inspired and inspiring teachers.

Good quality pre-primary education and elementary education are the essential building blocks for building a developed India. In a country with such a high commitment to knowledge and education, we cannot allow poor quality education to persist. As Sri MC Chagla, the then Education Minister of India said in 1964: “Our Constitution fathers did not intend that we just set up hovels, put students there, give untrained teachers, give them bad textbooks, no playgrounds, and say, we have complied with Article 45 and primary education is expanding... They meant that real education should be given to our children between the ages of 6 and 14”.

The ‘real education’ to foster all round development of students is what should aim for. There should be holistic development of students with equal emphasis on academic excellence and skills for self-employment or gainful employment.

India’s value system, culture and heritage should be accorded due importance in the syllabus. Also physical training, crafts, sports, NCC training, music and even subjects like gardening should be part of the curricula for a well-rounded development of the student. Health of the students is very important. A healthy nation can become a wealthy nation, but a wealthy nation may not become a healthy nation.

India was once known as “Vishwa Guru” with all those seeking knowledge from across the globe flocking to our ancient seats of learning like Nalanda and Takshashila Universities and scholars like Friedrich Max Müller admiring it in the following words:

“If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most full developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant—I should point to India.”

However, following various invasions and colonisation, India lost its pre-eminent position. Now the time has come for India to regain its position as a “Vishwa Guru”, the centre of educational excellence. This can happen if we can create and strengthen our own system by drawing inspiration from the best examples from around the world like the ancient sages had suggested: “Aano Bhadrah Kratavo Yantu Vishvathah” meaning “Let noble thoughts come to us from all over the world”.

The teachers must take this as a sacred mission, a mission that aims to see that all children acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes that are required for a twenty-first century citizen.

We need more teachers who can build in our children a commitment to the values of democracy, equality, freedom, justice, secularism, concern for others well being, respect for human dignity and human rights. Children should be made aware of our rich heritage and the glorious history.

I congratulate all the awardees, whose commendable professional dedication has been recognised through this award.

I call upon all teachers at all levels in the country, in the pre-primary centres, elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities to rededicate themselves and pledge that they will transform the classrooms into hubs of joyful learning and raise the entire education system to a much higher level than what exists today.

I am sure the Government will ensure that the education system is considerably strengthened in terms of infrastructure and a congenial work environment where quality of learning becomes central.

I hope there will be a new impetus to make human development, quality education and lifelong learning as cornerstones in the development architecture of a new India.

We cannot rest on the past laurels. Nor can we be satisfied with a few islands of excellence. We need a system that responds effectively to the learning needs of all children, youth and adults and keeps constantly innovating.

We need teachers who have the required competence, confidence and commitment to make a difference to the educational landscape of our country. They must work in collaboration with the community members and parents to enrol all children in each habitation like teachers have been doing in some states like Gujarat, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

The entire educational system including the teachers should internalize the message of ‘Reform, Perform and Transform’ for India to once again become the knowledge hub of the world.

My greetings once again to all teachers across the country on this auspicious occasion and best wishes for a long exciting voyage of promoting learning in the years to come.

Jai Hind”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India is keen to see the conclusion of convention on the suppression of international terrorism, which is threatening world peace. He was addressing the 78th Session of International Institute of Law at NALSAR University of Law in Hyderabad, yesterday. The Governor of Telangana, Shri E S L Narasimhan, the Acting Chief Justice of High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad, Justice Ramesh Ranganathan, the Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali, the Minister for Law, Government of Telangana, Shri A. Indrakaran Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that several conventions resulted from the efforts exerted under the auspices of the United Nations. SAARC convention on the suppression of international terrorism as well as the Indian proposal to conclude a comprehensive convention on suppression of international terrorism is now under consideration of the UN, he added.

The Vice President said that India has put considerable effort in fighting international terrorism and terrorism is the biggest danger the world is facing today, for which there is no justification. He further said that India today is the one of the largest economies and has a young and educated work force. It represents a mature Parliamentary democracy with a highly independent judiciary and fourth estate, he added.

The Vice President said that holding the 78th Session of International Institute of Law in India will not only create greater awareness on the importance of international law but will also inspire young lawyers and students to specialize in this subject. The concept of the rule of law has been practiced in India from times immemorial, he pointed. He further said that the Sanskrit word Dharma broadly deals with righteousness, duty and law and it is derived from the root word denoting uphold, sustain, nourish and support. He also stated that the two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharatha epitomize how Dharma, embodied through righteousness and justice, forms the basis for triumph of good over evil and for protecting mankind. “Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah”, the Sanskrit sloka in Manu Smriti aptly sums up the basic Indian philosophy - the law will protect and defend those who protect and defend it, he added.

The Vice President said that India attaches huge importance to the implementation of international statutes and the rule of law and is a firm believer in promotion of peace and justice globally. He further said that India was among the countries which played a key role in the development of some of the important global conventions and also those formulated by the United Nations like the Law of Sea Convention. India has also made a significant contribution to the formation of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization to promote international law, he added.

The Vice President said that India is a signatory to many important international treaties, protocols and agreements include Convention on Biological Weapons, Convention on Chemical Weapons, Chicago Convention on International Aviation, Convention on Rights of Child, International Convention on Doping in Sport, Genocide Convention, the Statute of Hague Conference on Private International Law, Kyoto Protocol, Montreal Protocol, Nuclear Terrorism Convention and International Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.

The Vice President said that India played an active role in the UN and in the codification and progressive development of international law during the 60s. He further said that India’s foreign policy is based on sovereign equality of States, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with principles articulated in Article 33 of the United Nations. Our country attaches high importance to bilateral negotiations in settling its differences and disputes with other nations on the basis of international law, justice and equity, he added.

                Greetings to you all on the auspicious day of Vijayadashami.


Festivals in a way are the reflection of our social values and a learning for the society.

Each festival carries forward the tradition of showcasing our collective strength, to raise the sensitivity towards our social responsibilities and to keep on working tirelessly towards doing away with the social evils.

Our festivals are linked with the agriculture and harvesting, rivers and mountains, our history and our rich cultural traditions.

It has been thousands of years. But still the epics of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna have been a source of inspiration in our social milieu. They have been a source of awakening for us. After the auspicious period of Navaratri, today on Vijayadashami, we have the tradition of burning the effigy of Ravana. This is also a part of our great tradition. However, as a responsible citizen, it is our bounden duty to ward off the evil forces and the society has to keep the momentum on to raise the awareness in this regard.

Let me tell you, the festivals are not only about entertainment, there has to be purpose behind. We must take a resolve to do something positive for our country.  Can one imagine that Lord Rama leaves Ayodhya putting on the clothes stitched there and with his determination and resolve creates a huge collective strength and it paves the way for the involvement of every cross section of the society enroute to his victory in Sri Lanka. Men, monkeys, nature all joined him in his drive. It must be his magical power of putting hands together which saw Lord Ramchandra harnessing the collective strength. Even after his victory, he was humble and dedicated himself for the welfare of the people.

On this Vijayadashami, let us take a pledge that we would contribute something positively for our nation in the run up to 2022, when we celebrate 75th year of our Independence. Our Sankalp should be for the Siddhi as a citizen of a proud nation so that we make our own humble and positive contribution towards the nation by 2022. Let us resolve to create the nation of the dreams of our freedom fighters. And hence, we should undertake a resolve to contribute something positive for our nation like Lord Rama.

Many many greetings to you.

Once again, heartfelt greetings on Vijayadashami.

                आप सबको विजयादशमी के पावन पर्व पर बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं।

 



हमारे देश में उत्‍सव एक प्रकार से सामाजिक शिक्षा का माध्‍यम हैं। हमारे हर उत्‍सव के साथ समाज को सामूहिकता की ओर ले जाना, समाज के प्रति संवेदनशील बनाना, मूल्‍यों के प्रति अ‍हर्निश याद रखना, और‍ विकृतियों को मिटाने का निरन्‍तर प्रयास करते रहना; इसकी एक प्रशिक्षा के रूप में हमारे उत्‍सवों की परम्‍परा है। हमारे उत्‍सव खेत-खलिहान से भी जुड़े हुए हैं, हमारे उत्‍सव नदी-पर्वतों से जुड़े हुए हैं, हमारे उत्‍सव इतिहास से जुड़े हुए हैं, हमारे उत्‍सव सांस्‍कृतिक परम्‍पराओं से जुड़े हुए हैं।

हजारों साल हो गए लेकिन प्रभु राम, प्रभु कृष्‍ण- इनकी गाथाएं आज भी सामाजिक जीवन को चेतना देती रही हैं, प्रेरणा देती रही हैं। आज नवरात्रि के पावन पर्व के बाद विजयादशमी के पर्व पर रावण-दहन की परम्‍परा है। ये रावण-दहन उस परम्‍परा का हिस्‍सा है। लेकिन एक नागरिक के नाते समाजिक जीवन में ये जो रावण प्रबुद्धि होती है, उसको विनाश करने के लिए भी समाज ने निरन्तर जागृत प्रयास करने होते हैं।

और ऐसे उत्‍सव से सिर्फ मनोरंजन नहीं, कोई मकसद बनना चाहिए। ऐसे उत्सवों से कुछ कर गुजरने का संकल्‍प बनना चाहिए। कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता है कि अयोध्‍या से पहने हुए वस्‍त्र पहन करके निकले हुए राम पूरे रास्‍ते चलते-चलते संगठन शक्ति का इतना बड़ा कौशल्‍य बता देते हैं कि श्रीलंका विजय में समाज के हर तबके के व्‍यक्ति उनके साथ जुड़ गए। नर भी जुड़े, वानर भी जुड़े, प्रकृति ने भी उनका साथ दिया। लोक संग्रह की कितनी बड़ी अद्भुत शक्ति होगी, तब प्रभु रामचंद्र जी ने इतने बड़े सामर्थ्‍य को अपने साथ जोड़ा होगा। और विजय प्राप्‍त करने के बाद भी उसी नम्रता के साथ जन-समाज को अपने-आपको आहुत करने में लगे रहे।

ऐसे आज विजयादशमी के पर्व पर हम भी संकल्‍प करें कि 2022, जब भारत आजादी के 75 वर्ष मनाएगा; हम भी कोई संकल्‍प करें, हम भी कोई सिद्धि के लिए रास्‍ता चुनें और 2022 तक एक नागरिक के नाते देश को कुछ न कुछ सकारात्‍मक योगदान दें, कुछ न कुछ  contribution करें। हम 2022, आजादी के 75 साल को। महापुरुषों ने जिस सपनों से स्‍वतंत्रता दिलाई, उसके अनुरूप बना पाएंगे, और इसीलिए प्रभु रामजी की तरह हम भी कुछ संकल्‍प लेने का व्रत ले करके चलें, यही मेरी आप सबको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं। फिर एक बार आप सबको विजयादशमी की बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं।

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-second interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.  

The first twenty one meetings of PRAGATI have seen a cumulative review of 190 projects with a total investment of Rs. 8.94 lakh crore. Resolution of  Public Grievances has also been reviewed in 17 sectors.  

Today, in the twenty-second meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to the banking sector. The Prime Minister asked the Secretary, Financial Services, to look at ways to increase the use of RuPay debit cards that have been issued to Jan Dhan account holders. The Prime Minister was briefed on the relief that has been received by the Jan Dhan account holders, as part of the insurance provisions that are linked to these accounts.  

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of nine infrastructure projects in the railway, road, power, coal and gas pipeline sectors, spread over several states including Telangana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Delhi. The India Myanmar Friendship Bridge was also reviewed. These projects are cumulatively worth over 37000 crore rupees. 

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of the National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY), and the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan (Accessible India Campaign) for the Divyang. 

The Prime Minister said that while many Union Government departments are now using the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), only ten States have so far shown keenness in using it. The Prime Minister said that GeM increases the pace of procurement, and boosts transparency, besides supporting enterprise at the local level. He urged all Chief Secretaries to explore its use to the extent possible, to minimize leakages and delays.  

On GST, the Prime Minister said that while traders across the country are positive and are accepting this new taxation arrangement, they need handholding so that their problems can be resolved. He urged the Chief Secretaries to use the district administration in this regard, so that small traders are facilitated to access and adopt the new system. He reiterated that small businesses must register with the GST network, to take advantage of business opportunities. He said that the common man and the trader must benefit from this path breaking decision.  

The Prime Minister also called for sustained efforts to boost digital payments and work towards a less cash society.

                As part of their Valedictory Session as Assistant Secretaries, IAS officers of the 2015 batch today made presentations before the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.  

8 selected presentations on various themes of governance were made by the officers, on themes such as rapid response for accident victims, tracking individual carbon footprints, financial inclusion, improving rural incomes, data driven rural prosperity, heritage tourism, railway safety, and central armed police forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it was indeed significant that the junior-most and senior-most officers are spending such a lot of time communicating with each other. The Prime Minister said that the young officers must imbibe all the positives from these interactions. The Prime Minister asked young officers to focus on subjects such as GST implementation and boosting digital transactions, especially via the BHIM App. 

He urged all officers to speed up the adoption of Government e- Marketplace (GeM) in their respective departments. He said this would eliminate middlemen, and result in savings for the government. 

Giving examples of ODF targets and rural electrification, the Prime Minister urged the officers to work towards 100 per cent achievement of targets.  He urged the officers to work towards creating the India of the dreams of freedom fighters, by 2022. He said that officers who have risen from humble backgrounds, should meet young students, and motivate them. Communication leads to compassion, the Prime Minister added. 

He said that the key aim of officers today is the welfare of the nation and its citizens. He urged the officers work with team spirit, and make teams wherever they go.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today invited the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation – the ONGC – to take up a challenge, on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay’s birth anniversary. Addressing officers and staff of the ONGC at a function to mark the launch of the SAUBHAGYA Yojana, the Prime Minister exhorted them to work towards making an efficient electric chulha (stove), which would enable cooking through the use of electricity. 

The Prime Minister said this innovation would, in one stroke, significantly impact the nation’s dependence on imported fuel. He said that while the world is working towards electric cars, in India, in addition to electric cars, electric stoves would go a long way in meeting the needs of the people. He asked ONGC to invite startups and youth to innovate in this field.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, or Saubhagya, at New Delhi. The aim of this scheme is to provide power to all homes. 

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, the Prime Minister also dedicated a new ONGC building - the Deendayal Urja Bhawan. 

The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation, the Booster Compressor Facility in Bassein Gas Field. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister gave examples of the success of Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, Mudra Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, and Udan, to highlight how the Union Government is implementing schemes which benefit the poorest of the poor. 

In this context he mentioned the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, which would provide power connections to all the estimated four crore households which currently did not have a power connection. The outlay for this scheme would be over Rs. 16000 crore. These connections would be provided free of cost, the Prime Minister said. 

Speaking to the accompaniment of a presentation, the Prime Minister recounted how he had set a target of electrifying over 18000 unelectrified villages within 1000 days. He said less than 3000 villages are now left to be electrified. 

He explained how coal shortages have become a thing of the past, and capacity addition in power generation has exceeded targets. 

The Prime Minister also spoke of an increase in renewable power installed capacity, towards the target of 175 GW by 2022. He mentioned how the power tariff in the case of renewable energy has been reduced significantly. A considerable increase has also been made in transmission lines. 

The Prime Minister mentioned how the UDAY scheme has brought down losses of power distribution companies, describing it as an example of cooperative, competitive federalism. 

Explaining the impact of economies of scale in the UJALA scheme, the Prime Minister said that the cost of LED bulbs has come down significantly. 

The Prime Minister said that New India will require an energy framework that works on the principle of equity, efficiency and sustainability. He said the change in work culture in the Union Government is strengthening the energy sector. This in turn, will positively impact the work culture of the entire country, he added.

      Today, there is a convergence of three holy occasions. It is the 5th day of Navratri.  On this day Skandamata, the goddess of the solar system is worshiped. During these auspicious Navratri days, with the blessings of Skandamata a very important scheme related to the safety and lives of women of the country is beginning. The birth anniversary of the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji also falls on this day and today the country gets Deendayal Energy Bhawan. I feel elated to inaugurate this eco-friendly and low-electricity consumption grid building. I have been told that thousands of employees of ONGC are connected with this program  through video link. When I saw this building, an idea came to my mind. I felt I should have been here instead of being the Prime Minister but then there are so many other things which I am not lucky enough to get. I congratulate all of you for building this magnificent building. My best wishes.

     Today, spirituality, faith and modern technology all happen to shine brightly here in this place.

Brothers and Sisters, 

     The Garib Kalyan Varsh began on this date last year. The government has decided that for one year it will celebrate the birth centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyayji as the Garib Kalyan Varsh. The welfare of the poor is integrally  linked with the identity of this government. From Jan Dhan Yojna to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, from Ujjwala to Mudra, from Start up to Stand up India, from Ujala to Udan  you will see, all these are for the welfare of the poor.

      Who would have thought that someday  there would be  a government that would open bank accounts of 300 million poor people? Who would have thought that someday a government would come that would provide Insurance coverage of one rupee premium per month and another for 90 paisa per day to about 150 million poor people ? Who would have thought that someday a government would come which would provide more than 3.5 lakh crore rupees loan to 9 crore account holders without bank guarantee? Who would have thought that there would be a government that would think that women must get rid of the smoke in the kitchen ? Who had thought that someday a government would come that would think that a person putting on slippers could fly in airplanes ? Who would have thought that a government would ever come that would reduce the prices of Stents for heart surgeries and knee implants and make them affordable to middle class people ?

          The dreams of the poor are the dreams of my government and reducing their troubles in everyday life is my government’s biggest responsibility. Today, a very big, very important and essential scheme in this series is being launched for the women of poor families of the country. 

       Brothers and sisters, the name of this plan is Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojna  i.e. Saubhagya.

      Friends, even after 70 years of independence there are more than four crore houses in our country which do not have an electricity connection. The total number of families in India is 20 crores, out of which 4 crores is about 20 percent. You can imagine the living condition of the people of these 4 crore families. It appears as if they are living in 18th century. Imagine how your life would be without electricity. 

      Friends, it has been more than 125 years when great scientist Thomas Alva Edison invented electricity bulb. Showcasing his invention Edison had said, “We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.”  It is sad for all of us that till today, leave alone the bulb, even electricity could not reach four crore households of the country. Candles, lanterns are still being used in those households. Even today children in crores of those poor families face problems when they study after evening, even if they study they do it in light of those lanterns. When I was young I also used to study like that then our elders used to tell us, please don’t study in the light of kerosene oil, your eyes will be ruined and even your breath can also stop. So I asked: what should I do? Then they advised me to use castor oil in the lamp and then study with the help of that lamp. We tried to take our life a little forward by using the light of Castor oil lamp during our childhood. Then it comes to our mind that what happens to those four crore families? Leave alone the things of pleasure, the women of these houses also have to cook in the dark and therefore most women are under pressure to finish the kitchen work before the day is over. There are no lights in homes, no lights on roads. It is difficult to get out of homes in the dark, especially for women. So, they have to remain in the house by themselves. It is necessary for us and for every such person who has electricity connection, to understand how the life would be without an electricity connection. When the electricity connection is provided to these homes then only their fortunes will shine.

       Under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, Saubhagya, the government is aiming to give electricity connection to  every household in the country, be it in a village or city, be it a shanty or a hut in any remote area. We are moving ahead with the resolve to connect those houses with a power connection. No fee will be charged from poor for any electricity connection. The government will come to the house of poor people and give them electricity connection. To get electricity connection, leave alone poor people even the heads of the villages once had to make rounds of the government offices. This government will go to the houses of poor and provide them electricity connection without even charging one rupee.

      It will cost more than Rs. 16,000 crores to provide electricity connection to each and every poor family of the country. We have decided that this burden will not be put on poor people. We will definitely provide this facility to the poor people. It is not just a promise, we will implement it as well. Friends, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay had said: the success of economic plans and economic progress will not be measured by the person at the top of the ladder in the society, but by the person who is at the bottom level. Which means evaluation of the plans of the government should be based on how much beneficial they have been to the poor. Today, on the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Ji, I am glad that such a great scheme that will fulfill the dreams of millions of poor families of the country has started. Acknowledging the kind of problems faced by the poor people in the absence of electricity in the house, especially by women and children, the government is determined to provide electricity to 18,000 villages where there was no electricity even after so many years of independence. I had promised from the Red Fort to complete this work in one thousand days. Our of these 18,000 villages, now only less than three thousand villages are left where the electricity is yet to be provided. From this graph you can see that our target will definitely be achieved within the stipulated time. 

       Brothers and sisters, I remember that after I became the Prime Minister when I took the first meeting of the officials of the Power Ministry, I sought information on this count they  told me, Sir, it would take seven years to complete this work. I heard that and I asked that whether it could be done sooner ? They had it in their minds that it would not be possible. I announced from the Red Fort that I will do it in one thousand days. It is like this that if you take the courage and exhort the officers they will finish the task. Today I can see that they have actually almost finished the job.

         Brothers and sisters, in New India not only every village will have electricity, but every household in New India will also have an electricity connection.  Launching Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, Saubhagya is a symbol of the ambition of the government and it amounts to bringing in energy revolution in the country. Without solving the power crisis, improving the mechanisms and without modernizing the old system this kind of scheme could not be started. Things do not move with old systems, it cannot happen with old traditions. One has to make radical changes and move ahead in new direction with a renewed pace. This scheme is also a symbol of the efforts made by the Central Government in the last three years. People of the country cannot forget the days when big breaking news were aired on TV channel; you all are familiar with the breaking news. At that time such breaking news used to be aired – Power houses have been left with coal stock only for a day or two. The state of the energy crises was such that whole grids used to fail, one state after another were immersed in the dark. And I am not talking about that which used to happen several decades ago. Whatever I’ve been talking about had happened a few years ago, in the last decade itself. All this had happened during the previous government.

       Now try to recollect, since when you have not heard any such breaking news that power plants did not have coal. Friends, now the country is moving towards being power surplus after leaving behind the era of power crisis. And all this has not been achieved by adopting a new approach and  new policies. It has been achieved bytaking multidimensional steps. To improve the power situation of the country simultaneous work on four different directions was undertaken - Production, Transmission, Distribution and Connection. If production is not there, transmission-distribution system is not strong then no matter how much discussion we can have for providing electricity but it will not be possible to provide electricity to all the households.  Therefore, after the formation of government, first priority was given to increasing the production. The work has started to increase generation of solar energy, hydro energy, thermal  and nuclear power. 

      1.  Friends, we implemented a new Act for coal mines in year 2015 under which, for the first time, a reverse e-auction of coal mines was conducted. During the five year period from 2009 to 2014 coal production increased by only 34 million tons, while in the last 3 years, we have increased the production by 93 million tons to take it to 659 million tons per year. I am happy to inform you that the increase in the production of coal by PSUs during the three years of this government is more than one and a half times the increase in the tenure of the previous government. For those who do not want mines and just want the coal, the government has also introduced a new coal allocation policy with the name “Shakti” for them four months ago. Under this scheme the allocation of coal to electricity generating thermal plants will be done in a transparent manner by way of an auction. In February last year, the government has also issued a transparent auction policy for the re-allocation of coal linkages.

      2. Friends, coal auctions in which there was a big scam worth crores of rupees, this government has given the nation a transparent and modern system of auction for the same coal. This indicates both the policies and intention of this government. This Government is working on 6 basic principles of providing easy, affordable, clean, well planned, safe and secure power in the field of electricity.

     3. Due to the efforts of this government for the first time in three years the installed power capacity has increased by 60 thousand MW, which is 12% more than the target.

     4. While ensuring the energy security of India, we also resolved that this work will be done by giving priority to clean energy. That's why the government had set a target of producing 175 Gigawatts of clean energy by 2022 which means solar, wind and hydro electricity.

      5. Working towards this goal renewable energy capacity has been almost doubled in the last three years and there has been an increase of more than 27 thousand Megawatts in the capacity. The capacity of solar energy has been increased almost five times in the same period.

        6. By promoting the competitiveness in the Renewable Energy sector, the government has also ensured that it is economical for the common citizens of the country. Reduction in the cost of renewable energy is being constantly monitored. In 2016-17, because of this thing we got solar energy at a minimum tariff of only 2 rupees 44 paise and wind energy at only 3 rupees 42 paise. I remember when I was in Gujarat and I went for Solar Energy, at that time Indian government was even ready to give 19 rupees. Then I made a policy of 13 rupees there. And Gujarat was the first state in India which created the policy for Solar Energy. At that time our people were a scared lot. Government of India is giving 19 rupees per unit and if you are going to give only 13 rupees for a unit then who will come forward to supply to us. I said that I will not give more than this, I will stay at this only and I believe that day is not far away when thermal and solar power will become equal, this was the speech which I gave at that time. I did not waver and it was a joy to see that people did not go for the 19 rupee plan but they came forward for 13 rupee plan because I had prepared the eco system, and at that time the biggest solar park in India was there. Today the country has bought the solar energy to two and a half rupees per unit.

      Friends, the government has increased the investment in the field of power transmission, due to which transmission network in the country has expanded very rapidly. Over the last three years work has been done on projects worth over 1.50 lakh crores. This is 83 percent more than the last three years of work of the previous government. You can clearly see one thing, each and every thing tells you how the work is done. The transmission lines setup during this government are 12 percent more than the target. Due to this, now the country not only has a safe and balanced grid available today, but we are moving forward towards the goal of One Nation, One Grid, One Price with great pace.

       For many years, due to the negligence of the country's power sector, power distribution had become a major weakness in the power sector. Because of this the electricity which was being produced in the country was not available to the people. Power distribution companies were also facing economic losses on every additional unit.

       To break this weak link, in order to strengthen the Power Distribution System, the government started the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana i.e. UDAY, in 2015. The purpose of the Uday Yojana was to establish better Operational and Financial Management in the companies engaged in the distribution of electricity. When companies have stability, when they are commercially strong only then they will be able to pay attention to distribution.

      Today, due to the continuous efforts of three years, we can see an improvement in the health of the power distribution companies. The result of this is that by August 2017 the distribution companies have saved an amount of about Rs 23,500 crores, which earlier they had to pay as interest. You can see what kind of situation has been created. In comparison with 2016, annual losses of Distribution companies have decreased by about 42% in 2017 within one year of launch of UDAY. You can also see UDAY scheme as a spectacular example of competitive-cooperative federalisms for sake of development. Friends, this government is also working on two big plans to strengthen the power distribution system in the villages and the cities.

       Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana is underway in the villages and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) in the cities. Projects worth over Rs. 69 thousand crores related to these two schemes have been approved. Work on these schemes is being done at a fast pace. The Central Government has also provided the state governments an amount of about 22 thousand crore rupees in the last three years under different schemes for distribution of electricity. This amount is more than twice the amount provided in the last three years of the previous government. Brothers and sisters, the decisions taken and the policies created by the central government in the Power Distribution Sector across the country have had a direct impact on the Ease of Doing Business. In the power sector, in terms of Ease of Doing Business, India was on 99th place in 2015. Whereas now its ranking has improved to 26. Imagine such a big jump from 99th rank to the 26th rank, it is a matter of great pride for people engaged in reforming the sector. The work done by India in the power sector has been pointed out by another international agency. Last year US Space Agency NASA took a picture of India from space during night. In this picture, India was shining. You can see it in this picture. One such image was taken in the year 2012, which looks dark. And this another picture shows a different story of the power sector which was taken in 2016. Friends, along with strengthening the power sector, this government is also emphasizing that modern methods of reducing the power demand should be adopted. In addition to saving the electricity these modern systems also reduce electricity bills of people.

      Because of the government's effort, the LED bulb, and please keep this figure in the mind, the LED bulb, when I assumed office in May 2014, the price of the LED bulb was Rs 310 in February 2014 and today in September 2017, its price is Rs 40. Under the Ujala scheme, more than 26 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country so far. This has resulted in people having an estimated savings of more than Rs. 13,700 crore annually in the electricity bills. Rs. 13,700 crores! You can guess how many megawatts of power was saved and the amount to generate that much capacity was also saved. Which means it gives you an example of how the country's economy can be run. The private sector has also distributed more than 41 crore LED bulbs. In addition to this about 13 lakh energy saving fans and more than 33 lakh energy saving tube lights have also been distributed by the government. Under the world's largest program, more than 33.60 lakh LED street lights have also been installed as of now.

      Friends, transparency and accountability are the top priorities of this government. Common citizen of the country, its poor people, every consumer of the country is paramount for us. The government is very serious about both taking suggestions from them at each level and giving information to them about the work. The progress of schemes is being made available to people through mobile app, web portal, dashboard and suggestions from people are also being taken.

         Given the expansion of our economy it is also natural that our energy demand is going to increase in the coming years. In such a situation, we will have to move forward by maintaining a balance. Hydrocarbons also have a very important role. Current energy requirement of the country is mainly met by coal. In the coming days, we have to balance it with gas as well as renewable energy. Reducing Carbon-related emissions is part of our cultural heritage, it is a part of our tradition. We have been involved in this movement with publicly making commitments in the COP-21.

       We need an energy framework in New India that runs on the principle of equity, efficiency and sustainability. It will depend on how much we can increase the domestic supply and how much we can reduce our reliance on imports.If by 2022 we can cut oil imports by 10 percent, then it will not only help the industries but it will also strengthen the economy of the country. In the past ten years, we have spent almost a trillion dollars on crude imports. This is almost three times more than our general budget. You can predict the amount which could be saved by reducing oil imports and when it would be spent on development schemes for our middle class families in rural areas of the country, then how much more social and economic development it will bring.

Friends, while reforming the oil and gas sector many major consumer centric initiatives have also been taken in the last three years. Like Prime Minister Ujjwala scheme, connecting LPG subsidy to direct benefit transfer scheme, expanding Piped Natural Gas Supply and City Gas Distribution Network, increasing LPG coverage etc.

       Besides this many major decisions have been taken at the policy level also. Such as deregulating the price of liquid fuels, making new policies for gas pricing, finding new solutions to increase domestic production, creating HELP i.e. Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy, constituting a policy for auctioning of DSF i.e. Discovered Small Field and gas pooling in the fertilizer sector.

       Brothers and sisters, the government is fully sensitive for the protection of environment. Keeping this in mind an extensive program like blending of ethanol in petrol, schemes related to biodiesel, and development of LNG terminals have been started. To safeguard the country's energy needs in the future, relations with major oil producing countries are being strengthened. In this regard an India-Russia Energy Bridge has been formed. There have been many such agreements abroad from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas which will keep our future interests in mind.

       With the change in the work-culture of the government, the entire energy sector is getting stronger and with the energy sector getting stronger the country will also get a new work-culture. When people living in the remote areas of the country will get access to electricity and gas in their lives then their way of working and living will also change. I hope that ""Saubhagya"" scheme, just like ""Ujjwala"" scheme, will help to bring a new era of safety and health especially in the lives of women. This will also end one of the biggest imbalances of our society. In order to bring about changes in the lives of the poor people, u birder to remove the darkness from their lives, and for a New India, I extend my greetings to the country once again.

      Just a while ago, in his speech Dharmendra Ji was saying that ONGC has planned Rs 100 crore for start up. Today I want you to take up a challenging task and I believe that you will do it. You see the electric cars, the world has moved towards them because it is a matter related to energy which is taking us towards the electric car. I can understand the troubles that electric cars will reduce and their benefits also. But there is a field that can bring a huge revolution. And I would like the ONGC to take this initiative and call upon the youth of the country, call upon them for innovation. And ONGC should organise a competition on innovation. And the task would be to make an electric stove on which every kind of cooking can be done. Whether you have to make Pakodas, or Chapatis or even sweets, every kind of cooking can be done on that stove. If such user friendly equipment are invented then that day will not be far away when people will use solar energy to cook food in their homes and there would not be any need of gas cylinders, LPG or Ujjwala. And after building the electric car, whatever will be the burden or savings, in comparison it will be much cheaper to inculcate the habit of cooking on solar energy. 

I believe that to invite the young startups of our country ONGC must organize a big competition of this kind. I think Rs. 100 crore is sufficient for this work. Through this one task alone you can achieve the 10% reduction in consumption in one year that you want to achieve because there will be a big alternative to your consumption. Today, the kind of research that is being done on the electric cars, I believe that if this kind of research is done on electric equipments for cooking then maybe it will be more impactful for a country like India and therefore, today I am giving a challenge, on September 25, 2017, at 7:30 in the evening, you can write it down, it is eight o'clock now, So I hope that you will come to me with a plan in one month and just demonstrate this thing by doing it. And especially these thousands of ONGC soldiers who are listening to me, I would request them to think over and exhort the youth of country to focus their attention on innovation. I urge them to think how we can create simple and user friendly things and thereby start a new revolution. 

      Friends, thank you very much. I am sure all of you will do good job in this fine building. Many-many congratulations to all of you.

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, आप सबको नमस्कार । आकाशवाणी के माध्यम से ‘मन की बात’ करते-करते तीन वर्ष पूरे हो गए हैं । आज ये 36वाँ episode है । ‘मन की बात’ एक प्रकार से भारत की जो सकारात्मक शक्ति है, देश के कोने-कोने में जो भावनाएँ भरी पड़ी हैं, इच्छाएँ हैं, अपेक्षाएँ हैं, कहीं-कहीं शिकायत भी है - एक जन-मन में जो भाव उमड़ते रहते हैं ‘मन की बात’ ने उन सब भावों से मुझे जुड़ने का एक बड़ा अद्भुत अवसर दिया और मैंने कभी ये नहीं कहा है कि मेरे मन की बात है । ये ‘मन की बात’ देशवासियों के मन से जुड़ी हैं, उनके भाव से जुड़ी हैं, उनकी आशा-अपेक्षाओं से जुड़ी हुई हैं । और जब ‘मन की बात’ में बातें मैं बताता हूँ तो उसे देश के हर कोने से जो लोग मुझे अपनी बातें भेजते हैं, आपको तो शायद मैं बहुत कम कह पाता हूँ लेकिन मुझे तो भरपूर खज़ाना मिल जाता है । चाहे email पर हो, टेलीफोन पर हो, mygov पर हो, NarendraModiApp पर हो, इतनी बातें मेरे तक पहुँचती हैं । अधिकतम तो मुझे प्रेरणा देने वाली होती हैं । बहुत सारी, सरकार में सुधार के लिए होती हैं । कहीं व्यक्तिगत शिकायत भी होती हैं तो कहीं सामूहिक समस्या पर ध्यान आकर्षित किया जाता है । और मैं तो महीने में एक बार आधा घंटा आपका लेता हूँ, लेकिन लोग, तीसों दिन ‘मन की बात’ के ऊपर अपनी बातें पहुँचाते हैं । और उसका परिणाम ये आया है कि सरकार में भी संवेदनशीलता, समाज के दूर-सुदूर कैसी-कैसी शक्तियाँ पड़ी हैं, उस पर उसका ध्यान जाना, ये सहज अनुभव आ रहा है । और इसलिए ‘मन की बात’ की तीन साल की ये यात्रा देशवासियों की, भावनाओं की, अनुभूति की एक यात्रा है । और शायद इतने कम समय में देश के सामान्य मानव के भावों को जानने-समझने का जो मुझे अवसर मिला है और इसके लिए मैं देशवासियों का बहुत आभारी हूँ । ‘मन की बात’ में मैंने हमेशा आचार्य विनोबा भावे की उस बात को याद रखा है । आचार्य विनोबा भावे हमेशा कहते थे ‘अ-सरकारी, असरकारी ’ । मैंने भी ‘मन की बात’ को, इस देश के जन को केंद्र में रखने का प्रयास किया है । राजनीति के रंग से उसको दूर रखा है । तत्कालीन, जो गर्मी होती है, आक्रोश होता है, उसमें भी बह जाने के बजाय, एक स्थिर मन से, आपके साथ जुड़े रहने का प्रयास किया है । मैं ज़रूर मानता हूँ, अब तीन साल के बाद social scientists, universities, reseach scholars, media experts ज़रूर इसका analysis करेंगे । plus-minus हर चीज़ को उजागर करेंगे । और मुझे विश्वास है कि ये विचार-विमर्श भविष्य ‘मन की बात’ के लिए भी अधिक उपयोगी होगा, उसमें एक नयी चेतना, नयी ऊर्जा मिलेगी । और मैंने जब एक बार ‘मन की बात’ में कही थी कि हमें भोजन करते समय चिंता करनी चाहिये कि जितनी ज़रूरत है उतना ही लें, हम उसको बर्बाद न करें । लेकिन उसके बाद मैंने देखा कि देश के हर कोने से मुझे इतनी चिट्ठियाँ आयी, अनेक सामाजिक संगठन, अनेक नवयुवक पहले से ही इस काम को कर रहे हैं । जो अन्न थाली में छोड़ दिया जाता है उसको इकट्ठा करके, उसका सदुपयोग कैसे हो इसमें काम करने वाले इतने लोग मेरे इतने ध्यान में आये, मेरे मन को इतना बड़ा संतोष हुआ, इतना आनंद हुआ । 

एक बार मैंने ‘मन की बात’ में महाराष्ट्र के एक retired teacher श्रीमान् चन्द्रकान्त कुलकर्णी की बात कही थी, जो अपने pension में से, सोलह हज़ार रूपये का pension मिलता था उसमें से पाँच हज़ार रुपया वो, 51 post-dated cheque देकर के, स्वच्छता के लिये उन्होंने दान दे दिया था । और उसके बाद तो मैंने देखा कि स्वच्छता के लिए, इस प्रकार के काम करने के लिए कितने लोग आगे आए । 

एक बार मैंने हरियाणा के एक सरपंच की ‘selfie with daughter’ को देखा और मैंने ‘मन की बात’ में सबके सामने रखा । देखते ही देखते न सिर्फ़ भारत में, पूरे विश्व में ‘selfie with daughter’ एक बड़ा अभियान चल पड़ा । ये सिर्फ़ social media का मुद्दा नहीं है । हर बेटी को एक नया आत्मविश्वास, नया गर्व पैदा करने वाली ये घटना बन गयी । हर माँ-बाप को लगने लगा कि मैं अपनी बेटी के साथ selfie लूँ । हर बेटी को लगने लगा कि मेरा कोई माहात्म्य है, मेरा कोई महत्व है । 

पिछले दिनों मैं भारत सरकार के tourism department के साथ बैठा था । मैंने जब tour पर जाने वाले लोगों से कहा था कि आप incredible India पर, जहाँ भी जाएँ वहाँ की फोटो भेजिये । लाखों तस्वीरें, भारत के हर कोने की, एक प्रकार से tourism क्षेत्र में काम करने वालों की एक बहुत बड़ी अमानत बन गयी । छोटी-सी घटना कितना बड़ा आन्दोलन खड़ा कर देती है, ये ‘मन की बात’ में मैंने अनुभव किया है । आज मन कर गया, क्योंकि जब सोच रहा था तीन साल हो गये, तो पिछले तीन साल की कई घटनायें मेरे मन-मंदिर में छा गयीं । देश सही दिशा में जाने के लिए हर पल अग्रसर है । देश का हर नागरिक दूसरे की भलाई के लिए, समाज की अच्छाई के लिए, देश की प्रगति के लिए, कुछ-न-कुछ करना चाहता है ये मेरे तीन साल के ‘मन की बात’ के अभियान में, मैंने देशवासियों से जाना है, समझा है, सीखा है । किसी भी देश के लिए ये सबसे बड़ी पूँजी होती है, एक बहुत बड़ी ताक़त होती है । मैं ह्रदय से देशवासियों को नमन करता हूँ । 

मैंने एक बार ‘मन की बात’ में खादी के विषय में चर्चा की थी । और खादी एक वस्त्र नहीं, एक विचार है । और मैंने देखा कि इन दिनों खादी के प्रति काफ़ी रुचि बढ़ी है और मैंने स्वाभाविक रूप से कहा था कि मैं कोई खादीधारी बनने के लिए नहीं कह रहा हूँ लेकिन भाँति-भाँति के fabric होते हैं तो एक खादी क्यों न हो ? घर में चादर हो, रूमाल हो, curtain हो । अनुभव ये आया है कि युवा-पीढ़ी में खादी का आकर्षण बढ़ गया है । खादी की बिक्री बढ़ी है और उसके कारण ग़रीब के घर में सीधा-सीधा रोज़गारी का संबंध जुड़ गया है । 2 अक्टूबर से खादी में discount दिया जाता है , काफ़ी छूट-रियायत मिलती है । मैं फिर एक बार आग्रह करूँगा, खादी का जो अभियान चला है उसको हम और आगे चलायें, और बढ़ायें । खादी खरीद करके ग़रीब के घर में दिवाली का दीया जलायें, इस भाव को लेकर के हम काम करें । हमारे देश के ग़रीब को इस कार्य से एक ताक़त मिलेगी और हमें करना चाहिए । और इस खादी के प्रति रुचि बढ़ने के कारण खादी क्षेत्र में काम करने वालो में, भारत सरकार में खादी से संबंधित लोगों में एक नये तरीक़े से सोचने का उत्साह भी बढ़ा है । नई technology कैसे लाएँ, उत्पादन क्षमता कैसे बढ़ाएँ, solar-हथकरघे कैसे ले आएँ? पुरानी जो विरासत थी जो बिलकुल ही 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 साल से बंद पड़ी थीं उसको पुनर्जीवित कैसे किया जाए । 

उत्तर प्रदेश में, वाराणसी सेवापुर में, अब सेवापुरी का खादी आश्रम 26 साल से बंद पड़ा था लेकिन आज पुनर्जीवित हो गया । अनेक प्रकार की प्रवर्तियों को जोड़ा गया । अनेक लोगों को रोज़गार के नये अवसर पैदा किये । कश्मीर में पम्पोर में खादी एवं ग्रामोद्योग ने बंद पड़े अपने प्रशिक्षण केंद्र को फिर से शुरू किया और कश्मीर के पास तो इस क्षेत्र में देने के लिए बहुत कुछ है । अब ये प्रशिक्षण केंद्र फिर से शुरू होने के कारण नई पीढ़ी को आधुनिक रूप से निर्माण कार्य करने में, बुनने में, नयी चीज़ें बनाने में एक मदद मिलेगी और मुझे अच्छा लग रहा है कि जब बड़े-बड़े Corporate House भी दिवाली में जब gift देते हैं तो इन दिनों खादी की चीज़े देना शुरू किये हैं । लोग भी एक दूसरे को gift के रूप में खादी की चीज़े देना शुरू किये हैं । एक सहज़ रूप से, चीज़ कैसे आगे बढ़ती है ये हम सब अनुभव करते हैं । 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, पिछले महीने ‘मन की बात’ में ही हम सब ने एक संकल्प किया था और हमने तय किया था कि गाँधी-जयंती से पहले 15 दिन देश-भर में स्वच्छता का उत्सव मनायेंगे । स्वच्छता से जन-मन को जोड़ेंगे । हमारे आदरणीय राष्ट्रपति जी ने इस कार्य का आरंभ किया और देश जुड़ गया । अबाल-वृद्ध, पुरुष हो, स्त्री हो, शहर हो, गाँव हो, हर कोई आज इस स्वच्छता-अभियान का हिस्सा बन गया है । और जब मैं कहता हूँ ‘संकल्प से सिद्धि’, ये स्वच्छता-अभियान एक संकल्प-सिद्धि की ओर कैसे आगे बढ़ रहा है हम अपनी आँखों के सामने देख रहे हैं । हर कोई इसको स्वीकारता है, सहयोग करता है और साकार करने के लिए कोई न कोई योगदान देता है । मैं आदरणीय राष्ट्रपति जी का तो आभार मानता हूँ लेकिन साथ-साथ देश के हर वर्ग ने इसको अपना काम माना है । हर कोई इसके साथ जुड़ गया है । चाहे खेल- जगत के लोग हों, सिने-जगत के लोग हों, academicians हों, स्कूल हों, कॉलेज हों, university हों, किसान हों, मज़दूर हों, अफ़सर हों, बाबू हों, पुलिस हों, फौज के जवान हों - हर कोई इसके साथ जुड़ गया है । सार्वजनिक स्थानों पर एक दबाव भी पैदा हुआ है कि अब सार्वजनिक स्थान गंदे हों तो लोग टोकते हैं, वहाँ काम करने वालों को भी एक दबाव महसूस होने लगा है । मैं इसे अच्छा मानता हूँ और मेरे लिए ख़ुशी है कि ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा अभियान’ के सिर्फ पहले चार दिन में ही करीब-करीब 75 लाख से ज़्यादा लोग, 40 हज़ार से ज़्यादा initiative लेकर के गतिविधियों में जुड़ गए और कुछ तो लोग मैंने देखा है कि लगातार काम कर रहे हैं, परिणाम लाकर के रहने का फैसला ले करके काम कर रहे हैं । इस बार एक और भी चीज़ देखी - एक तो होता है कि हम कहीं स्वच्छता करें, दूसरा होता है हम जागरूक रह करके गन्दगी न करें, लेकिन स्वच्छता को अगर स्वभाव बनाना है तो एक वैचारिक आंदोलन भी ज़रुरी होता है । इस बार ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ के साथ कई प्रतियोगितायें हुईं । ढाई करोड़ से ज़्यादा बच्चों ने स्वच्छता के निबंध-स्पर्धा में भाग लिया । हज़ारों बच्चों ने paintings बनायी । अपनी-अपनी कल्पना से स्वच्छता को लेकर के चित्र बनाये । बहुत से लोगों ने कवितायें बनायी और इन दिनों तो मैं social media पर ऐसे जो हमारे नन्हें साथियों ने, छोटे-छोटे बालकों ने चित्र भेजे हैं वो मैं post भी करता हूँ, उनका गौरवगान करता हूँ । जहाँ तक स्वच्छता की बात आती है तो मैं media के लोगों का आभार मानना कभी भूलता नहीं हूँ । इस आंदोलन को उन्होंने बहुत पवित्रतापूर्वक आगे बढ़ाया है । अपने-अपने तरीक़े से, वे जुड़ गए हैं और एक सकारात्मक वातावरण बनाने में उन्होंने बहुत बड़ा योगदान दिया है और आज भी वो अपने-अपने तरीक़े से स्वच्छता के आंदोलन का नेतृत्व कर रहे हैं । हमारे देश का electronic media, हमारे देश का print media देश की कितनी बड़ी सेवा कर सकता है ये ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ आंदोलन में हम देख पाते हैं । अभी कुछ दिन पहले मुझे किसी ने ध्यान आकर्षित किया श्रीनगर के 18 साल के नौजवान बिलाल डार के संबंध में । और आपको जान करके ख़ुशी होगी कि श्रीनगर नगर निगम ने बिलाल डार को स्वच्छता के लिए अपना Brand Ambassador बनाया है और जब Brand Ambassador की बात आती है तो आपको लगता होगा कि शायद वो सिने-कलाकार होगा, शायद वो खेल-जगत का हीरो होगा, जी नहीं । बिलाल डार स्वयं 12-13 साल की अपनी उम्र से, पिछले 5-6 साल से स्वच्छता में लग गया है । एशिया की सबसे बड़ी झील श्रीनगर के पास वहाँ प्लास्टिक हो, पॉलिथीन हो, used bottle हो, कूड़ा-कचरा हो, बस वो साफ़ करता रहता है । उसमें से कुछ कमाई भी कर लेता है । क्योंकि उसके पिता जी की बहुत छोटी आयु में कैंसर में मृत्यु हो गई लेकिन उसने अपना जीवन आजीविका के साथ-साथ स्वच्छता के साथ जोड़ दिया । एक अनुमान है कि बिलाल ने सालाना 12 हज़ार किलो से ज़्यादा कूड़ा-कचरा साफ़ किया है । श्रीनगर नगर निगम को भी मैं बधाई देता हूँ कि स्वच्छता के प्रति इस पहल के लिए और Ambassador के लिए उनकी इस कल्पना के लिए, क्योंकि श्रीनगर एक tourist destination है और हिन्दुस्तान का हर नागरिक श्रीनगर जाने का मन करता है उसका, और वहाँ सफ़ाई को इतना बल मिले ये अपने आप में बहुत बड़ी बात है । और मुझे ख़ुशी है कि उन्होंने बिलाल को सिर्फ Brand Ambassador बनाया ऐसा नहीं है, सफ़ाई करने वाले बिलाल उसको निगम ने इस बार गाड़ी दी है, uniform दिया है और वो अन्य इलाक़ों में भी जाकर के लोगों को स्वच्छता के लिए शिक्षित करता है, प्रेरित करता है और परिणाम लाने तक पीछे लगा रहता है । बिलाल डार, आयु छोटी है लेकिन स्वच्छता में रुचि रखने वाले हर किसी के लिए प्रेरणा का कारण है । मैं बिलाल डार को बहुत बधाई देता हूँ । 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, इस बात को हमें स्वीकार करना होगा कि भावी इतिहास, इतिहास की कोख में जन्म लेता है और जब इतिहास की बात आती है तो महापुरुष याद आना बहुत स्वाभाविक है । ये अक्तूबर महीना हमारे इतने सारे महापुरुषों को स्मरण करने का महीना है । महात्मा गाँधी से लेकर के सरदार पटेल तक इसी अक्तूबर में इतने महापुरुष हमारे सामने हैं कि जिन्होंने 20वीं सदी और 21वीं सदी के लिए हम लोगों को दिशा दी, हमारा नेतृत्व किया, हमारा मार्गदर्शन किया और देश के लिए उन्होंने बहुत कष्ट झेले । दो अक्तूबर को महात्मा गाँधी और लाल बहादुर शास्त्री जी की जन्म जयंती है तो 11 अक्तूबर को जयप्रकाश नारायण और नानाजी देशमुख की जन्म-जयंती है और 25 सितम्बर पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी की जन्म-जयंती है । नानाजी और दीनदयाल जी की तो ये शताब्दी का भी वर्ष है । और इन सभी महापुरुषों का एक केंद्र-बिंदु क्या था? एक बात common थी और वो देश के लिए जीना, देश के लिए कुछ करना और मात्र उपदेश नहीं, अपने जीवन के द्वारा करके दिखाना । गाँधी जी, जयप्रकाश जी, दीनदयाल जी ये ऐसे महापुरुष हैं जो सत्ता के गलियारों से कोसो दूर रहे हैं, लेकिन जन-जीवन के साथ पल-पल जीते रहे, जूझते रहे और ‘सर्वजन हिताय–सर्वजन सुखाय’, कुछ-न-कुछ करते रहे । नानाजी देशमुख राजनीतिक जीवन को छोड़ करके ग्रामोदय में लग गए थे और जब आज उनका शताब्दी-वर्ष मनाते हैं तो उनके ग्रामोदय के काम के प्रति आदर होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है । 

भारत के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति श्रीमान अब्दुल कलाम जी जब नौजवानों से बात करते थे तो हमेशा नानाजी देशमुख के ग्रामीण विकास की बातें किया करते थे । बड़े आदर से उल्लेख करते थे और वो स्वयं भी नानाजी के इस काम को देखने के लिए गाँव में गए थे । दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी जैसे महात्मा गाँधी समाज के आखिरी छोर में बैठे हुए इंसान की बात करते थे । दीनदयाल जी भी समाज के आखिरी छोर पर बैठे हुए ग़रीब, पीड़ित, शोषित, वंचित की ही और उसके जीवन में बदलाव लाने की - शिक्षा के द्वारा, रोज़गार के द्वारा किस प्रकार से बदलाव लाया जाये, इसकी चर्चा करते थे । इन सभी महापुरुषों को स्मरण करना ये उनके प्रति उपकार नहीं है , ये महापुरुषों का स्मरण इसलिए करते हैं कि हमें आगे का रास्ता मिलता रहे, आगे की दिशा मिलती रहे । 

अगले ‘मन की बात’ में, मैं जरुर सरदार वल्लभ भाई पटेल के विषय में कहूँगा, लेकिन 31 अक्तूबर पूरे देश में Run for Unity ‘एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत’ । देश के हर शहर में, हर नगर में बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में Run for Unity के कार्यक्रम होने चाहिए और मौसम भी ऐसा है कि दौड़ने का मज़ा आता है - सरदार साहब जैसी लौह-शक्ति पाने के लिए ये भी तो ज़रुरी है । और सरदार साहब ने देश को एक किया था । हमने भी एकता के लिए दौड़ करके एकता के मंत्र को आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए । 

हम लोग बहुत स्वाभाविक रूप से कहते हैं - विविधता में एकता, भारत की विशेषता । विविधता का हम गौरव करते हैं लेकिन क्या कभी आपने इस विविधता को अनुभव करने का प्रयास किया है क्या? मैं बार-बार हिंदुस्तान के मेरे देशवासियों से कहना चाहूँगा और ख़ास करके मेरी युवा-पीढ़ी को कहना चाहूँगा कि हम एक जागृत-अवस्था में हैं । इस भारत की विविधताओं का अनुभव करें, उसको स्पर्श करें, उसकी महक को अनुभव करें । आप देखिये, आपके भीतर के व्यक्तित्व के विकास के लिए भी हमारे देश की ये विविधतायें एक बहुत बड़ी पाठशाला का काम करती है । Vacation है, दिवाली के दिन है, हमारे देश में चारों तरफ कहीं-न-कहीं जाने का स्वभाव बना हुआ है ,लोग जाते हैं tourist के नाते और बहुत स्वाभाविक है । लेकिन कभी-कभी चिंता होती है कि हम अपने देश को तो देखते नहीं हैं, देश की विविधताओं को जानते नहीं, समझते नहीं, लेकिन चका-चौंध के प्रभाव में आकर के विदेशों में ही tour करना पसंद करना शुरू किये हैं । आप दुनिया में जायें मुझे कोई एतराज़ नहीं है, लेकिन कभी अपने घर को भी तो देखें ! उत्तर-भारत के व्यक्ति को पता नहीं होगा कि दक्षिण-भारत में क्या है? पश्चिम-भारत के व्यक्ति को पता नहीं होगा कि पूर्व-भारत में क्या है? हमारा देश कितनी विविधताओं से भरा हुआ है । 

महात्मा गाँधी, लोकमान्य तिलक, स्वामी विवेकानंद, हमारे पूर्व राष्ट्रपति अब्दुल कलाम जी अगर उनकी बातों में देखोगे तो एक बार बात आती है कि जब उन्होंने भारत-भ्रमण किया तब उनको भारत को देखने-समझने में और उसके लिए जीने-मरने के लिए एक नई प्रेरणा मिली । इन सभी महापुरुषों ने भारत का व्यापक भ्रमण किया । अपने कार्य के प्रारंभ में उन्होंने भारत को जानने, समझने का प्रयास किया । भारत को अपने आप में जीने की कोशिश की । क्या हम, हमारे देश के भिन्न-भिन्न राज्यों को, भिन्न-भिन्न समाजों को, समूहों को, उनके रीति-रिवाजों को, उनकी परम्परा को, उनके पहर्वेश (पहनावे) को, उनके खान-पान को, उनकी मान्यताओं को एक विद्यार्थी के रूप में सीखने का, समझने का, जीने का प्रयास कर सकते हैं ? 

Tourism में value addition तभी होगा कि जब हम सिर्फ़ मुलाक़ाती नहीं, हम एक विद्यार्थी के तौर पर उसका पाना-समझना-बनने का प्रयास करें । मेरा स्वयं का अनुभव है मुझे हिंदुस्तान के पाँच सौ से अधिक district में जाने का मौक़ा मिला होगा । साढ़े चार सौ से अधिक district तो ऐसे होंगे जहाँ मुझे रात्रि-मुक़ाम का अवसर मिला है और आज जब मैं भारत में इस दायित्व को संभाल रहा हूँ तो मेरे उस भ्रमण का अनुभव मुझे बहुत काम आता है । चीजों को समझने में मुझे बहुत सुविधा मिलती है । आपसे भी मेरा आग्रह है कि आप इस विशाल भारत को “विविधता में एकता” सिर्फ़ नारा नहीं, हमारी अपार-शक्ति का ये भंडार है, इसको अनुभव कीजिये । ‘एक भारत-श्रेष्ठ भारत’ का सपना इसमें निहित है । खान-पान की कितनी varieties हैं ! पूरे जीवन भर हर दिन एक-एक नई variety अगर खाते रहें तो भी repetition नहीं होगा । अब ये हमारी tourism की बड़ी ताक़त है । मैं आग्रह करूँगा कि इस छुट्टियों में आप सिर्फ घर के बाहर जाएँ ऐसा नहीं, change के लिए निकल पड़ें ऐसा नहीं - कुछ जानने- समझने-पाने के इरादे से निकलिए । भारत को अपने भीतर आत्मसात् कीजिये । कोटि-कोटि जनों की विविधताओं को भीतर आत्मसात् कीजिये । इन अनुभवों से आपका जीवन समृद्ध हो जायेगा । आपकी सोच का दायरा विशाल हो जायेगा । और अनुभव से बड़ा शिक्षक कौन होता है ! सामान्य तौर पर अक्तूबर से मार्च तक का समय ज्यादातर पर्यटन का रहता है । लोग जाते हैं । मुझे विश्वास है कि इस बार भी अगर आप जायेंगे तो मेरे उस अभियान को और आगे बढ़ायेंगे । आप जहाँ भी जाएँ अपने अनुभवों को share कीजिये, तस्वीरों को share कीजिये । #incredibleindia ( हैश टैग incredibleindia) इस पर आप फ़ोटो ज़रुर भेजिए । वहाँ के लोगों से मिलना हो जाये तो उनकी भी तस्वीर भेजिए । सिर्फ़ इमारतों की नहीं, सिर्फ़ प्राकृतिक सौन्दर्य की नहीं ,वहाँ के जन-जीवन की कुछ बातें लिखिए । आपकी यात्रा के अच्छे निबंध लिखिए । Mygov पर भेजिए, NarendraModiApp पर भेजिये । मेरे मन में एक विचार आता है कि हम भारत के tourism को बढ़ावा देने के लिए क्या आप अपने राज्य के सात उत्तम से उत्तम tourist destination क्या हो सकते हैं - हर हिन्दुस्तानी को आपके राज्य के उन सात चीज़ों के विषय में जानना चाहिये । हो सके तो उन सात स्थानों पर जाना चाहिये । आप उसके विषय में कोई जानकारी दे सकते हैं क्या ? NarendraModiApp पर उसको रख सकते हैं क्या ? #IncredibleIndia (हैश टैग incredibleindia) पर रख सकते हैं क्या ? आप देखिये, एक राज्य के सब लोग ऐसा बतायेंगे तो मैं सरकार में कहूँगा कि वो उसको scrutiny करे और common कौन-सी सात चीज़े हर राज्य से आई हैं उस पर वो प्रचार-साहित्य तैयार करें । यानि एक प्रकार से जनता के अभिप्रायों से tourist destination का बढ़ावा कैसे हो ? उसी प्रकार से आपने जो चीजें देखी हैं देशभर में, उसमें से सात आपको जो अच्छे से अच्छी लगी हैं , आप चाहते हैं कि किसी-न-किसी ने तो इसको देखनी चाहिये, जाना चाहिये, उसके विषय में जानकारी पानी चाहिये तो आप आपकी पसंद की सात ऐसे स्थान का भी MyGov पर, NarendraModiApp पर ज़रूर भेजिये । भारत सरकार उस पर काम करेगी । ऐसे उत्तम destination जो होंगे उसके लिए film बनाना, video बनाना, प्रचार-साहित्य तैयार करना, उसको बढ़ावा देना - आपके द्वारा चुनी हुई चीज़ों को सरकार स्वीकार करेगी । आइये, मेरे साथ जुड़िये । इस अक्तूबर महीने से मार्च महीने तक का समय का उपयोग देश के tourism को बढ़ाने में आप भी एक बहुत बड़े catalyst agent बन सकते हैं । मैं आपको निमंत्रण देता हूँ । 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, एक इन्सान के नाते बहुत-सी चीजें मुझे भी छू जाती हैं । मेरे दिल को आंदोलित कर जाती हैं । मेरे मन पर गहरा प्रभाव छोड़ जाती हैं । आख़िर मैं भी तो आप ही की तरह एक इन्सान हूँ । पिछले दिनों एक घटना है जो शायद आपके भी ध्यान में आयी होगी - महिला-शक्ति और देशभक्ति की अनूठी मिसाल हम देशवासियों ने देखी है । Indian Army को लेफ्टिनेंट स्वाति और निधि के रूप में दो वीरांगनाएँ मिली हैं और वे असामान्य वीरांगनाएँ है । असामान्य इसलिए हैं कि स्वाति और निधि माँ-भारती की सेवा करते-करते उनके पति शहीद हो गए थे । हम कल्पना कर सकते हैं कि इस छोटी आयु में जब संसार उजड़ जाये तो मन:स्थिति कैसे होगी ? लेकिन शहीद कर्नल संतोष महादिक की पत्नी स्वाति महादिक इस कठिन परिस्थितियों का मुक़ाबला करते हुए उसने मन में ठान ली । और वे भारत की सेना में भर्ती हो गयीं । 11 महीने तक उसने कड़ी मेहनत करके प्रशिक्षण हासिल किया और अपने पति के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए उसने अपनी ज़िन्दगी झोंक दी । उसी प्रकार से निधि दुबे, उनके पति मुकेश दुबे सेना में नायक का काम करते थे और मातृ-भूमि के लिए शहीद हो गए तो उनकी पत्नी निधि ने मन में ठान ली और वे भी सेना में भर्ती हो गयीं । हर देशवासी को हमारी इस मातृ-शक्ति पर, हमारी इन वीरांगनाओं के प्रति आदर होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है । मैं इन दोनों बहनों को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ । उन्होंने देश के कोटि-कोटि जनों के लिए एक नयी प्रेरणा, एक नयी चेतना जगायी है । उन दोनों बहनों को बहुत-बहुत बधाई । 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नवरात्रि का उत्सव और दिवाली के बीच हमारे देश की युवा पीढ़ी के लिए एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर भी है। FIFA under-17 का वर्ल्ड-कप हमारे यहाँ हो रहा है । मुझे विश्वास है कि चारों तरफ़ फुटबाल की गूँज सुनाई देगी । हर पीढ़ी की फुटबाल में रूचि बढ़ेगी । हिन्दुस्तान का कोई स्कूल - कॉलेज का मैदान ऐसा न हो कि जहाँ पर हमारे नौजवान खेलते हुए नज़र न आयें । आइये, पूरा विश्व जब भारत की धरती पर खेलने के लिए आ रहा है, हम भी खेल को अपने जीवन का हिस्सा बनायें । 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नवरात्रि का पर्व चल रहा है । माँ दुर्गा की पूजा का अवसर है । पूरा माहौल पावन पवित्र सुगंध से व्याप्त है । चारों तरफ़ एक आध्यात्मिकता का वातावरण, उत्सव का वातावरण, भक्ति का वातावरण और ये सब कुछ शक्ति की साधना का पर्व माना जाता है । ये शारदीय-नवरात्रि के रूप में जाना जाता है । और यहीं से शरद-ऋतु का आरंभ होता है । नवरात्रि के इस पावन-पर्व पर मैं देशवासियों को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनायें देता हूँ और माँ-शक्ति से प्रार्थना करता हूँ कि देश के सामान्य-मानव के जीवन की आशा-आकांक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने के लिए हमारा देश नई ऊँचाइयों को प्राप्त करे । हर चुनौतियों का सामना करने का सामर्थ्य देश को आए । देश तेज़ गति से आगे बढ़े और दो हज़ार बाईस (2022) भारत की आज़ादी के 75 साल- आज़ादी के दीवानों के सपनों को पूरा करने का प्रयास, सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का संकल्प, अथाह मेहनत, अथाह पुरुषार्थ और संकल्प को साकार करने के लिए पांच साल का road map बना करके हम चल पड़े और माँ शक्ति हमे आशीर्वाद दे । आप सब को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएँ । उत्सव भी मनायें, उत्साह भी बढ़ायें । 

बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद ।

My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you! It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over “Mann Ki Baat”. This is the 36th episode today. “Mann Ki Baat” has provided me with a unique opportunity to get connected with various feelings and positive energy of the country; emotions of our people which include their desires, expectations and at times, even grievances, which come to their minds. And I have never said that these are the expressions of my mind; Mann Ki Baat reflects our countrymen’s minds, their expressions, their expectations. And when I say things in Mann Ki Baat, people from across the country send their ideas, experiences and feelings to me. I am probably not able to convey all these to you but still I get a treasure-full of ideas over e-mail, over telephone, over mygov. or over NarendraModiApp. I receive a multitude of such ideas and suggestions. Most of these are inspiring to me. 

A large number of these ideas are regarding improvements in the functioning of our government. There are personal grievances and complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to community problems. I just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions, ideas and other material over Mann Ki Baat during all 30 days of the month. And, the result of this whole exercise is that the government has started realizing the sensitivities and powerful ideas of the people of far off places. And, this is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen, their emotions and their feelings. I am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man. In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one sentence of Acharya Vinoba Bhave. He always used to say ‘A- sarkari, Asarkari’, meaning non government is effective. I have also tried to focus on the people of the country in Mann Ki Baat, have kept it away from political hues & tried to remain connected with you with a stable mind rather than being diverted by the heat of the moment or anguish. 

I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative. And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it. And, in one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had said that while having our food, we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage. But, later, I received letters from all corners of the country. Many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice. I come to know about a lot many people who were involved in ensuring that leftover food was best utilized. I derived much satisfaction and joy to learn this. 

Once, in Mann Ki Baat, I had mentioned about a retired teacher from Maharashtra Shriman Chandrakant Kulkarni who donated 51 post - dated cheques of Rs. 5,000/- each for the cleanliness drive out of his total monthly pension of Rs. 16,000/-. And then I saw that a lot many people came forward to donate for this cause. 

Once, I saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in Mann Ki Baat. In no time, “Selfie with Daughter” became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world. This is not only an issue of social media. It became an incident to create a new self-confidence and a feeling of self pride in every daughter. Every parent started feeling that they should take a selfie with their daughter. Every daughter started regaining her own self confidence & self esteem. 

I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently. I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit ‘Incredible India’, they must send photographs of those places. Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector. I’ve experienced through ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign. Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events & incidents over those three years ran across my mind. The nation is always ready to move in the right direction. Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others, for social good, for the country’s progress. This is what I gathered, learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the Mann Ki Baat campaign. This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country. I heartily bow to my countrymen. 

In one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had discussed about Khadi and Khadi is not a fabric but an idea, a principle. I have noticed that these days interest in Khadi has increased very much and I had just said that I was not asking people to makeover into wearing Khadi permanently; rather, since there are a number of fabrics then why not Khadi also be one of the fabrics of your choice? May be a bed-sheet in the house, a handkerchief or a curtain, it has been felt that the younger generation has got interested in Khadi. Sale of Khadi has increased and as a result of this, the poor man’s household has directly got connected to employment. Discount is offered on Khadi from 2nd October and people get quite a good rebate. I once again urge that we should try and take forward the Khadi movement. We should follow the spirit of helping the poor to be able to light a Diwali lamp. The poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it. The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi. How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power? How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years? 

Sewapuri Khadi Ashram at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was lying closed for 26 years but has got a fresh lease of life now. A number of thoughts were implemented. New employment opportunities were created for a number of people. Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer. With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts. Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts. We now experience how something grows naturally. 

My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last month’s Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti. We shall connect people through cleanliness. Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected. The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now. And when I say “Sankalp Se Siddhi”, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove. Everyone accepts this, co-operates in this and makes a contribution in realizing this. I am grateful to our Honourable President. But, every section of society has taken this as its own campaign, everyone has got connected to this. Whether it be people from the sports world, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police, or army jawans – every one has got connected with this. A kind of a pressure has been created in public places and now people resist if someone tries to spoil or to make a public place dirty in any way and even those spoiling public places are also feeling this pressure. It is a good thing and I am pleased to know that just in the first four days of “Swachhata Hi Sewa Abhiyan” more than 75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40 thousand initiatives.. 

I have seen that some people are continuously working and are determined to bring out results. I noticed something else this time – one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth; but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also. This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme “Cleanliness is Service”. More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness. Thousands of children made paintings. They drew pictures based on their own imaginations. Many people wrote poems and these days I post drawings made by our young children on social media and praise their efforts. Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons. They have taken this campaign in a religious manner. They have made a big contribution in creating a positive environment and are leading the Cleanliness Campaign in their own ways. 

We can see in “Swachhata Hi Sewa” movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country. Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar. And you will be glad to know that Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made him their brand ambassador and when there is a talk of brand ambassador, there is a general feeling that he/she must be a Cine artist or a sports-personality. But not in this case. Bilal Dar got connected to the ‘Swachhata Abhiyan’ or Cleanliness Campaign since the age of 12-13 years and has been working for the last 5 to 6 years. He clears plastic, polythene, used bottles, dry or wet waste – every piece of dirt from Aisa’s biggest lake near Srinagar. He also earns from this activity. His father had died of cancer at a very young age but he connected his livelihood with cleanliness. I congratulate Srinagar Municipal Corporation for taking this initiative towards sanitation and for their imagination to appoint an ambassador for this cause of cleanliness because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every Indian wants to go there; and if such attention is given to Cleanliness it is a very big achievement in itself. And I am glad that they have not only appointed Bilal as their ambassador but also given him a vehicle, and also a uniform and he goes to other areas and educates people about cleanliness and inspires them and keeps tracking them till results are achieved. Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness. 

I congratulate Bilal Dar. 

My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men. The month of October is a month to remember so many of our titans. From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, there are many great leaders who gave us the direction towards the 20th and 21st century, led us, guided us and faced so many hardships for the country. 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, 11th October is the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narain and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s birth anniversary falls on 25th September. This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji. And, what was the main focus of all these great men? One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation; they led the people not by mere sermons but by their actions. Gandhiji, Jai Prakashji, Deen Dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people, kept fighting all odds following the principle “Sarv Jan Hitay – Sarv Jan Sukhay”, they kept endeavouring tirelessly. Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and joined the Gramodaya Movement and while celebrating his Centenary year, it is but natural to honour his contribution towards Gramodaya. 

India’s former President Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to speak of Nanaji’s contribution in rural development while talking to the youth. He used to mention Nanaji’s contribution with great respect and he even went to a village to see Nanaji’s work there. 

Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes. Deen Dayalji talked about the poorest of the poor the deprived, distressed ones and spoke of how, through education, employment or otherwise his life could be transformed. We are not obliging these great men by remembering them but we remember them so that we may be able to foresee our forays into the future and the direction we choose. 

In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will surely mention Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel but on 31st October, Run for Unity - Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat - will be organized throughout the country. There should be a number of Run for Unity programmes in every city, every town and the weather is also such that one would enjoy running – It is essential for developing a will power of steel, like that of Sardar Saheb. Sardar Saheb unified the country. We also have to run for unity in order to promote the mantra of unity. 

The element of Unity in diversity being India’s speciality comes naturally to us. We feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity? I would like to re-iterate to my countrymen, and specially to my young friends that we are alive & aware beings. We should feel India’s diversity, touch it, feel its fragrance. You may see for yourself, that for your inner development also, these diversities of our country work as a big teaching tool. There are vacations, Diwali is drawing near, all around in our country, there is an inclination to travel to some place or the other; people go as tourists and it is very natural. But, it is a matter of concern when we do not see our own country, we do not know about its diversities nor do we understand them. Impressed by mere superficial glitter we have started enjoying touring foreign countries only. You travel around the world, I have no issues but have a look at your own country too. People of North India may not be knowing what all is there in the South! People of West India may not be knowing what all is there in the East! Our country is full of such myriad diversities. 

If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country. All these great men travelled widely in India. At the beginning of their endeavour, they tried to know and understand India; tried to live India within themselves. Can we make an effort as a student to learn, understand and try to live as per the traditions, culture, attire, eating habits and beliefs of different states, different societies, different groups of our country? 

There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand & adapt. This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India. In more than four hundred & fifty districts, I had a night stay too. And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful. That helps me a lot in understanding things. I request you too, to feel the “Unity in Diversity” which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy. The dream of “Ek Bharat – Shreshtha Bharat” is inherent in this. How many varieties of cuisines there are ! If we eat a new dish every day, we won’t have to repeat any variety throughout our life. This is the power of our tourism. I would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand –& gain something. Internalize India within yourselves. Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you. These experiences will enrich your lives. Your vision will expand. And, who can be a better teacher than experience! 

Generally, October to March is the suitable time for tourism. People travel. I am sure that even this time if you go, you will lend further fillip to my campaign. Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photographs. You must send photographs on # incredibleindia. If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too. Write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too. Write good travelogues. Send on Mygov. And on NarendraModiApp. A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state – every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state. If possible, one must visit these seven places. Can you provide some information about that? Can you post on NarendraModiApp? Can you post on #incredibleindia? You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state. In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind? Similarly, whatever you have seen throughout India and whichever seven out of these you liked the best and you wish that someone should see these things, or should go there, should get information about them, then you must send photos and information of seven such tourist spots on Mygov. Or on NarendraModiApp. The Government of India will work on that. The government will accept suggestions about making films, videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination. Come, get connected with me. You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March. I invite you. 

My dear countrymen, being a human being, there are many things that touch me too. They agitate my heart. They leave a deep impression on my heart. After all I am also a human being just like you. You might have noticed one recent incident, a unique example of grit, determination and patriotism that was witnessed by all countrymen. The Indian Army has got two extraordinary brave women officers; they are Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi. Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India. One can imagine one’s agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age! But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik – resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army. She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husband’s dreams. Similarly, Nidhi Dubey’s husband Mukesh Dubey was a Naik in the army and attained martyrdom while fighting for his country. His wife Nidhi also took a resolve and joined the army. It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti. I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them. They have evoked a new inspiration and a new awakening among millions of our countrymen. Many congratulation to these two sisters. 

My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali. FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country. I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around. It will evince more interest in Football in every generation. There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play. Come on, the whole world is coming to play on Indian soil, let us make sports a part of our lives. 

My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on. It is a time for praying to Ma Durga. The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance. All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, an air of festivities, an atmosphere of bhakti, of reverence. This is revered as a festival of Shakti Sadhana. This is also known as Sharadiya Navratri, the beginning of autumn. On this pious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to our countrymen and pray to Ma Shakti to let our country attain newer heights so that the desires and expectations of all our countrymen get fulfilled. May our nation be blessed with the strength to face any challenge. 

May the nation move forward and may the year two thousand twenty two- 75 years of India’s Independence be an attempt to realize the dreams of our freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore countrymen, with their tremendous hard work, courage and determination to fulfill our resolve and prepare a roadmap for five years. We have moved on; may ma-shakti shower her blessings upon us. My good wishes to all of you. Celebrate festivities, enjoy with enthusiasm. 

Many Many thanks.

                My dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers,

Such a massive crowd so early in the morning! I could not imagine this thing, one can see people everywhere! First of all, I would like to say sorry to you people as the arrangements made by us were not sufficient and many people are standing under the sun, they are facing difficulty but despite that they have turned up to give their blessings. I express my gratitude to them and I also seek their forgiveness. But I’d like to assure those people who are standing under the sun that we will never allow your sufferings to go waste.  

Brothers and sisters, I’d like to convey my best wishes to the government of Uttar Pradesh, particularly to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh as he has organized a health fair for livestock. This health fair for livestock, when I visited the fair then some 1700 cattle from different place were there and several expert veterinary doctors were there and they were taking care of the health of livestock. And I’m confident that as Uttar Pradesh government has made this effort, they will organize these livestock health fairs across the state and our poor farmers who sometimes hesitate to ensure the health of his livestock due to poverty, these livestock health fairs will provide a big relief to him.

And we know that in the agriculture sector, if something that helps our farmers the most in the field of agriculture then it is animal husbandry, it is production of milk. And that is why milk production, animal husbandry and our cattle health fairs will provide great facility, great service to our villages, to our poor farmers and to our cattle raisers in the coming days. And I heartily congratulate the government of Uttar Pradesh for this thing.

Brothers and sisters, this is the nature of politics that politicians prefer those things where they see some potential for getting votes. They work to strengthen their vote bank. But, brothers and sisters, we are the people who have been raised in a different value system, our character is different.  For us the country is more important than the party and therefore our priorities are not governed by the votes.

Today, this cattle health fair, this is service to those animals that never go to cast votes. These are not voters of anybody. And this kind of movement for livestock has never been done in the last seventy years. These health services will provide a new facility in the area of livestock keeping; it will provide a new system.

 Today, our country is doing well in the field of milk production. However, our per capita milk production is very low in comparison with the global average. And due to this thing cattle raising has become costlier in our country. If we succeed in increasing the per capita milk production then I’m confident that our farmers will take interest in animal husbandry, and milk production will lead to a new economic revolution.

Brothers and sisters, I was born in Gujarat, and Gujarat was my area of work and I have seen that cooperative way of milk production has given a new strength to the farmers of Gujarat. I’ve been informed that a Gujarat based dairy - Banas dairy – has started procuring milk from farmers in Lucknow-Kanpur area. And today, farmers are getting several times better price for their milk than they used to get earlier. I’ve been told that Banas dairy is going to start procurement of milk from the farmers of Kashi region in the coming days.

And I’m confident that when this procurement of milk will start through a dairy, when it will start on the basis of the fat content then the price of milk of the farmers of Kashi region will go up many folds and it will also result in the increase in their incomes. And that is why I congratulate the government of Uttar Pradesh, congratulate the farmers of Uttar Pradesh for starting this movement with the help of Gujarat government, with the help of Banas dairy for the farmers, for the livestock keepers and for the milk producers so that we can work together in the field of milk production, in the field of animal husbandry.

Brothers and sisters, India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022. And when India is completing 75 years of independence in 2022 then we should collectively determine to realize the dreams of India’s freedom fighters. We must strive to realize those dreams, we should put our time and effort and we must realize those dreams in any case. If 1.25 billon citizens of India vow for at least one thing then the country will march ahead by 1.25 billion steps in five years. So brothers and sisters: 2022 - the pledge of our freedom struggle.

It’s our pledge to double our farmers’ income by 2022. And livestock keeping is one way, modernizing our agriculture is one way in that direction. The soil should be investigated through soil health cards, the farmers should get total support of this thing, we have been working in the direction to strengthen these things.

The way the work of issuing the soil health cards to the farmers has picked up the pace after the formation of new government in Uttar Pradesh it is going to help in the welfare of our farmers in the coming days.

Similarly, no one from amongst us likes to live in dirtiness. There would be no man who would not hate dirtiness. Everyone hates the filth. But this cleanliness, this is our responsibility, this culture has not developed in our country.

We will pollute and someone else will clean it, this mentality is the main reason behind our inability to make India clean, to make our cities and villages clean as we want them. No one of you can deny that this cleanliness is the responsibility of every citizen, this cleanliness is the responsibility of every family and that is why this cleanliness, this is not enough that just our village looks clean, our locality looks clean, this is not enough. Cleanliness is very important for our health. Lack of cleanliness is the main cause behind the rise of several diseases.

UNICEF has just completed the survey of 10,000 families in India. The survey was on the construction of toilets and yesterday I have read this thing in a news paper that UNICEF has said: If there is a toilet in the house then it saves the expenditure of around Rs. 50,000 per annum incurred due to diseases. Today, I got the good opportunity to work in the construction of a toilet in a small village nearby. And the people of that village have determined that they will make their village open defecation free by the 2nd October. The villagers have taken a solemn vow that not a single person will defecate in open from the 2nd October onward. And I am happy that I got the good opportunity to lay a stone for that toilet during this auspicious period of Navratra; it’s a kind of worship for me. For me cleanliness is equal to worship, cleanliness will rid the poor people of my country of diseases. Cleanliness will rid the poor people of my country of that burden that falls on them due to lack of cleanliness. And that is why it is my mission for the welfare of the poor people and I congratulate those who have been supporting me in this movement.

Today, I’m happy as generally toilet word is in use in our country but today in the village where I laid the foundation for a toilet, in that village, Izzatghar (the place of honor) was written on all the toilets in that village. I really liked this word- Izzatghar (the place of honor), and especially this toilet is indeed a place of honor for our sisters and daughters. And the house that has this Izzatghar is indeed a place of honor. And that village is also respected where there are toilets (the places of honor). And I also congratulate the government of Uttar Pradesh for coining this term Izzatghar (the place of honor), for identifying toilets as Izzatghars (the places of honor). They have given a new respect to toilets. This name of Izzatghar, this is my belief that whosoever who is mindful of honor, who is concerned about the honor, he will certainly construct a toilet (Izzatghar) and he will certainly use it and will become a man of honor.

Brothers and sisters, even today there are millions and millions of families in our country who don’t have their own house, who don’t have a roof on their heads. They survive in sub-human conditions. Brothers and sisters, it is our duty that we provide a roof on the head of the poorest of the poor, we provide a house to the poorest of the poor.

And brothers and sisters that is why we have taken a pledge. And I know that it’s a very difficult task. But If Modi will not do difficult thing then who else will do it. And brothers, that is why we have decided that when India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, then by that time we will provide a house to every poor person of India. Whether that poor person lives in a city or in a village, we have determined to provide a house to every such person in India who doesn’t have a house. And when millions and millions of houses will be constructed in India, we have to construct so many houses that in a way we have to construct a small country of Europe in India; we have to create so many houses. And when the new houses will be constructed then they will require bricks, they will require cement, steel, woods, it will provide employment to new people, it will provide the work of a mason, when millions and millions of houses will be constructed then it will create a new avenue of employment.

 Today, I’m happy as we used to write letters to the previous government in Uttar Pradesh, we used to tell them to prepare a list of those people of the state who don’t have a house, we used to ask them to give such a list to us as the government of India wanted to work out a scheme but I have to say this thing with sadness that the previous government had no interest in constructing the houses for the poor. When we applied too much pressure on them then they reluctantly gave us a list of just 10,000 people. But when Yogi Ji’s government came in to power then it immediately started working on this thing and as of today they have registered the names of millions of people in the list. It’s not just that, today, I was fortunate to hand over the funds to those people whose houses are going to be constructed.

Brothers and sisters, be it cleanliness or be it providing electricity to the villages or be it constructing toilets in schools or be it making the villages open defecation free or be it supplying electricity to every household or be it supplying the drinking water to people, our country has been indifferent towards all these things.

If the lives of our villages, our poor farmers change, if the lives of our middle class families change then the country will become what we want to make it and the first condition for this thing is that the relief is being provided to our middle class families, that relief is being provided to poor families to bring about changes in their lives. And that is why we have transformed all those schemes; we have strengthened all such schemes which can bring about change in the country.

Brothers and sisters, yesterday I got the opportunity to dedicate several cleanliness related projects in Banaras. A sewage treatment plant has been constructed at a cost of Rs. 600 crores, and we have kept the capacity of the plant such that it will be sufficient even for the expansion and growth of Banaras in the next 20 years, we have decided for this kind of massive work.

We have emphasized on the recycling of waste material - from waste to wealth. And we have decided to produce electricity from this waste material along with emphasizing on converting this waste material into wealth and we will supply the electricity produced from the waste material to 40,000 thousand houses. We have launched a movement to provide LED bulbs. The kind of electricity bulbs that have been installed in Kashi alone, every family will save money on account of saving in the electricity bill due to use of LED bulbs and when I calculated this thing then officers told me that the LED bulbs installed in Kashi alone will collectively reduce the electricity bill by Rs. 125 crore. You can imagine that common man’s money will be saved, somebody will save Rs. 500, someone will save Rs. 1,000 and someone else will save Rs. 250 and the entire city will save Rs. 125 crore, this in itself is a good effort by us to reduce the burden of poor and middle class.

It’s not that, the streetlights that have been installed in Kashi, they too have LED bulbs and due to use of LED bulbs in streetlights in Kashi alone, the electricity bill has come down by Rs. 13 crore. Municipal council of Kashi has saved Rs. 13 crore. And this 13 crore rupees will be used in the development of Kashi. It’s very easy, just replace the old bulbs with LED bulbs and it saves Rs. 125 crore of citizens and Rs. 13 crore of municipal council, this in itself is a proof that how we are bringing about transparency.

Brothers and sisters, be it black money or corruption or be it dishonesty; I’ve waged a massive battle against all these things. This country’s common man, honest man has to suffer because of this thing as dishonest people have been robbing the honest person. And brothers and sisters, that is why today this movement is emerging as a festival. The way small traders, petty traders have been joining GST, the way people are getting associated with Aadhaar, and the money that used to be siphoned off, all that money, every single penny of the public money will be spent in public welfare, we have started working on these things. We have been moving very fast. And that is why my dear brothers and sisters, development of villages of this place, development of poor people and farmers and development of our cities. Development; we have been moving forward with this formula alone. I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you who have turned up here in such a large number to give blessings. 

This is the parliamentary constituency of our Mahendra Pandey Ji, and I express my heartfelt gratitude for the energy, enthusiasm and the zeal that you have shown. Once again I congratulate the Yogi government for the successful initiatives and I also congratulate and thank him the way he has successfully taken the steps to transform the Uttar Pradesh within six months and moving ahead in that direction successfully.

Please join me in chanting – Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail Mother India).

Please say with your full strength - Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail Mother India).

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail Mother India).

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail Mother India).

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail Mother India).

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today performed Shramdaan for the construction of a twin pit toilet at Shahanshahpur village in Varanasi. He interacted with the people, who have resolved to make the village open-defecation-free. He appreciated their initiative of naming the toilet ""Izzat Ghar."" 

The Prime Minister visited a Pashudhan Arogya Mela organised at the village. He was briefed on various health and medical activities being performed at the premises. These included surgeries on cattle, ultrasonography etc. 

Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, and the State Government, for the successful setting up of the Pashudhan Arogya Mela. He said this is a new effort which would benefit the animal husbandry sector in the State. He said that increase in milk productivity will lead to economic benefit for the people. He said cooperatives can help consolidate the gains in the dairy sector, as has been the case in other parts of the country. 

Describing the well-being of people as the priority for governance, the Prime Minister reiterated the pledge to double farm incomes by 2022. He noted that soil health cards are benefiting farmers significantly. He said each one of us should resolve to make a positive contribution by 2022, to achieve the India that our freedom fighters dreamt of. 

The Prime Minister said that the feeling of ""cleanliness being our responsibility"", needs to be inculcated among all. He said this would go a long way towards ensuring wellness, and protecting the health of the poor. He said Swachhta is like a prayer for him, and cleanliness is a way to serve the poor.

                Postal stamps have their own importance in our country and also in the world. In a way, postal stamps reflect the history of a country. They also work like ambassadors. When our postal articles are delivered in other countries, there are people there who collect our postal stamps. Sometimes postal stamps of a country reveal the kind of changes that country has gone through. In a way the stamp informs about those changes. India’s postal department has continuously been making this kind of contribution.

Today, a postal stamp related to the life of Lord Ram is being unveiled. I could have done this in Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi. I could have done it at the Prime Minister’s residence. However, it occurred to us that this is the auspicious occasion of Navratri and Navratri and Vijayadashmi had their special importance in the life of Lord Ram. And there can be no place more appropriate than Manas Mandir for dedication of this postal stamp to the public because the place bears the live memories of Tulsidas Ji even today. Since I had to come to Kashi so I had a discussion with the department of post. Several stamps have been issued in the honor of Lord Ram Ji but this is first such collection of stamps in which different aspects of life of Lord Ram have been shown through postal stamps. It appears that it is just one stamp, however, it is a collection of several stamps. So, in a way this kind of work has never been published on the life or Lord Ram in form of postal stamps. This is for the first time this kind of thing has been done today. I’m happy that I got the opportunity to do this thing from the holy land of Manas. And the life of Lord Ram is a source of inspiration for everyone.

If we remember Mahatma Gandhi, Lord Ram was a Mantra of his life since his childhood days. Every aspect of the life of this great man is a source of inspiration for the modern society. On behalf of government of India, I release this postal stamp on the auspicious occasion of Navratri while bowing down to the Lord Ram. I convey my happiness and I thank all of you for coming here.

                Present here on the dais, the governor of Uttar Pradesh Mr. Ram Naik Ji, the popular chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mr. Yogi Adityanath Ji, my colleague in the union council of ministers cabinet Shrimati Smrti Irani Ji, my colleague in the union council of ministers Shri Ajay Tamta Ji, deputy chief minister of the state Shriman Keshav Prasad Maurya Ji, member of Parliament from this area who worked well with me in the union council of minister for several years and now looking after the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh Bhartiya Janta Party Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey Ji, chairman of railway board Shriman Ashwani Ji, managing director of Utkarsh Bank Shriman Govind Singh Ji who has taken upon himself the noble task of financial inclusion in a very detailed manner, in a very wise manner for the welfare of poor people, for making them self-dependent and my dear brothers and sisters of Banaras who are present here in large numbers,

Today, public dedication and foundation laying of projects worth more than thousand crore rupees are going to take place in just one program through just one platform. I’m extremely grateful to the government of Uttar Pradesh as it has played an extremely important role in the development of Banaras region, in realizing our dream of development of Eastern India. And therefore the state government is also worthy of praise. A Rs. 300 crore project of the textile ministry which is being dedicated to the public today, I don’t think that such a massive project on the land of Banaras has been executed in the last several decades. And we ourselves inaugurate those projects for which the foundations were laid by us. Otherwise, foundations for projects are being laid due to the political expediencies then those projects get stuck, they have never been completed. Here, two bridges have been dedicated to public which have been stuck for so long, but after assuming the power Yogi Ji took it upon himself and today it has been realized and it opens the doors of development for the people living on the other side, it increases the convenience.

Today, I think it’s a golden opportunity for weavers and artisan brothers and sisters. You already have these skills received from your ancestors but who knows about the wonders performed in a forest. If this situation continues then my weaver and artisan brothers from the Kashi area cannot get the opportunity to introduce their strength to the world. This is such an initiative; if our small time weaver brothers, artisan brothers, their economic activities get stuck if they don’t get a global market for their products that have been produced by them using their skills, their craft. When I was talking to these weaver brothers after being elected as a new MP then I was told that now their kids didn’t want to join the same trade; their family members want to leave this work; they want to go out of this work by getting education. And at that time I realised that if such a powerful economic activity will be given up by these families then the history will never forgive us. Because you have such a great tradition that you can mesmerize the world. And as the time passes by the world is getting attracted towards these specialties of India. And that is why this building constructed at a cost of Rs. 300 crore is not just a building.

It is something that gives the introduction of strength of India, it encompasses such a story of strength of our weavers and artisans of Kashi area who have the power to open new doors for the future. I would like to appeal local auto rickshaw drivers, to local taxi drivers that if a tourist comes to visit Kashi then you must bring him here. You insist on bringing them here and familiarize them with the strength of Kashi at one place. And if a tourist comes here then he will certainly buy something. And if a foreign tourist comes here then he would not like to leave this place. The museum that has been constructed it will promote the tourism in Kashi. Those people who come to visit Kashi due to their faith, when they will see these things, when they will come to know about the strength of Kashi then I’m confident that it will also promote tourism in Kashi. And these arts and crafts of Kashi will also be strengthened and it will become a new centre for economic activity.

Today, I convey my sincere regards to all my weaver brothers and sisters, to all my artisan brothers and sisters while dedicated this thing to them. And I convey my best wishes to them for their economic progress.

Brothers and sisters, the solution for every problem eventually lies in development. Earlier those governments were in power which had a tendency of disliking the development; during their tenure the government exchequer was destroyed for the projects aimed at winning elections. It is our effort to realize those things of development that will create opportunity for bringing about changes in the lives of poorest of the poor people. It should lead to economic empowerment of our poor people. It should lead to strengthening of their capacity. It should result in some economic activity for them. If they get an opportunity to work then I believe that no poor person of India wants to remain poor. You ask any poor person: ‘Would you like to give the same kind of life full of misery that you yourself have lived?’ Even the poorest of the poor person will say: I have endured what was my fate, whatever I got from my fathers and forefathers, I have lived my life but I don’t want my next generation to be condemned to lead this life of poverty. No poor person has a desire to pass on its poverty as a legacy to his next generation. He also wants to lead such a life that he doesn’t leave a life full of poverty for his children. He wants them to become self dependant, wants to them work hard, do something and learn new things, he wants to develop them in such a way that they can lead a life with dignity. My government has the same dream as a poor person has for his next generation. And that is why in all our schemes we are making effort in that direction that every section of the society is being empowered, so that it gets the strength to become self-dependant. I’d specially like to congratulate Utkarsh Bank for placing emphasis on this thing in this region; the work done by our Govind Ji and his team is commendable as they have shown this kind of dedication for this thing.

 

Brothers and sisters,

Today, a water ambulance has been dedicated to public in Kashi and also a waterborne hearse. Some people were surprised when I had mooted the idea of a waterborne hearse.

I told them that we should use the waterways for solving the traffic related problems of Kashi and also for solving the problems of the people associated with the last journey of a deceased person. Our waterways have their own strength. And we have made several attempts to link them with our economic development, with the convenience of a common man and to develop them for tourism related activities. And under that process today this thing is being dedicated to the public.

 

My dear brothers and sisters of Banaras,

You are aware that when I came to contest the election from Banaras then I was simultaneously contesting the election from Baroda as well. And I was elected with a huge margin from Baroda, and I was elected from huge margin from Banaras as well. But when the question of vacating one seat arose then I thought to myself that I have a lot of colleagues for the progress of Baroda and they will not leave any stone unturned for the development of Baroda. But if I dedicate my life for Kashi then perhaps I will get some satisfaction. And that is why I opted to serve Kashi but today I’m happy as Baroda and Kashi are getting linked today. Vadodara and Banaras have been linked through Mahamana Express. Today, Mahamana express has been launched from here and Vadodara. This Mahamana Express will come to Banaras from Vadodara via Surat. Textile industry from Ahmedabad in Gujarat gradually came to Banaras. And today, once again through the Mahamana Express; Baroda is also a city of culture, it is also a place for education; Banaras too is a city of culture and education and the linking of these two cities via Surat which is also a textile city, this is such a railway system which is directly related to common man of the Eastern Uttar Pradesh but it is related more to economic activities. I’d like to congratulate to the ministry of railway…our railways minister Piyush Ji has just flagged off Mahamana Express from Baroda and our railway minister (MoS railways) Shriman Manoj Sinha Ji, who is a son of the soil of this place, he is flagging off the train from Surat. Today, it’s a unique moment at the time of public dedication of Mahamana Express.

 

Brothers and sisters,

I don’t want to take much of your time but today the country has been making progress at a rapid pace and it’s being done by putting the welfare of poor people, by putting the welfare of middle class people at its centre. Several courageous steps have been taken. With a lot of courage those issues are being solved that had been stuck for 20-25 years. Decisions are taken with a lot of courage. And today as a result of it the entire world is watching this thing that India is making rapid progress, India is changing. We have to bring about changes in Eastern UP, in Eastern India as well. We have been working in that direction to bring about that strength in the economy of eastern part of the country as it is there in the western part of the country. Today, I believe that these projects worth Rs. 1,000 crore will play an important role in bringing about the changes in the economic and social life of this place and also in the infrastructure of this place. And once again I congratulate and I thank Yogi Ji for performing the wonders in a short span of six months, and also for the fast pace of work done under his leadership.

The Prime Minister had laid the foundation stone of this Centre in November 2014. Today, he visited the Centre, and was given an overview of the facilities developed there, before arriving on the dais for the dedication.

Shri Narendra Modi flagged off the Mahamana Express through a video link. This train will connect Varanasi with Surat and Vadodara in Gujarat.

The Prime Minister also unveiled plaques to mark the laying of Foundation Stone and dedication of various development works in the city. He inaugurated banking services of the Utkarsh Bank, and unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of foundation stone of the headquarters building of the Bank.

The Prime Minister dedicated a Jal Ambulance service, and a Jal Shav Vahan service to the people of Varanasi, through a video link. He distributed tool-kits and solar lamps to weavers and their children.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that in one programme from one dais, projects worth over 1000 crore have been either dedicated, or their foundation stone laid.

He described the Trade Facilitation Centre as one of the biggest projects for Varanasi for a long time. He said this Centre would help the artisans and weavers showcase their skills to the world, and facilitate a brighter future for them. He asked the people to encourage all tourists to visit this Centre. He said this would result in increased demand of handicrafts, and also boost the tourism potential of Varanasi, and indeed the economy of the city.

The Prime Minister said the solution to all problems is through development. He said the Government is focused on bringing about positive change in the lives of the poor and of succeeding generations. In this context, he praised the efforts of Utkarsh Bank.

Referring to the Jal Ambulance and Jal Shav Vahini launched today, the Prime Minister said that these represent the drive for development even through water-ways.

In the context of the Mahamana Express, the Prime Minister observed that Vadodara and Varanasi, which happen to be the two constituencies from which he contested the 2014 Parliamentary elections, are now connected via railway.

The Prime Minister said the country is progressing rapidly today, and firm decisions are being taken in the interest of the nation. He said eastern India must match the progress of the western part of the country, and the projects being launched today would go a long way in achieving this objective.

                All the dignitaries present here who have come from different parts of the country and have been associated with the cooperative movement.

Along with the celebrations on the occasion of the birth centenary of Laxmanrao Ji Inamdar Ji, you people are also going to have a comprehensive deliberation throughout the day to find the ways to provide more momentum to this cooperative movement, to provide new energy and find the ways to collectively solve the problem of the common man while maintaining the sensitivity towards the society and also to find the solutions of the problems through cooperation and cooperatives.

Our country is prolific in producing great souls. There is infinite series of men in every period, in every region who lived for the society and who gave something or some other thing to the society during their lifetime.

There is no period in the history, and even today there is no part of the land where we can’t see the people who are dedicated to the society. There are several people who during their tenure become the topic of discussion among the people due to TV, due to news papers, due to the publicity and also due to the honors and recognition given to them; and since they become a topic of discussion so sometimes they appear larger than life. However, this is such a country which has a very large pool of those people who never make it to the headlines of news papers, those who never appear on the glittering television screen. They never receive the applause or recognition or awards. But they dedicate their lives like a silent worker, like one lamp lighting another and then lighting thousands of lamps in the similar manner, they lead their lives in this manner by sacrificing, by dedicating their bodies and lives for the ideals, for the values. The value of their services to the country is no less despite them being an unknown face. Vakil Saheb was one such person.

Today, some may wonder that we never heard of his name and you people are celebrating his birth centenary. I admit that you might not have heard the name but precisely that was the most unique thing about him. By keeping oneself in the backdrop; and I believe that this is the first formula for the success of cooperatives to keep oneself away from these things as much as possible while putting people ahead by working together, this is the most important formula for the cooperatives.

He dedicated his life in development of people; he found this thing as a way for the development of the nation. It’s my good fortune that I got the opportunity to spend a big part of my life with him.I spent several years of my youth under his direction. And that is why his life was constant source of inspiration for me. And when I was writing a book on his life; it was around 25-30 years ago.

And I was surprised when I looked at his life closely though I had lived with him, I had lived with him for several years. But there were several things that became known only after his death, so it was a good example of this thing that how he had lived his life.He worked as a gem of this great tradition of leading a humble lifestyle while making a constant effort to avoid limelight for the growth of his colleagues, to strengthen their capabilities, and to give strength to an idea.

There will be several programmes related to the centenary year. The cooperative movement will get a new strength. But today when we are moving ahead in the context of his contribution to the cooperative movement on his birth centenary then you are going to deliberate this issue throughout the day. You are going to discuss the best global practices in the field of cooperatives.

How we can move ahead in the field of agriculture through cooperatives? How to double the income of our farmers by 2022? What are the good things that we should adopt and what are the bad things that we must shun to mould our agriculture, to mould our rural life, as per the requirement of a modern India, how to prepare them in that direction of development? Now this is not possible that while the cities develop but we leave behind the villages. A balanced development is required. Equal opportunities for growth are required. And collective working is the fundamental for balanced growth and for equal opportunities. Shortcomings emerge in the systems due to passage of time. Some systems become time barred.

Every person in the field of cooperatives should keep reflecting on these issues. In case, this understanding develops in us that cooperative is a structure, it’s a legal system, it is something that has been created under some rules, under a constitutional framework and if we fit ourselves in that framework then we will automatically become a cooperative. I think it will be a big mistake.

It’s such a big country. Systems are required, rules and structures are required, and do’s and don’ts are also required, this is an essential thing. But cooperatives don’t work that way, cooperative is a spirit, it’s not a system, it’s an spirit. And values are important for this spirit that is why Inamdar Ji used to say this thing several times that without values there can’t be a cooperative.

Today, sometimes it feels that whether that spirit has been lost somewhere in the system or not? Can we get a bigger inspiration than Vakil Saheb to revive, to reenergize the spirit of cooperative? And, the more strength we will give to the spirit of cooperative, so if there is a flaw in the system then perhaps that flaw will be rectified.

In our country, the village has been the basis of the entire cooperative movement. But we cannot deny that when the world of urban cooperatives started to develop under the same rules and regulation, particularly in the banking sector, that too in urban sector, then the kind of changes that took place, when the systematic breakdown started to happen then the sphere of apprehensions and suspicion continued to expand. Even today, some kind of sacredness can be felt in the cooperative movement associated with rural life.

Even farmers feel that this is the right path for him and the people those who have been investing their time in cooperative movement for this thing they also feel that they have been doing something for the poor farmer, for the village through this thing. So you people are going to discuss all these things today. I have a small topic in my mind that I want to share with you people, I hope that you will certainly discuss that.

There have been several problems of Indian farmers, but if we look at this thing that our farmer purchases at a retail rate and sells at a wholesale rate. Can this thing be reversed, that he purchases at a wholesale rate and sells at a retail price? Then nobody would be able to exploit him. No middleman will be able to take advantage of him. Those people who have studied the dairy industry, the cooperative dairy, then please mark this thing that it’s unique in the sense that under that system the farmer purchases and sells at the wholesale rate. Look, this uniqueness is fundamental in the success of dairy industry that farmer sells and purchases at the wholesale rate. Why? Earlier if was in the business of producing milk then he used to sell one litre milk to each of the 10 households, today, he goes to one collection centre to sell that same 10 litre of milk, it means that he sells in the wholesale market. And if he makes purchases then this too is being done through the dairy, the food for his livestock, the medicines for them and if he needs to take care of his livestock then all these facilities are collectively provided to the entire village.

And as a result of this thing, he continued to get some or some other benefits from the dairy, he was protected and it became a means for additional income. And in every other sector he has one difficulty. Look, if he sells the milk to the private sector at the wholesale rate then he would not have this kind of income. It became the basis of his income as it was the cooperative sector. Can we launch such a cooperative movement, one is already there as per the tradition. Earlier there were five cooperatives, these are being run by those people, I will show them, I will create the sixth one. There is a new form of cooperative. If these five have been running, let them run. But there are 10 such areas where no one has done anything and can we solve the problems of those sectors through cooperative, can I do it? There are plenty of such areas which have been untouched by cooperatives. And if they have been touched by cooperatives then there is an intense competition, if it is sugar, if it is milk then there will be a lot of competition. It’s a natural thing that wherever there is some benefit then there will be competition. However, there are plenty of sectors where an entire generation will have to dedicate itself then only the cooperative will be strengthened.

Can we inspire a new generation in the cooperative movement with a new spirit, particularly, to fundamentally transform the rural life? Cooperative movement completely suits the disposition of our country.

It’s not a borrowed idea; it’s completely suitable to our fundamental way of thinking, to our fundamental values. And therefore it’s very natural that it flourishes here. You don’t have to inject yourself for this thing. All the other systems, if we adopt them, they are borrowed systems, and there is some resistance due to foreign element. It’s a part of our natural, routine system and we can do it collectively.

For example, today, as we have been using Neem coated urea. Farmers have benefited immensely from this thing, and the struggle to get urea has diminished because of this. But the collection of Neem legume for coating of the urea, extraction of oil after its collection and then supply of that oil to the urea factory; all this have become a new big thing. And if our village women form the cooperative societies and the Neem which is required for this Neem coating, if they only collect legume from those areas, from the forests where Neem trees have been found then it can open a new sector of entrepreneurship, a new cooperative can be started.

I regularly tell to all my friends in the dairy industry that you encourage the farmers for raising the livestock but we should also insist, we should also emphasise on bee keeping, we should bring about a revolution in the field of honey, we should bring about a sweet revolution in the country. This honey revolution can be brought about through cooperatives. Honey, as the farmer keeps the livestock, as he is engaged in the milk production, similarly he can pick 50 bees and he can easily increase his income by 1.5 to 2 lakh rupees per annum. And the dairy that collects the milk can also collect the honey, they can collect the honey. And as the milk is processed in the dairy, honey should also be processed, it has a market. If the chemical wax sells for 100 rupees a kilo then bee was sells for 400-450 rupees per kilo, there is a huge demand. There is a huge market in India itself but our farmers are not part of it even today. And there are hundreds of species of bees and it also benefits the crops immensely. And honey bee works like an ambassador, acts like a cattle engager for those people who have been working in the field of horticulture. I mean to say that there are plenty of new areas, how do we move forward in those areas?

Our brothers and sisters from the fisherman community who live in the coastal areas; their work halts for almost five months in a year due to weather, it’s dangerous to go out in the sea during the rainy season therefore it is being stopped. But the cultivation of sea-weed is not becoming popular in our country. If our fisherman brothers start cultivating sea-weeds on our sea shores through the cooperative movement then it’s laboratory proven thing that it is a much sought after basic material for the pharmaceutical industry. Suppose that you don’t get the market for the sea-weed, it has life cycle of 45 days, in the sea, sea-weeds become ready for harvest after 45 days and you can harvest its crop after every 45 days. And you can harvest the crop of sea-weed everyday if you raise 45 sea-weed farms under the sea. And even if you don’t do anything else then you can just extract its juice and spray that juice in the field. So it can be a very big market of preserving the soil through the use of sea-weed juice. You don’t have to do much, it doesn’t require any hard work. Through cooperative movement, can we open this opportunity for our fisherman brothers living in the coastal areas whose work stops for nearly five months, and women folk of whose family are available for this work day and night? I mean to say that cooperative movements in the country can bring about big changes in our rural economy through these small things.

I would like to call upon our friends from the field of cooperative movementthose who are present here today that they should publicise this movement even more, that they will rope in more and more people with them and in the true sense of the word our cooperative movement, in the equal partnership,should be used for the growth of the common man while protecting his interest as per the sentiments that Vakil Saheb attached to the cooperative movement, as per the values that he had attached to the cooperative movement, as per the kind of sensitivity that he had called upon to be attached to the cooperative movement and as per those fundamental elements and those fundamental values.

With this hope only, and while having the sacred memories of Vakil Saheb, I convey my best wishes to all of you. Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a Sahkar Sammelan in New Delhi, on the occasion of the birth centenary celebrations of Shri Laxmanrao Inamdar.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that our country is a “Bahuratna Vasundhara” where many people have made great contributions across regions and time periods. He said that while some of them become well known and are talked about by the media, there are many others who make valuable contributions, even though they remain largely unknown. The Prime Minister said that Vakil Saheb – Laxmanrao Inamdar – was one such person. The Prime Minister emphasized that the first principle of the cooperative movement is to unite everyone, even while remaining anonymous. He said that Shri Inamdar had imbibed this principle, and his life is a source of inspiration.

The Prime Minister spoke of the goals such doubling farmers’ income by 2022, and balanced development in rural and urban areas. He said the cooperative movement can play a key role in the achievement of these objectives.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preserving the “spirit” in the cooperative movement, which he said is still largely intact in the rural areas. He reiterated Shri Inamdar’s mantra of “Bina Sanskar, Nahin Sahkar.”

The Prime Minister said that today, the farmer buys in retail, but sells in wholesale. He said the process needs to be reversed, to eliminate middlemen and help raise incomes. Giving the example of dairy cooperatives, he said that the cooperative movement has the capacity to solve people’s problems. He added that the cooperative movement is in sync with the nature of Indian society. The Prime Minister mentioned neem coating of urea, bee keeping, and sea-weed cultivation, as areas where the cooperative movement could contribute significantly.

The Prime Minister released two books: one on Shri Laxmanrao Inamdar, and one titled “Nine Gems of Indian Cooperative Movement.” He also gave away awards for cooperative excellence, on the occasion.

Ms. Aishwarya and Ms. Saundarya briefly performed the ""Maithreem Bhajatha."" This is a benediction which was also rendered by M.S. Subbulakshmi herself in October 1966, at the United Nations.

The benediction was composed in Sanskrit by Acharya Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati of Kanchi.

It is an anthem for universal friendship and world peace, which was sung by M.S. Subbulakshmi, in most of her subsequent concerts, after the UN concert. It ends with the words “Srey o bhooyat sakala jananam” - Let grace and happiness abound for all mankind.

                (Following is the Hindi Translation of what PM spoke in Gujarati) 

My brothers and sisters present here in large numbers,

Kem Chho, badhaa?

(How are you? Good!)

I think the ground is not big enough; there is no space outside also. Do you remember which Prime Minister you met here last? No! No? Did any Prime Minister come here? It’s okay. This was in my destiny only.

First of all, I would like to praise the cooperative society of Amreli district in which a new generation is engaged now. There was a time when Ratubhai and other great personalities were active in the cooperative world. Both the cooperative and government sectors were controlled by these great men. But for the past few years, the new team is taking Amreli district to new heights of development. I had a meeting with the APMC market of Amreli earlier also but the kind of wonders our PP has performed these days, the kind of model he has developed is really praiseworthy. Many congratulations to PP and his team.

Dilipbhai is very hard working; work is his life. He cannot live without work. He keeps on thinking about how to do something new. I remember that our former governments in Gujarat had made such decisions that it was not possible for the dairy industry in Saurashtra to develop. They never came here. It was in such a poor condition. We made policy level changes. First of all, Dilipbhai decided that this situation needs to change and today I am content that he was able to accomplish this thing. Today the entire Amreli has benefited. The people of the entire Amreli, be it the cattle breeders, or farmers, or people involved in milk production directly or indirectly have got a proper market. Not only this, they also received adequate and fair prices in exchange for milk. Today, I am satisfied that even after being such a huge success the work in this direction has not stopped, but APMC has used modern technology and created a Soil Testing Lab. They also made a Lab for the grading of the goods coming in the market. Government of India has launched the eNAM scheme through which farmers can sell their products in any market in which they get the best price. A digital platform has been developed by Government of India which requires a gradation lab that has also been accomplished by PP Bhai. I firmly believe that Amreli has shown a new path for the other APMCs of Gujarat. I congratulate him and Amreli was the first in the world of APMC in Gujarat. And today after six decades again Amreli has become the first to show a new path in the world of modern technology, and must be congratulated for this feat. 

 

Today I want to draw your attention to two things.

The first thing that is happening here is the launch of Sweet Revolution and the other is the 1600 km long shoreline of Gujarat which can lead a Blue Revolution. Our brothers and sisters from the fishing community, our maritime asset, they can move ahead by taking the example of a new revolution. The process of giving a new dimension to both the rural Gujarat and its coastal areas is beginning with these schemes. Government of India has planned that on the lines of green revolution and white revolution, we must also move in the direction of a sweet revolution.  A year or a year-and-a-half ago, I had spoken to Dilip Bhai and all of them that like we go and collect milk from the farmers, similarly we can collect honey also. And if someone keeps 50 honeybees then he can sell honey worth at least 2 lakh rupees in a year. This is an additional income and due to bee keeping, there is an increase in the farm produce as well as honeybees supplement farming, today I got the opportunity to lay the foundation-stone for that thing as well.

Secondly, if you go to any other corner of India then sweets are offered before any auspicious work, Gujarat is the only state which offers ice cream during auspicious work and today Amreli is also starting a dairy ice cream plant. Many congratulations for both these new schemes and government of India will offer 400 lakh rupees for these schemes so that the work on these schemes can move ahead smoothly.

I would request my brothers in the farming community that bee farming can be done naturally in the fields without any extra effort and if we make arrangements for that and if we market the produce well then it can generate good revenue. And not only that, let’s assume that there is no sale then the children at our homes will have honey, it is very good for health. And therefore for sweet revolution, wherever there is dairy network in Gujarat we will connect it with honey revolution and move towards a new revolution in India.

India's sea coast is vast, but Gujarat's sea coast makes a huge contribution to the Blue Revolution. We are moving towards water ways, towards Ghogha-Dahej ferry service. We are working on port development; we are working on port led development. If we are required to send goods through the coastal route to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh or we can deliver tiles from our Morbi to Kolkata in the East at a minimum cost through sea route. So, in a way, the government is working towards pushing the blue revolution which will lead to a major change in the livelihood of those living along the coasts of Gujarat. Encouraging the youth of coastal Gujarat to join navy, to train them and guide them so that they can join navy to serve our mother India, government of India is promoting such schemes to encourage them to do so. Our Rupala Ji told me just a while ago that after Jivraj Mehta, no new college has come up here. And after Jivraj Bhai Mehta this revolution took place in the education sector only after we came to power. Broad gauge railway, National Highway, Amreli people had given up hope that such things will ever come here. You have given me a chance to serve in Delhi, today both your demands are moving forward at a fast pace.

Brothers and sisters, we will soon complete 75 years of our independence. During the freedom struggle, Amreli district was at forefront among all the districts. How do we celebrate 75 years of our independence, what kind of India should we gift to those who fought for our freedom, how do we give them the India of their dreams? I think that right now our Amreli district, municipalities of Amreli, Tehsil panchayats of Amreli, district panchayats of Amreli, village panchayats, cooperative societies, educational institutions, social institutions should collectively resolve that by 2022, within five years, we will give this much to the country in any case, and fulfill that resolution by planning what we should do on daily basis during these five years. We must complete our journey from resolution to accomplishment. It is our dream that the income of the farmer of our country doubles by 2022.

Brothers and sisters, if we move ahead in a systematic way, if we move ahead with precision, then the Indian farmer has this kind of strength and the government, the society and the farmers can achieve this by working together. But for that we will have to move away from traditional systems and go towards modernity. New things will have to be accepted. Today we have completed the Narmada project; it is a glorious day in the life of Gujarat. It is a very glorious day; but if we develop the habit of using Narmada water through drip irrigation, and also introduce drip irrigation to our farming system then not only it will benefit us but we will be able to benefit our generations for the next 100 years. And therefore we have ensured that we will use Narmada water in that particular way. Gujarat has taken a big step. Gujarat accounts for 25% of the total drip irrigation practiced in the country and farmers of Gujarat deserve congratulations for that. But things should not stop at that, there is a lot of scope to do much more and we must try in that direction. Two other things with agriculture: many farmers have gone towards solar pump. Not a single rupee electricity bill will be there. Using a solar panel in his own farm, the farmer can run a pump and get water from that pump. If farmers are able to save on electricity bills then their expenses is reduced by thousands of rupees. Nowadays many farmers are moving towards the solar-powered pumps in big scale. Now tell me if you have drip irrigation, solar pumps and electricity generated from solar power, will it reduce the expenses or not? Income will increase or not? And our land has a good use and therefore it is my request to the farmers that they must come forward in this direction also so that friends of cooperative movement can move forward in this direction. 

Together all the farmers must install solar panels near their farms and produce electricity collectively and as a result,  farmers will come out of two of their main expenditures - electricity and water. Just imagine the change it will bring to the lives of farmers. There is one more thing which I would request; we waste almost 2 to 3 meters of our land by putting wire fence around it. Can we do timber farming there instead? Government of India is contemplating to bring a new law so that farmers who do timber farming at the periphery of their fields, they will get the rights to sell that timber and the forest department of the government will not trouble them in any way; thus enabling the farmers with more power. Our government is working towards bringing such a law. Our land is lying useless and the country has to import timber wood from abroad. If the farmers of our country want then they can do timber farming and put an end to the import of timber wood. Won’t it increase the income of farmers?

 

And in addition to all these things animal husbandry is also there. If we compare per cattle milk production in our country then it is far below than the global average. How the livestock should be raised? What arrangements should be made to keep them healthy? What kind of fodder they should be fed? As per our old traditions they eat whatever they get and because of that our per-cattle milk production is far less than the potential. Today, what does a farmer do if he wants to increase the milk production? He will increase the number of cattle from two to four, from four to eight, which in turn increases his cost.  Instead of that if we focus on how we can get more milk from just two animals then the income of the farmer will increase and the burden on the farmer will also be reduced. Since the animal husbandry work is done mainly by our sisters, so they get good training. We are working in that direction.

In a way, for the first time our farmers are being protected in the country. Schemes like Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme - Krishi Bima Yojana has been launched. For the first time there is a scheme for you people to get insurance amount if there is no crop because of natural calamity. If the harvest is still lying in the field and within 15 days rain comes, still the money is paid for that harvest. This kind of insurance scheme has been brought for the first time by the government of India. And for every rupee farmers have to pay only 2 paise, responsibility of the remaining 98 paise will be jointly borne by the central and the state governments. Two paise for every rupee, this humongous task has become possible because you have installed a government in Delhi which loves farmers. And today farmers are also benefitting from that.

Farmers are moving towards crop insurance. Those who have a habit of doing wrong things they will take time; but I know they will feel that despite doing wrong things they are getting benefits and they can live well. Then the wrongdoer will turn to the other side and the righteous people will get a lot of benefits; the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme is like this. 

We do farming and horticulture in our country but in spite of that fruits and vegetables worth crores of rupees go waste. We have set up a Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. Under this scheme value addition to the goods that have been produced is being done. If you sell raw mango then you will get less money but if you sell ripe mangoes then you will get more money. This is called value addition. If you make pickle from the raw mangoes then you will get more money. And if you pack it beautifully and advertise your product then you will get even better prices, this is called value addition. Green chilies will be sold cheap; red chilies will sell for more. But if chilies are converted into chili powder then it will get even a higher price. With value addition farmers also get more benefits. If you sell milk you will get less money, if you prepare Khoya (condensed milk) and sell it then you will get more money. If you prepare Pedas from Khoya and sell it then you will make yet more money. Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sampada Yojana to take farmers on the path of value addition. Government has planned to make Food Park on a large scale. In the month of November we are calling companies from all over the world in the field of food processing so that they can guide our farmers by supporting them in the value addition of their produce. Government of India has made provisions of thousands of crores of rupees via Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sampada Scheme to encourage our farmers to come forward in the area of food processing.

 

Brothers and sisters, villages of Gujarat should become prosperous; farmers of Gujarat should prosper; farmers of our country should get the benefit of this scheme and farmers of our country should become prosperous. And today when government of India is moving ahead with so many projects to bring an economic revolution in the rural life of the country and when our Amreli district has taken many projects under the cooperative sector in White Revolution, Sweet Revolution, Blue Revolution, APMC and Dairy Engineering then Government of India will always be with you. Whenever you move ahead you will always find Government of India with you. This is the policy of Government of India and any district, any cooperative scheme of any district can benefit from it. Amreli should take its full advantage; districts of Gujarat should take full advantage of this thing.

Many congratulations to all you.

                Long live Mother India.

Long live Mother India.

I have visited Dabhoi many times; sometimes I used to come by bus, sometimes on scooter, sometimes I took meeting of the workers, and sometimes I used to address public gatherings. So a lot of my memories are associated with all of you. But I have never seen such a spectacular sight earlier in Dabhoi. This humongous sea of people is a living symbol of the devotion to mother Narmada.

Today it is Vishwakarma Jayanti. For centuries in India, people who work with their hands, who sweat, who toil, who work in construction sector; Be it a technician, an engineer, a mason, lime and cement workers, who are related to the work of architecture, all of them are seen as Vishwakarma in India; today it is the festival of birth anniversary of such Vishwakarma. And therefore, there can be no greater coincident than this that on Vishwakarma Jayanti, the followers of Vishwakarma, those who have created this Sardar Sarovar Dam; to remember the virtue of their hard work, to remember the virtue of their harsh practice, it is a privilege to gift Mother India this massive Sardar Sarovar Dam in India.

Brothers and sisters, Many people are congratulating me here on my birthday today. The people who have congratulated me, people who have conveyed their best wishes, I express my gratitude to them from the bottom of my heart and on my birthday, the emotions that have been manifested today by the people, I will not fall short on my efforts to refine myself and to live each moment of my life to fulfill their dreams. I’ll live for the sake of your dreams, I’ll sacrifice myself to fulfill your dreams, and to make your dreams come true by mobilizing the power of 1.25 billion Indians we will surely build a new India.

One Gandhi, lean and thin Gandhi, while practicing in Sabarmati's ashram, could unite the countrymen for freedom, then with the blessings of mother Narmada, with the blessings of Sabarmati, with the blessings of sacrifice and penance of the heroes of our country, with the blessings of the great men of this country, 1.25 billion people, on the completion of 75 years of independence, they will leave no stone unturned in the making of a new India, I have full faith in this.

Brothers and sisters, This Sardar Sarovar Dam, today, India’s Ironman Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's soul, wherever it may be, it will be showering a lot of blessings on us. Who is called a visionary? 71 years ago, before the independence, even before I was born, before many of us were born, Sardar Patel dreamed of Sardar Sarovar Dam.

Our country got independence, today I want to say it with great confidence that if two of our great men had survived for a few more years, then this Sardar Sarovar Dam would have been built in the 60-70s, all the states of west India would have had plenty of water and would have been green. The western states of India would have gotten a chance to provide phenomenal financial capabilities to India. And these two great men were - one, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, who had dreamed how Narmada River and its significance can transform the requirements of Gujarat, the life in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. How he envisioned the outline of this project. And the other great personality was, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Those who have had the opportunity to study Baba Saheb Ambedkar, they can see that the number of schemes which were presented by revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar for bringing water revolution in India, for building waterways and maritime capabilities of India, during his very short term in the council of ministers, the number of schemes or projects that were imagined by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, hardly any government could even think about it.

If these two great men would have been alive for a few more years and if we had the opportunity to benefit from their services for a few more years, then my dear countrymen, the states which get ruined due to floods today, or where the farmers are dying due to drought, our country would have come out of these problems long ago and it would have scaled new heights of development. But it was our misfortune that we lost these two great personalities long ago. Today this Sardar Sarovar Dam is being dedicated to India, it is being dedicated to 1.25 billion citizens of India, it is being dedicated to the land of Sardar Patel and Gandhi Ji, on the land which brought a new change in the life of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, because of Gaikwads; it is being dedicated from that land. This will be a symbol of a new force of the country, with this belief today, remembering all these great personalities, I dedicate this grand and divine project to the people of the country and to the Mother India.

Brother and sisters, 

It is very natural that projects are being planned and completed, but perhaps the hardships that mother Narmada had to face or this project had to endure in India, there was no such force in the world, which did not create obstacles in it’s way. World Bank decided that they will not lend money for Sardar Sarovar Dam. For India, such a huge project of thousands of crores of rupees was not possible without financial help. And the same World Bank also said that the project is against environment as the miscreants of bad publicity had spread so much lies. Brothers, sisters, we had also decided, World Bank or No World Bank, we will definitely complete this Sardar Sarovar Dam from our sweat, and today we have accomplished it. 

 

After the 2001 earthquake in Kutch, it was rebuilt which was both eco-friendly and environment friendly and the World Bank which had refused to help Sardar Sarovar Dam in the name of environment, the same World Bank was forced to give its largest environmental award i.e. Green Award to the same Gujarat for the development work done after the earthquake.

Brothers and sisters, 

If the people of India resolve then this country has the power to challenge every challenge of the world, and the result of this Sardar Sarovar Dam Project. Sometimes, in our country a lot of discussion takes place on the power of states, their competitiveness, comparative studies are being conducted on this subject and if we look at western states and their history after independence, if anything has been an obstacle in their development, it has been water. Paucity of water, be it animals or humans, made them leave their homes, their fields and go up to 200 to 400 kms. in search for water. For few months they would stay wherever they could find water and when it rained they would come back. Has anyone ever imagined this painful life? How is the life without water?

When I was working as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, visiting border was in my nature. Be it the soldiers of army or BSF; I used to celebrate Diwali among them. Once when I went to the border of Gujarat and sat with the soldiers of BSF, these soldiers used to bring drinking water on hundreds of camels, only then these soldiers who protect our country in the desert will get drinking water. I felt that pain very well. And when Sardar Sarovar Dam's work started, a desire came to my mind that I would take water of Narmada River to my soldiers of BSF who are standing at the border of India and Pakistan without water, I’ll take the water of Narmada River to them. Pipeline was installed 700 kilometers away. For many decades, when camels carried water to the border then only the protector of my country used to get water. The day I reached border with the water, water from Narmada River, I had seen such happiness on the faces of the BSF soldiers, it was an engineering miracle that we took water from Narmada 700 km away and for that sometimes we even had to take it to a height of 60-storeyand then bring down to bring the water at the border.

Brothers and sisters, this whole Sardar Sarovar Dam is a miracle of engineering, canal network is a miracle of engineering. And I will urge all the architects, engineers, students of structural design, civil engineers, electrical engineers, to take it as a project in their studies. They will get the opportunity to learn how construction work gets a new direction in the future.

Brothers, sisters, it is a project that will change the fortune of millions of farmers of not only of Gujarat but also of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. And Gujarat took the lead, brother and sisters we tried, we were criticized all over the world, false accusations were made against us, many conspiracies were hatched to stall this project on mother Narmada, but we always maintained that we will not let it become a matter of political disputes. It is going to decide the fate of the future generations of 21st century, so we will not let it to be defined by the language of politics.

Brothers and sisters, 

I have been following that principle even today. We encountered numerous troubles, who caused those troubles, I have complete list of that, but I won’t do that politics, I won’t go down on that path.

I have seen the saints and sages of Gujarat, whose only motto was to spread the message of spirituality, but when the issue of Sardar Sarovar Narmada project came, I have seen that the saints of Gujarat led from the front, they went on hunger strikes. Not only this, when the World Bank refused to provide financial support, temples of Gujarat provided money for the construction of Sardar Sarovar Dam then only this dam could be completed. And that's why we never believed that it is a work of any one party, any one government. This is a work of crores and crores of people, this is a work of the determination of people who are seeking water, and this water belongs to the dry land of Gujarat, dry land of the country.

Brothers and sisters, 

There are moments in life that fill a person with great passion. Doing something for Mother Narmada in my life holds an emotional value for me. Because when I see that my motherland, this dry and parched motherland, when my motherland is yearning for the drops of water, and when her son gives her the water of Narmada, what could be a bigger emotional moment for that son? In my state, millions and millions of mothers and their daughters had to go with their mothers for up to 3 kms to get drinking water. Leaving their studies, girls of 6 years, 8 years, 10 years would help their mother in fetching water. Today for a son, when this water from the Narmada River sets them free from their troubles, then when a son like me gets the blessings of these millions and millions of mothers, what could be a bigger emotional moment inmy life?

Those innocent animals who could not speak, who serve the mankind with their bodies, those obscure animals had to wander up to 200 km in search of drinking water, food and fodder. Today, when the water of Narmada will reach there, they’ll get green fodder to eat, those innocent animals will get water for drinking. When millions and millions of these mute animals give their blessings, then as a son of mother India it is very natural for me to have one of the most emotional moment of my life. 

Brothers and sisters, 

I am not one of those who celebrate their own birthdays. But if it’s Vishwakarma Jayanti on the birthday, and the fortune of a generation for the whole century is being created, then such a moment has never come in my life for so many years, which Gujarat has given me now.

 

Brothers and sisters, 

This is a very big example of development. Learned people will study how much concrete was used? It is said that if an eight meter wide cement road is constructed from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kandla to Kohima, i.e. from the Himalayas to the sea and from the Kandla to Kohima, if an eight meter wide concrete road is constructed then the amount of concrete that will be required in its construction, my dear friends that much concrete is used in this project. What is it that we have not don for this!

Therefore, brothers and sisters, the water of Narmada is not just water, it is a philosopher’s stone and when a philosopher’s stone touches any iron then that iron turns into gold. Similarly, the water of this Narmada River reaches whichever corner of the land, that land becomes golden and hence brothers and sisters I can see that this task of making India’s future golden will be accomplished by the water of the Narmada River, I am seeing that.

Brothers and sisters, i

It will be beneficial for farmers, drinking water will be available, Gujarat will have an economic revolution. But you see, in our country - West India craves for water and Eastern India needs electricity and gas for development. And you have seen that since we formed the government in Delhi, you people have given us a chance to serve at the Center that there should be a balanced development of India, West should get water, East should get electricity and gas, so that my both sides East and West become stronger so that both arms of my mother India become capable, we are working with that plan.

Brothers and sisters, 

This Sardar Sarovar Dam does not belong to any one state. I very well remember that when water was given to Rajasthan from Sarovar Dam, Vasundhara ji was the chief minister at that time, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Jaswant Singh Ji - Bhairon Singh Ji was the Vice-President of India; they came to meet me and told me, Bhairon Singh Ji and Jaswant Singh Ji had said: Modi Ji you know, what does it mean to give water to Rajasthan? He was very emotional and he said, Modi Ji look at the whole history. Centuries ago daggers would be drawn between states for a little water, there were wars, the kingdoms of many states were defeated, the history of victories was written; and you, without any struggle, tension, quarrel or movement, you straight away gave water of Narmada from Sardar Sarovar to Rajasthan’s dry land! You provided water to Barmer, near Pakistan border? 

Brothers and sisters, I have seen those emotions in the eyes of those two leaders. And I am glad that whenever such people got a chance to rule the country for whom the country is bigger than the party, then during that time Narmada project progressed and for whom party is bigger than nation, during those times there were obstacle in the Narmada project.

Today, the work of dam has been completed, I respectfully want to thank the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan. Today, this project has been completed, for this, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Mr. Devendra Fadnavis and the people of Maharashtra. Today, this project has been completed and I want to bow before my tribal brothers and sisters, who came forward to relinquish things if they had to, for the greater good of all and I am sure that the future governments will also look at them with great respect. It is my belief that even the future governments will be concerned about their well-being. I bow to my tribal brothers and sisters whose sacrifice made it possible that my thirsty mother land is going to be flourished by the water of Narmada River, and what else could be a greater privilege than this in life?

Brothers and sisters, 

It was Sardar Saheb who did the work of uniting our country India into one. If Sardar Saheb had not been there, how scattered the country would have been, we can understand that very well. Other than Kashmir Sardar Saheb was responsible for uniting the entire India, and he accomplished that. And today we are moving ahead with a dream of better India. But after independence the way our country should have acknowledged this great personality, the way our younger generations should have been inspired by him, for some reason that never happened.

I consider it to be my sacred duty that for the future generations of India, name of Sardar Saheb should remain immortal, his work and inspiration should remain immortal and sometimes symbolic things also become a source of inspiration and to fulfill those dreams in this world, now you know me very well that menial tasks do not suit me. Neither do I think small nor do I work small, when a country of 1.25 billion people is banking on for realisation of its dreams then I do not have any right to dream small. And so, when it was decided to make a statue of Sardar Saheb, then I just made up my mind that it would be the highest statue in the world, the highest in the world. In all the structure would be about 190 meters and the statue will be of 182 meters. From the Statue of Liberty which is in America, this Statue of Unity, statue of our Sardar Saheb will be two times higher than the Statue of Liberty of America, it will be twice the size of that my brother.

You can imagine, people from all over the world visit statue of liberty. If you go to the South Gujarat, then there is Saputara, if you go to Saurashtra then there are lions of Gir, if you go to Kutch then there is a magnificent desert, if you go to the north, there is Goddess Ambe, and if you go a little ahead, then there is Abu. But this is one of our areas where there are possibilities of tourism and so brothers and sisters this statue of Sardar Patel, you will see, and mark my words, millions of people will come here every day, lakhs and lakhs of people will come, and it will become a center of tourism and that will become the reason for the livelihood of thousands of villages here; I have seen this dream.

And in this place only, people who died for the independence of our country, some people think that only a handful of people liberated the country? Only a handful of people sacrificed, and the songs were also sung only for few people. The history of the country's freedom has been forgotten. Some people have been shying away from the remembrance of the people who died for the country. From 1857 to 1947 my tribals have fought with every ruler and made sacrifices. The British used to hang up to one hundreds of tribals together as they were not ready to bend. During the battle of independence, in every state of India, wherever there are tribals, they have never been behind in making sacrifices in the battle of freedom. They have played an important role in starting the freedom struggle. Future generations of my country should know that my tribal brothers lived in the jungles, stayed in the mountains, they had no clothes to wear, but they were never behind in making sacrifices for the freedom of mother India. They should be respected, they should be honored, and coming generations should get inspiration from them. And so in India in whichever state these tribals have made sacrifices during the war of independence from 1857-1947, our government wants to make a museum in those states for them.

Future generations of India should be proud of our tribals. They should have a feeling of reverence for the ancestors of our tribal people who died for mother India and therefore all the states of India wherever there are stories of the valor of tribal people, we will make a virtual museum of modern digital technology there. Today I got the opportunity to start this by laying the foundation stone in the state of Gujarat. Slowly it will spread to other states of India. I consider this as a blessing of my life and I respectfully salute my brave tribals, from Birsa Munda to the Nayka society of Jambhughoda, that I got the opportunity to lay its foundation stone and in the near future this will also be beneficial.

This whole Sardar Sarovar Dam project is going to become a big tourism center for water sports, adventure water sports and recreation sports. Till yesterday this place which was a jungle, it is going to become the area of most of the economic activities in Gujarat. People were required to go to cities in search of livelihood now that livelihood will come to their doorsteps, this is what is going to happen. Building roads, building railways, building rapid transport vehicles from Baroda, from Bharuch so that tourist can visit the place and it can become an important tourist center of India. The Taj Mahal of Agra was built centuries ago, even today, we keep on showcasing that Taj Mahal to the world. Brothers, every corner of India has a lot to offer, a lot to show to the whole world. This Sardar Sarovar Dam, this statue of Sardar Patel, a museum singing the legends of tribal Indians, it is going to be a big center of attraction for national and international tourists.

 

Such an important program is being launched today, dam is being inaugurated. Today, I did a detailed examination of the work being done on the statue of Sardar Saheb. The speed at which the work is going on, and the kind of technology that is being used, it is worthwhile to learn and understand that. 

Today I feel truly proud and satisfied to give these priceless gifts to my countrymen. I want to congratulate the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for one more thing. Since everybody knows that Narmada River does not flow from mountains, it comes from the forests and therefore, in the recent past the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh started a campaign to keep the forests of Narmada River green. There was a walkabout for around 8-9 months, crores of trees were planted through a campaign and with these crores of trees, they have taken the lead so that the level of water in Narmada River does not go down in the coming century. My heartiest congratulations to the people of Madhya Pradesh, to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, for doing this sacred task. The task of saving a river might not have happened earlier in this country. Today I have seen, many saints of our country, many organizations of our country are campaigning to save rivers, and they are doing it with sacrifice and penance. The efforts that are taking place in the country to protect the environment also deserve heartiest congratulations, and therefore I congratulate everyone for this very important work.

Brothers and sisters, last night when I started from Delhi I got a sad news. A brave soldier, a brave commander of our military and whenever I met the marshal of our country Shri Arjun Singh Ji, he was such a heroic warrior, war of 1965 was associated with him, he was 98 years old. Only few days back we met in a program and he always used to come in full uniform. He had to come on wheel chair but whenever he would see me he would stand up and salute. I used to request him that marshal you should not stand up but he was that kind of soldier, discipline always ran in his veins and he would always stand up.

Yesterday he had a heart attack, I came to know so I went to the hospital to meet him. His feelings were same, spirit was same. His body was not supporting him but one could see the discipline to get up which was there in his veins. We have lost such a brave and heroic soldier. I respectfully bow down to him and I pay my tributes to the departed soul. This country will always remember his valor, his discipline, his sacrifice and penance, his devotion to mother India. Taking inspiration from him, the future generations of India will resolve to do something for mother India and they will be successful to make a new India in 2022.

With this same spirit, I once again thank the Government of Gujarat, and the people of Gujarat. I also congratulate these four governments, who have contributed to this project. Mother Narmada is also being useful in providing electricity to homes. She will nourish and flourish the land and she will also lighten up our homes too. While saluting mother Narmada, I urge you all to close your both fists, I will say - Narmade, you join me by saying: ‘Sarvade’. Today, if Mother Narmada is there everything is there.

Please join me in saying with your entire strength.

Narmade – Sarvade

Narmade – Sarvade

Narmade – Sarvade

Many many thanks.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the Sardar Sarovar Dam to the nation. The occasion was marked by prayers and chanting of hymns at the Dam at Kevadia. The Prime Minister unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion. 

Later, the Prime Minister visited the construction site of the Statue of Unity, an iconic structure dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, at Sadhu Bet, a short distance from the Sardar Sarovar Dam. He was given an overview of the progress of work at the site. 

At a large public meeting in Dabhoi, the Prime Minister unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of foundation stone of the National Tribal Freedom Fighters' Museum. The occasion also marked the closing ceremony of the Narmada Mahotsav, which generated awareness about the River Narmada, in various districts of Gujarat. 

Speaking on the occasion, he said the huge gathering shows the respect that people have for Maa Narmada. On the occasion of Vishwakarma Jayanti, he said that he salutes all those who are working to build the nation. Let us leave no stone unturned to build a New India by 2022, the Prime Minister exhorted. 

The Prime Minister recalled Sardar Patel's vision of the dam. He said that both Sardar Patel and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar gave a lot of emphasis to irrigation and waterways. 

The Prime Minister said lack of water resources has been a major impediment to development. He recalled visiting the border areas in the past, when BSF jawans did not have enough water. We brought Narmada waters to the border areas for the jawans, he said. 

The saints and seers of Gujarat have played a very big role in the making of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, he said. The waters of the River Narmada will help citizens and transform lives, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that in the western part of the country, there is water shortage, and in the eastern part, there is power and gas shortage. He said the Government is working to overcome these shortages, so that India scales new heights of development. 

The Prime Minister said the Statue of Unity would be a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel, and would draw tourists from all over. He recalled freedom fighters from tribal communities, who fought against colonialism.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will dedicate the Sardar Sarovar Dam to the nation, at Kevadia in Gujarat on September 17, 2017. 

The height of the dam was recently raised to 138.68 metres, facilitating a usable storage of 4.73 Million Acre feet (MAF). This will greatly benefit the participating States of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. 

The project has helped transport the waters of the River Narmada, to the water-deficient areas of Gujarat through an elaborate canal and pipeline network. Irrigation from the project is expected to benefit about 10 lakh farmers, and drinking water to be supplied to various villages and towns, is likely to benefit upto 4 crore people. The project has been described as one of largest ever human endeavours for water transport. Upto a billion units of hydropower are also expected to be generated annually. 

From the dam site, the Prime Minister will travel to Sadhu Bet, where the Statue of Unity, an iconic statue and associated memorial complex for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is currently under construction. The Prime Minister will be given an overview of the progress of work on this project. The project comprises a 182 metre tall statue, an exhibition hall, a memorial garden, and a Visitor Centre. 

The Prime Minister will attend the closing ceremony of the Narmada Mahotsav, and address the gathering at Dabhoi. He will lay the foundation stone for the National Tribal Freedom Fighters’ Museum during the event. 

The Prime Minister will later visit Amreli. He will inaugurate a new market yard of APMC. He will also inaugurate new plants of Amar Dairy, and lay the foundation stone of a honey production centre. He will address a Sahakar Sammelan at Amreli.

                His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan; 

Honourable Ministers and Senior Delegates from Japan; 

Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijay Rupani ; 

Deputy Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Nitin Patel 

Business Leaders from both countries; 

Ladies and Gentlemen! 

It is a real pleasure to be with the business community of Japan and India. That too in the presence of a great friend: Friend of India; Friend of Gujarat and my personal friend Mr. Shinzo Abe Please give a big hand for this great friend and a great leader. My personal engagement with the leadership, Government, Industry and people of Japan is now a decade old. When I first visited Japan as Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had said that.... I want to see a mini Japan in Gujarat. Today, that dream has come true. I am happy to see so many friends from Japan happily living and doing business in Gujarat. It also gives me great pleasure to see so many familiar faces here. I am also happy to see that dedicated townships, clusters and institutions have come up to make the Japanese life and work experience better. Today also, one Japanese township has been announced. Gujarat's Industry and Government still cherish the fact that Japan became the first partner country in the Vibrant Gujarat event. Not only did this partnership continue, but our engagement has kept growing. It has resulted in much greater level of engagement of the Japanese industry with the Indian economy. I thank Keidanren, JETRO and other organisations for helping us in this process. The mechanism of Japan Plus has also helped in the process of hand holding. 

Friends! 

The Government and the people of Japan have always shown great affection towards me and my country. In fact, 1.25 billion people of India have the same affection for the Japanese people. I am particularly grateful to Prime Minister Abe for his encouragement and support at a personal level. Prime Minister Abe and I do not miss any opportunity to meet. This closeness and understanding has helped us bridge a number of gaps in our bilateral relations. Last year has seen the highest ever disbursement of Official Development Assistance from Japan in a financial year. Similarly, the number of Japanese companies working in India has gone up steadily in the last few years. From the activities launched today, you can see the depth of relationship between the two countries. 

 First is the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project: 

 We are grateful for the support of the Japanese Government for this Project. 

 I hope that the construction of the 500-km long bullet train will begin soon and it would become operational by 2022--23. 

 Along with the High Speed Rail project, a training institute is also taking shape. 

 It will prepare the Makers of a New India – the highly skilled manpower required to build, operate and maintain the high speed railway. 

 Second is the Development of Japanese Industrial Townships: Country-wide, four locations have been finalized. Apart from Gujarat, they are located in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. 

 Third is our cooperation in auto-mobiles: 

The Suzuki plant at Maandal is exporting cars world-wide, and foundation has been laid for production of Lithium-ion batteries to power the next generation hybrid and electric vehicles. 

 Fourth is for Human Resource Development through the Japan-India Institutes of Manufacturing They are being developed by Japanese companies. In addition to Gujarat, they will be developed in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. 

 You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home. 

The project of Varanasi Convention Centre is a symbol of cultural co-operation between Kyoto city of Japan and Varanasi. It was conceived by Prime Minister Abe and I when we visited Varanasi together in 2015. I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and a Prasad of Lord Shiva to Humanity. This Rudraksh will be a gar-land of love of Japan for Varanasi. It will also be a tribute to our shared Buddhist heritage present at Sarnath too. For Japan’s financial assistance to this project, I extend my warmest personal thanks to Prime Minister Abe. · You have also seen some other announce- -ments for investment by Japanese companies. · On political and strategic side too, this visit of Prime Minister Abe has been very productive. We have concluded a number of agreements on very important matters. All this shows the depth of our understanding and the comfort and confidence which we have with each other. 

Friends! 

Over the last three years, we have worked very hard on the front of Ease of Doing Business. A series of administrative reforms have significantly improved the business sentiment in the country. These reforms and initiatives are all aimed at preparing India for the 21st century. They are aimed at transforming the country and making a New India. Powered by the energy of our youth, we are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub. For this purpose, we have launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign. We are also developing India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society. A grand beginning has already been made through our drives like Digital India and Skill India. For the same purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign. India is ranked 3rd in the Global Start-Up Eco-system, and has seen a momentous rise in the past couple of years. The Start-Up India initiative also aims to build a strong eco-system of innovation. On infrastructure side also, my Government has launched ambitious initiatives These projects create and present life time opportunities to investors. This includes 100 Smart Cities Mission, Housing for 50 million homeless, building roads, bridges, ports, railways tracks as well as stations. 

Friends! 

Japan can benefit tremendously with the size and scale of our potentials and skilled hands that India offers! In fact, all of India’s development agenda is relevant for Japanese companies. To allow entry of capital and technology, we have worked hard on opening our economy. Every day we are making it easier to invest and do business in India. We have already resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies. We have got very good results of these efforts. I can list out some of the recent global recognitions: India has moved up in the index of Ease of Doing Business of world Bank; We have moved up 32 places in last two years in the Global Competitive- -ness Index of the World Economic Forum – this is higher than any other country; We have also moved up 21 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization in two years. We moved 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank; and We are 3rd among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD the UN Conference on Trade and Development. India’s biggest tax reform, the GST has been introduced recently. With this, we are also moving towards a modern tax regime, which is transparent, stable and predictable. Today, India has one of the most liberal FDI regimes in the world. More than 90 percent of the FDI approvals have been put on automatic route. We have abolished the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. This liberalization has seen India’s FDI reach 60 billion dollars in the last financial year. FDI flows from Japan have almost tripled in last three years. The new Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code will make it easier for investors to have an exit. We are setting up commercial courts and commercial divisions to ensure speedy disposal of commercial matters. Arbitration proceedings will now become faster as the Arbitration law has been amended. We have also announced a new Intellectual Property Rights policy. These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are moving. We will do more and more; better and better; faster and faster. 

Friends! 

India and Japan are ancient civilizations and vibrant democracies. We know how to distribute the fruits of progress and prosperity to the common man. India needs affordable solutions and processes which can ease the delivery of government services to its citizens. Japan needs opportunities where it can deploy its hard earned knowledge and technology. I have been saying that 21st Century is Asia's Century. I have also been saying that India and Japan will play a major role in Asia's emergence. The growing conver-gence between India and Japan on strategic and economic issues has the capacity to stimulate the global economy. I am confident that Strong India and Strong Japan will also be a stabilising factor in Asia and the world. In this mutual and global pursuit I thank Prime Minister Abe and Japan for being a perfect partner. With the strength of our friendship and mutual trust, I invite more and more Japanese people and companies to come, live and work in India. I wish you success in your efforts. I assure you my support wherever it is required. 

Thank You! Thank you very much.

                His Excellency, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Distinguished 

Delegates,

 

Members of the media,

 Konnichiva (Good Afternoon/Namaskar)

 I’m delighted that I got the opportunity to welcome my unique friend, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in India, especially in Gujarat. Prime Minister Abe and I have met several times on the sidelines of global conferences but welcoming him in India is a matter of great happiness for me. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sabarmati Ashram with him. Today both of us visited the Dandi Kutir. This morning, together we carried out the ground-breaking ceremony of Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed railway project, which is being built with Japanese cooperation. This is a very big step. This is not just the beginning of high speed rail. While looking forward at our future needs, I consider this new railway philosophy as the lifeline of a New India. India's uninterrupted progress has now been attached to a much faster pace.

 

Friends,

 Mutual trust and faith, understanding of each other's interests and concerns, and continuous high level interactions, this is the uniqueness of Indo-Japan relations. The scope of our special strategic and global partnership is not confined to bilateral or regional levels only. We also have close cooperation on global issues. Last year, during my visit to Japan, we had a historic agreement for peaceful use of nuclear energy. I express my gratitude to the people of Japan, Parliament of Japan, and especially Prime Minister Abe for its ratification. This agreement has added a new chapter to our cooperation on the issue of clean energy and climate change.

 

Friends,

 In 2016-17, India got Japanese investment worth $ 4.7 billion which is 80 percent more than the previous year. Now Japan is the third largest investor in India. It clearly shows how much confidence and optimism is prevalent in Japan towards India's economic development and a golden tomorrow. And by looking at this investment, it can be assumed that in the coming days people-to-people ties between India and Japan will grow further along with a growing business. We already provide visa on arrival facilities to citizens of Japan and now after the collaboration between India Post and Japan Post we are going to introduce a Cool Box Service so that the Japanese people living in India can directly get their favorite food from Japan. At the same time, I would also request the Japanese business community to open more Japanese restaurants in India! Today, India is on the path of a radical change at many levels. Whether it is ease of doing business or Skill India, taxation reforms or Make in India, India is transforming completely. This is a huge opportunity for Japanese businesses. And I'm glad that many Japanese companies are deeply involved with our flagship programs. We will also get to see its direct benefit during our conversation in today's evening program with the business leaders of both the countries. We are the largest partner in Japan's official development assistance programme and I warmly welcome the agreements that have been signed today for the projects in several sectors.

 

Friends,

 I am confident that our dialogue and the agreements signed by us today will further strengthen the partnership between India and Japan in all areas. With these words, I once again warmly welcome Prime Minister Abe and the high level delegation accompanying him.

Thank you very much.

                जापान से आए हुए विशिष्‍टगण और यहां इस ऐतिहासिक अवसर पर उपस्थित सभी महानुभव, 

अपने करीबी मित्र श्रीमान आबे-सान का, मैं भारत में और विशेषकर गुजरात की धरती पर एक बार फिर बहुत–बहुत ह्दय से स्‍वागत करता हूं। 

(अने मारे तमने पण बधाने अभिनंदन आपवा छे. विश्वना एक नेताने, जापानना प्रधानमंत्रीने अने भारतना परम मित्रने अने मारा अंगत मित्रने, जे रीते तमे स्वागत सम्मान कर्युं, गईकाल जे द्रश्य बताया जे वातावरण बनाव्युं हुं हृदयपूर्वक सौ गुजरातवासीओनो आभार मानुं छुं।) 

साथियों, कोई भी देश आधे अधूरे संकल्‍पों और बंधे हुए सपनों के साथ कभी भी आगे नहीं बढ़ सकता है। सपनों का विस्‍तार ही किसी भी देश को, किसी भी समाज को, किसी भी व्‍यक्ति की उड़ान तय करने का सामर्थ्‍य रखता है। ये ‘New India’ है और इसके सपनों का विस्‍तार, इसकी उड़ान असीम है, इसकी इच्‍छाशक्ति असीमित है। 

आज भारत ने अपने बरसों पुराने सपने को पूरा करने की ओर एक बहुत बढ़ा अहम कदम उठाया है। मैं देश के सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों को Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-speed Rail Corridor के इस भूमि पूजन के अवसर पर कोटि-कोटि शुभकामनाएं और बधाइयां देता हूं। ‘बुलेट ट्रेन’ परियोजना एक ऐसा प्रोजेक्‍ट है जो तेज गति, तेज प्रगति और उसके साथ तेज टेक्‍नोलॉजी के माध्‍यम से तेज परिणाम भी लाने वाला है। जिसमें सुविधा भी है, सुरक्षा भी है। जो रोजगार भी लाएगा और वो रफ्तार भी लाएगा। जो Human Friendly भी है और Eco-friendly भी है। आज का दिन, जापान और भारत के रिश्‍तों के लिए एक ऐतिहासिक और उतना ही भावात्‍मक अवसर भी है। एक अच्‍छा दोस्‍त हमेशा समय और सीमा के बंधनों से परे होता है और जापान ने दिखा दिया है कि वो भारत का कैसा मजबूत दोस्‍त है, जो सीमा और समय से परे है। मुंबई और अहमदाबाद के बीच, भारत का पहला High-speed Rail Project, दोनों देशों के बीच मजबूत होते संबंधो का भी एक उम्‍दा उदाहरण है, एक प्रतीक है। अगर आज इतने कम समय में इस Project का भूमि पूजन हो रहा है तो उसका सबसे बड़ा श्रेय मेरे परम मित्र श्री आबे-सान को जाता है। श्री शिंजों आबे ने व्‍यक्तिगत रूचि लेकर ये सुनिश्चित किया कि Project में कहीं कोई दिक्‍कत नहीं आनी चाहिए। साथियों मानव सभ्‍यता का विकास, यातायात के साधनों के विकास के साथ बहुत करीबी से जुड़ा हुआ है अगर हम Asian civilization पर गौर करें तो देखेंगे उस समय गांव, शहर और लोग नदी के तट पर बसते थे और यही वो क्षेत्र होते थे जो विकास का केंद्र बनते थे, उसके बाद सड़के विकास का माध्‍यम बनीं और जहां जहां से Highways गुजरते थे वहीं पर शहर बसना शुरू हो गए। और अब Next Generation growth वहीं पर होगी, जहां High-speed Corridor होंगे। 

साथियों किसी देश के विकास में Transport System अत्‍यंत महत्‍वपूर्ण भूमिका अदा करती है, चाहे वो रेल हो, सड़क हो, जलमार्ग हो या वायुमार्ग हो। ये Transport System देश में connectivity का आधार बनाती है और connectivity का लाभ देश के लोगों को विभिन्‍न तरीकों से मिलता है अनेक प्रकार से मिलता है। जो अमेरिका के इतिहास को जानते होंगे अमेरिका के इतिहास में आज पूरा विश्‍व जानता है कि railways आने के बाद कैसे अमेरिका में आर्थिक प्रगति का नया दौर शुरू हुआ था। अभी हमारे मित्र आबे-सान बता रहे थे कि दूसरे विश्‍व युद्ध के बाद जापान का हाल क्‍या था! कैसी भयानक जिंदगी थी, कैसी गरीबी थी, लेकिन 1964 में जापान में बुलेट ट्रेन चली और फिर ये तकनीक धीरे-धीरे दुनिया के पंद्रह देशों में फैली और उसने जापान के अर्थजगत को बदल दिया। आज यूरोप से चीन तक इसका छाया नजर आता है। High-speed Rail इन देशों में न सिर्फ आर्थिक, बल्कि सामाजिक परिवर्तन लाने में भी एक बहुत बड़ी अहम भूमिका उसने अदा की है। तब से लेकर के अब तक, समय बहुत बदला है, जरूरतें बदली हैं। और इसलिए प्रयास करने के तरीकों में भी बदलाव बहुत ही आवश्‍यक है। समय के साथ छोटे-छोटे प्रयास किए गए हैं। नई चीजें जोड़ी गई हैं। लेकिन अब वक्‍त धीरे-धीरे बढ़ने का नहीं है। समय ज्‍यादा इंतजार नहीं करता। टेकनोलॉजी जो पिछले सौ साल में नहीं बदली होगी। वो पिछले पच्‍चीस साल में बदल चुकी है। अब इतनी तेज गति से बदलाव आ रहा है, तो आज हमारा जोड़ connectivity से आगे बढ़कर, High-speed connectivity पर हमारी प्राथमिकता है हमारा जोर है। High-speed connectivity से speed बढ़ेगी distance घटेगी, आर्थिक प्रगति के नये अवसर खुलेगें। साथियों, किसी भी देश में आर्थिक प्रगति का सीधा संबंध होता है productivity से, growth तभी होगी जब productivity होगी। हमारा जोर है ‘more productivity with high-speed connectivity’. 

साथियों, आज इस अवसर पर मैं जापान के एक और मित्र भाव की विशेष प्रशंसा करना चाहता हूं। हम भारतीयों और विशेषकर हम गुजराती और अहमदाबादी जब भी कोई चीज खरीदने जाते हैं, जब बिक्री की बात आती है तो बराबर तोल-मोल का हिसाब लगाते हैं, एक-एक पैसे का हिसाब लगाते हैं। घाटे और फायदे के रूप रंग बराबर चकासते हैं। जब हम एक छोटा सा बाइक भी खरीदने के लिए जाएं और बैंक से लोन ले जाएं तो दस बैंकों में चक्‍कर काटेगें। एक बैंक में दस-दस बार जाएंगे और कम रेट से कम ब्‍याज दर से कौन लोन देगा, उसका जरा हिसाब लगाते हैं। कोई बैंक 8 प्रतिशत बताती होगी, कोई बैंक 9 प्रतिशत बताती होगी और फिर हम हिसाब लगाते होंगे जोड़-तोड़ भी करते होंगे कि इतने परसेंट ब्‍याज से अगर मैं बाइक लाता हूं और जब बैंकों में ब्‍याज समेत पैसे लौटाऊंगा तब मेरी बाइक की कीमत क्‍या बनेगी? कितने साल में बनेगी? ये बहुत बारीकी से देखते हैं, बैंक वाला भी थक जाए उतनी बार बैंक के दरवाजे पर जाते हैं जरा यार कम करो। 8 प्रतिशत पर नहीं ले सकता 9 प्रतिशत पर नहीं ले सकता जरा कम करों। आधा परसेंट भी कोई कम कर दे तो खुशी मनाते हैं। ये हम भली-भांति जानते हैं और अहमदाबादी तो शायद बहुत अच्‍छी तरह से जानते हैं। लेकिन कल्‍पना कीजिए दोस्‍तों कोई ऐसा दोस्‍त, ऐसी बैंक नहीं मिल सकती जैसे भारत को आबे-सान जैसा दोस्‍त मिला है, जापान जैसा दोस्‍त मिला है। अगर कोई ये कहे कि बिना ब्‍याज के ही लोन ले लो और दस बीस नहीं पचास साल में चुकाना, कोई यकीन करेगा क्‍या? लोगों को ऐसा बैंक नहीं मिलते, लेकिन भारत को ऐसा दोस्‍त मिला है जिसने बुलेट ट्रेन के लिए 88 हजार करोड़ रुपया, Eighty Eight Thousand Crore rupees सिर्फ 0.1 परसेंट, 0.1 प्रतिशत ब्‍याज दर से ये बुलेट ट्रेन के लिए पैसा देना का फैसला किया है। 

मैं हैरान हूं जब मैं गुजरात में था, तब मैं बुलेट ट्रेन की जब बात करता था तो मुझे पूछा जाता था मोदी बाते करता है बुलेट क्‍यों लाएं, कब लाएगें, कब लाएगें, कब लाएगें? अब जब लाना शुरू किया तो पूछ रहे हैं क्‍यों लाए? भाईयो बहनों ये बुलेट ट्रेन जापान की भारत को बहुत बड़ी सौगात है एक प्रकार से मुफ्त में ये पूरा प्रोजेक्‍ट बनता जा रहा है। और मैं जापान का फिर से बहुत-बहुत आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। जो इस प्रोजेक्‍ट के लिए तकनीक और आर्थिक मदद के साथ भारत के सहयोग के लिए आज हमारे साथ जुड़ा है, आगे आया है। 

भाइयों और बहनों इस High-Speed Railway System से न दो जगहों के बीच दूरगर्मी होगी बल्कि पांच सौ किलोमीटर दूर बसे शहरों के लोग भी और निकट आ जाएगें, और पास आ जाएगें और इसलिए मैं तो कहूंगा यह ट्रेन आमरू अहमदाबाद से आमची मुंबई जाएगी। जब ये प्रोजेक्‍ट पूरा होगा तो मुबंई और अहमदाबाद की दूरी दो से तीन घंटे के भीतर-भीतर पूरी की जा सकती है। अगर हम हवाई यात्रा से इसकी तुलना करें तो जितना समय यहां सें एयरपोर्ट जाने में वहां की औपचारिकता पूरी करने में और हवाई यात्रा के बाद अपने घर या अपने दफ्तर पहुंचने में जितना समय लगता है उससे भी आधे समय में ये High Speed Rail से मुबंई जा सकते हैं। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हें कितना बड़ा बदलाव आएगा। लोगों का कितना समय बचेगा। मुबंई अहमदाबाद सड़क रूट पर जो हजारों गाड़ियाँ हर रोज चला करती हैं, उसमें भी कमी आएगी इसका पर्यावरण पर भी positive impact होगा और जब इंधन बचेगा, तो विदेशी पूंजी भी बचेगी क्‍योंकि हमें सारा इंधन विदेशों से लाना पड़ता है। 

साथियों इस प्रोजेक्‍ट के साथ Mumbai-Ahmedabad Route पर एक नया Economic System भी विकसित भी होने जा रहा है। दोनों शहरों के बीच का पूरा एरिया एक प्रकार से Single Economic Zone में परिवर्तित हो जाएगा। High-speed Corridor से न सिर्फ यातायात तेज होगा, लेकिन trade को भी बढ़ावा मिलेगा ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा क्षेत्रों के बीच आपसी संपर्क बढ़ेगा और इससे चाहे transfer of manpower हो या सामानों की ढुलाई हो, ये बहुत ही सरल और सुगम हो जाएगी। इससे देश का विकास भी होगा और मैंने जैसे पहले कहा देश को एक नई रफ्तार मिलेगी। 

एक धारणा सी बन गई है कि जितनी भी नई टेक्‍नोलॉजी आती है वो सिर्फ अमीरों के लिए आती है, जबकि अनुभव कुछ और होता है। टेक्‍नोलॉजी गरीबों के empowerment के लिए अगर उपयोग किया जाए तो गरीबी के खिलाफ की लड़ाई बहुत तेजी से हम जीत सकते हैं और इसलिए हमारा मकसद है इस technology का maximum उपयोग करते हुए उसको इतना affordable बना दिया जाए कि देश के गरीब की जिंदगी के साथ वो जुड़ जाएं। मैं मानता हूं कि Technology का लाभ तभी है जब देश का सामान्‍य नागरिक भी इसका भली-भांति उपयोग कर सके। आज जब हम Railways में नवी एवं अत्‍यआधुनिकों को जोड़ रहे हैं तो हमारा पूरा प्रयास है कि देश के सामान्‍य मानवी को new technology का लाभ मिलना चाहिए इस प्रोजेक्‍ट के दौरान Technology Transfer से रेलवे को फायदा होगा। क्षेत्र के Technicians, Vendors, Manufactures उनको भी लाभ मिलेगा और एक तरफ पूरा नेटवर्क जो है रेलवे का, उसको नयेपन की ओर आगे जाना पड़ेगा और उसको लाभ मिलेगा।

साथियों, टेक्‍नोलॉजी हमें भले जापान से मिल रही है लेकिन बुलेट ट्रेन के लिए अधिकांश संसाधन भारत में ही जुटाएं जाएगें। और इसलिए हमारे उद्योगों को भी World Class Equipment Manufacturing करने होंगे और उनकी समय पर सप्‍लाई भी करनी होगी। ‘Zero Defect, Zero Effect’ manufacturing पर बल देना पड़ेगा। इससे ‘Make in India’ को भी मजबूती मिलेगी। Direct or Indirect Employment के हजारों अवसर भी ये प्रोजेक्‍ट अपने साथ लेकर कर के आ रहा है। 

साथियों देश में Integrated Transport System ‘New India’ की आवश्‍यकता है। ‘New India’ का सपना है। और इसलिए हम देश के Feature Proofing पर ध्‍यान दे रहे हैं, ताकि आने वाली पीढि़यों के हिसाब से Infrastructure का निर्माण किया जा सके। Railways हों, Highways हों, Waterways हों या Airways हों, हमने सभी क्षेत्रों में एक समान Infrastructure पर जोर दिया है और अप्रत्‍याशित गति से कार्यों को आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं। हम आज पहले से ज्‍यादा तेज गति से सड़कों का निर्माण कर रहे हैं। GST का फायदा देश के Transport System को भी मिला है और ट्रकों के द्वारा प्रतिदिन तय की जाने वाली दूरी तीस प्रतिशत बढ़ी है। अगर पहले Goods लेकर के जाने वाला एक ट्रक एक दिन में अगर 200 किलोमीटर जाता था, तो GST आने के बाद check-post की मुसीबतें दूर होने के बाद आज वही ट्रक 200 किलोमीटर की बजाय 250 किलोमीटर से भी ज्‍यादा यात्रा एक दिन में कर लेता है, यानि पूरी economy में गति में 30 प्रतिशत की बढ़ोतरी एकमात्र GST के निर्णय के कारण संभव हुई है और उसके कारण लोगों को सस्‍ता सामान पहुंचाने का संभावना बनने वाली है। 

सरकार जलमार्गों को परिवहन के पर्यावरण अनुकूल तरीके के रूप में विकसित करने के लिए भी प्रतिबद्ध है इसी दिशा में आगे बढ़ते हुए 106 अतिरेक नदियों को National Waterways के रूप में विकसित करने का काम इस दिशा में हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। भारत में Aviation Sector भी नई संभावनाए लेकर आ रहा है। पिछले तीन वर्षों में Domestic Flyers की संख्‍या में हवाई जहाज में सफर करने वालों की संख्‍या में लगभग तीन करोड़ यात्रियों की वृद्धि हुई है। Aviation Sector को मजबूत करने के लिए पहली बार National Aviation Policy हमनें बनाई है। मध्‍यम वर्ग के जीवन में ‘उड़ान योजना’ के माध्‍यम से बदलाव लाया जा रहा है। इस योजना के तहत देश के 70 छोटे शहरों को जोड़ा जा रहा है ताकि देश का आम नागरिक कभी सस्‍ती हवाई सेवाओं को भी वो फायदा उठा सके। 

वर्तमान रेल व्‍यवस्‍था को सुधारने और आधुनिक तकनीक के आधार पर नये रेल नेटवर्क के निर्माण दोनों पर बराबर ध्‍यान दिया जा रहा है। हमनें रेलवे ट्रैक, उसको doubling करना, electrification करना इस काम को भी तेजी से आगे बढ़ाया है और पहले से ज्‍यादा तेज गति से काम हो रहा है जितना निवेश रेलवे में अभी ये सरकार कर रही है, उतना इसके पहले कभी नहीं हुआ है। निवेश बढ़ाने के साथ ही अब दशकों से अटके हुए Projects को पूरा करने पर भी बल दिया जा रहा है। भारतीय रेलवे की क्षमता में बढ़ोतरी और माल ढुलाई में आसानी के लिए भारत सरकार लगातार प्रयासरत है। 

मुबंई के जवाहरलाल पोर्ट से लेकर यूपी के दादरी तक Western Dedicated Fright Corridor बनाया जा रहा है। इसी तरह कोलकता से लुधियाणा तक Eastern Dedicated Fright Corridor का निर्माण किया जा रहा है। अगले तीन साढे तीन साल में ये प्रोजेक्‍ट पूरा कर लेने की हम कोशिश कर रहे हैं। ये प्रोजेक्‍ट पूरा होने के बाद जो congestion है वो कम होगी, यात्री ट्रेंनों का समय बचेगा और रेलवे की transport क्षमता भी बढ़ेगी। 

साथियों, High-speed Rail Project आधुनिक रेलवे निर्माण के vision का integral part है। मुझे बहुत खुशी है कि आज इसका भूमि पूजन हुआ है। और मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयों और बहनों मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, भूमि पूजन आज हुआ है। आजादी के 70 सत्‍तर साल हुए हैं, साबरमती आश्रम की शताब्दी मना रहे हैं, मन में इच्‍छा है सपना है, जब आजादी के 75 साल हों 2022-23 में ये हम रेल का काम पूरा करें और जैसा आबे-सान ने कहा हम दोनों बैठकर के उसमें यात्रा करके उसका उद्दघाटन करें। जापान और भारत ने एक बार ठान ली तो ये भी हम करके रहेंगे ये मैं आपको विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं। 

इस Project के साथ-साथ High-speed Rail Experts तैयार करने के लिए बड़ोदरा में High-speed Training Institute की भी स्‍थापना की जा रही है। ये बहुत महत्‍वपूर्ण प्रोजेक्‍ट मैं मानता हूं। बड़ोदरा वर्षों से रेलवे की एक बहुत बड़ी महत्‍वपूर्ण इकाई रही है। अब जापान वहां पर High-speed Railway के लिए जिस प्रकार के manpower की जरूरत है, नई टेक्‍नोलॉजी को सिखाने की आवश्‍यकता है, भारत के नौजवानों को विशेषकर गुजरात के नौजवानों को ये अवसर मिलेगा और जब Human Resource Skill Development होता है तो देश की ताकत अनेक गुना बढ़ जाती है। जो एक High-speed से भी ज्‍यादा होती है, वो काम अब बड़ोदा की धरती पर होगा, जापान की मदद से होगा और आधुनिक से आधुनिक रेलवे इंजीनियरिंग का काम है, उसके लिए भारत के नौजवानों को तैयार किया जाएगा। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि नये भारत के लिए कितने बड़े सामर्थ्‍यवान मानव बल को तैयार करने का काम इस एक Institution के द्वारा होने वाला है। मेरे लिए जितना महत्‍व High-speed Railway के भूमि पूजन का है उससे भी कई महत्‍व देश के नौजवानों को ये आधुनिक training देने के लिए ये जो Institution का भूमि पूजन हो रहा है इसमें है और ये 21वीं सदी के भारत की मजबूत नींव डालने का काम इससे होने वाला है। 

मैं इस प्रोजेक्‍ट से जुड़े भारत और जापान के सभी प्रतिनिधियों का, कर्मचारियों का एक बार फिर बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, उनका धन्‍यवाद करता हूं। उनके प्रयास से ये प्रोजेक्‍ट यहां तक पहुंचा है। और अब जमीन पर इसका असली काम शुरू हो रहा है। मुझे पूरा-पूरा भरोसा है कि मिलकर इस प्रोजेक्‍ट को समय से कम समय में पूरा करने प्रयास करेंगे और करके दिखाएगें। एक बार फिर से जापान के प्रधानमंत्री और मेरे परम मित्र श्रीमान शिंजो अबे, श्रीमान आबे-सान उनका मैं ह्दय से आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। और भारत का ट्रेन नेटवर्क इतना बड़ा है इतना बड़ा है कि जापान की जो कुल जनसंख्‍या है। हमारे यहां एक सप्‍ताह में जापान की जितनी जनसंख्‍या ,है इतनी रेलवे में सफर करते हैं। कितनी विशालता कितनी क्षमता, हमारे पास scope है, speed है, आपके skill है और हम मिलकर के इस नये भारत को नई गति देने की दिशा में आगे बढ़ेंगे। 

मैं फिर एक बार गुजरात वासियों ने जो भव्‍य स्‍वागत सम्‍मान किया। जापान के प्रधानमंत्री की शोभा के अनुरूप किया इसलिए गुजरात का ह्दय से आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। मैं गुजरात और महाराष्‍ट्र सरकार दोनों को बधाई देता हूं, इस काम के अंदर इन दोनों सरकारों ने मिलकर के भारत सरकार और जापान सरकार के साथ मिलकर के सारे विश्‍व को एक के बाद एक High-speed से निपटाते गए और पूरी व्‍यवस्‍था को आगे बढ़ाया और इसलिए मैं गुजरात के मुख्‍यमंत्री का, महाराष्‍ट्र के मुख्‍यमंत्री का, उनका भी ह्दय से आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                All the dignitaries from Japan and all the dignitaries present here on this historic occasion, 

I once again very warmly welcome my close friend Mr. Abe San in India, especially on the land of Gujarat. 

And I wish to congratulate to all of you. I express my gratitude to all the people of Gujarat for according a very warm welcome, for the respect given by them to a world leader, to the Prime Minister of Japan, to the best friend of India, to the best friend of mine, for the yesterday’s hospitality and atmosphere. 

Friends, no country can ever move ahead with half-hearted resolve, with constrained dreams. Expansion of dreams alone has the capability to decide the flight of a country, the flight of a society or the flight of an individual. This is a New India and the vastness of its dreams, the vastness of its flight is infinite, it has unlimited will power. 

Today, India has taken a very big, an extremely important step in the direction of realizing an old dream. I congratulate, I convey my best wishes to 1.25 billion countrymen on the occasion of the ground breaking ceremony of Mumbai-Ahmadabad High-speed Rail Corridor. Bullet Train Project is such a project that it will bring speedy results along with high speed, rapid progress and fast technology. This is both convenience and safety, Which will bring both – employment as well as speed. This is both human friendly and eco-friendly. Today is a historic day for the relations of Japan and India and it is equally an emotional occasion as well. A good friend is always above the limits of time and boundaries and Japan has demonstrated this thing that how close a friend of India it is which is beyond the time and boundaries. The first High-speed Rail Project between Mumbai and Ahmadabad is a good example, it is a good symbol of the strengthening of bilateral relations. If the ground breaking ceremony of this project is taking place today within such a short span of time then the biggest credit for this thing goes to my best friend Mr. Abe San. By taking personal interest, Mr. Shinzo Abe ensured that there should not be any hurdles in this project. Friends, growth of human civilization is very closely linked with the development of the means of transportation, if we take a closer look at Asian civilization then we will find that at that time villages, cities and people used to settle on the river banks and these were the regions that used to become the hub of development; after that roads became a medium for development and the cities used to develop from wherever highways were passing through. And now the next generation of growth will only take place near the high-speed corridors. 

Friends, transport system, are it railways or be it waterways or be it air corridors, plays an extremely important role in the development of a country. This transportation system becomes the foundation for connectivity in the country and connectivity benefits the people in several ways, in various ways. Those who are familiar with the history of America, today the entire world knows in the history of America that how a new era of economic progress was started in America after the development of railways. Just a while ago, our friend Abe San told us about the situation of Japan after World War II. What a terrible life it was, what kind of poverty was there? But Bullet Train was started in Japan in 1964 and then this technology gradually spread to the fifteen countries of the world and it transformed the economy of Japan. Today, its shadow can be seen from Europe to China. High-Speed Railways has played an extremely important role in bringing about not only economic changes but also in bringing about social changes in these countries. The time has changed a lot since then, requirements have changed. And therefore it’s imperative to bring about changes in our approach. Small attempts have been made with the time. New things have been added. However, now is not the time to move slowly. Time doesn’t wait much. The Technology that had not changed in the last hundred years, what it has changed in the last 25 years. If the changes are taking place so rapidly then today our emphasis should go beyond the connectivity to high speed connectivity, this is our priority and our emphasis is on this. High-speed connectivity will increase the speed and reduce the distance and it will open new avenues for the economic progress. Friends, there is a direct relation between the productivity and that country’s economic progress, growth will happen when productivity is there. Our emphasis is on more productivity with high-speed connectivity. 

Friends, today on this occasion, I’d like to especially praise one more aspect of Japan’s friendship. When we Indian, particularly we Guajarati's and Ahmadabad's, go out to buy something, when it comes to the selling then we weigh everything, then we account for every single penny. We continuously analyses both the profit and loss. When we go out to purchase an ordinary bike and if we borrow money from a bank then we will knock the doors of ten banks. We will visit every bank at least ten times and we minutely calculate that who will give the loan on low interest. Some bank would offer it for 8% and some other might offer the loan on 9% and then again we calculate, we might try to figure out as well that if I purchase the bike at this interest rate then what will be the final cost of my bike at the time of settlement of the loan with interest, and for how many years? We see these things very minutely and we visit the bank so many times seeking the reduction that even a bank employee would get tired. I can’t borrow on 8% or 9% please reduce the interest rate a bit. And we celebrate even if someone reduces the interest rate by just half a per cent. And we know this thing very well and perhaps Ahmadabad's would know it extremely well. Friends, just imagine, no one can get a friend; no one can get a bank like India has got a friend like Abe San, as India has got a friend like Japan. If someone offers an interest free loan and repay it not in ten or twenty years but repay it in fifty years. So will anyone believe this thing? People don’t get this kind of bank but India has got such a friend that has decided to lend eighty eight thousand crore rupees at the interest rate of just 0.1% for this bullet train. 

I’m surprised when I was in Gujarat and when I used to talk about the bullet train then it was asked to me: Modi talks that why should we bring bullet train, when will he bring it, when will he do it, when will he bring it? And when I have started to bring it then they are asking: why am I bringing it? Brothers and sisters this bullet train is a very big gift of Japan to India and in a way this entire project is being built at no cost. And once again I express my gratitude to Japan which has come forward, which has joined in to support this project along with providing technology and economic assistance for it. 

Brothers and sisters, this high-speed railway system will not only reduce the distance between the two places but the people of the cities located at a distance of 500 kilometer will also come closer to each other and therefore I would say that this train will travel from Amaroo Ahmadabad to Amchi Mumbai. When this project will be complete then the distance between Mumbai to Ahmadabad will be covered within two-three hours. 

If we compare this thing with the air travel then one can reach Mumbai in less than half of the time by using this high-speed rail than what is required for travelling from here to the airport, in completion of formalities there and also the time required for going home or your office from the airport. 

What a big change it will bring about, you can imagine this thing. How much time it will save for the people? It will also reduce the number of thousands of vehicle plying on the Mumbai-Ahmadabad road and it will also have a positive impact on environment and saving of fuel will help in saving the foreign reserves as we are required to import all the fuel from abroad. 

With this project, a new economic system is also going to be developed on the Mumbai-Ahmadabad route. In a way, the entire area between the two cities will be converted into a single economic zone. High-Speed Corridor will not only speed-up traffic, it will also boost trade, the interaction between different areas will also increase and whether it is transfer of manpower or transportation of goods, it will make them both simple and easy. This will also lead to the development of the country and as I said earlier, the country will attain a new speed. 

There is a notion that whatever new technology comes, it only comes for the rich, whereas experience is something else. If technology is used for the empowerment of the poor, then we can win the fight against poverty very quickly and therefore our aim is to make maximum use of this technology to make it so affordable that it becomes connected to the lives of poor of this country. I believe that technology is beneficial only when a country's ordinary residents can use it well. Today, when we have been bringing in new and highly advanced technologies in the railways, we are striving that the common man of the country should also get the benefits of new technology. Railways will benefit from the technology transfer during this project. It will benefit the technicians, vendors and manufacturers of this area and on the other hand, the railway network that we have, it will have to be modernized and will get benefit from this thing. 

Friends, we may be getting technology from Japan but most of the resources for the bullet train will be mobilized in India. And therefore our industries will have to produce world class equipments and also supply them on time. We will have to place emphasis on 'zero defect, zero effect' manufacturing. This will also reinforce 'Make in India' program. This project is also bringing in thousands of direct and indirect employment opportunities with it. 

Friends, an integrated transport system in the country is required for a 'New India’. It is a dream of 'New India'. And, therefore, we are focusing on Feature Proofing of the country so that infrastructure can be built according to the future generations. Whether it is railways, highways, waterways or the airways, we have stressed equally on infrastructure in all areas and we have been moving forward in these areas at an unprecedented speed. We are building roads at a much faster pace than before. Benefits of GST can also be seen in the country's transport system; daily distance traveled by trucks has increased by 30 percent. Earlier if a truck carrying goods used to travel 200 kilometers a day, then after the implementation of GST and after removal of check-post troubles, today, the same truck travels more than 250 kilometers in a day instead of 200 kilometers, so a 30 percent increase in speed of the economy is possible due to the implementation of GST alone and therefore there is going to be a possibility of people getting cheaper goods. 

The government is committed towards developing waterways as an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Moving forward in this direction, we are working towards developing 106 excess (overflowing) rivers in the form of national waterways. Aviation sector is also bringing new prospects in India. In the last three years, the number of people traveling on airplanes i.e. number of domestic flyers has increased by about three crore passengers. We have created national aviation policy for the first time to strengthen the aviation sector. Lives of the middle class people will be changed with the help of Udan Yojana (Flying Scheme). Under this scheme, 70 small towns of the country are being inter-linked so that the common citizens of the country can sometimes take advantage of affordable air services. 

Equal attention is being given to both, on improving the existing railway system and on construction of a new railway network on the basis of modern technology. We have expedited the work of lying of railway tracks, doubling of railway tracks, its electrification and today the work is being done at a faster pace than ever before. The kind of investment that the government is currently making in the railways, it has never been done before. Along with the increase in the investment, now the emphasis is on completing those projects which have been stuck for decades. Indian government is constantly working to increase the capacity of Indian Railways and facilitate freight movement. 

Western Dedicated Freight Corridor is being built from Jawaharlal Port in Mumbai to Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor is being constructed from Kolkata to Ludhiana. We are trying to complete these projects in the next three to three-and-a-half years. Congestion will be reduced after completion of these projects and we will save time for passenger trains and the capacity of railways will also increase. 

Friends, High-Speed Rail Project are an integral part of the vision of making a modern railway. I am very happy that today we have performed its ground-breaking ceremony. And my dear brothers and sisters, my dear countrymen, today ground-breaking has been done. This is the 70th year of our independence; we are celebrating the centenary of the Sabarmati Ashram. I have a desire, I have a dream that when we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022-23, we finish this rail project and as Abe San has just said that we both inaugurate it by travelling on that train. If once Japan and India have resolved this thing then we will definitely do it, that I can assure you. 

Along with this project a High-Speed Training Institute is also being set up in Baroda for preparing high-speed rail experts. I believe this is a very important project. Vadodara has been a very important unit of the railways for years. Now Japan would be there, the kind of manpower that is needed for the High-Speed Railway, there is a need to teach the new technology, Indian youth especially the youth of Gujarat will get this opportunity and when there is Human Resource Skill Development then country’s power increases manifold which is even more than a high-speed train, that work will now be done in Baroda, with the help of Japan. It is a modern railway engineering work and young people of India will be ready for that. You can imagine that this institute is going to perform the task of creating such a capable human resource for the New India. I attach greater significance to the ground breaking ceremony of this institute which is going to provide advance training to the youth of country than the significance that I attach to the ground breaking ceremony of the high speed railway, as it will lay the foundation of the 21st century India. 

I once again congratulate all the delegates and employees of India and Japan who are associated with this project. The project has reached at this point due to their efforts. And now the actual ground work is starting. I have full faith that together we will try to complete this project before schedule and we will certainly do it. Once again, I express my gratitude to the Prime Minister of Japan and my best friend Mr. Shinzo Abe, Mr. Abe San. And India's train network is so large that the people equal to the total population of Japan travel on our railway network in a week. Such a large network, what a huge capacity? We have scope, we have speed; you have skills and together we will move ahead to give new momentum to this New India. 

Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Gujarat for the grand welcome and the respect that the people of Gujarat have accorded and they did it according to the dignity of the Prime Minister of Japan. I congratulate both the governments of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Both these governments by working together and by working with the Government of India and with the Government of Japan, executed all the work, one after another, at a high speed and took forward the entire system therefore I express my heartfelt gratitude to the chief minister of Gujarat and also to the chief minister of Maharashtra. 

Thanks a lot.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today jointly laid the foundation stone for India’s first high speed rail project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. 

Speaking on the occasion, at a large public meeting in Ahmedabad, the Prime Minister spoke of the high ambition and willpower of “New India.” He congratulated the people of India on the occasion, and said that the bullet train project will provide speed and progress, and deliver results quickly. He said the Government’s focus is on increasing productivity through high speed connectivity. The Prime Minister thanked Japan for the technical and financial help given to India, for this project. He praised Prime Minister Abe for the fact that this project is being launched within such a short time. 

The Prime Minister said that this high speed railway would not only bring two cities closer, but also bring the people living hundreds of kilometers away, closer to each other. He said a new economic system is being developed along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, and the entire area would become a single economic zone. 

The Prime Minister said technology is useful only if it provides benefit to the common man. He said the technology transfer envisaged in this project will benefit Indian Railways, and boost the “Make in India” initiative. He said the project would be eco-friendly as well as human-friendly. He said “high-speed corridors” would be regions for rapid growth in the future. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is working to ensure that infrastructure is developed keeping in mind futuristic requirements. He expressed confidence that everyone would work together to complete this project in the shortest possible time. 



 

Earlier, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the India-Japan partnership is special, strategic and global. He said that he hopes to see the beauty of India through the windows of the Bullet Train, a few years hence.

                Your Excellency President Alexander Lukashenku 

Friends,
Members of the media


I am delighted to welcome President Lukashenku to India. His visit comes as both countries mark 25 years of our diplomatic relationship this year.


We have earlier had the pleasure of receiving President Lukashenku in India in 1997 and in 2007. During this visit, I hope Your Excellency will get a chance to see and experience the transformations taking place in India. 

Our discussions today were wide-ranging and forward-looking. They were marked by the warmth of our ties over two and a half decades. We exchanged views on bilateral issues and on regional and global developments. We reviewed the architecture of our partnership. We considered ideas and initiatives for further expanding it. We decided to enhance our interaction in all aspects of cooperation.


I found in President Lukashenku matching enthusiasm and desire to scale up our partnership for the benefit of our people. 


To this end, we will work to diversify economic linkages. The focuswill be to build upon the natural complementarity between us. 


Our companies have to evolve from a buyer-seller framework to deeper engagement. There are abundant business and investment opportunities in pharmaceuticals, oil & gas, heavy machinery and equipment. Last year, Indian companies made a positive beginning with three joint ventures in pharmaceuticals.


Possibilities for partnership also exist in manufacturing of tyres, agro-industrial machinery, and mining equipment. Similarly, in heavy-duty construction machinery India has a growing demand and Belarus has industrial strengths.

We will also encourage joint development and manufacturing in defence sector under the Make in India programme. We have also progressed our discussion on utilising the US$ 100 million line of credit that India had offered in 2015 in specific projects in Belarus. 

India is linked with Belarus under multilateral economic initiatives such as the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and the International North South Transport Corridor. India is negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the EEU. 

Friends,

Science and technology is another area of focus for stronger cooperation. Belarus is a long-time partner in this field. 

Innovation and commercialisation will be given due emphasis in fields like metallurgy & materials, nano-materials, biological & medical sciences, and chemical & engineering sciences. We envisage participation of our youth in this process.


We are exploring the setting up of a technology demonstration Centre in India to showcase Belarusian technology.

Another dimension of India’s partnership with Belarus lies in development cooperation. Belarus is an active participant in Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation programme. 


In international forums, our two countries have close cooperation and common approaches on matters of mutual interest. 

India and Belarus will continue extending mutual support for each other in multilateral fora. 


Friends, 

President Lukashenku and I discussed the rich history of cultural interactions between our people, which has nurtured goodwill. I was pleased to learn that many Belarusians take active interest in Indian culture, cuisine, films, music, dance, Yoga and Ayurveda. 


I see great potential to enhance our tourism and people-to-people exchanges so as to build an even stronger foundation for our relations. 


In closing, I want to thank President Lukashenku for being our honoured guest. India will work closely with Belarus in the coming days and months to implement today’s consensus and outcomes. I wish President Lukashenku a memorable stay in India.


I thank you.

                 I have been told that due to shortage of space here a  large number of people are sitting in some other room.  I respectfully remember them also.

Today it is the 11th September,  the world never knew the importance of 9/11 before 2001. It’s not the fault of the world, it’s our fault that we pushed it into oblivion.  Had we not done so, perhaps the terrible 9/11 of the 21st century would not have happened. A 9/11 happened 125 years ago also, the day when a young man from this country, he was almost your age, may be older by 5-7 years, in a saffron robe , the world  wasn’t even familiar with the attire, and the world which was looking at him as a representative of  a slave India, but his self-confidence had that power that even the slightest shadow of slavery was neither there in his thought nor in his behaviour nor in his voice. What kind of heritage he  was carrying  inside himself that even after thousands of years of slavery a fire was raging within him, he had that kind of confidence in  him that our country, its philosophy, its lifestyle has the capability to give a lot to the world. That was something extremely unusual.

We should reflect on this that when everything around us is negative, when everything is against our own beliefs, when there are voices of dissent all around and still we have to articulate our ideas then how sccared we would be in doing so. Under such a pressure situation we will think twice before speaking lest someone may misinterprete. What kind of strength that great personality had that he never let this kind of pressures sway him. A person who knows very well his inner fire, inner enthusiasm, inner self confidence only he can attempt to provide the right direction to the world, solutions to the problems of the world.  The world did not know that there could be other than the words: “Ladies and Gentlemen”. And when he addressed them as “Brothers and Sisters of America”, there was burst of  thunderous applause that continued for quite a few minutes. With these words he introduced the power of India to the world. That was also a kind of 9/11. One who had treasured Mother India within himself by travelling the entire country. The one who had imbibed all the languages of India in him, from north to south, from east to west, one who could see the miracle of India within himself, one who could make the entire world his own within a few minutes, one who gave identity to the oneness to the whole world by gathering different cultures that flourished through ages, he conquered the whole world. That was 9/11 and that was the world victory day for me. And there was this other 9/11 at the beginning of 21st century when human beings were massacred and there was destruction all around. On the same land of America, one 9/11 gave the message of love and oneness and the other which shook the world and humanity and brought them  on the verge of destruction, was the result of our forgetting the lessons of the first 9/11.  The world then came to know that how a voice that emanated from India gives 9/11 a significance in the history and how this 9/11 remained seeded in the psyche of world which moved ahead on the path of destruction and deformity. And that is why today, on 9/11, I feel that there is a need to understand Vivekanand Ji in a different manner.

If you look at it closely you’ll see two aspects of Vivekanand Ji. Across the world wherever he went, wherever he got an opportunity to discuss, he would tirelessly glorify the great traditions and philosophy of India, he would never stop or feel embarrassed in doing so. That was one aspect. And the other aspect was whenever he would speak in India he would openly criticize our evil practices. He used to hit hard on our weaknesses and the language that he used - if we use the same language today perhaps, people would be surprised, how anyone could use such a language. He used to raise voice against every vice of the society. And just imagine that the society of that period when the importance of rituals, worship, traditions was very high and it was the society’s natural tendency. During such a time and under such a condition, a young man of 30 years, stands up and says that you will not be able to reach God by following these rituals and worshiping in temples.  He said, “Service to mankind is service to God”. “Go and serve the poor and you will be able to reach God”. What a great strength!

The person who would praise India outside the country but when he would come back to India he would hit hard on the social evils of the country.  He belonged to the tradition of saints but he never went out in search of a Guru. It is a matter of learning and appreciation. He did not come out to find a guru, he came out in search of truth. Throughout his life Mahatma Gandhi was also engaged in the search of truth. He was also search for the truth. The family was in difficult economic situation. Ram Krishna Dev sent him to goddess Kali and said “Go and ask whatever you want from goddess Kali”. And when he asked him later whether he had asked for something or not Vivekanand Ji said: “No, I did not”. That was his nature that he was not even ready to seek help from the goddess Kali. What was that inner strength, what was that energy that gave rise to such capacity, and hence whatever evils are present in the current society, shouldn’t we fight against those evils? Should we accept them? Vivekanand Ji used the words ‘Brother and Sisters of America’ on the American soil and we dance and rejoice here but I would specifically like to say this to youth of my country: do we really respect women? Do we really look at the girls with a feeling of respect, and I bow 100 times to those who really do, but those people who are not able to see girls as human beings; they are also a creation of God just like you are. If we do not look at them with this feeling then we must really think 50 times whether we have the right to rejoice at the use of words, ‘Brothers and Sisters of America’ by Vivekanand Ji.

 Have we ever thought that Vivekanand Ji used to say that serving the society is equal to serving the God. Now look, a man, at the age of 30, created ripples in the world. During that period of slavery there were two personalities who manifested a new consciousness and energy in India. There were two incidents, one when Rabindranath Tagore was awarded Nobel Prize and other when the 9/11 speech of Vivekanand became a topic of discussion all over the world. These two incidents stirred up a new consciousness in India during that period of slavery, and both of them were prodigies of Bengal. How much pride I feel when I tell somebody in the world that Rabindranath Tagore from my country created the national anthems of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Do we take pride in this legacy of us? And it is not shallow. Today, India is a young country in the world. 800 million people of this country are less than the age at which Vivekanand Ji gave his speech in Chicago. A country whose 65 percent population is less than the age at which Vivekanand Ji made his mark in the world, what could be a better inspiration for them than Vivekanand Ji and therefore, what kind of work did Vivekanand Ji do, he was not the one who would limit himself to preaching only. He converted ideas into idealism and he combined ideas and idealism to make an institutional framework. Around one-twenty years ago he created Ram Krishna Mission, he did not create Vivekanand mission. It is a small thing but a hint is enough for the wise men and the way Ram Krishna Mission has emerged, that even after 120 years there is no dilution or diversion in its principles. How could he lay such a strong foundation for the institution, how clear his vision was and how strong the action plan was? Every aspect of India would have been experienced in such a deep sense, only then it became possible for that movement to be still moving ahead with the same spirit even after 120 years. 

 I had the good luck of spending a few moments in that great tradition. I was fortunate to visit Chicago on the centenary year of Vivekanand Ji’s speech of 9/11. I was fortunate to visit the hall and participate in the centenary celebrations of the speech. I can imagine how emotional that moment was.  

 Has anyone in the world thought about celebrating the 125th anniversary of a speech? A speech which lasted for sometime, a speech of few words which is still alive even after 125 years and which is capable of rekindling the consciousness of people. This in itself is a very big opportunity for us to make it as one of our great heritage. 

 I came here and I heard the chanting of Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram in the loudest possible voice. It’s a hair raising experience and a feeling of reverence for India naturally takes over. But I am not posing this question to the people present here in this auditorium alone, I am asking this question to the entire   India. Do we have a right to chant Vande Matram? I know what I just said will hurt many people. You can think 50 times, but tell me, do we have the right to say Vande Matram? We are those who are spitting on mother India after eating pan and then chanting Vande Mataram. We are those who are throwing all the garbage on mother India and then chanting Vande Matram. If anybody has the first right to say Vande Mataram in this country then it is those sweepers and cleaners who are involved in cleaning India and therefore it is essential for us to think that our mother India which is full of water and productive in every way, we may clean it or not but we do not have any right to make it dirty. We may have reverence for Ganga, thinking that taking a dip in Ganga cleanses us of our sins, every young person has a desire in his heart to take his parents to Ganga at least once for a holy dip, but are we able to stop ourselves from polluting that Ganga? If Vivekanand Ji would have been present today, would he have scolded us or not? Sometimes we feel that we are healthy because there are plenty of doctors, best of the best doctors are available. 

 No sir, we are not healthy because we have plenty of doctors, we are healthy because someone is doing the job of cleaning. And if we can have more respect for his work than for a doctor then only can we enjoy saying Vande Matram. I remember quite well that once I said, first build toilets then a temple. Many people scoffed at me but I am happy that we have this kind daughters in our country who have refused to marry if there is no toilet in the house. We are here on this land for thousands of years. What is the reason for that: We believe in changing with the times. Among ourselves we have produced such people who led us in our struggle with our vices and that is our strength. Therefore when we remember Swami Vivekanand Ji, then that 9/11 was not a mere treasure of words, it was the voice of an ascetic, it was the voice of tenacity, only then the words which came out had the power to mesmerize the world. Otherwise do you remember, India, a land of snakes and snake charmers, a land of the rules about what to eat and what not to eat on a particular day, this is how India was recognised. 

विवेकानंद ने दुनिया के सामने कह दिया था हमारी परंपरा के नीचे उनकी परंपरा नहीं है। क्‍या खाना, क्‍या नहीं खाना यह मेरे देश की संस्‍कृति परंपरा नहीं है, वो तो हमारी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का हिस्‍सा होगा, हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक व्‍यवस्‍था अलग है। आत्मवत् सर्व भूतेषु यह हमारी सोच है। अहम् ब्रह्मास्मि ऐसी निकली हुई बातें नहीं है। गुणतम् विश्‍व मारयम् यह आर्य शब्‍द हम पूरे विश्‍व को सुसंस्‍कृत करेंगे, इस अर्थ में है किसी जाति परिवर्तन धर्म परिवर्तन के लिए नहीं है और इसलिए जिस महान विरासत के हम उस परंपरा से पले-बढ़े लोग हैं यह सब इस धरती की पैदावर है।

  Vivekanand had publicly told the world that our tradition was not inferior  than theirs. What to eat and what not to eat has never been a part of our culture; it might have been a part of our system. Our way of thinking is that our own soul is reflected in every living being. ‘I’m the Supreme Being’ these ideas have not emerged without any purpose. ‘We will make the entire world Arya (great)’, this Aryan philosophy means that we will make the entire world civilized, it is not for changing anybody’s caste or religion and that is why the great legacy, the great tradition under which we have been raised, all these things have evolved on this land only.   

 These things are a result of penance of many centuries and every person in the county has contributed something or the other in this. This is a country where a beggar is also full of knowledge. He conveys his good wishes to the givers and also to those who don’t give anything. And therefore this was the fundamental basis of the success of Swami Vivekanand Ji that  he had the feeling of self-confidence and self-pride in himself and ‘self’ does not mean an individual , it was the pride in the heritage of the country which he was representing and which he presented to the world. Do we ever care about what we say? If we go to a good place which has good natural environment and which is spic and span, then what is the first thing that comes to our mind: this does not seem to be India. Do we say something like that or not? If we would have been raised with self-respect and with self-pride then this feeling would not be there.  We would take pride that our country also has such things. 

  I tell you friends that if we really look at Vivekanand Ji in today’s context; whenever I say ‘Make In India’, there are many people who oppose it. Some people say that instead of ‘Make in India’ it should be ‘Made in India’, there are many smart people who can give a new meaning to it. But if someone recalls the discussion that took place between Vivekanand Ji and Jamshed Ji Tata; at that time India was a slave country but even then a 30 year old young man was asking a person like Jamshed Ji Tata that he should Make in India, he should setup industries in India. And later Jamshed Ji Tata himself acknowledged that these words of Vivekanand Ji have been an inspiration for him and that is the reason that he established industries in India.

 You would be surprised to know that the first agriculture revolution took shape from the ideas of Vivekanand Ji and Dr. Sen who is considered to be the pioneer of first agricultural revolution in India, when he set up an institute, he named it Vivekanand Agriculture Research Institute. It means that the approach to agriculture in India should be based on scientific research and it should be modern, Vivekanand Ji had this kind of ideas during that period.

 Today a lot of emphasis is being laid on the fact that our youth goes to university. Today 9/11 is also associated with the centenary celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and it is also the birth anniversary of Acharya Vinoba Bhave, the person who truly lived according to the principles of Mahatma Gandhi. Today when I say this thing, then the people who have read, listened or studied Pandit Deen Dayal, his thoughts on progress, welfare of poor and service to the society is the service to god etc. these are nothing but the teachings of Vivekanand Ji in the modern context. A very close associate of Acharya Vinoba Bhave ji was Dada Dharmadhikari. What Gandhi Ji used to think or teach, Vinoba Ji actually expressed those thoughts by leading his life by following them and what Vinoba Ji used to think, the task of putting them into words can be seen in Dada Dharma Ji’s thought process. Dada Dharmadhikari wrote about a funny incident in one of his books. A young man came to him for a job through some acquaintance. He wanted Dharmadhikari Ji to recommend him so that he could get a job. Dada Dharmadhikari wrote about it that he asked that person what did he know and the person replied that he was a graduate.  Again he asked the person: what do you know, he again said: I’m a graduate. That person could not understand what Dharmadhikari Ji wanted to know. So Dharmadhikari Ji asked for the third time: what do you know? That person again said: ‘I am a graduate’. Dharmadhikari Ji then asked that person, do you know typing, he said no. Do you know how to cook? He said no. Do you know how to make furniture? He again said no. Do you know how to prepare tea or snacks? He said no, I don’t know all these things but I am a graduate. Now look what Vivekanand Ji had said, everything that Vivekanand Ji had said had the power to revolutionalise our thinking and he used to talk like that only and he said a very interesting thing, he said: ‘Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested all your life.’ If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who got an entire library in his chest which means that there are people who stored information equal to a library into their chests and minds but anyone who lives by five ideas is an educated man. It means that he had distinguished knowledge from skill. Today whole world gives more importance if one has some certificate or skill in their hands. This government has tried to put forward that idea, the idea of skill development.

 Skill development is not a new subject in our country but earlier it was scattered in different departments which had no accountability, it used to move in the directions given by the whims and fancies of the people. We brought all the skill development related work in to one place and we created a new ministry and a new department for it to prepare the youth of India in such a focused way that they should never be dependent on anybody. The youth of my country should not be a job seeker, he should be job creator. The youth of my country should be a provider instead of seeker and hence today when I remember thoughts of Swami Vivekanand Ji, he was a supporter of innovation, he was a supporter of research. He would exhort people to boycott all the old and useless things, however great they might have been, howsoever good they appear, but he would exhort people to banish them.

 Social life can progress when we innovate on regular basis, only then we can be successful. The young generation of our country needs to have that courage and that feeling of innovation. Some people are afraid of ‘what if I fail’. Have you seen anybody in the world who has become successful without facing any failures? Sometimes the path to success is paved by failures only, therefore being scared of failure is not the life. One who keeps standing on the river bank never drowns, one who jumps into the water, he drowns but while drowning he also learns how to swim. Anyone can live their entire life by counting waves from the shore but the ability to cross waves comes to those who have the courage to fight them by jumping into water or into a lake, or in an ocean. Swami Vivekanand Ji had hoped for such kind of young generation. 

Today, the government of India is running campaigns like Start-up India, Stand-up India. You can get loans without bank guarantee under the Mudra scheme. I would like the youth of my country to come up with new products and innovations for the problems of my country and take them to the people of India. India is a very big market. It is waiting for their talent and capabilities. And how Vivekanand Ji separated knowledge from skill, it is the need of the hour that we keep on emphasizing on the importance of skill. It does not happen overnight, we have to keep giving it more importance. You’ll see that the results would be very much different. We have started Atal Innovation Mission i.e. AIM through our NITI Aayog. Along with that Atal Tinkering Lab is also there, which is a campaign to promote young talents of the country. It is a silent movement but it is going on. And many talented children brought many new things. Once I was in Rashtrapati Bhawan, when Pranab Da was the President, he had called such children from all over the country. Around 12-15 children came with the things that was their innovation. So Pranab Da requested me that I should meet these children. I was surprised to see that among those 12-15 children who had come with their innovations, half of them were students of 8th, 9th or 10th standard. They brought the project of how to make best use of garbage waste, look what was the influence of cleanliness campaign.  They had brought things with them which could be made from garbage. What I mean to say is that there is no dearth of talent in India and we must think about that.

 Today a lot of discussion takes place in the world about foreign policy. This camp, that camp, this group, that group, cold war etc. look at the selection of words. Has anyone read Vivekanand Ji, what was his foreign policy? Swami Vivekanand Ji had said it at that time and now after 120 years it is evident to the world. He had given the concept of One Asia and with that concept he had said that when the world would be embroiled in crises then it would be only One Asia which would have the abilities to give a new direction to the world. One Asia is rich in cultural heritage. Today the whole world is saying that the 21st century belongs to Asia. Some people say it belongs to China while some others say it belongs to India but there is no doubt that the whole world says that the 21st century belongs to Asia.

What role can One Asia play in this whole picture of the world? What are the fundamental capabilities of One Asia which can provide solutions to the problems? It has a rich heritage of thousands of years, this philosophy, this concept of One Asia was given 125 years ago by Vivekanand Ji. And hence we must look at Vivekanand Ji in the modern context. He talks about promoting entrepreneurship, in his every discussion he talks about on what basis India can become capable and powerful, so the first thing he talks about is agricultural revolution, then he talks about innovation and the third thing he talks about is  entrepreneurship. He would also talk about fighting the vices of the society. He speaks a lot against untouchability and calls it insanity. Today we are celebrating the birth centenary of Deendayal Ji and he also talked about upliftment of the downtrodden people. Mahatma Gandhi used to say that if you are making any decision then just make sure that it would be beneficial for the person at the last end of the society and your decision will always be correct.

 Few days ago, some young people organized a program and it was about travelling on the golden quadrilateral that was constructed during Atal Ji’ tenure. They did a relay race of 6,000 km on cycle. Their mantra was very good, they had said: follow the rules and India will rule.’ If 1.25 billion Indians just do this much i.e. follow the rules then the dream of Vivekanand Ji that one day India will become guru of the world, then automatically India will rule the world. But we must follow the rule to achieve that. So with these feelings, when we are celebrating 125 years of his speech, when we are celebrating 100 years of Deendayal Ji, and it is also the birth anniversary of Vinoba Bhave Ji and on the other hand the other horrible 9/11 which caused mayhem in the world and pushed it towards destruction; when man turned against man; in times like these, people like us who believe in whole world being one family, who see God in nature, who see God in plants, who consider rivers as their mothers, who consider whole universe to be their family, we will be able to give something to this crises stricken world and humanity. Only then we take pride in our things and make timely changes. Whatever is wrong and harmful for the society, many beliefs may have been correct during the past but if they are not appropriate in the present day then we must raise our voice against them and we must come out to stop them, abolish them.

 My young friends, 

 Ramkrishna Mission which was started by Swami Vivekanand has now completed 125 years. It will be 75 years of independence of India in 2022. Can we make a pledge? And that pledge should become the aim of our lives, yes I will definitely do this, and you’ll see it will be a different life. Sometimes there is a debate in our country whether all the university presidents who have been elected are student leaders or not. It is a matter of contemplation where the student politics began and where it has reached now. Sometimes I see that when people who have been involved in the student politics contest elections, they make promises that they will do this or that but till now I have not seen that any candidate has promised that they will keep the campus clean. If you go to any university campus one day after the elections, what all lies strewn there? Still Vande Matram? Do we wish to make the 21st century as India’s century? We will be celebrating 75 years of independence in 2022, is it not our responsibility to make India as per the dreams of Gandhi Ji, as per the dreams of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev, as per the dreams of Subhash Chandra Bose, as per the dreams of Swami Vivekanand? Management students are taught that everybody, somebody, nobody, but ultimately it comes to nothing and that is why this thing that I’ll do it, this is my responsibility becomes necessary and you’ll see that it will not take much time for India to change. If 1.25 billion Indians take one step forward then India will move ahead by 1.25 billion steps.

I have seen that certain days are celebrated in colleges, people may feel good or bad about it,  some people protest also, but different days are celebrated in colleges, today it is Rose day, some people are against it and they might be sitting here also, but I am not against it. You see, we don’t have to prepare robots, we need creativity. There is no better place than university campus to bring out the inner feelings and an individual present inside us. But does it ever come to our mind that a college in Haryana should decide to celebrate Tamil-day, a college in Punjab decides to celebrate Kerala day? We will listen and sing few of their songs, we will dress up like them and come to college. We will learn to eat by our hands. We will see some Tamil or Malayalam movies in our college, we will call some young people from there and ask them about the games which they play in their hometown and then play those games with them. Please tell me that whether such day would be productive or not? Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat will happen or not? You people shout a lot of slogans regarding unity in diversity but please tell me do we ever try to take pride in this diversity? Till the time we do not have a sense of pride for every state in India, a sense of pride for every language of India, I remember some students from Tamil Nadu university just came up and I  greeted them by saying ‘Vanakkam’ to them, they became so happy and they felt touched. Don’t we feel that we should create such an environment and celebrate this kind of special days in our universities? Don’t we feel that in our university we should celebrate a day dedicated to Sikh Gurus so that we get to know about the sacrifices made by the Sikh Gurus of Punjab. Or we will remain stuck in Bhangra only? Punjab is much more than Bhangra and Paratha. You see, life is nothing without creativity. We cannot become robots, the person present inside us should express itself continuously but we must do what enhances the power of our country, which increases our capability and which fulfils the requirements of our country. Till the time we will remain aloof from them, we will be limiting ourselves. 

Vivekanand Ji used to tell the story about the mentality of a frog in a well. We cannot be like that. We have to integrate ourselves with the entire world otherwise we will confine ourselves to a corner, no one can imagine us like that. Our journey has been from Upnishads to Satellites. We have never shied away from accepting anything from the world if it was favorable to us or was favorable to the humanity. And we have never been scared that somebody will come and we will be trampled. No sir, whatever may come we will handle that, we belong to this thought process. We will make them our own and we will move ahead whatever good they have in them, then only India will become capable of giving something to the world. There might have been a period when we were living as slaves so we might have been living with a protective nature. Today we must have this kind of strength and we should not be concerned influence of the outside world. And nowadays whenever I go abroad, I have this feeling that the outlook of world towards India has now changed. This has not been achieved due to our political power, it is the strength of our people, the reason behind this is the strength of 1.25 billion Indians. But if we keep on brushing our evils under the carpet then there would be nothing but a rotten bad smell. We have to fight these evils, we have to fight with our own vices. It should be our dream to make a modern India and why India should not become a modern state? Why shouldn’t the youth of my country be at par with others in the world? Why shouldn’t they become strong? Once I met with a great personality, he must have read my speech somewhere so he brought up that topic, at that time I was not in politics. He said: brother, do you know what is the problem with India? I asked: what was that? He said: 5,000 years ago India was like this, 2,000 years ago India was like this, India was like that during the times of Buddha or like that during the times of Rama, we could not come out of this mentality. The world evaluates you on the basis of where you are at present. We are fortunate that we have a great heritage but we are not ready to move ahead beyond praising that. Taking pride on your past should be an inspiration to move ahead, it should not make us step backwards and stop. We have to move beyond singing our praises. Being young is not a state, it is a state of mind. One who is immersed in the yesterday cannot be considered as young. But one who takes best things from the past and thinks of the future and understands it, he is young. You must make a pledge how to move forward with that feeling of youngness. With this, I pay my obeisance to Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, I pay my obeisance to Vivekanand Ji, I pay my obeisance to Vinoba Bhave Ji and I congratulate the young members of my country.

Thank You.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a Students' Convention on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Centenary Celebrations, and 125th Year of Swami Vivekananda's Chicago Address, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. 

The Prime Minister said that 125 years ago, on the same day that has recently come to be known as 9/11, with just a few words, a youngster from India won over the world and showed the world the power of oneness. The 9/11 of 1893 was about love, harmony and brotherhood, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that Swami Vivekananda raised his voice against the social evils that have entered our society. He recalled that Swami Vivekananda said that only rituals will not connect an individual to divinity; he said that 'Jan Seva’ is ‘Prabhu Seva.' 

Swami Vivekananda did not believe in sermonising, the Prime Minister said. His ideas and idealism paved way for an institutional framework through the Ramakrishna Mission, he added. 

The Prime Minister specially mentioned all those people who are working tirelessly to keep India clean, noting that they were the ones who had most imbibed the spirit of Vande Mataram. Student organisations, while campaigning for university elections should give more importance to cleanliness, the Prime Minister said. He said that only those who respect women, can take legitimate pride in the opening words of Swami Vivekanand’s address – “Brothers and sisters of America.” 

The correspondence between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata will show the concern Swami ji had towards India's self-reliance, the Prime Minister said. Both knowledge and skills are equally important, the Prime Minister added. 

The Prime Minister said, that people now say that the 21st century is Asia’s century. But long ago, Swami Vivekananda had given the concept of 'One Asia,' and said that the solutions to the world's problems will come from Asia. 

There is no better place for creativity and innovation than university campuses, the Prime Minister said, adding that campuses should organize days to celebrate the culture and language of various States, to strengthen the spirit of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.” 

India is changing, India's standing at the global stage is rising and this is due to Jan Shakti, the Prime Minister said. “Follow the rules, and India will rule,” he exhorted the student community.

                My greetings to the Indian community and people of Indian origin living in Myanmar!

 My best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi and Eid. May your lives get filled with happiness, peace and prosperity.

 I am very happy to be here with you today. I have always wanted to visit this historical and spiritual city of Yangon which is famous for its rich heritage and which has age old links with India. And I also wanted to meet you all, who have deep relations with both India and Myanmar, at this historical and spiritual gateway to the East. I can see a mini India here. You all who have come here from different parts of India are residing in the heart of a great Nation in the form of the Heartbeat of another Nation. I am all the more happy because you all are the manifestation of those cultural traditions that have been nurtured by benevolent mothers like Ganga, Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Brahmaputra and Iravati.

 

You represent thousands of years of the shared culture and Civilization, geography and history, aspirations and achievements of the great sons and daughters of India and Myanmar.

 

For the past thousands of years India and Myanmar share not only the boundary but also the emotions. In India Myanmar is also known as Brahmadesh or the place that belongs to Lord Brahma. Friends, this is that place that nurtured Buddha and his teachings. The Buddhist monks and the Buddhist texts, for several years, have propagated not only the religion but also Pali language and teachings at every corner of India. The holy land of Myanmar has gifted India and the whole world the art of meditation through Late Goenka ji. And I am happy that his son is present here among us today.

 

In Myanmar even today, Ramayana is presented by the name of Yama. And goddess Saraswati is known as Tharuthari, Siva as Parvijwa and Vishnu as Vithano.

 

The history of India's struggle for independence will be incomplete without the reference of Myanmar. This is that sacred soil from where Subhas Chandra Bose had raised his slogan,     ""You give me blood, I will give you freedom"". On hearing this slogan, several youngsters - who loved India more than their lives and were ready to sacrifice their lives for the motherland - came in large numbers to support the Azad Hind Fauj. I feel privileged to meet and seek the blessings of those young fighters in the Azad Hind Fauj who have now become old. The foundations of the British rule had shaken when Netaji had announced the formation of Azad Hind Government. This is that very sacred soil where Bal Gangadhar Tilak had written his work, Geeta Rahasya inside the Mandalay jail. This is that very sacred land where great personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had set their feet on.

 

Whenever the great sons of India had to leave the country in order to fight the British forces, Myanmar used to be their second home. After the first war of independence in 1857 the ruler Bahadur Shah Zafar was given two yards of land in Myanmar.

 

Whenever I visit any country I get the opportunity to seek the blessings of the Indian community residing there. Few days back I visited Jaffna on my Sri Lanka tour. That was the first time when an Indian Prime Minister had visited Jaffna. There I met the people of Tamil origin. I also got the opportunity to handover to them the houses constructed with Indian aid. When I again visited Sri Lanka in the month of May this year I received an invitation to participate in an international conference. At that time I met Tamil brothers and sisters of Central Sri Lanka. I received so much love from thousands of people there after the inauguration of one hospital that was made with Indian aid that I can never forget the day. My Tamil brothers had showered a lot of love on the soil of Sri Lanka. Whenever I meet the Indian community abroad, be it the construction workers of Saudi Arabia or the Farmers and traders of Kenya or the professionals of Silicon Valley, I feel deeply attached to them. In a way they are government's ambassadors; you all are our ambassadors. I feel proud of you because wherever you all go, you not only contribute to the development and harmony of that place but also protect the Indian culture, which is a great thing.

 3 years ago United Nations had passed the proposal for International Yoga Day under India's initiative in record time with record support. June 21st is being celebrated worldwide as International Day for Yoga for the past 3 years. Whenever we talk of yoga a reference to India is always made.

This global recognition of yoga is your achievement because it was taken to all corners of the world by the people of India.

 It’s not only an emotional connect with India but you all are also associated with India's development. The Indian diaspora is cooperating with India for its development. They are aiding in the development projects of their or their ancestor's States. The youngsters are all the more active, not only through social media but also through the deep interests that are developing every day to know more about India. Last year we had organised a quiz titled 'Know India' for the overseas youth. I was very happy and pleasantly surprised to know that youth from about hundred countries had participated in the quiz. This means that the second and the third generation Indian kids had participated in large numbers.

 When I meet you, I also feel that communication of our people living in foreign countries with government authorities in India is not a ‘one-way-traffic’ anymore.

 Before coming here I had requested you all to provide your suggestions through the Narendra Modi app. I am really thankful to you all that you have given me extremely good suggestions.

From the very first day after coming to power the welfare of the Indian diaspora has been our government's priority. We have taken several initiatives such as merging the PCI and PIO Schemes, freeing the long term visa holders from police reporting, easy access to passport, efficient utilisation of community welfare fund, re-energizing the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and organising Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in different parts of the world, according to the needs and feedback of the overseas Indian community.

 And I believe that there is no other foreign minister like Sushma Swaraj ji who is so active in solving the issues of Indian diaspora.

 Whenever any Indian or person of Indian Origin abroad faces any problem, she immediately contacts that person through Twitter and resolves the issue at the earliest. Whenever you have any difficulty while obtaining passport or visa or you need any legal assistance, the doors of the Indian Embassy are open for the Indian community 24/7, 365 days.

Friends, today the entire world is looking up to India; and the reason being you all. You all are the true ambassadors of India because India is transforming at a rapid pace and moving ahead.

We are not merely reforming our country, we are transforming India.  We are not merely changing India; we are building a new India. We celebrated 70 years of India’s Independence, last month. After five years, in 2022 it will be seventy five years of India’s Independence. We have pledged to build a new India by the time Independent India turns 75 years.

We have taken a resolution to make India clean and poverty free, terrorism free, communalism free, casteism free, corruption free. I appeal to you all to visit the new India website and be a part of this great mission.

Friends, I believe that the 19th Century design cannot be used for 21st century infrastructure and infrastructure does not mean only road and rail network. The 21st century infrastructure includes everything that connects the people with modern techniques; transform their lives and quality of life. India has taken the lead to increase the solar energy capacity in the world.

Today a lot of investments are being made in railways, roads and airports like never before. The work of connecting every gram panchayat to the optical fibre network is progressing at a rapid pace. Coastal cities and ports are being developed at a rapid pace with the help of Sagarmala project.

I believe that with these efforts a new ‘Infra culture’ will also develop along with new infrastructures in the country and agriculture will be an inherent part of the same. Our government is aiming at doubling the farmer’s income. For this we are making efforts to help them right from the sowing stage to the marketing stage like soil health card, neem coated urea, micro irrigation, crop insurance, food processing park, cold storage chain and so on and so forth. We all are well aware of the Green Revolution and The White Revolution. But today we have to focus on two more revolutions - Blue Revolution and Sweet Revolution as well. Blue revolution is for the welfare of not only the fishermen but also for developing the marine economy. Similarly sweet revolution which is beekeeping can help to increase the income manifold.

Also we are not afraid to take tough decisions for the welfare of the country. This is only because for us the country comes before the party. For us the country is everything. The government has taken every decision without any hesitation for the welfare of this Nation, be it the surgical strike or demonetisation.

We took the tough decision of demonetizing rupees 1000 and rupees 500 notes in order to eliminate black money and corruption. We could not have allowed the 125 crore people to bear the burden of the sins committed by handful of corrupt people. Black money does not have any address. It is not traceable.

Friends, after demonetization we caught hold of lakhs of people whose bank accounts had crores of rupees but they had never filed income tax return. We also got to know about lakhs of companies that were involved in money laundering cases. My friends, you will be happy to know that within 3 months the registration of more than 2 lakh companies where cancelled and their bank accounts were freezed.

Just 2 months back GST was implemented. I call GST as Good and Simple Tax in a simpler language. GST has created a new culture of doing business with honesty. Those businessmen who were out of the tax system for the past 6 years have been linked with it within two months after the implementation of GST. Which could not be accomplished in 6 years has been accomplished in 60 days only. A new era began 3 years ago. Following the principle of 'minimum government, maximum governance', all the procedures have been simplified, the laws have been changed, rules for ease of doing business have been simplified; the people have gained the confidence back that India can transform and move ahead and that India is now capable of getting rid of the decades-old evils that had held India back.

Friends, India believes in sharing the fruits of its development with other countries. We believe in sharing our experiences with other developing countries of Africa, South Asia or Pacific Island. I had promised for a South Asian satellite in 2014 and we launched it this year. Not only India but all those neighbouring countries that are associated with it are gaining with this satellite.

We have been the first responders at the time of a natural disaster or any crisis, not only for Indians but also for all those who are in need of help. When we reach out for help we never ask for the nationality of that person. We have tried to fulfil our responsibility of a good neighbour at times of crises, be it the Nepal earthquake or water crisis of Maldives or typhoon in Fiji or evacuation of Indians and foreigners during West Asian violence or rehabilitation work after the cyclone had hit Myanmar.

Friends, ' Vasudev kutumbakam' that is, ‘the whole world is a family’ has been our cultural tradition and we are proud of it. Today the entire world considers India as the third leader. Today India has a significant position in the world order; be it the International Day of Yoga or the International Solar Alliance or the agenda on Golden decade of BRICS; the voice of India echoes at every corner of the world. A new hope and expectation has developed among the countries of the world towards India.

Brothers and sisters, India considers the North Eastern states as a gateway to the South East Asia. The Gateway opens towards Myanmar. Hence, India is making efforts towards developing the roads connecting India to this gateway. Few months back 1600 crore rupees were sanctioned to upgrade the Imphal-Moreh section. An integrated check post is also being made at Moreh. Now the trade and people to people contact will also enhance between Manipur and Myanmar on the completion of this project. We have progressed upon the Kaladan project after completing the Sittwe port and Paletwa inland water terminal. The work on the road component has already begun. I have no doubt about the fact that the transport corridor will emerge as the development corridor for the nearby areas. India has started providing truck-loads of high speed diesel to fulfil the needs of upper Myanmar. We want to increase our cooperation by signing the border crossing agreement and the motor vehicles agreement thereby increasing the power and energy trading. India is proud of the achievements in the field of development cooperation and capacity building partnership. 

We are sharing India's democratic experiences with Myanmar. The people to people connect and the social culture of India is our greatest strength and to strengthen it further we have decided to provide gratis visa to the people of Myanmar who are interested in coming to India. We have also decided to release forty fishermen of Myanmar. We hope that they will soon be united with their families.

Today I had visited the Ananda Temple in Bagan. India is helping in renovation of Ananda Temple as well as other historical structures that were destroyed last year due to earthquake. India and Myanmar have a deep historical connect with which the future generation should be aware of. I believe research should be done in this matter.

During our discussions I have put forward a proposal in front of the Myanmar government. We can conduct the survey on INA memorial together and a joint history project can be established. This can help in strengthening people to people contact between the two countries.

I am delighted to inform you that we have decided to provide OCI based on National Registration Card. The government has also decided to increase the number of scholarships for Indian Council for Cultural Relations in order to strengthen the cultural relations between the two countries.

Friends, once I read that the India and Myanmar’s relation is based on 5Bs - Buddhism, Business, Bollywood, Bharatnatyam and Burma teak. But I think they have missed one B here; which is Belief or trust; trust between the two countries. Trust between the two countries has been developing over the years.

Brothers and sisters, our motto of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is not limited to our country's boundaries; because it also means every country's cooperation as well and every country's development. India is obligated to co-operate in the development projects of Myanmar.

I bow to you for showering your blessings. I feel privileged to have met you all. Thanks a lot for coming here in large numbers to listen to me and for your attachment with India. Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart and I salute this land. Thanks a lot!

	At the invitation of H.E. U Htin Kyaw, President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, is paying his first bilateral State visit to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar from 5th to 7th September 2017. The visit is part of the continuing high level interaction between the leaders of the two countries and follows successive State visits to India last year by H.E. President U Htin Kyaw and H.E. State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
	Prime Minister Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Presidential Palace in Nay Pyi Taw on 5th September 2017. He paid a courtesy call on the President of Myanmar, who hosted a State Banquet in his honour. On 6th September 2017, the Indian delegation led by Prime Minister Modi held bilateral talks with the Myanmar delegation led by State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The talks were held in a warm, cordial and constructive atmosphere as befits the close and friendly relations between the two countries. Thereafter, the State Counsellor and the Indian Prime Minister witnessed the signing and exchange of various documents between Myanmar and India in the areas of health, culture, capacity building, maritime security and collaboration between key institutions and held a Joint Press Conference.
	Apart from his official engagements in Nay Pyi Taw, Prime Minister Modi will visit places of historical and cultural importance at Bagan and Yangon. In Bagan, he will visit the holy and historic Ananda Temple, where restoration work is being carried out by Indian and Myanmar archaeologists under the expert guidance of the Archaeological Survey of India. In Yangon, he will pay his respects to the memory of General Aung San at the Martyrs’ Mausoleum and also visit the Bogyoke Aung San Museum as well as other prominent sites. He will interact with the Indian origin and expatriate Indian community of Myanmar during his stay in Yangon.
	During the talks, the two leaders reviewed developments since the very successful State visits of the President and the State Counsellor of Myanmar to India in August and October 2016 respectively. They reviewed ongoing official exchanges, economic, trade and cultural ties, as well as people-to-people exchanges that reflect the harmony between Myanmar’s independent, active and non-aligned foreign policy and India’s pragmatic Act East and Neighbourhood First policies. They pledged to pursue new opportunities to further deepen and broaden bilateral relations for the mutual benefit of the people of both countries. They reaffirmed their common aspirations for peace, collective prosperity and development of the region and beyond.
	The Prime Minister of India appreciated the measures taken by the Government of Myanmar towards peace and national reconciliation and commended the on-going peace process of the Government of Myanmar. He noted that peace and stability in Myanmar are of the highest priority to India and reiterated India’s continued support to the Government of Myanmar in consolidating democratic institutions in Myanmar and for the emergence of a democratic Federal Republic.
	The two leaders discussed the security situation prevailing along their borders and expressed concern at various incidents of terrorism and extremist-inspired violence that have taken place in their respective territories. Recognizing that terrorism remains one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region, both sides condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and agreed that the fight against terrorism should target not only terrorists, terror organisations and networks, but also identify, hold accountable and take strong measures against States and entities that encourage, support or finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups, and falsely extol their virtues. Myanmar condemned the recent barbaric terror attacks during the Amarnath Yatra in India as also various acts of terror perpetrated by terrorists from across the borders. India condemned the recent terrorist attacks in northern Rakhine State, wherein several members of the Myanmar security forces lost their lives. Both sides agreed that terrorism violates human rights and there should, therefore, be no glorification of terrorists as martyrs. They called on the international community to end selective and partial approaches to combating terrorism and, in this regard, jointly called for the expeditious finalization and adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism by the United Nations General Assembly.
	Recognising that maintenance of security and stability along the common border is essential for the socio-economic development of the peoples of the border areas, Myanmar reaffirmed its respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and steadfastly upheld the policy of not allowing any insurgent group to utilise Myanmar’s soil to undertake hostile acts against the Indian Government. Myanmar also appreciated Government of India for upholding the same principle.
	Both sides reiterated their mutual respect for the already demarcated boundary between the two countries and emphasised the need to resolve outstanding boundary demarcation issues as fast as possible through existing bilateral mechanisms and consultations.
	Both sides reviewed the security situation in their immediate neighborhood and agreed upon the special need for enhancing closer bilateral cooperation in maritime security. They also agreed to foster mutually beneficial and deeper defence cooperation between the two countries and, in this context, noted with satisfaction the recent successful visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of Myanmar to India. Besides institutionalized cooperation through regular coordinated patrolling initiatives, they agreed to focus on bilateral maritime cooperation in non-traditional security domains, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, which are critical for safeguarding the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean as global commons.
	Both sides pledged that Myanmar and India will maintain the already-achieved mutual understanding and growing bilateral relations between the two countries and that they will stand by each other as good and trustworthy neighbours in the years ahead in the interest of both peoples and the region.
	The two sides noted with satisfaction the continued exchange of high-level visits that has fostered better mutual understanding of outstanding bilateral issues. They appreciated the regular holding of sector specific institutional mechanisms in the areas of security and defence, trade and commerce, power and energy, border management and connectivity etc. for effective follow-up of decisions taken at the highest political levels. They also noted with pleasure the excellent exchanges between Indian and Myanmar Parliamentarians and encouraged them to further enhance such interaction.
	The Myanmar side expressed its heartfelt appreciation to Government of India for all the assistance rendered to Myanmar in support of its endeavour for socio-economic development. Both sides reviewed on-going cooperation projects being executed with technical and financial assistance from the Government of India, noting that these were directly associated with the benefit of the Myanmar people, and agreed that these should be expedited. Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s abiding commitment to supporting Myanmar in its efforts to build infrastructure and develop human resources capacity. Alluding to the positive experience of the Industrial Training Centres set up with Indian assistance in Pakokku and Myingyan, the Myanmar side thanked India for the support being extended to develop two more Centres at Monywa and Thaton respectively as well as the assistance for a five year comprehensive maintenance plan for ITC, Myingyan. They also expressed appreciation for the support offered by India to upgrade the Myanmar-India Entrepreneurship Development Centre and the Centre for English Language Training at Yangon. The two sides also agreed to continue discussion towards the establishment of a Planetarium at a suitable location in Myanmar, recognizing that this would be a valuable institution that would nurture a scientific temper amongst the Myanmar youth.
	The two sides shared the view that the situation in Rakhine State had a developmental as well as a security dimension. In this context, they agreed to bring about overall socio-economic development in the State by undertaking both infrastructure and socio-economic projects, particularly in the spheres of education, health, agriculture and allied activities, agro-processing, community development, construction of small bridges, upgradation of roads, small power projects, livelihood activity, setting up of training centres, promotion of household crafts, conservation of environment and cultural heritage. Myanmar welcomed India's offer of assistance under the Rakhine State Development Programme and the two sides agreed to finalize the implementation modalities within the next few months
	The two sides noted with satisfaction the cooperation in the field of agricultural research and education, especially through the rapid progress in operationalizing the Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education set up at the Yezin Agricultural University and the Rice Bio Park set up at the Department of Agricultural Research. It also appreciated India’s assistance for facilitating post graduation and doctoral education in agricultural sciences for candidates from Myanmar.
	The two sides expressed satisfaction at the ongoing capacity building programmes for Myanmar judicial officers, military personnel and police. Myanmar thanked India for the extended period of support to the Myanmar Institute of Information Technology and the India-Myanmar Centre for Enhancement of IT Skills. They agreed that India would extend regular training to Myanmar diplomats at the Foreign Service Institute, New Delhi. Myanmar welcomed India’s offer to enrol two Myanmar diplomats every year for training at the Kendriya Hindi Sansthan while 150 Myanmar civil servants would undergo training in English language at Indian training institutes every year for a period of five years.
	Recognizing the need to further upgrade the training infrastructure and capacity building of Myanmar Police, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the Memorandum on Upgradation of the Women’s Police Training Center at Yamethin in Myanmar with technical and financial assistance of Government of India. Myanmar welcomed India’s offer to help set up a training centre for police officers in Yangon and it was decided that modalities would be jointly worked out.
	Myanmar thanked India for supporting various projects in Myanmar that enhance bilateral as well as regional connectivity like the Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and other road and bridge construction projects as fully funded grant-in-aid projects. Myanmar appreciated the substantial progress made on the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project with the completion of works on the Sittwe Port and the Paletwa Inland Water Transport Terminal and the handing over of six cargo barges to the Myanmar Port Authority and Inland Water Transport. The two sides agreed to enter into an MoU on appointing a port operator that may include both sides to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the port in keeping with the practice that has been adopted at other international ports in Myanmar. This would enable the Port and IWT infrastructure to be used commercially and promote development of the surrounding areas even as the final component of the project, the road from Paletwa to Zorinpui, is under construction. Both sides noted with satisfaction that work on the road was already underway and agreed to facilitate movement of project personnel, construction material and equipment across the border through Zorinpui and Paletwa. They also noted that construction work would shortly begin on reconstruction of bridges on the Tamu-Kyigone-Kalewa Road and on the Kalewa-Yargyi sector of the Trilateral Highway. The two sides have agreed upon the alignment of the Rih-Tedim road and the DPR for its construction. Further steps on construction of the Putao-Myitkyina and Alethankyaw-Ahungmaw roads under available LOC would be taken after DPRs are made available by Myanmar. In response to Myanmar’s request, India agreed to undertake preparation of DPRs for the Rihkhawdar-Zowkhathar bridge and the Bwaynu bridge.
	The two sides also reviewed projects in the field of health and noted with satisfaction that work on the upgradation of Yangon Childrens' Hospital and Sittwe General Hospital and on construction of Monywa General Hospital had been completed. They agreed to start consultations to establish and operate a state-of-the-art hospital in Nay Pyi Taw in association with one of the leading Indian hospital groups, based on modalities to be mutually decided.
	Both sides deliberated on the progress made in utilization of US$ 500 million concessional Line of Credit extended by India to Myanmar in 2012. Noting that the projects to be implemented under the Line of Credit would help augment the physical infrastructure in vital areas and enhance capacities in agriculture and transport, they resolved to implement mutually agreed projects expeditiously.
	Both sides expressed that, in order to derive full value from these infrastructure projects, the institutional arrangements related to connectivity needed to be put in place on priority. In this regard, they noted the importance of concluding a bilateral agreement that would enable motor vehicle traffic, both passenger and cargo, to cross the border.
	Both sides underlined the need for bringing about greater integration of power and energy supply networks between India and Myanmar. Myanmar welcomed India's participation in its energy sector both in exploration and production and invited Indian companies to participate in tenders for petrochemicals and petroleum products, marketing infrastructure and setting up of LPG terminals. India informed that leading Indian oil and gas companies are in the process of opening their offices in Myanmar. The two sides applauded the agreement reached by Numaligarh Refinery of India and Parami Energy Group of Myanmar on supply of diesel to Myanmar across the land border, noting that this will give the people of north Myanmar cheaper and more reliable access to petroleum products, and also encouraged both sides to collaborate in storage and retail marketing of petroleum products in Myanmar. The first consignment of the high speed diesel reached Myanmar on 4th September 2017.
	India also expressed its readiness to extend technical as well as project-specific assistance to conventional as well as renewable energy-based power development projects identified by Government of Myanmar. In addition to the earlier offer to conduct a feasibility study for development of solar parks in Myanmar, India offered to conduct a solar radiation resource assessment in Myanmar. The two sides discussed ways to cooperate in the field of energy efficiency between the two countries. Myanmar thanked India for the technology demonstration projects being undertaken through Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. of India to introduce LED-based energy efficient lighting in key townships and buildings identified by Myanmar in Nay Pyi Taw, Bago region and Rakhine State. India shared its experiences in power trade and expressed its interest in examining possible cooperation in this area with Myanmar. It was agreed that these and other relevant issues would be taken up at an early meeting of the Joint Steering Committee on Power and other forums. In view of the immense benefits that would accrue to participating countries, Myanmar promised to give careful consideration to India’s suggestion to join the Framework Agreement for the establishment of the International Solar Alliance.
	The two sides noted the current level of bilateral trade and investment and agreed that, while robust, it has potential for growth. In this regard, they emphasized the need to improve market access by removing all trade barriers with a view to facilitate trade between the two countries.

                म्‍यांमार में रहने वाले मेरे भारतीय और भारतीय मूल के मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो और बहनो, नमस्‍कार।

अभी-अभी आप सबने गणेश चतुर्थी का त्‍योहार मनाया, ईद मनाई; आप सभी को इन त्‍योहारों की मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएँ। आशा करता हूँ ये त्‍योहार आपके लिए बहुत सुख, समृद्धि और शांति लाएँ।

I am very happy to be here with you today. मेरी बहुत इच्‍छा थी कि मैं इस historical और spiritual शहर में आऊँ, इच्‍छा थी कि देखूं इस Yangon को जो अपनी विरासत के लिए दुनिया भर में मशहूर है। जिसका भारत के साथ सदियों पुराना नाता भी है। और यहाँ at this historical and spiritual gateway to the East आप लोगों से मिलूं, आप सबसे, जिन्‍होंने भारत और म्‍यांमार, दोनों देशों को अपने दिलों में समेटा हुआ है। मैं यहां अपने सामने एक लघु, एक mini India के मैं दर्शन कर रहा हूं। भारत के अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों से आए हुए आप लोग एक महान राष्‍ट्र के दिल में एक दूसरे महान राष्‍ट्र की धड़कन के रूप में जी रहे हैं। आप लोगों से मिलकर मुझे और भी खुशी हो रही है, क्‍योंकि आप के रूप में मैं एक ही जगह उन परम्‍पराओं और सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत को देख रहा हूं, जिन्‍हें गंगा, गोदावरी, कृष्‍णा, कावेरी, ब्रह्मपुत्र और इरावती जैसी उदार माताओं ने अपने आंचल में पाला है।

You represent thousands of years of the shared culture and civilization, geography and history, aspirations and achievements of the great sons and daughters of India and Myanmar.   

हजारों वर्षों से भारत और म्‍यांमार की सिर्फ सीमाएं ही नहीं, बल्कि भावनाएं भी एक-दूसरे से जुड़ी हुई हैं। भारत में म्‍यांमार को ब्रह्मदेश या भगवान ब्रह्मा की धरती भी कहा जाता है। साथियो, ये वो पवित्र धरती है जिसने बुद्ध को सहेजा है, उनकी शिक्षाओं को संवारा है। यहां के बौद्ध ग्रंथों और भिक्षुओं ने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के कोने-कोने में, भारत के सभी राज्‍यों के साथ सैंकड़ों साल से भी ज्‍यादा एक अटूट रिश्‍ते को पाला-पोसा है, जिसमें न केवल धर्म, बल्कि पाली भाषा, साहित्‍य और शिक्षा भी शामिल रहे हैं। भारत को और विश्‍व को म्‍यांमार की पुण्‍य भूमि में स्‍वर्गीय गोयनका जी के माध्‍यम से विपासना का उपहार दिया है। और मुझे खुशी है कि उनके सुपुत्र आज हमारे बीच हैं।

म्‍यांमार में भी आज भी, रामायण को यामा के नाम से पेश किया जाता है, विद्या की देवी सरस्‍वती को आप लोग थरूथरी के नाम पर से पूजते हैं और शिव को परविजवा, विष्‍णु को विथानो कहते हैं।

भारत के स्‍वतंत्रता आंदोलन का इतिहास बिना म्‍यांमार को नमन किए बिना पूरा कभी नहीं हो सकता है। ये वो पवित्र धरती है, जहां से सुभाषचंद्र बोस ने गरज करके कहा था, ‘तुम मुझे खून दो, मैं तुम्‍हें आजादी दूंगा।‘उनका ये नारा सुनकर भारत को अपनी जान से भी ज्‍यादा प्‍यार करने वाले हजारों, लाखों नौजवान और यु‍वतियां अपनी जान की परवाह किए बिना, भारत में और भारत के बाहर आजाद हिन्‍द फौज को सहयोग देने के लिए चल दिए थे। और मुझे भी आज उस आजाद हिन्‍द फौज के कुछ उस समय के जिनकी जवानी लगाई थी, अब तो काफी बुजुर्ग हुए; उनके दर्शन का, उनके आशीर्वाद का मुझे आज यहां पर सौभाग्‍य मिला है। जब नेताजी ने यहां आजाद हिन्‍द सरकार का एलान किया, तो भारत में अंग्रेजी शासन की जड़ें हिल गई थीं। ये वो पवित्र धरती है जहां की Manle Jail में 6 साल कैद रहते हुए बाल गंगाधर तिलक, लोकमान्‍य तिलक जी ने गीता रहस्‍य की रचना की थी। ये वो पवित्र धरती है, जहां पर महात्‍मा गांधी, लाला लाजपतराय, गुरुवर रविन्‍द्रनाथ टैगोर जैसे महा-मानवों ने कई बार इनके चरण इस धरती पर पड़़े थे।

जब विदेशी ताकतों से भारत को स्‍वतंत्र कराने के लिए देश के वीर सपूतों को अपना घर छोड़ना पड़ता था तो म्‍यांमार ही उनका दूसरा घर बन जाता था। 1857 के पहले स्‍वातंत्र्य संग्राम के बाद बादशाह बहादुरशाह जफर को दो गज जमीन भी इसी धरती पर मिली थी।

मैं जब भी किसी देश में जाता हूं तो भारतीय समुदाय से मिलकर उनके आशीर्वाद पाने का मुझे अवसर मिलता है। पिछले दिनों जब मैं श्रीलंका यात्रा के दौरान जाफना गया। ऐसे पहली बार हुआ कि कोई भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री जाफना गया। वहां मैं तमिल मूल के लोगों से मिला। उनके लिए भारत की सहायता से बनाए घर उन्‍हें सौंपने का सौभाग्‍य भी मुझे मिला। इस साल मई में जब दोबारा बुद्ध पूर्णिमा के समय मुझे  श्रीलंका जाने का अवसर मिला, इंटरनेशनल समारोह में भाग लेने के लिए मुझे निमंत्रण मिला था। तब मैं Central Sri Lanka के तमिल भाई-बहनों से भी मिला। वहां भारत की मदद से बने एक हॉस्पिटल का inauguration करने के बाद हजारों लोगों ने आकर मुझे इतना प्‍यार दिया, कि मुझे वो दिन कभी भी नहीं भूल सकता। मेरे तमिल भाइयों ने श्रीलंका की धरती पर इतना प्‍यार दिया। मैं साउथ अरेबिया में गया, ConstructionWorks हों, या कीनिया में किसान और व्‍यापारी हो, या सिलिकोन वैली में सियोद हों, विदेशों में रह रहे भारतीयों और Indian Origin  के लोगों से मिलकर मुझे अपनापन महसूस होता है। एक प्रकार से ये हमारे सरकारी व्‍यवस्‍था में राजदूत होते हैं, आप सब हमारे राष्‍ट्रदूत हैं। और आप पर गर्व भी होता है कि जहां आप रहते हैं, आपने वहां development और harmony को तो बढ़ाया ही है, आपने अपने भारतीय संस्‍कार और मूल्‍य भी संजो करके रखे हैं; और ये बहुत बड़ी बात होती है।

United Nations में तीन साल पहले भारत के initiative पर अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय योगा दिवस का प्रस्ताव record time में record sport के साथ पारित हुआ।पिछले तीन साल से दुनियाभर में 21 जून, International Yoga Day के तौर पर व्‍यापक रूप से मनाया जा रहा है और जब योगा की बात आती है, तो भारत का स्‍मरण स्‍वाभाविक होता है।

This global recognition of Yoga is your achievement because it was taken to all corners  of the world by the people of India.

आपका भारत से bond सिर्फ भावात्‍मक नहीं है, आप भारत के विकास से भी ठोस रूप से जुड़े रहे हैं। अनेक प्रवासी भारतीय अब भारत के विकास में सहयोग दे रहे हैं। वे अपने या अपने पुरखों केstates में development projects में सहयोग कर रहे हैं। युवा वर्ग तो और भी अधिक active है। न सिर्फ social media के माध्यम से regular engagement है, बल्कि भारत के बारे में जानने की उनकी इच्‍छा भी दिनों-दिन बढ़ती चली जा रही है, और अधिक strong होती जा रही है। गत वर्ष हमने प्रवासी youth के लिए Know India, भारत को जानो, quiz प्रतियोगिता का आयोजन किया था, quiz competition,और ये निरंतर चलने वाली प्रक्रिया है। और मुझे ये जान करके खुशी भी हुई और आश्‍चर्य भी हुआ, इसमें लगभग 100 देशों के प्रवासी भारतीय युवाओं ने हिस्‍सा लिया। यानी वो देश जहां पर second generation, third generation Indian बच्‍चे हैं, उन्‍होंने इसमें बढ़-चढ़कर भाग लिया।

When I meet you, I also feel that communicationof our people living in foreign countries  with government authorities in India is not a one-way traffic any more.

यहां आने से पहले मैंने आप लोगों से Narender Modi App के माध्‍यम से सुझाव मांगे थे। मुझे खुशी है, कि आप लोगों ने बहुत अच्‍छे सुझाव मुझे भेजे हैं और मैं इसके लिए आपका आभारी हूं।

मेरी सरकार के पहले दिन से ही प्रवासी भारतीयों का welfare, ये हमारी priorityमेंहै। OCI और PIO Schemes को merge करना, Long term Visa वालों को Police Reporting से मुक्ति दिलाना, पासपोर्ट मिलने में आसानी होना, Indian Community Welfare Fund का उचित और efficient प्रयोग, प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस को re-energies करना, और विश्‍व के अलग-अलग हिस्‍सों में क्षेत्रीय प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस का आयोजन; ऐसे अनेक कदम हमने प्रवासी भारतीयों की आवश्‍यकताओं और feedback को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए उठाया है। और मैं नहीं समझता, कि किसी अन्‍य देश के विदेश मंत्री, विदेश में बसे या फंसे अपने देश के लोगों के दु:ख-दर्द को लेकर इतने active हैं, जितनी कि भारत की हमारी विदेश मंत्री, सुषमा स्‍वराज हैं।

पूरी दुनिया में किसी भारतीय नागरिक को, या भारतीय मूल के प्रवासी को किसी भी प्रकार की समस्‍या होती है, तो बिना हिचक वे सुषमा जी से twitter पर संपर्क करते हैं, उनकी समस्‍या का समाधान हो जाता है। मेरा भी यही संदेश है आप सब लोगों को कि पासपोर्ट की समस्‍या हो या Visa की, या परदेश में legal assistance की, भारत की Embassy के दरवाजे भारतीय समाज के लिए 24x7 = 365 days, खुले हैं।

साथियो, भारत को आज दुनिया में सम्‍मान की निगाह से देखा जा रहा है तो उसका कारण, उसका कारण, उसका कारण आप हैं, आप भारत के सच्‍चे राष्‍ट्रदूत हैं, और उसका कारण ये है कि भारत बहुत तेजी से बदल रहा है, आगे बढ़ रहा है।

We are not merely reforming our country, we are transforming India.  We are not merely changing India, we are building a new India. We celebrated 70 years of India’s Independence, last month. After five years, in 2022 it will be seventy five years of India’s Independence. We have pledged to build will a new India by the time Independent India turns 75 years.

हमने संकल्‍प किया है कि हम गरीबी-मुक्‍त, आतंकवाद-मुक्‍त, communalism free, जातिवाद-मुक्‍त, भ्रष्‍टाचार-मुक्‍त, clean India बनाएंगे और बना करके ही रहेंगे। मैं आपसे भी यही कहूंगा कि New India Website पर आप भी इस महा-मिशन में शामिल हों।

साथियों, मेरा मानना है कि 19वीं शताब्‍दी, 19वीं सदी की design पर 21वीं सदी का Infrastructure नहीं चल सकता है। और Infrastructure का मतलब सिर्फ सड़कें बनाना और rail network बिछाना ही नहीं होता। 21वीं सदी के Infrastructure का आधार हर वो चीज है, जो लोगों को आधुनिक technique से connect करे, उनकी जिंदगी में बदलाव लाए, Quality of life में change लाए। पूरी दुनिया में Solar Energy बढ़ाने का सबसे बड़ा कार्यक्रम आज भारत में चल रहा है।

आज भारत में रेलवे, सड़क, एयरपोर्ट पर जितना निवेश किया जा रहा है, उतना पहले कभी नहीं किया गया। देश की हर ग्राम पंचायत का optical fiber बिछाकर जोड़ने का काम बहुत तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। समंदर के किनारे बसे शहरों और ports को विकसित करने के लिए सागरमाला परियोजना तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रही है।

मैं समझता हूं इन प्रयासों से देश में Infrastructure के साथ एक नया Infracultureभी विकसित होगा। और उसका एक और अभिन्‍न हिस्‍सा होगा agriculture. हमारी सरकार भारत के किसानों की आमदनी double करने के लक्ष्‍य पर काम कर रही है। इसके लिए बीज से बाजार तक हम अनेक कदम उठा रहे हैं, जैसे- Soil health card, neem coated यूरिया, micro irrigation, crop insurance, food processing parks, cold storage chain, ढेर सारी बातें मैं गिना सकता हूं। Green और White Revolution की तरह हम सब Green Revolution  से परिचित हैं, White Revolution से परिचित हैं। लेकिन अब दो और revolutionका भी, पर भी हमारा बल है, एक है blue revolution और दूसरा है Sweet Revolution. जब मैं blue revolution कहता हूं तब सिर्फ मछुआरों के लिए, भला हो ऐसा नहीं है, सामुद्रिक सामर्थ्‍य का भी एक नया युग आरंभ हुआ है। उसी प्रकार से Sweet Revolution, यानी मधुमक्‍खी पालन से भी शहद के द्वारा बहुत बड़़ी आय की भी संभावनाओं को हम तराश रहे हैं, प्रयास कर रहे हैं।

साथ ही हम देश के हित में बड़े, बड़े और कड़े; देश के हित में हम बड़े और कड़े फैसले लेने से जरा भी घबराते नहीं हैं। और ये इसलिए कर पाते हैं, कि हमारे लिए दल से बड़ा देश है। हमारे लिए देश सब कुछ है। चाहे surgical strike हो या नोटबंदी, या GST, इस सरकार ने देश के हित में हर फैसला बिना किसी डर या संकोच से लिया है।

जब अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था और उसको काले धन और भ्रष्‍टाचार से मुक्ति दिलाने के लिए कड़ा फैसला लेने की आवश्‍यकता हुई तो 1000 और 500 रुपये के नोट बंद करने का फैसला भी हम ले पाए। मुट्ठीभर कुछ लोगों के भ्रष्‍टाचार की कीमत अब देश के सवा सौ करोड़ लोग उठा रहे थे, ये हमें मंजूर नहीं है। बेईमानी के पैसे की ये ताकत थी, वो कहां से आ रहा है, किसके पास जा रहा है; ये कागज पर नजर नहीं आता था। काले धन का कोई address नहीं होता है।

साथियो नोटबंदी के बाद अब ऐसे लाखों लोगों के बारे में पता चला है जिनके account में करोड़ों, अरबों रुपये जमा हैं, लेकिन उन्‍होंने कभी income tax return नहीं भरा था। ऐसी लाखों कम्‍पनियों का भी पता चला है जो सिर्फ काले धन को इधर से उधर करने का ही काम कर रही थीं। सिर्फ तीन महीने में, मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, आपको जान करके संतोष होगा, सिर्फ तीन महीने में दो लाख से ज्‍यादा कम्‍‍पनियों का registration रद्द किया जा चुका है, और उनके bank account भी freeze कर दिए गए हैं।

अभी दो महीने पहले ही देश में GST लागू किया गया है। मैं GST को simple भाषा में Good  and Simple Tax कहता हूं। GST से भी देश में ईमानदारी के साथ कारोबार करने का नया culture पैदा हो रहा है। जितने व्‍यापारी पिछले 6 साल में देश के tax system से नहीं जुड़े थे, उतने GST लागू होने के बाद सिर्फ दो महीने में जुड़ चुके हैं। जो काम 6 साल में होता है, वो सिर्फ 60 दिन में हो जाए; ये अपने-आप में काम कैसे हो रहा है, उसका उदाहरण है। पिछले तीन वर्षों में भारत में परिवर्तन के एक बड़े दौर की शुरूआत हुई, minimum government, maximum governance के सिद्धांत पर चलते हुए तमाम प्रक्रियाओं को आसान बनाया जा रहा है, simplify किया जा रहा है, कानून बदले जा रहे हैं, ease of doingbusiness के लिए नियम सरल किए जा रहे हैं, देश के लोगों में ये भरोसा लौटा है कि भारत बदल सकता है, आगे बढ़ सकता है, दशकों पुरानी जिन बुराइयों ने भारत को जकड़ करके रखा है, उनसे अब भारत मुक्‍त हो सकता है, ये भरोसा देशवासियों में पैदा हुआ है।

साथियो, भारत अपने विकास का लाभ सिर्फ खुद तक नहीं रखता है। अगर हमारे पास जो है, उसे हम मिलकर, बांटकर खाएं, तो उसका आनंद कई गुना बढ़ जाता है। अफ्रीका हो या साउथ एशिया, या पैसेफिक आईलैंड, हमारी क्षमताएं, हमारा अनुभव, हम सभी developing देशों के साथ खुले मन से share करते थे। 2014 में मैंने South Asian satellite का वायदा किया था। और इस साल हमने इसे launch कर दिया है। भारत का ही नहीं, सभी पड़ोसी देश जो इससे जुड़े हैं, उन्‍हें भी इस satellite का लाभ मिल रहा है।

Natural disaster या किसी अन्‍य प्रकार की crisis के समय भी हम first responders रहे हैं, न सिर्फ भारतीयों के लिए बल्कि हर किसी के लिए, जिसकी हम सहायता कर सकते हैं; हमने करने में पहल की है, प्रयास किया है। और जब हम ऐसी मदद करते हैं तो हम कभी पासपोर्ट का रंग नहीं पूछा करते। नेपाल में भूकंप आया, मालदीव में अचानक पानी की समस्‍या आ गई, फिजी के अंदर समुद्री तूफान आ गया, पश्चिम एशिया में हिंसा के इलाकों में हजारों भारतीयों, विदेशियों का evacuation की बात हो, म्‍यांमार में  cyclone के बाद राहत और re-habilitation के लिए सहायता करने में हमने एक अच्‍छे पड़ोसी का कर्तव्‍य निभाया है।

सा‍थियो, वसुदेव कुटुम्‍बकम, यानी के whole world is a family, ये विचारधारा हमारी परम्‍परा है और हमें इसे पर गर्व है; ये हमारी रगों में है। आज सारी दुनिया भारत को third leader के रूप में पहचानना शुरू किया है। अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय योग दिवस का प्रस्‍ताव हो या International Solar Alliance की नई पहल हो, या BRICS की अगले 10 वर्षों की golden decade की विचारधारा; आज भारत की आवाज विश्‍व में सुनाई देती है, गूंज सुनाई देती है। एक नए प्रकार का भरोसा है, विश्‍व को; भारत के प्रति एक नई आशा जगी है।

भाइयो और बहनों, भारत उत्‍तर-पूर्व के राज्‍यों को South-East Asia को Gateway मानता है। और इस Gateway का दरवाजा म्‍यांमार की तरफ ही खुलता है। और इसलिए भारत इस Gateway को जोड़ने वाली सड़कों पर तेज गति से काम कर रहा है। कुछ महीनों पहले 1600 करोड़ रुपये के Imphal-Moreh section को upgrade करने का काम हमने मंजूर कर दिया है। Moreh में एक integrated check post भी बनाया जा रहा है। इस project के बाद मणिपुर और म्‍यांमार के बीच व्‍यापार और लोगों का आना-जाना भी आसान हो जाएगा। हमने Sittwe Port तदा inland water terminalपर भी काम पूरा करके Kaladanproject में निरंतर और प्रत्‍यक्ष प्रगति की है। रोड कम्‍पोटेंट पर काम शुरू हो चुका है। मुझे कोई संदेह नहीं कि ये transport corridor आसपास के क्षेत्रों को development corridor में बदल के ही रहेगा, ऐसा मेरा विश्‍वास है। Upper म्‍यांमार की जरूरत को पूरा करने के लिए भारत से high speed diesel ट्रकों द्वारा आना शुरू हो चुका है। हम border Crossing agreement तथा motor vehicles agreement करके तथा power और energy trading को और अधिक बढ़ावा देकर आपसी सहयोग को कई गुना बढ़ाना चाहते हैं। हमने अपने development co-operation और capacity building partnership के माध्‍यम से जो कुछ भी हासिल किया है उस पर आज भारत को गर्व है, नाज है।

भारत का लोकतांत्रिक अनुभव हम म्‍यांमार के साथshare कर रहे हैं। हमारे people to people तथा social culture संबंध हमारी सबसे बड़ी धरोहर हैं, और इन्‍हें मजबूत करने के लिए हमने भारत आने के इच्‍छुक म्‍यांमार के सभी नागरिकों को, म्‍यांमार के सभी नागरिकों को gratis visa देने का निर्णय कर लिया है। हमने म्‍यांमार के 40 मछुआरों को रिहा करने का निर्णय भी कर लिया है, जो इस समय भारत की जेलों में बंद हैं। हम आशा करते हैं कि वे जल्‍द ही म्‍यांमार में अपने परिवारों से फिर से मिल पाएंगे।

आज मैं Bagan में Ananda Temple गया था। Ananda Temple एवं अन्‍य ऐतिहासिक व सांस्‍कृतिक इमारतों में पिछले साल के भूकंप से हुए नुकसान के बाद भारत के सहयोग से renovation हो रहा है। भारत और म्‍यांमार के बीच इतने ऐतिहासिक संबंध हैं कि उनकी जानकारी एक बहुत बड़ा विषय है, और मेरा मानना है कि आने वाली पीढ़ियों को भी इनकी जानकारी रहनी चाहिए। इस संबंध में मिलकर रिसर्च के प्रयास होने चाहिए।

मैंने यहां अपनी बातचीत में सरकार के समक्ष एक प्रस्‍ताव रखा है। INA Memorial का survey हम एक साथ कर सकते हैं। एक joint history project की स्‍थापना की जा सकती है, इसे दोनों देशों के बीच people to people contact और मजबूत होंगे।

मुझे आपको बताते खुशी है कि हमने National Registration Card के आधार पर OCI देने का निर्णय ले लिया है। दोनों देशों के बीच सांस्‍कृतिक संबंधों को और मजबूती देने के लिए Indian Council for Cultural Relations की scholarship की संख्‍या में बढ़ोत्‍तरी करने का भी फैसला भारत सरकार ने कर लिया है।

Friends, मैंने एक बार कहीं पढ़ा था कि भारत और म्‍यांमार के रिश्‍तों का आधार 5B है, 5B. यानी कि Buddhism, Business, Bollywood, bharatnatyamऔर Burma Teak. लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि इसमें सबसे महत्‍वपूर्ण B छूट गया है। और यह B है भरोसा, भारत और म्‍यांमार का एक-दूसरे पर भरोसा। इस भरोसे की बुनियाद सैंकड़ों वर्षों में मजबूत हुई है, और समय के साथ और मजबूत होती जा रही है।

भाइयो और बहनों, सबका साथ-सबका विकास के जिस मंत्र पर हमारी सरकार चल रही है, वो सीमाओं में बंधा हुआ नहीं है। सबका साथ-यानी हर देश का साथ, सबका विकास-यानी हर देश का विकास। भारत विकास के कार्यों में म्‍यांमार के साथ-साथ चलने के लिए पूरी तरह प्रतिबद्ध है।

आप इसमें, आपके आशीर्वाद के लिए मैं आपको फिर नमन करता हूं। आपके दर्शन करने का सौभाग्‍य मिला, आप सबका बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद। इतनी बड़ी संख्‍या में आप लोग आए, देश की बातें सुनने के लिए, देश के साथ लगाव के कारण, देश के साथ जुड़ने के इरादे से, इतनी बड़ी तादाद में आप आए। मैं फिर एक बार हृदयपूर्वक आपका आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं, इस धरती को नमन करता हूं, आप सबको नमन करता हूं। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

	At the invitation of H.E. U Htin Kyaw, President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, is paying his first bilateral State visit to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar from 5th to 7th September 2017. The visit is part of the continuing high level interaction between the leaders of the two countries and follows successive State visits to India last year by H.E. President U Htin Kyaw and H.E. State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
	Prime Minister Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Presidential Palace in Nay Pyi Taw on 5th September 2017. He paid a courtesy call on the President of Myanmar, who hosted a State Banquet in his honour. On 6th September 2017, the Indian delegation led by Prime Minister Modi held bilateral talks with the Myanmar delegation led by State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The talks were held in a warm, cordial and constructive atmosphere as befits the close and friendly relations between the two countries. Thereafter, the State Counsellor and the Indian Prime Minister witnessed the signing and exchange of various documents between Myanmar and India in the areas of health, culture, capacity building, maritime security and collaboration between key institutions and held a Joint Press Conference.
	Apart from his official engagements in Nay Pyi Taw, Prime Minister Modi will visit places of historical and cultural importance at Bagan and Yangon. In Bagan, he will visit the holy and historic Ananda Temple, where restoration work is being carried out by Indian and Myanmar archaeologists under the expert guidance of the Archaeological Survey of India. In Yangon, he will pay his respects to the memory of General Aung San at the Martyrs’ Mausoleum and also visit the Bogyoke Aung San Museum as well as other prominent sites. He will interact with the Indian origin and expatriate Indian community of Myanmar during his stay in Yangon.
	During the talks, the two leaders reviewed developments since the very successful State visits of the President and the State Counsellor of Myanmar to India in August and October 2016 respectively. They reviewed ongoing official exchanges, economic, trade and cultural ties, as well as people-to-people exchanges that reflect the harmony between Myanmar’s independent, active and non-aligned foreign policy and India’s pragmatic Act East and Neighbourhood First policies. They pledged to pursue new opportunities to further deepen and broaden bilateral relations for the mutual benefit of the people of both countries. They reaffirmed their common aspirations for peace, collective prosperity and development of the region and beyond.
	The Prime Minister of India appreciated the measures taken by the Government of Myanmar towards peace and national reconciliation and commended the on-going peace process of the Government of Myanmar. He noted that peace and stability in Myanmar are of the highest priority to India and reiterated India’s continued support to the Government of Myanmar in consolidating democratic institutions in Myanmar and for the emergence of a democratic Federal Republic.
	The two leaders discussed the security situation prevailing along their borders and expressed concern at various incidents of terrorism and extremist-inspired violence that have taken place in their respective territories. Recognizing that terrorism remains one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region, both sides condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and agreed that the fight against terrorism should target not only terrorists, terror organisations and networks, but also identify, hold accountable and take strong measures against States and entities that encourage, support or finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups, and falsely extol their virtues. Myanmar condemned the recent barbaric terror attacks during the Amarnath Yatra in India as also various acts of terror perpetrated by terrorists from across the borders. India condemned the recent terrorist attacks in northern Rakhine State, wherein several members of the Myanmar security forces lost their lives. Both sides agreed that terrorism violates human rights and there should, therefore, be no glorification of terrorists as martyrs. They called on the international community to end selective and partial approaches to combating terrorism and, in this regard, jointly called for the expeditious finalization and adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism by the United Nations General Assembly.
	Recognising that maintenance of security and stability along the common border is essential for the socio-economic development of the peoples of the border areas, Myanmar reaffirmed its respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and steadfastly upheld the policy of not allowing any insurgent group to utilise Myanmar’s soil to undertake hostile acts against the Indian Government. Myanmar also appreciated Government of India for upholding the same principle.
	Both sides reiterated their mutual respect for the already demarcated boundary between the two countries and emphasised the need to resolve outstanding boundary demarcation issues as fast as possible through existing bilateral mechanisms and consultations.
	Both sides reviewed the security situation in their immediate neighborhood and agreed upon the special need for enhancing closer bilateral cooperation in maritime security. They also agreed to foster mutually beneficial and deeper defence cooperation between the two countries and, in this context, noted with satisfaction the recent successful visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of Myanmar to India. Besides institutionalized cooperation through regular coordinated patrolling initiatives, they agreed to focus on bilateral maritime cooperation in non-traditional security domains, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, which are critical for safeguarding the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean as global commons.
	Both sides pledged that Myanmar and India will maintain the already-achieved mutual understanding and growing bilateral relations between the two countries and that they will stand by each other as good and trustworthy neighbours in the years ahead in the interest of both peoples and the region.
	The two sides noted with satisfaction the continued exchange of high-level visits that has fostered better mutual understanding of outstanding bilateral issues. They appreciated the regular holding of sector specific institutional mechanisms in the areas of security and defence, trade and commerce, power and energy, border management and connectivity etc. for effective follow-up of decisions taken at the highest political levels. They also noted with pleasure the excellent exchanges between Indian and Myanmar Parliamentarians and encouraged them to further enhance such interaction.
	The Myanmar side expressed its heartfelt appreciation to Government of India for all the assistance rendered to Myanmar in support of its endeavour for socio-economic development. Both sides reviewed on-going cooperation projects being executed with technical and financial assistance from the Government of India, noting that these were directly associated with the benefit of the Myanmar people, and agreed that these should be expedited. Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s abiding commitment to supporting Myanmar in its efforts to build infrastructure and develop human resources capacity. Alluding to the positive experience of the Industrial Training Centres set up with Indian assistance in Pakokku and Myingyan, the Myanmar side thanked India for the support being extended to develop two more Centres at Monywa and Thaton respectively as well as the assistance for a five year comprehensive maintenance plan for ITC, Myingyan. They also expressed appreciation for the support offered by India to upgrade the Myanmar-India Entrepreneurship Development Centre and the Centre for English Language Training at Yangon. The two sides also agreed to continue discussion towards the establishment of a Planetarium at a suitable location in Myanmar, recognizing that this would be a valuable institution that would nurture a scientific temper amongst the Myanmar youth.
	The two sides shared the view that the situation in Rakhine State had a developmental as well as a security dimension. In this context, they agreed to bring about overall socio-economic development in the State by undertaking both infrastructure and socio-economic projects, particularly in the spheres of education, health, agriculture and allied activities, agro-processing, community development, construction of small bridges, upgradation of roads, small power projects, livelihood activity, setting up of training centres, promotion of household crafts, conservation of environment and cultural heritage. Myanmar welcomed India's offer of assistance under the Rakhine State Development Programme and the two sides agreed to finalize the implementation modalities within the next few months
	The two sides noted with satisfaction the cooperation in the field of agricultural research and education, especially through the rapid progress in operationalizing the Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education set up at the Yezin Agricultural University and the Rice Bio Park set up at the Department of Agricultural Research. It also appreciated India’s assistance for facilitating post graduation and doctoral education in agricultural sciences for candidates from Myanmar.
	The two sides expressed satisfaction at the ongoing capacity building programmes for Myanmar judicial officers, military personnel and police. Myanmar thanked India for the extended period of support to the Myanmar Institute of Information Technology and the India-Myanmar Centre for Enhancement of IT Skills. They agreed that India would extend regular training to Myanmar diplomats at the Foreign Service Institute, New Delhi. Myanmar welcomed India’s offer to enrol two Myanmar diplomats every year for training at the Kendriya Hindi Sansthan while 150 Myanmar civil servants would undergo training in English language at Indian training institutes every year for a period of five years.
	Recognizing the need to further upgrade the training infrastructure and capacity building of Myanmar Police, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the Memorandum on Upgradation of the Women’s Police Training Center at Yamethin in Myanmar with technical and financial assistance of Government of India. Myanmar welcomed India’s offer to help set up a training centre for police officers in Yangon and it was decided that modalities would be jointly worked out.
	Myanmar thanked India for supporting various projects in Myanmar that enhance bilateral as well as regional connectivity like the Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and other road and bridge construction projects as fully funded grant-in-aid projects. Myanmar appreciated the substantial progress made on the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project with the completion of works on the Sittwe Port and the Paletwa Inland Water Transport Terminal and the handing over of six cargo barges to the Myanmar Port Authority and Inland Water Transport. The two sides agreed to enter into an MoU on appointing a port operator that may include both sides to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the port in keeping with the practice that has been adopted at other international ports in Myanmar. This would enable the Port and IWT infrastructure to be used commercially and promote development of the surrounding areas even as the final component of the project, the road from Paletwa to Zorinpui, is under construction. Both sides noted with satisfaction that work on the road was already underway and agreed to facilitate movement of project personnel, construction material and equipment across the border through Zorinpui and Paletwa. They also noted that construction work would shortly begin on reconstruction of bridges on the Tamu-Kyigone-Kalewa Road and on the Kalewa-Yargyi sector of the Trilateral Highway. The two sides have agreed upon the alignment of the Rih-Tedim road and the DPR for its construction. Further steps on construction of the Putao-Myitkyina and Alethankyaw-Ahungmaw roads under available LOC would be taken after DPRs are made available by Myanmar. In response to Myanmar’s request, India agreed to undertake preparation of DPRs for the Rihkhawdar-Zowkhathar bridge and the Bwaynu bridge.
	The two sides also reviewed projects in the field of health and noted with satisfaction that work on the upgradation of Yangon Childrens' Hospital and Sittwe General Hospital and on construction of Monywa General Hospital had been completed. They agreed to start consultations to establish and operate a state-of-the-art hospital in Nay Pyi Taw in association with one of the leading Indian hospital groups, based on modalities to be mutually decided.
	Both sides deliberated on the progress made in utilization of US$ 500 million concessional Line of Credit extended by India to Myanmar in 2012. Noting that the projects to be implemented under the Line of Credit would help augment the physical infrastructure in vital areas and enhance capacities in agriculture and transport, they resolved to implement mutually agreed projects expeditiously.
	Both sides expressed that, in order to derive full value from these infrastructure projects, the institutional arrangements related to connectivity needed to be put in place on priority. In this regard, they noted the importance of concluding a bilateral agreement that would enable motor vehicle traffic, both passenger and cargo, to cross the border.
	Both sides underlined the need for bringing about greater integration of power and energy supply networks between India and Myanmar. Myanmar welcomed India's participation in its energy sector both in exploration and production and invited Indian companies to participate in tenders for petrochemicals and petroleum products, marketing infrastructure and setting up of LPG terminals. India informed that leading Indian oil and gas companies are in the process of opening their offices in Myanmar. The two sides applauded the agreement reached by Numaligarh Refinery of India and Parami Energy Group of Myanmar on supply of diesel to Myanmar across the land border, noting that this will give the people of north Myanmar cheaper and more reliable access to petroleum products, and also encouraged both sides to collaborate in storage and retail marketing of petroleum products in Myanmar. The first consignment of the high speed diesel reached Myanmar on 4th September 2017.
	India also expressed its readiness to extend technical as well as project-specific assistance to conventional as well as renewable energy-based power development projects identified by Government of Myanmar. In addition to the earlier offer to conduct a feasibility study for development of solar parks in Myanmar, India offered to conduct a solar radiation resource assessment in Myanmar. The two sides discussed ways to cooperate in the field of energy efficiency between the two countries. Myanmar thanked India for the technology demonstration projects being undertaken through Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. of India to introduce LED-based energy efficient lighting in key townships and buildings identified by Myanmar in Nay Pyi Taw, Bago region and Rakhine State. India shared its experiences in power trade and expressed its interest in examining possible cooperation in this area with Myanmar. It was agreed that these and other relevant issues would be taken up at an early meeting of the Joint Steering Committee on Power and other forums. In view of the immense benefits that would accrue to participating countries, Myanmar promised to give careful consideration to India’s suggestion to join the Framework Agreement for the establishment of the International Solar Alliance.
	The two sides noted the current level of bilateral trade and investment and agreed that, while robust, it has potential for growth. In this regard, they emphasized the need to improve market access by removing all trade barriers with a view to facilitate trade between the two countries. They expressed satisfaction with the conclusions reached at the 6th meeting of Myanmar-India Joint Trade Committee held in New Delhi, India in June, 2017 and agreed to continue holding of meetings on Border Trade Committee and Border Haats Committee.

In this context, the State Counsellor expressed grave concern at the recent notification issued by India imposing quantitative restrictions on various categories of pulses and requested Prime Minister of India to lift all restrictions on imports from Myanmar in view of the bonds of friendship and long term interests of the two peoples and nations. The Indian Prime Minister responded that it was important to work out long term arrangements whereby the interests of both the peoples could be safeguarded in future.
	The two sides welcomed the successful negotiations and finalization of the agreement on border crossing which will help in regulating and harmonizing movement of people across the common land border and thus promote bilateral trade and tourism and directed their senior officials to expeditiously conclude the formalities for its signature.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian community in Yangon, Myanmar.

The Prime Minister elaborated on the rich spiritual traditions of Myanmar. 

The Prime Minister said that the Indian diaspora is like “Rashtra-doot” for India. He said that the global recognition of Yoga is the achievement of the diaspora, who took it to all corners of the world. 

“When I meet you, I also feel that communication of our people living in foreign countries with government authorities in India is not a one way traffic any more,” the Prime Minister said. 

“We are not merely reforming our country, we are transforming it,” the Prime Minister asserted, adding that an India free from poverty, terrorism, corruption, communalism, and casteism is being created. 

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government in India is focusing on infrastructure. He said that good infrastructure is no longer about roads and railways alone - it includes several other aspects that bring about a qualitative change in society. He said that the Government has not shied away from taking decisions that are tough. 

The Prime Minister said GST is ushering in a new culture across the nation. He said that the people of India have the confidence that India can be transformed and we can break free from some of the evils that entered our system. 

The Prime Minister said that people-to-people ties are the strength of India-Myanmar relations. 

Mr. Phyo Min Thein, Chief Minister of Yangon Region, was present at the gathering.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited the Ananda Temple, at Bagan in Myanmar. 

 

This is a Buddhist temple built in the early 12th century. It is the second largest temple in the entire Bagan region. The Archaeological Survey of India has carried out structural conservation and chemical preservation work of this temple. Restoration work is being carried out after damage during the earthquake last year. The Prime Minister was shown a photo exhibit depicting the ongoing restoration work at the temple. He offered prayers and made a Parikrama of the temple, during which ASI representatives explained the restoration process. 

 

The Prime Minister signed the visitors' book at the Temple, and unveiled a plaque signifying the contribution of India, in the restoration of the Ananda Temple. 

 



 

 

The ASI has undertaken several major conservation works across various countries of Asia. Besides the Ananda Temple, these include the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Ta Prohm Temple in Cambodia, the Vat Phou Temple in Laos, and the My Son Temple in Vietnam.

                Your Excellency, the State Counsellor

Distinguished delegates,

Friends from media,

Minglaba,

I came here in 2014 on the occasion of ASEAN summit, however, this is my first bilateral visit to the golden land of Myanmar. But I’m feeling at home due to the warm welcome accorded to me. I’m grateful to the government of Myanmar for this.

Excellency,

Your courageous leadership of Myanmar peace process is praiseworthy. We thoroughly understand the challenges that you have been facing. We are partners in your concerns over the loss of lives of security forces and innocent people due to the extremist violence in Rakhine State.

Be it a large peace process or be it to resolve a specific problem, we hope that all the stakeholders can work together in the direction to find such a solution that will ensure peace, justice and dignity for all by respecting the unity and territorial integrity of Myanmar.

Friends,

I believe that India’s democratic experience is also relevant for Myanmar. And therefore we are pride of our comprehensive cooperation in the capacity building of the institutions like the executive, the legislature, election commission and press council. Our interests in the area of security are common as neighbors. It’s essential that we work together to ensure the stability of our long territorial and coastal borders. The construction of roads and bridges, links in the field of energy and our efforts to boost connectivity indicate in the direction of a good future. We have completed the work on the Sittwe port and Paletwa Inland Waterways Terminal in Kaladan project. And the work on road component has started. In order to meet the requirement of Upper Myanmar, two way movement of high speed diesel trucks have started from India. Development of high quality health, education and research facilities in Myanamar under our development partnership is a cause of happiness. In this context, Myanmar Institute of Information Technology and Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education are worthy of special mention. Both of these are emerging as the main centers of education. In the future, our projects will only be according to the needs and priorities of Myanmar. The agreements signed by us today between our two countries will further strengthen our multifaceted bilateral cooperation.

Friends,

I am happy to announce that we have decided to give gratis visa to all citizens of Myanmar who are interested in coming to India. I am also happy to state that we have decided to release 40 citizens of Myanmar who are currently lodged in the jails of India. We hope that they will soon be able to meet with their families in Myanmar.

Excellency,

My time in Nay Pyi Taw was very meaningful. I am also very excited about my remaining stay in Myanmar. Today I will go to the Anand Temple in the Bagan. The renovation work of Ananda Temple and other historic and cultural buildings is being carried out with the help of India to repair the damages caused to them due last year’s earthquake. Apart from meeting the community of Indian origin people in Yangon, I will also pay my tributes at the monuments of religious and historical importance. I believe that in the coming time, we will work together to build a strong and close partnership for our mutual benefit.

Thank you

Cheju Tin Ba De.

                Your Excellency, the State Counsellor 
Distinguished delegates, 
मीडिया के मित्रों, 

मिंगलाबा 

2014 में ASEAN Summit के अवसर पर मेरा यहां आना हुआ था, परन्तु स्वर्णिम भूमि म्यांमार की यह मेरी पहलीद्विपक्षीय यात्रा है। लेकिन जिस गर्मजोशी से हमारा स्वागत हुआ है, मुझे ऐसा लग रहा है जैसे मैं अपने ही घर में हूं। इसके लिए मैं म्यांमार सरकार का आभारी हूं। 

Excellency, 

Myanmar peace process का आपके द्वारा साहसिक नेतृत्व प्रशंसनीय है। जिन चुनौतियों का आप मुकाबला कररही हैं, हम उन्हें पूरी तरह समझते हैं। Rakhine State में चरमपंथी हिंसा के चलते खासकर security forces और मासूम जीवन की हानि को लेकर आपकीचिंताओं के हम भागीदार हैं। चाहे वह बड़ी शांति प्रक्रिया हो या किसी विशेष मुद्दे को सुलझाने की बात, हम आशा करते हैं कि सभी stakeholdersमिलकर ऐसा हल निकालने की दिशा में काम कर सकते हैं जिससे म्यांमार की एकता और भौगोलिक अखंडता का सम्मान करतेहुए सभी के लिए शांति, न्याय और सम्मान सुनिश्चित होंगे। 

Friends, 

मेरा मानना है कि भारत का लोकतांत्रिक अनुभव म्यांमार के लिए भी प्रासंगिक है। और इसलिए, म्यांमार के Executive, Legislature तथा Election Commission और Press Council जैसी संस्थाओं की Capacity Building में हमारे व्यापकसहयोग पर हमें गर्व है। पड़ोसी होने के नाते, सुरक्षा के क्षेत्र में हमारे हित एक जैसे ही हैं। यह ज़रूरी है कि हम अपनी लंबी ज़मीनी और समुद्री सीमा पर सुरक्षा और स्थिरता बनाए रखने के लिए मिलकर काम करें। सड़कों और पुलों का निर्माण, उर्जा के links, और connectivity बढ़ाने के हमारे प्रयास, एक अच्छे भविष्य की ओर संकेतकरते हैं। Kaladan project में हमने Sittwe port तथा Paletwa Inland Waterways Terminal परकाम पूरा किया है। और Road component पर काम शुरू हो गया है। Upper Myanmar की जरूरतों को पूरा करने के लिए भारत से high speed diesel ट्रकों द्वारा आना शुरू हो चुका है। हमारी development partnership के तहत म्यांमार में उच्च कोटि की स्वास्थ्य, शिक्षा तथा अनुसंधान की सुविधाओं काविकास प्रसन्नता का विषय है। इस संबंध में Myanmar Institute of Information Technology और Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education विशेष रूप से उल्लेखनीय हैं। ये दोनों शिक्षा के प्रमुख केंद्रों के रूप में तेजी से उभर रहे हैं। भविष्य में भी हमारे projects म्यांमार की आवश्यकताओं और प्राथमिकताओं के अनुरूप ही होंगे। हमारे दोनों देशों के बीच आज हुए समझौतों से हमारे बहुमुखी द्विपक्षीय सहयोग को और भी बल मिलेगा। 

Friends, 

मुझे यह घोषणा करते हुए खुशी हो रही है कि हमने भारत आने के इच्छुक म्यांमार के सभी नागरिकों को gratis visa देने कानिर्णय लिया है। मुझे यह बताते हुए भी खुशी हो रही है कि हमने म्यांमार के 40 नागरिकों को छोड़ने का निर्णय लिया है जो इस समयभारत की जेलों में हैं। हम आशा करते हैं कि वे जल्द ही म्यांमार में अपने परिवारों से फिर से मिल सकेंगे। 

Excellency, 

Nay Pyi Taw में मेरा समय बहुत सार्थक रहा। म्यांमार में अपने शेष प्रवास को लेकर भी मेरे मन में उत्साहहै। आज मैं बागान में आनंद Temple जाऊंगा। आनंद Temple एवं अन्य ऐतिहासिक व सांस्कृतिक इमारतों में पिछले सालके भूकंप से हुए नुकसान के बाद भारत के सहयोग से renovation हो रहा है। Yangon में भारतीय मूल के समुदाय से मुलाकात के अलावा मैं धार्मिक और ऐतिहासिक महत्व के स्मारकों पर भीअपनी श्रद्धा अर्पित करूंगा। मुझे विश्वास है कि आने वाले समय में हम पारस्परिक लाभ के लिए सशक्त और नज़दीकी साझेदारी बनाने के लिएमिलकर काम करेंगे। 

धन्यवाद! 

चेजू तिन बा दे!

                Your Excellency President Xi Jinping, my esteemed BRICS Colleagues, Distinguished Leaders

I am delighted to be here with you all today. Your countries are close and valued partners of India. And I am pleased to exchange perspectives with you on the shared priority of achieving comprehensive sustainable development. I thank President Xi Jinping for bringing us together for this dialogue. 

Excellencies, 

Two years since the adoption of UN’s 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the imperative of collaborative action to achieve the goals is even stronger. Recently in July, India completed its first voluntary national review of SDGs. The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of ""SabkaSaath,SabkaVikaas” - that is: Collective Effort, Inclusive Growth. We have mapped each of the SDGs to our own development programmes and scheme, both at the federal and state level. Our Parliament too has taken the initiative to organize Parliamentary debates on SDGs. Our programmes are geared to accomplish these priority goals in a time-bound manner. To cite just one example, our three-pronged approach of providing a bank account to the unbanked, providing a biometric identity to all, and using innovative mobile governance solutions, has enabled Direct Benefit Transfers to almost 360 million people for the first time.

Excellencies, 

We would like to see such domestic efforts buttressed by strong international partnerships. And, for this, we stand ready to do our part. India has a long tradition of partnerships with fellow developing countries, while pursuing our own aspirations for growth. At every step, we have shared our experience and resources across a range of sectors: from strengthening democratic institutions to deploying high-tech solutions for public good. Earlier this year, we launched the South Asia Satellite to benefit willing regional partners in meeting their developmental goals in education, healthcare, communication, and disaster management. For over half a century, India’s flagship initiative – Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation, ITEC - has offered training and skill development to 161 partner countries from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Caribbean and Pacific Island states. From Africa alone, over the last decade, over 25,000 students have trained in India on ITEC scholarships. At the Third India-Africa Forum Summit in 2015, with participation of all 54 African countries, we decided to double the number of ITEC scholarships to 50,000 over a period of only 5 years. The ""Solar Mamas” of Africa, trained in India, are lighting up thousands of homes across the African continent. Our growing engagement with Africa has led to the African Development Bank holding its Annual Meeting outside Africa for the first time, in India earlier this year. Our development partnerships projects are providing water, electricity, roads, healthcare, tele-medicine, and basic infrastructure to people in dozens of countries across the world. And, in all of this, our ""no strings attached” model of cooperation is driven purely by the requirements and priorities of our partner countries.

Excellencies, 

The countries present here together represent almost half of the humanity. Whatever we do, will impact the world substantially. So, it is our solemn duty to make a better world – brick by brick, or, through BRICS. Yesterday, I had spoken about the BRICS driving the global transformation in the next ten years for it to be a Golden Decade. I suggest that this can be brought about with our proactive approach, policies, and action, on the following ten Noble Commitments:

1. Creating a Safer World: by organized and coordinated action on at least three issues: Counter Terrorism, Cyber Security and Disaster Management;
2. Creating a Greener World: by taking concerted action on countering Climate Change, through initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance;
3. Creating an Enabled World: by sharing and deploying suitable technologies to enhance efficiency, economy and effectiveness;
4. Creating an Inclusive World: by economic mainstreaming of our people including in the banking and financial system;
5. Creating a Digital World: by bridging the digital divide within and outside our economies;
6. Creating a Skilled World: by giving future-ready skills to millions of our youth;
7. Creating a Healthier World: by cooperating in research and development to eradicate diseases, and enabling affordable healthcare for all;
8. Creating an Equitable World: by providing equality of opportunity to all, particularly through gender equality;
9. Creating a Connected World: by enabling free flow of goods, persons and services; and,
10. Creating a Harmonious World: by promoting ideologies, practices, and heritage that are centered on peaceful coexistence and living in harmony with nature.

Through these agenda points, and action on them, we will be contributing directly to the welfare of the Global Community in addition to welfare of our own people. And in this, India stands ready as a willing and committed partner to enhance cooperation and support each other’s national efforts; I look forward to our progress together on this path. I commend President Xi for ably steering the BRICS Chairmanship for the year 2017, and for his warm welcome and hospitality in this beautiful city of Xiamen. I also welcome President Zuma and commit India’s full support for Johannesburg Summit next year.

I thank you.

                Your Excellencies, 

President of the New Development Bank 

Members of the BRICS Business Council 

I am pleased to participate in this meeting with the BRICS Business Council. The work you do in the Business Council plays a vital role in giving practical shape to the vision of BRICS partnership. The partnerships you have forged and the networks you have created are energizing the economic growth stories in each BRICS country. At this meeting last year in Goa, there was a suggestion on closer cooperation between the NDB and BRICS Business Council. I am happy to note that you are entering into an MOU with the NDB. 

Excellencies and Friends, 

India is changing fast into one of the most open economies in the world today. Foreign Direct Investment inflows are at an all-time high, rising by 40 per cent. India has moved up in the World Bank Index of Ease of Doing Business. Similarly, we have moved up 32 spots in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index. The Goods and Services Tax that was introduced in July is India’s biggest economic reform measure ever. In one stroke, a unified market of 1.3 billion people has been created. Programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India are changing the economic landscape of the country. They are assisting India turn into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society. 

Excellencies and Friends, 

I am happy to note that the BRICS Business Council also has matching priorities of trade & investment facilitation, promoting skills development, infrastructure development, SME Development, e-commerce and digital economy. Many productive recommendations have come out of your deliberations. Your work towards establishment of a BRICS Rating Agency, energy cooperation, green finance, and digital economy is particularly noteworthy. Let me conclude by saying that as Governments, we will offer full support to your endeavours. And we also count on the BRICS Business Council to take us closer to our common objective of improving business and investment cooperation. 

Thank you.

                Your Excellencies

President Xi Jinping,

President Jacob Zuma,

President Michel Temer,

President Vladimir Putin,

Let me begin by sincerely thanking President Xi again for his warm reception and the excellent organisation of this Summit. Our interaction during the restricted session was constructive. It enriched our mutual understanding and perspectives. After more than a decade of existence, BRICS has developed a robust framework for cooperation. We contribute stability and growth in a world drifting towards uncertainty. While trade and economy have been the foundation of our cooperation, our endeavours today touch diverse areas of technology, tradition, culture, agriculture, environment, energy, sports, and ICT. The New Development Bank has started disbursing loans in pursuit of its mandate to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in BRICS countries. At the same time, our Central Banks have taken steps to make the Contingent Reserve Arrangement fully operational. These are milestones of progress we can build upon. Looking ahead, it is important that our people remain at the centre of our journey. I am happy to note that China has taken forward the people-to-people thrust of our exchanges from last year. Such inter-mingling will consolidate our links and deepen our understanding.

Excellencies,

India’s own far-reaching journey of transformation gives pride of place to our people. We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education and innovation. National programmes of Clean Ganga, Renewable Energy, Digital India, Smart Cities, Housing for All and Skill India are laying the basis for clean, green and inclusive development. They are also tapping the creative energy of our 800 million youth. Our women’s empowerment programmes are productivity multipliers that mainstream women in nation building. We have also stepped up the fight against black money and corruption. Moving forward, using the springboard of our national experiences, BRICS countries can deepen partnership for win-win results. Some thoughts come to mind for upgrading mutual cooperation. First, last year we discussed pooling our efforts to create a BRICS rating agency. An Expert Group has since been studying the viability of such an agency. I would urge that the roadmap for its creation should be finalized at the earliest. Second, our Central Banks must further strengthen their capabilities and promote co-operation between the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the IMF. Third, affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to energy is crucial for the development of our nations. Climate resilient development calls upon us to utilise all available resource streams. Renewable energy is particularly important on multiple counts. Recognizing this, India, together with France, launched a major international initiative - the International Solar Alliance (ISA) - in November 2015. It will bring together a coalition of 121 countries for mutual gains through enhanced solar energy utilisation. BRICS countries can work closely with ISA to strengthen the solar energy agenda. Our five countries have complementary skills and strengths to promote use of renewable and solar energy. The NDB can also establish an effective link with ISA to support such cooperation. We would wish to see more clean energy funding, particularly in solar energy, from the NDB. Fourth, we are nations with large youth populations. We need to mainstream our youth in our joint initiatives as far as possible. Scaled up cooperation in skill development and exchange of best practices will be a valuable instrument. Fifth, at the Goa Summit last year we had exchanged thoughts on smart-cities, urbanization, and disaster-management in the context of cooperation between our cities. We need to further accelerate this track. Sixth, Technology and innovation are the foundations of the next generation of global growth and transformation. India has also found that technology and digital resources are powerful tools in fighting poverty and corruption. A strong BRICS partnership on innovation and digital economy can help spur growth, promote transparency and support the Sustainable Development Goals. I would suggest considering a collaborative pilot project under the BRICS framework, including private entrepreneurship. Finally, India would be happy to work towards more focused capacity building engagement between BRICS and African countries in areas of skills, health, infrastructure, manufacturing and connectivity.

Excellencies,

In the last decade, two generations of leader of our countries contributed to the emergence and establishment of BRICS. We acquired credibility, wielded influence and spurred growth. Now, the next decade is crucial. In an environment where we seek stability, sustainable development and prosperity. BRICS leadership will be crucial in driving this transformation. If we as BRICS can set the agenda in these areas, the world will call this its Golden Decade. In our outreach segment with emerging markets tomorrow. I will share some of our ideas in this regard. I am confident that it will help the BRICS in our shared journey to scale new heights of partnership. I thank you.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Friday met and interacted with a group of over 90 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries serving in the Government of India. This was the last of five such interactions.

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as governance, social welfare, tribal development, agriculture, horticulture, environment and forests, education, project implementation, urban development and transportation.

The Prime Minister urged the officers to work towards simplification of governance processes. He said well executed projects and schemes should serve as case studies, so that their success can be emulated.

Highlighting the current positive global environment in favour of India, the Prime Minister asked officers to work with clear objectives towards creating a New India by 2022.

                Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will be attending 9th BRICS Summit in Xiamen, China from 3-5 September 2017. Prime Minister will also be on the state visit of Myanmar from 5-7 September 2017.

In a series of Facebook posts from his account, the Prime Minister said:

""I will visit Xiamen, China for the 9th BRICS Summit from 3-5 September 2017.

India had the privilege of hosting the previous Summit in Goa in October last year. I look forward to building upon the results and outcomes of the Goa Summit. I also look forward to productive discussions and positive outcomes that will support the agenda of a stronger BRICS partnership under the chairmanship of China.

We will also interact with the BRICS Business Council represented by captains of industry from all five countries.

In addition, I look forward to engaging with leaders of nine other countries, including BRICS partners, in an Emerging Markets and Developing Countries Dialogue, hosted by President Xi Jinping on 5 September.

I will have the opportunity to meet leaders bilaterally on the sidelines of the Summit.
India attaches high importance to the role of BRICS that has begun a second decade of its partnership for progress and peace. BRICS has important contributions to make in addressing global challenges and upholding world peace and security.

I will visit Myanmar on 5-7 September 2017 at the invitation of His Excellency U Htin Kyaw, President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. I have visited this beautiful country earlier in 2014 for the ASEAN-India Summit, but this will be my first bilateral visit to Myanmar.

I am looking forward to meeting President U Htin Kyaw as also Her Excellency Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, State Counsellor, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of President's Office. I have had the opportunity for discussions with both dignitaries during their visits to India in 2016.

During the visit, we will review developments in our bilateral relations, especially the extensive programme of development cooperation and socio-economic assistance that India is undertaking in Myanmar, and explore new areas in which we can work together.
We will also look at strengthening our existing cooperation on security and counter-terrorism, trade and investment, skill development, infrastructure and energy, and culture.

I also look forward to paying a visit to the famed heritage city of Bagan, where the Archaeological Survey of India has done stellar work on renovating the Ananda Temple, and where it will be undertaking further restoration work on a number of pagodas and murals that were damaged in last year's earthquake.

I will end my visit in Yangon, where I look forward to visiting various historical spots that symbolise the shared heritage of India and Myanmar.

I am also keen to meet and interact with the Indian-origin community of Myanmar, whose history goes back more than a century.

I am confident that the visit will open a bright new chapter in India-Myanmar relations and will help in charting a roadmap for closer cooperation between our Governments, our business communities and at the people to people level.""

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Rajasva Gyan Sangam at New Delhi, and addressed the tax administrators of both the Union and State Governments.  

The Prime Minister exhorted the officers to improve their work-culture, to incorporate both a ""sense of urgency"", and ""measurability"", in their performance.  

Mentioning the benefits of the GST, the Prime Minister said that besides economic integration of the country, and transparency in the system; more than 17 lakh new traders have been brought into the indirect tax system within two months.  

The Prime Minister said that in order to enable all traders to take maximum benefit of GST, we should work towards ensuring that all traders, including even relatively smaller traders with a turnover below Rs. 20 lakhs, should register with the GST system. He asked the officers to make efforts in this regard by designing a system for this category. 

The Prime Minister asked the officers to fix clear targets to improve the country's tax administration by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. He said that the Union Government is working towards creation of an environment which shatters the confidence of the corrupt, and instills confidence and trust among the honest taxpayer. In this regard, he mentioned steps taken by the Union Government, such as demonetization, and implementation of stringent laws against black money and benami property. 

The Prime Minister said human interface must be kept to a minimum in the tax administration's dealings. He asked for a push to be given to ""e-assessment"" and anonymity of proceedings using technology, so that vested interests do not impede the due course of law.  

Shri Narendra Modi expressed his dismay at the huge pendency of tax-related cases in adjudication and appeal. He said big sums of money that is locked up in these cases, could have been used for the welfare of the poor. He asked officers to come up with an action plan during the Rajasva Gyan Sangam, to eliminate pendency.  

The Prime Minister asked officers to use data analytical tools to proactively track and determine undeclared income and wealth. He said that though efforts to increase tax revenue are made by officers each year, the estimated amounts of tax that should accrue to the system, are often not realised. The Prime Minister asked officers to come up with a time-bound solution to ‘tax raised and not realised’, and asserted that the honest cannot continue to pay the price for the misdeeds of the dishonest. In this regard he also suggested complete reworking of human resource management in the tax departments to strengthen the data analytics and investigation wing.  

The Prime Minister hoped that the two-day Gyan Sangam would come up with concrete ideas to improve the tax administration.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the signing of the (i) Interbank Local Currency Credit Line Agreement and (ii) Cooperation Memorandum Relating to Credit Ratings by Exim Bank with participating member banks under BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism. As both the Agreement and the MoU are umbrella pacts, and are non-binding in nature, the Board of Directors of Exim Bank has been authorized to negotiate and conclude any individual contracts and commitments within their framework.

Impact

The Agreements will promote multilateral interaction within the area of mutual interest which will deepen political and economic relations with BRICS nations.

Signing of the Agreement will position Exim Bank in the international platform along with large development finance institutions, like CDS, VEB and BNDES. At an appropriate time, Exim Bank, leveraging this umbrella agreement, could enter into bilateral agreement with any of these member institutions to raise resources for its business. As and when an opportunity arises for co-financing in commercial terms, by any two member institutions (say India and South Africa), lending in single currency by both the institutions would also be possible.

Background

Exim Bank finances, facilitates and promotes India's international trade. It provides competitive finance at various stages of the business cycle covering import of technology, export product development, export production and export credit at pre-shipment and post-shipment stages and investments overseas.

Interbank Local Currency Credit Line Agreement

The initial Master Agreement on Extending Credit Facility in Local Currency under the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism had a validity of five years, which has expired in March 2017. It is understood that some of the member banks (like CDB and VEB; CDB and BNDES) have entered into bilateral agreements for local currency financing under the Master Agreement signed in 2012. Although the current conditions are not conducive to usage, it was useful to keep the same alive as an enabling feature in case a suitable opportunity materializes in future. Exim Bank raises resources in the off-shore market in diverse currencies and swaps to mitigate the risk. The umbrella Agreement would serve as an enabler to enter into bilateral agreements with member banks subject to national laws, regulations and internal policies of the signatories.

Cooperation Memorandum Relating to Credit Ratings

It would enable sharing of credit ratings amongst the BRICS member banks, based on the request received from another bank. This would be an ideal mechanism to mitigate the credit risks associated with cross-border financing. In future, such a mechanism could also serve as pre-cursor to the proposal of having an alternate rating agency by BRICS nations.

The Agreement and the MoU have also been highlighted in the BRICS Leaders Xiamen Declaration made in Xiamen, China on 4th September 2017.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to pay Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days wages to eligible non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the financial year 2016-17. About 12.30 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision. This payment will be made before Dussehra/Puja holidays, bringing a smile to lakhs of families ahead of the festive season.

The payment of PLB would serve as an incentive, and result in motivating a large number of Railway employees, particularly those involved in execution and operations of railways, to improve their productivity and ensure safety, speed and service for Railway customers. Indian Railways operates on the principle of maximum public welfare, and in this context, this bonus payment will help in improving accountability and efficiency in railways operations.

The financial implication of payment of 78 days' PLB to railway employees has been estimated to be Rs. 2,245.45 crores. The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB is Rs. 7,000/- p.m. The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is Rs. 17,951 for 78 days.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the revamped Khelo India programme at a cost of Rs.1,756 crore for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20. This marks a watershed moment in the history of Indian sports, as the Programme aims at mainstreaming sport as a tool for individual development, community development, economic development and national development.

The revamped Khelo India Programme would impact the entire sports ecosystem, including infrastructure, community sports, talent identification, coaching for excellence, competition structure and sports economy.

• The Programme aims to promote 20 universities across the country as hubs of sporting excellence, which would enable talented sports persons to pursue the dual pathway of education and competitive sports. 
• The Programme also aims at creating an active population with healthy life-style. 
• The Programme would cover about 200 million children in the age group of 10-18 under a massive national physical fitness drive, which will not only measure the physical fitness of all children in the age group, but also support their fitness related activities.

Impact:

• The power of sport in promoting gender equity and social inclusiveness is also fully recognized and special measures are provided for to achieve these objectives. 
• The programme also aims at engaging youth living in disturbed and deprived areas, in sporting activities, to wean them away from unproductive and disruptive activities and mainstream them in the nation-building process. 
• The programme strives to raise the standards of competition, both at school and college level, to have maximum access to organized sports competitions.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Central Silk Board (CSB), India and National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS), Japan for collaborative research in the field of silkworm and silk industries.

The MoU was signed on 11.11.2016 between CSB and NIAS for initiating a Collaborative Research for developing prolific bivoltine hybrids of silkworm suitable for the Indian tropical conditions. The MoU is of scientific and technological nature. It would help in developing prolific hybrid silkworms, which would improve the manufacturing capacity and the quality standards of the Indian sericulture industry and thereby enhance exports of silk and silk products.

It is expected that subsequent to the MoU, the Indian Textiles & Apparel Industry would be able to produce world class silk and silk products. The improvement of quality and productivity would ultimately increase export of silk products.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for release of additional 1% Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to pensioners.  It will be applicable from 01.07.2017.

The release of the additional instalment of DA represents an increase of 1% over the existing rate of 4% of the Basic Pay/Pension, to compensate for price rise. This increase is in accordance with the accepted formula, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission.

The combined impact on the exchequer on account of both DA and DR would be Rs.3068.26 crore per annum and Rs.2045.50 crore in the financial year 2017-18 (for a period of 8 months from July, 2017 to February, 2018). This will benefit about 49.26 lakh Central Government employees and 61.17 lakh pensioners.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for hiving off mobile tower assets of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) into a separate company, fully owned by BSNL.

This approval authorizes BSNL to monetize its telecom tower infrastructure with the formation of a separate subsidiary company.

There are around 4,42,000 mobile towers in the country out of which more than 66,000 mobile tower are of BSNL.  An independent, dedicated tower company of BSNL with a focused approach will lead to increasing of external tenancies and consequentially higher revenue for the new company.

Background:

The telecom tower industry has emerged as an independent business to harness the potential for sharing of infrastructure. The business model arose from the need to achieve economies of scale and to reduce capital investment costs for providing mobile services. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) policy allows sharing of passive infrastructure i.e. the tower structure, Diesel Generator sets, battery units, power interface unit, air-conditioning etc., which has facilitated the growth of the telecom infrastructure industry. A tower infrastructure company essentially owns the passive infrastructure asset and leases it to telecom service providers enabling them to minimize duplication of investments and economize on costs of Operation and Maintenance (O&M), thereby improving profitability.

Besides the captive model in BSNL and MTNL where the service provider owns their passive infrastructure also, there are three different business models within the telecom tower industry:- companies created by hiving off the tower assets portfolios of service providers into subsidiaries, companies established as independent joint venture entities by service providers jointly and companies promoted by specific service providers but established as independent entities with the promoter being the anchor tenant for the tower company.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the Parliament.

The Amendment will increase the maximum limit of gratuity of employees, in the private sector and in Public Sector Undertakings/ Autonomous Organizations under Government who are not covered under CCS (Pension) Rules, at par with Central Government employees.

Background:

The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 applies to establishments employing 10 or more persons. The main purpose for enacting this Act is to provide social security to workmen after retirement, whether retirement is a result of the rules of superannuation, or physical disablement or impairment of vital part of the body. Therefore, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 is an important social security legislation to wage earning population in industries, factories and establishments.

The present upper ceiling on gratuity amount under the Act is Rs. 10 Lakh. The provisions for Central Government employees under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 with regard to gratuity are also similar. Before implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 was Rs. 10 Lakh. However, with implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, in case of Government servants, the ceiling now is Rs. 20 Lakhs effective from 1.1.2016.

Therefore, considering the inflation and wage increase even in case of employees engaged in private sector, the Government is of the view that the entitlement of gratuity should be revised for employees who are covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Accordingly, the Government initiated the process for amendment to Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for revision of cost norms with annual cost indexation for Supplementary Nutrition (SN) for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and Adolescent Girls (out of school 11-14 years) under the Umbrella ICDS Scheme. This addresses a long standing anomaly and ensures that the changes in norms keeps pace with changes in costs on an annual basis.

This follows the decision by the Government to provide cash benefits to pregnant and lactating mothers under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, and is part of an intensive effort to improve the nutritional status of women and children.

The revised Supplementary Nutrition cost norms for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and for Adolescent Girls (11-14 years out of school) under the Umbrella ICDS Scheme, as approved by the Government are as under:

 


	
		
			
			S.No.
			
			
			Category
			
			
			Existing Rate Rs./day/beneficiary
			
			
			Revised Rates

			Rs./day/beneficiary
			
		
		
			
			1
			
			
			Children (6-72 months)
			
			
			Rs.6.00
			
			
			Rs.8.00
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM)
			
			
			Rs.7.00

			 
			
			
			Rs.9.50
			
		
		
			
			3
			
			
			Severely Malnourished
			
			
			Rs.9.00

			 
			
			
			Rs.12.00
			
		
		
			
			4
			
			
			Adolescent Girls (11-14 years out of school)
			
			
			Rs.5.00
			
			
			Rs.9.50
			
		
	


 

The revision of cost norms for SN for beneficiaries of Aanganwadi Services would cost additional expenditure of Rs.9,900 crore and for beneficiaries of Adolescent Girls, it would cost Rs.2,267.18 crore as GoI share for a period from 2017-18 to 2019-20.

The revision in the cost norms of SN for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and Adolescent Girls would impact the health and nutritional status of about 11 crore beneficiaries per annum.

                An exhibition highlighting the achievements of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was inaugurated by the Union Minister of State of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (Independent Charge), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, in Surat, Gujarat yesterday. 

The exhibition was held under the aegis of Municipal School Board with participation by a large number of school children. The Lok Sabha MP Shri C.R. Patil, MLA Smt Sangitaben R. Patil and senior scientists from ISRO were also present on the occasion. 

Speaking after inaugurating the exhibition, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the founding father of India’s Space Programme, Dr Vikram Sarabhai was a son of Gujarat and therefore, this is the right place and location to celebrate the vindication and realization of Sarabhai’s dreams. He told the children that when his generation was in the same age group as they are, their only relationship with Space and the Moon was through poetry and songs on the theme of “Chanda Mama”. But today, India has taken over other nations in the field of space. 

While India under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is on the threshold of becoming a world power in the coming years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the field of Space Technology, India has already emerged as a front-line nation after having overtaken countries like US and Russia which had started their Space programmes several decades before us. He said, when Dr Sarabhai and his colleagues began India’s Space Programme over half-a-century ago, there were no resources and not even a laboratory. But today, because of their efforts, we have reached a stage where the pictures and the visuals sent by our Mangalyan Mission are being procured even by the world’s most advanced centres like America’s NASA, he said. 

The story of Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Dr Jitendra Singh said, holds a moral for all the youngsters that they should never hesitate to dream big, but more important, at the same time, is to build up within ourselves the capacity and ability to realize our dreams and this can happen only through consistent effort and hard work. 

The function was followed by an interactive session of the children with MoS Dr Jitendra Singh.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has lauded the valuable contribution made by Space Application Center (SAC) Ahmedabad in providing original inputs for enriching the India’s Space Programme and also performing the role of value addition to several of the prestigious Space missions launched from ISRO, Sriharikota. 

Currently on a two-day visit to Gujarat, Dr Jitendra Singh held a detailed review meeting with the scientists of Space Application Centre led by its Director, Dr Tapan Misra. 

Dr Jitendra Singh made a special note of appreciation for some of the advanced technology developed at SAC, Ahmedabad with regard to origami lens, indigenously developed MMIC, Airborne low mass x-band Mini-SAR for strategic applications and disaster management, optical trans-receiver satellite mobile radio etc. 

Referring to Ahmedabad Space Centre and other Space science programmes going on in the State of Gujarat, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the State was already ahead in terms of making maximum utilization of Space communication for education purposes. However, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he said, the same applications have been effectively extended even to the peripheral areas of Northeast and hill States. In this regard, he mentioned recent MoU signed by the Department of Space, Government of India with the Department of Education, Government of Jammu & Kashmir. 

Dr Jitendra Singh observed that India has already emerged as a world leader in the field of Space Technology. This has not only vindicated the noble initiative of the founding fathers like Dr Vikram Sarabhai and Dr Satish Dhawan, but has also set an example before other countries about how the Space Technology can be used effectively even for non Space Satellite Mission Programmes. 

During the three years of the Union Government, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Department of Space has entered into MoUs with a number of other Ministries. This has enabled the application of Space Technology in an effective manner for several important programmes of Government of India, including Smart City programmes, Geo-MNREGA, Tele-Education and Tele-Medicine. 

Director SAC Ahmedabad Dr Tapan Misra along with his team of senior scientists/officials including Dr Piyush Verma, Dr D.K. Das, Shri Rajiv Jyoti, Shri Sarkar S., Shri Raj Kumar and others were present at the review meeting.

Dovchuk, President, Cameco called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here yesterday and discussed with him various aspects of uranium and nuclear/atomic energy collaboration with India. They acknowledged and complimented the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India for having distinguished itself as an internationally known Uranium and nuclear/atomic energy establishment.

Dr Jitendra Singh referred to traditional friendly relations between India and Canada which, he said, made it far more comfortable and easy for the two nations to collaborate at different levels and in different areas. He expressed the hope that in future, the overall collaboration between the two nations is bound to gain more momentum and this will also be visible in the field of nuclear/atomic energy.

Reiterating India’s commitment for use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the extension of the atomic energy applications to diverse areas in recent years. He said, not only is the nuclear energy emerging as one of the most important and clean sources to meet the rising energy needs of India, but is now also being utilized for other socially relevant purposes like, for example irradiation of agricultural and food products, etc.

                The Government has taken initiatives to spread information related to modern technology among the farmers in the shortest possible time Shri Singh

Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed National Workshop on Agricultural Knowledge Management

 

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for the first time, a national level workshop has been organized to prepare a roadmap for agricultural knowledge management on September 27-28, 2017. Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed the workshop. More than 300 eminent agricultural scientists and information technology experts from all over the country participated in the workshop.

Shri Singh said that 58 percent population of the country still relies on agriculture for livelihood. Irrespective of industrial and services sectors progress, the agriculture sector is still the top employer. He said there is a steady increase in the number of small and marginal farmers in the agrarian sector. Due to traditional farming and low productivity, they are unable to achieve higher yield despite hard work. In the absence of information related to modern and scientific agricultural systems, this situation persists throughout the country.

Union Minister informed that a vast network of agricultural research and education thrives in the country under the leadership of ICAR. More than 102 Agricultural Research Institute, 73 Central and State Agricultural Universities and more than 690 Krishi Vigyan Kendras are working under it and researching for the development of agricultural techniques, high-yielding crops and development of livestock and other activities. The network is constantly generating useful information. However, due to ineffective mechanisms to spread information most of the benefits of farmer-oriented research take a long time to reach the agrarian community.

Shri Singh said that the government has taken several initiatives in recent times to bring such useful information through the help of modern information technology to the farming community in the shortest possible time. It includes Farmers Portal, Kisan Call Center, Fasal Bima Portal, Rice Export App, Pusa Krishi App, Agro Collect- Krishi Gyan App, e-NAM Portal, etc.

The two-day workshop organised by the Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture, ICAR, at Pusa, New Delhi, has been divided into four sessions where Scientists and IT experts exchanged views on topics like current Status of Agricultural Knowledge Management, Data Management and Information Storage for Higher Agricultural Profits, and the Role of Media in Knowledge Management.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that agriculture plays an important role in the lives of our people and economy of the country where more than 50 per cent of people are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. For the development of the nation, development of agriculture and the farmers are important. The Ministry, through its various programs, works not only for the development of agriculture but also for the welfare of farmers. Shri Singh said it today while addressing the representatives at the Start-up Companies’ CEO meet in Krishi Bhawan.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said the objective of the agriculture development is to double the Farmers’ Income by 2022. With limited resources and fixed area of land availability, it cannot be achieved without the support of technology, which should be low cost, farmer friendly and scalable.

 Shri Singh said the Ministry is running various flagship programs such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Soil Health Card (SHC), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana PMKSY), Paramparaagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY),  Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), etc. The schemes are providing support to farmers. SHC, for instance, will help in improving the soil health and reducing the cost of fertilizers.  However, for this, a large number of soil samples have to be analyzed, which is arduous and time consuming.  Therefore, we need a technological solution in the form of low-cost hand-held soil sensors or any non-destructible method of soil fertility assessment that can easily assess soil health using the technology.

 Another program is PMFBY for accurate and timely assessment of crop loss so that farmers can reap benefits through fast and accurate claim settlement.  To achieve this, PMFBY promotes following technologies:

i)                    Smartphone-based android apps for Crop Cutting Experiments data collection

ii)                  Satellites and drones for crop loss assessment, mid-season adversity, area discrepancy and post-harvest losses

iii)                IT-based solutions to increase the number of insured farmers. 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said for this, technological development is compulsory.  Shri Singh said technologies desirable for different farmer friendly programs include Sensor Technology, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, App Development, Development of GIS-based portals, low-cost field instruments for various agricultural assessments, etc.

Union Agriculture Minister said the Ministry would promote these technologies and their development, which can be used for farmers’ welfare. Shri Singh directed his offices to work with a smaller core-teams to continue to work with the start-ups.

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that the National Dairy Project (NDP) aims to increase the productivity of milch animals which will lead to increase in milk production for meeting growing demand for milk. Shri Singh said this today in the TK Patel Auditorium, NDDB Anand, Gujarat. In this program, Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijaybhai Rupani and Union Minister for State, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Purushottam Rupala were also present.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the productivity of milch animals is increasing through artificial insemination using high-quality semen taken from high genetic bulls and by proving balanced food to the animals of the farmers. To promote balanced diet for the effective use of input, NDP initiatives are helping farmers to increase production by lowering dietary (Ration) costs.

Shri Singh said that the country has been the world's largest producer of milk for the last two decades and its credit goes to the farmers of the country. Since more than two-thirds of our nation's citizens live in rural areas, therefore, there is a need to make the farmers more prosperous, for which dairy sector is important.

Union Agriculture Minister said that NDDB has implemented several major dairy development programs including 'Operation Flood' from its inception in the country. India is at number one in milk production and contributes 19 percent of the world's total milk production. Dairy farmers' income has increased by 13.79 percent in the year 2014-17 compared to the year-ago period. Milk production, which was 155.49 million tonnes during 2015-16, is planned to increase it to 200 million tonnes in 2019-20. Presently, NDDB is in the leading role for the implementation of the National Dairy Plan (NDP) and the recently announced Dairy Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF). The Central Government has established dairy infrastructure development fund (DIDF) at the cost of Rs.10,881 crore for the period from 2017-18 to 2028-29.

The purpose of the DIDF is to establish an effective mechanism for creating a basic structure for milk cooling at village level and installing electronic equipment for milk adulteration, manufacturing/modernization/processing facilities and for procuring milk. Educational institutes would set up for value-added products for milk unions/milk producers companies.

The purpose of NDP-1 is to help in increasing the productivity of milch animals and thereby increase the milk production to meet the growing demand of milk and to provide more assistance to rural milk producers for more market access, including organized milk processing sector. During the year 2015-16, NDP-1 has been expanded into four states (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, and Uttarakhand) and its implementation period has been extended to 2018-19.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that under the able leadership of the Prime Minister, on the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement, under the 'Sankalp se Siddhi Mission', the Central Government has set a target to double the income of farmers by 2022.  For this, recently, a seven-point strategy has been unveiled. Ministry of Agriculture is working in this direction through various schemes in the dairy sector.

Shri Singh said that his experience indicates that producer-centric institutions are very important for dairy development. Union Agriculture Minister said that the selection of Dairy Excellence Awards has been done fairly and the producer-centric institution which has achieved excellence in operation, administration, and inclusion have been honoured with Dairy Excellence Award where the winners will be encouraged to maintain their performance, it is expected that by learning from these role models, others will be motivated to achieve excellence. Shri Radha Mohan Singh gave his best wishes to the award winners.

                The 1st Advance Estimates of production of major Kharif crops for 2017-18 have been released today by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare. The assessment of production of different crops is based on the feedback received from States and validated with information available from other sources. The estimated production of various crops as per the 1st Advance Estimates for 2017-18 vis-à-vis the comparative estimates for the years 2003-04 onwards is enclosed.

 

            As per 1st Advance Estimates, the estimated production of major crops during Kharif 2017-18 is as under:

 

Ø  Foodgrains  –  134.67 million tonnes.

·   Rice  –  94.48  million tonnes.

·   Coarse Cereals  –  31.49 million tonnes.

·     Maize  –  18.73 million tonnes.

·   Pulses  –  8.71 million tonnes.

·   Tur  –  3.99 million tonnes.

·   Urad  –  2.53 million tonnes (record).

Ø   Oilseeds  –  20.68 million tonnes.

·   Soyabean  –  12.22 million tonnes

·   Groundnut  –  6.21 million tonnes

·   Castorseed – 1.40 million tonnes

Ø   Cotton  –  32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each)

Ø   Jute  & Mesta -10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each)

Ø   Sugarcane – 337.69 million tonnes

 

            The cumulative rainfall in the country during the monsoon season i.e. 01st June to 06th September, 2017 has been 05% lower than Long Period Average (LPA). Thus, monsoon rainfall conditions have been normal in the country. The estimated production of most of the crops during current Kharif season is estimated to be higher as compared to their normal production of last five years. However, these are preliminary estimates and would undergo revision based on further feedback from the States.

             As per the First Advance Estimates, total production of Kharif Foodgrains during 2017-18 is estimated at 134.67 million tonnes. This is lower by 3.86 million tonnes as compared to last year’s Kharif foodgrains record production of 138.52 million tonnes (4th Advance Estimates). However, kharif foodgrain production is 6.43 million tonnes more than the average production of five years (2011-12 to 2015-16) of 128.24 million tonnes.

             Total production of Kharif rice is estimated at 94.48 million tonnes. This is lower by 1.91 million tonnes than the last year’s record production of 96.39 million tonnes. However, it is higher by 2.59 million tonnes over the average production of Kharif rice during the last five years.

             The total production of coarse cereals in the country has decreased to 31.49 million tonnes as compared to 32.71 million tonnes during 2016-17 (4th Advance Estimates). Production of Maize is expected to be 18.73 million tonnes which is marginally lower by 0.52 million tonnes than that of last year’s record production. Further, this is higher by 2.15 million tonnes than the average production of maize during the last five years.

             The total production of Kharif pulses is estimated at 8.71 million tonnes which is lower by 0.72 million tonnes than the last year’s record production of 9.42 million tonnes. However, kharif pulses estimated production is 2.86 million tonnes more than the last five years average production.

             The total production of kharif oilseeds in the country is estimated at 20.68 million tonnes as compared to 22.40 million tonnes during 2016-17, i.e., a decrease of 1.72 million tonnes. However, it is higher by 0.69 million tonnes than the average production of last five years.

             Production of Sugarcane is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes which is higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year’s production of 306.72 million tonnes. Despite higher area coverage, lower productivity of Cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales during 2016-17. Production of Jute & Mesta estimated at 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) is marginally lower than its production of 10.60 million bales during the last year.

Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the various development and welfare schemes launched by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in the last three years helped farmers reap a record production of food grains during 2016-17. The production of pulses increased to 22.40 million tonnes in 2016-17 from 16.35 million tonnes in the previous years. Similarly, the production of food grains increased from 265 million tonnes to 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17; and horticulture production increased from 244 million tonnes to 295 million tonnes. Shri Singh said it today at the inaugural function of four-day Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Centenary Krishi Unnati Mela organized by National Horticulture Board of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Ministry in Mathura.

 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh further said that the government is committed to the development and welfare of the farmers and is rubbing shoulders with them under the guidance of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. The government is trying to make farmers economically stabile and increase their income by 2022 through various schemes like Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Soil Health Card Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, National Agriculture Development Programme, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana launched in the last three years.

 

Shri Singh said farmers from 18 states and the entrepreneurs from various fields like horticulture, agriculture, livestock, dairy, fisheries etc. will be demonstrating and selling their products at the fair. What makes the fair more significant is the fact that it is being organized to mark the Birth Centenary Celebrations of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji who desired for farmers’ prosperity and welfare. Keeping his ideology under consideration, the Ministry is striving for the welfare and growth of the farmers.

 

Agriculture Minister said the Government is making constant efforts for development and welfare of horticulture, agriculture, and farmers. That is why the Central and the Uttar Pradesh Governments are organizing various programmes for the farmers. The farmers and the entrepreneurs will demonstrate and sell their best horticultural and agricultural products at the 70 stalls at the fair. And farmers are also learning about recent technologies used in the fields of horticulture and agriculture etc and getting expert advice from scholars from different agricultural fields.

 

Shri Singh said horticulture helps farmers in earning a profit and creating self-employment opportunities. The country has witnessed higher horticultural production than food grains which is contributing to nutrition security of the country. Apart from this, horticultural plays a significant role in the changing climate scenario.

 

Shri Singh suggested that the horticulture sector should adopt improved techniques used by developed nations. The farmers should use sophisticated techniques and machinery used by the developed nations to grow horticultural crops of international standards. The Government organizes demonstrations of sophisticated machines and technologies to encourage farmers to use the equipment and giving subsidy for the same.

 

On the occasion, the Union Agriculture Minister inaugurated an eco-friendly sewerage treatment plant of 75,000 liters capacity, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute using indigenous technology. Wastewater (sewage water) will be recycled at the plant and will be reused for irrigation. This treatment will reduce 75 to 85 percent heavy metal pollution from the wastewater and such treated water is used for irrigation. The use of treated water for wheat and paddy cultivation helps in reducing the health risks by 44 to 58 percent.

                Recently, some news reports have been published regarding drought warning for 225 districts in 17 States, are factually incorrect. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has been monitoring regularly the agricultural situation in the States. During the current monsoon season, the monsoon rains have been normal i.e. 738.8 mm against the normal of 782.2 mm as on 10.09.2017. The overall rainfall in the country is in the category of normal (-6%). The monsoon season in the country is from 1st June to 30th September. Many States particularly, NE States are receiving heavy monsoon rains.

The kharif crops coverage in almost all the States have been satisfactory and the rains during the period from 1-10 September, 2017 in Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Odisha and Jharkhand have improved moisture in the soil. This wide distribution of rainfall has brightened the prospects of kharif production in current season. During 2017-18, the area sown under all kharif crops is 1041.17 lakh hectares against the normal of corresponding period of 1014.00 lakh hectares as on 08.09.2017. However, some areas experienced deficit rains after sowing of kharif crops. The States have already started assessment of impact of less rain in such areas. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has already given advisories to the States for life saving irrigation, in case of moisture stress. Though, there is deficit rainfall reported in 95 districts but sowing is normal and satisfactory. The current rainfall in first fortnight of September in many States will improve the situation. The yield is expected to be same as of last year. There is no drought like situation.

To improve the economic condition of the farmers, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has set a target.  The goal is to double the income of farmers by 2022. For the first time, a Prime Minister has put such a target in front of the nation for the welfare of farmers. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Agriculture Ministry is working to achieve the target by 2022. The Ministry is working sincerely and honestly to fulfill our Prime Minister’s dream. To double the farmer income, a large number of officials and farmers have been taking a pledge at events organized by the KVK since August 16, 2017.

Seven-point Strategy

1.      Increase in production

It is important to improve irrigation efficiency to increase production. Therefore, our government has increased the irrigation budget. ‘Per Drop More Crop’ is our motto.  Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana has been launched to mitigate the drought effect and to ensure ‘water to every farm’. Hence, pending medium and large projects have also been expedited. Watershed development and water harvesting & management projects have been put on the fast track.

2.      Effective use of input cost

 

For the first time, our government has introduced Soil Health Card Scheme to inform farmers about nutrients status of the soils. This is reducing the cultivation cost as farmers are following the recommendations and going for balanced use of fertilisers. In addition, the Government has curbed illegal use of urea and ensured adequate supply through Neem Coated Urea scheme. The government is also encouraging organic farming. The adoption of new technologies in agriculture such as space technology is helping in better planning through forecasting of crop production, agricultural land-use mapping, drought prediction, and utilisation of fallow paddy fields for Rabi crops. Apart from this, farmers are getting timely information and advisory services through online and telecom mediums such as Kisan Call Centre and Kisan Suvidha App.

3.      Reduction of post-harvest losses

One of the biggest problems of the farmers is storage after harvesting as a result they are forced to sell their products at a lower cost. Therefore, the government is encouraging farmers to use warehouses and avoid distressed sales. Loans against negotiable warehouse receipts are being provided with interest subvention benefits. To protect farmers from losses, the government is focusing on storage facilities and integrated cold chains in rural areas. 

4.      Value Addition

The government is also promoting quality through food processing. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana has been started and Rs.6, 000 crore has been allocated for this project. Under this scheme, food-processing capabilities will be developed by working on the forward and backward linkage of agro processing cluster, which will benefit 20 lakh farmers and create employment opportunities for about 5, 00,000.

5.      Reforms in Agriculture Marketing

The Central Government is emphasizing on the need of reforms in agriculture marketing. e-NAM was launched with three reforms and so far, 455 mandis have been linked to this platform. Online trading has begun on various mandis. In addition, the government has circulated model Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, which includes private market yards and direct marketing. In addition, the Government is also working on a Model Act to promote contract farming.

6. Risk, Security and Assistance

The Government has initiated Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to reduce the possible risks. The scheme creates a security shield. The lowest rate has been fixed for Kharif and Rabi crops. Maximum rate is 2% and 1.5% respectively.  The scheme covers standing crops as well as pre-sowing to post-harvesting losses. Not only that, 25% of the claim is settled immediately online. New technologies like Smartphones, satellite imagery and drones facilities are being utilised to carry out faster assessments of crop loss under PMFBY. From this Kharif season, the farmers can also avail customer service centre and online banking facilities to deposit their premium. The Government has revised the norms for assistance from SDRF and NDRF. Now, the government is providing compensation if at least 33% of the crop is damaged. Compensation amount has been increased to 1.5 times. 

7.      Allied Activities

 

I. Horticulture: The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) scheme is playing an important role in doubling the income of farmers. For this, we are providing better planting materials, improved seed and protected cultivation, high-density plantation, rejuvenation, and precision farming.

 

II. Integrated Farming: Our government is also using Integrated Farming System (IFS). In addition to agriculture, the focus is also on horticulture, livestock, and bee keeping. This scheme will not only increase farmers’ income, it will also mitigate the effect of drought, flood, and other natural disasters.

 

III. White Revolution: Indigenous breeds of cows are being conserved under Rashtriya Gokul Mission. The genetic makeup is improving and increasing the production of milk. The government is set to establish Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund. In addition, Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme is generating self-employment opportunities. White Revolution has been expedited to increase the income of the farmers.

 

IV. Blue Revolution: Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries is a new initiative and it includes activities such as inland fisheries, Aquaculture, Mariculture undertaken by National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB). Apart from this Deep Sea Fishing scheme has also been initiated.

 

V. Sub-Mission on Agroforestry: For the first time Sub-Mission on Agroforestry has been initiated with an aim to promote inter-cropping. Under this scheme, “Med Per Ped” campaign has also been included.

 

VI. Beekeeping: A large number of farmers/beekeepers are being trained for bee keeping. The bee keepers and honey societies/companies/firms are being registered. Integrated Bee Keeping Development Centres (IBDC) are being established in the states.

 

VII. Rural Backyard Poultry Development: Under this scheme, supplementary income and nutritional support are provided to poultry farmers. Awareness program sensitizing sheep, goat, pig and duck farmers about opportunities to enhance income through Rural Backyard Poultry Development mission is being carried out.

                Extension Division of Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&FW), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DAHD&F) have been organizing two pre seasonal interfaces every year, one each for Kharif & Rabi season, to work out joint strategy and technical coordination for research and development in the field of agriculture and allied sectors. This forum provides a platform for finalizing the recommendations for the forthcoming crop season and discussing the emerging issues in agriculture and allied sectors. These recommendations are shared with the states during the National Conference on Agriculture for Kharif & Rabi Campaigns. Along with the states, ICAR Institutes, Krishi Vigyan Kendras and other concerned Institutes are directed to implement these recommendations at field level. 

In this respect a Pre-Rabi seasonal interface was organized in Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi on 5-9-2017 and jointly chaired by the Secretary, DAC&FW and Director General, ICAR. On this occasion discussions on the subjects of Crops, Seeds, Horticulture, Plan Protection, Integrated Nutrient Management etc. were organized so that the obstacles coming in the way of agricultural production can be removed. 

The discussion mainly focused at making available new, improved & certified seeds to the farmers in the states. The issue of bio-pesticides made of cow dung & cow urine also prominently appeared during the discussion. 

It was decided to develop a hand held device so that the benefits of soil health card can flow to maximum number of farmers. It was also decided to review the progress of the same by contacting start-up companies manufacturing these equipments. 

Both chairpersons agreed unanimously to expedite publicity & extension in areas of Bee keeping, Agro forestry, use of quality seeds and adoption of new technology for doubling the income of the farmers. 

It was also decided that the issues raised by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer Welfare would be addressed by ICAR in a time bound manner so that the benefits flow to the farmers. 

The recommendations emerging out of this Pre-Rabi Interface would be shared with states in the forthcoming National Conference on Agriculture for Rabi Campaign being organized on 19-20 September, 2017, at New Delhi.

Smt. Krishna Raj, after assuming the charge of the Office of Minister of State, Agriculture & Farmers Welfare reviewed the Schemes being implemented by Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries today wherein Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries and other Senior Officers were present. A detailed presentation was made regarding the schemes for development of increasing cattle productivity through Rashtriya Gokul Mission, Dairy Development for more income to Dairy farmers, Fisheries and small Livestock like Goat/Sheep and also the poultry sector. Achievements made during the last three years and the challenges as well as Action Plan for doubling farmer’s income by 2022 threw the livestock sector were discussed in detail. 

While appreciating the ongoing efforts of the Department for development of Animal Husbandry Sector and its role in doubling farmer’s income, Hon’ble Minister of State emphasized the importance of monitoring and evaluation of the schemes and mentioned that schemes officers should be made aware about their responsibilities for efficient and optimum utilization of allocated resources. Hon’ble Minister of State also observed that along with organising Animal Husbandry on modern scientific lines, Department may also actively promote traditional methods for enhancing production and productivity of Country’s Livestock wealth. Emphasis should also be made on ensuring that the benefit of Government Schemes flows to the poorest. For this innovative ways of implementing various schemes with assured impact on the ground need to be taken up.

Airports Authority of India will undertake construction of Integrated Cargo Terminal at Imphal Airport after obtaining grant-in-aid under Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) of Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Govt. of India. The Government of Manipur had planned to establish an Export Import Cargo Terminal (EICT) at Tulihal, Imphal Airport under ASIDE Scheme of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. 

The proposed Integrated Cargo Terminal is expected to give a boost to the export of handicrafts items and perishable cargo. This will also help generate employment opportunities in the North Eastern region of the country, thereby fostering economic development of the region. In addition to this, the EICT will help establish better connectivity with South & Southeast Asia and give a boost to trade between India and the ASEAN countries. 

The estimated cost construction of the cargo terminal is Rs.16.20 crores. Out of this, the Ministry of Commerce & Industry has sanctioned a grant of Rs.12.96 crores under TIES. The balance amount to construct will be met out of internal sources of AAI.

                The Ministry of Civil Aviation today unveiled rules to tackle on-board disruptive and unruly behaviour by passengers. Briefing the media in New Delhi today, the Minister for Civil Aviation Shri P Ashok Gajapathi Raju said that the new rules will allow for the formation of a national, No Fly List of such unruly passengers. He said the promulgation of the No - Fly List in India is unique and first-of-its-kind in the world. Emphasizing the Government’s commitment for ensuring safety, Shri Raju said that the concept of the No-Fly List is based on the concern for safety of passengers, crew and the aircraft, and not just on security threat.

The DGCA has revised the relevant sections of the Civil Aviation Requirement ( CAR Section 3, Series M, Part Vl on ""Handling of Unruly Passengers ) to bring in a deterrent for passengers who engage in unruly behaviour on board aircrafts. The revision has been done in accordance with the provisions of Tokyo Convention 1963.

The revised CAR deals with unruly behavior of passenger on-board aircrafts. Unruly behavior of passengers at airport premises will be dealt with by relevant security agencies under applicable penal provisions. The revised CAR will be applicable for all Indian operators engaged in scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services, both domestic and international carriage of passengers. The CAR would also be applicable to foreign carriers subject to compliance of Tokyo Convention 1963.

Also speaking on the occasion the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha said that the new rules have been promulgated after a lot of deliberation and consultation with all stakeholders. The focus has been on ensuring on board safety while maintaining an element of balance and safeguarding the interest of passengers, cabin crew and the airlines.

The revised CAR defines three categories of unruly behavior - Level 1 refers to behaviour that is verbally unruly, and calls for debarment upto 3 months; Level 2 indicates physical unruliness and can lead to the passenger being debarred from flying for upto 6 months and Level 3 indicates life-threatening behaviour where the debarment would be for a minimum of 2 years.

The complaint of unruly behavior would need to be filed by the pilot-in-command. These complaints will be probed by an internal committee to be set up by the airline. The internal committee will have retired District & Sessions Judge as Chairman and representatives from a different scheduled airline, passengers' association/consumer association/retired officer of Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum as Members. As per the CAR provisions, the internal committee will have to decide the matter within 30 days, and also specify the duration of ban on the unruly passenger. During the period of pendency of the enquiry the concerned airline may impose a ban on the said passenger. For every subsequent offence, the ban will be twice the period of previous ban.

The airlines will be required to share the No-Fly list, and the same will be available on DGCA website. The other airlines will not be bound by the No-Fly list of an airline. The No Fly Lists will have two components - unruly passengers banned for a certain period based on examination of the case by the internal committee; and those persons perceived to be national security risk by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The latter component will, however, not be displayed on the DGCA website.

The revised CAR also contains appeal provisions against the ban. Aggrieved persons (other than those identified as security threat by MHA) may appeal within 60 days from the date of issue of order to the Appellate Committee constituted by MoCA comprising of retired Judge of a High Court of India as Chairman and representatives of passengers association/consumer association/retired officer of Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum and airlines as Members.

Ministry of Coal, along with its attached offices and PSUs under the administrative control of Ministry observed the Swachhta Pakwada during the fortnight from 16th August 2017 to 31st August 2017.

 The Pakhwada was formally launched on Independence Day, 15th August 2017 by carrying out special activities to mark the beginning of Swachhta Pakhwada.

 Shri Susheel Kumar, Secretary Coal convened a pre-pakhwada meeting to review the Swachta Action Plan of the Ministry and PSU’s. A mid-pakhwada meeting was also taken to review the activities carried out during the first week of Pakhwada.

 During these meetings Secretary Coal, emphasized on working towards making ‘swachata’, a Jan Andolan, i.e a public movement, so that it inculcates behavioural and attitudinal changes, thus making it sustainable.

  The highlight of the Pakhwada was large scale tree plantation program that included fruit bearing, timber, medicinal plants with the provision for maintenance and watering of plants for one year. More than 5 lakh samplings were planted in the fortnight.

 

Some of the specific activities that merit special mention are as follows:

 

Installation of a plant for production of drinking water under the brand name “Coal Neer” and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Purification Project at Patansawangi underground coal mine. This plant has a capacity to treat 10,000 litres of water per hour.

 

Electrical crematorium constructed on the Ghat of Mahanadi River.

Truck mounted compactor machine provided to the Sambalpur municipal corporation for collection and compaction of the garbage.

A stretch of around 1.5 km in Manimukta River in Vridhachlam, TN was cleaned by involving 2000 volunteers from various NGOs.

Funds were provided to the Government of Jharkhand for making 3 districts open defecation free(ODF).

 Besides the above, all the units were involved in cleaning of schools, hospitals, Primary Health Centres, anganwadis. Students and staff were made a part of the process. Three different dustbins were installed in schools and hospitals for segregating the waste at the source to ensure proper disposal of solid waste.

 In villages, under the command area of the PSU’s, cleaning of water bodies, wells, overhead tanks, water collection facilities, storm water drains, streets and roads was taken up.

 

Swachh Bharat awareness session on personal hygiene and environmental hygiene were also organized. This included de-worming drive, health camps, blood donation camps, distribution of Swachhta kits.

Finally, for creating awareness, activities like Nukkad Natak; essay, drawing, debate, slogan, wall painting competitions; swachhta talks, discussions, seminars, swachhta rallies; and display of banners, posters were organized in schools and villages.

 To promote Swachhta and recognize the efforts of the PSUs, best performing unit/subsidiary of each PSU is being awarded a running shield.

 Ministry of Coal has uploaded the details of activities, photos and videos along with geo-tagging on the ‘Swachta Samiksha’ Portal of the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation (MoDWS).

      On May 17, 2017, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a new policy for allocation of future coal linkages in a transparent manner for power sector. This policy was christened as Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India (SHAKTI). The policy was an important initiative in alleviating one key challenge in power sector, viz. lack of coal linkage and is expected to positively contribute in resolution of a number of stressed assets. As a part of this policy, CIL/SCCL is to grant coal linkages on notified price on auction basis for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) having already concluded domestic coal based Power Purchase Agreement (PPAs), with the bidding parameter being levellised discount on existing tariff that the IPP is willing to provide. This was expected to result in a win-win situation of IPPs having a long term supply security of coal from a source of their choice while consumers will benefit from a lower tariff.

 

Accordingly, Coal India Limited (CIL), a PSU of Ministry of Coal, Government of India, invited expressions of interest from potential bidders by 19 August 2017. A total of 31 applications were received. These were scrutinized by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and finally a total of 14 bidders were found to be eligible.

 

Subsequently, CIL conducted the auction for IPPs with PPA between 11 and 12 September 2017 as per the approved methodology which, perhaps for the first time in India, used a right to choose technique wherein the Bidder quoting a higher discount to its existing tariff would have a priority in choosing its preferred source(s).

 

Out of 14 Eligible Bidders, 10 participated in the auction representing a cumulative capacity of approx 9044 MW and booked from 8 available sources a cumulative quantity of ~27.18 million Tonnes Per Annum (TPA) with tariff discounts going up to 4 paise / unit. This is expected to result in an annual generation of over 47 billion units per annum from the linkage coal and a savings in tariff of approx 125cr / annum for period up to 25 years.

 

Maximum Allocable Quantity, which was 39.97 MT, is 80% of the Maximum Eligible Quantity (calculated in terms of weighted average of the Source Grades) of all the Eligible Bidders who have submitted the Initial Public Offering (IPO) Discount.

Maximum Eligible Quantity was given by CEA in G13 grade. As the Weighted Average of all the sources was G11, the Maximum Eligible Quantity was converted from G13 into G11 which resulted in the maximum eligible quantity of 33.97 million tonne per annum (MTPA). Therefore, the Maximum Allocable Quantity was 80% of 33.97 = 27.18 MTPA.

                Secretary, Ministry of Coal Shri Susheel Kumar reviewed the coal supply position to the Thermal Power Plants in the country. The meeting was attended by CMD CIL and all the CMDs of the subsidiary companies of CIL.

There has been growth of 17% in coal based thermal power generation, this is primarily on account of reduction in hydro power generation by 12%, in nuclear power generation by 36% and others by 7% in August, 2017 over August, 2016. CMD CIL expressed that the TPPs had earlier regulated and reduced their coal intake and presently when the production in the coal companies and off take from them is sporadically restrained on account of excessive rainfall, there has been a sudden increase in coal based power generation which has resulted in dwindling coal stock at the TPPs. CMD CIL also stated that there has been a growth of 17.8% in coal off take in August, 2017 as compared to August, 2016 and the overall cumulative growth in coal off take is 7.2% in the current year corresponding to the same period last year.

To meet the emergent situation of coal supply, Secretary, Ministry of Coal issued the following directions to CIL:

(i) The coal loading through railway rakes shall be increased to 250 rakes per day by CIL;

(ii) The Ministry of Railways has been requested to position these rakes in consultation with CIL subsidiaries;

(iii) Of these, 225 rakes per day shall be supplied to the power sector;

(iv) For every power plant, one subsidiary of CIL has been assigned the role of lead company. The lead company shall be responsible to monitor and ensure that the power plants linked to it are out of criticality;

(v) A control room at CIL shall monitor the coal supply position to the TPPs on 24x7 basis;

(vi) The offer of coal on ‘as is, where is’ basis shall be made by CIL to all the power plants. CIL shall also request Ministry of Power to direct the pithead TPPs to augment coal supplies through this route.

                Taking forward the Startup India initiative to the next level, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Government of India organized the Second States’ Startup Conference today at Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra, New Delhi. 60 enablers comprising Venture Capitalists (VCs), Incubators, Accelerators, Banks, etc. and over 100 Startups from all over the country participated in the conference. The conference gave them the unique opportunity of interacting with senior officials from as many as 23 States and UT Governments, as also Central Government. 

The discussions in the conference focussed around the themes related to incubation facilities in India, role of State Government in setting up and operationalizing Fund of Funds through AIFs and VCs and making regulatory compliance easier for Startups. In his inaugural address, the Hon’ble Minister of State, Commerce and Industry, Shri C.R. Choudhary emphasized on the larger role States need to play in facilitating and encouraging Startups which would determine the ultimate success of Startup initiative. He exhorted all to ensure that the benefits of Startup India program should percolate down to entrepreneurs in tier-2/tier-3 cities. Shri Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, DIPP stressed upon the need to take positive steps to support the budding entrepreneurs of the country. He also highlighted the game-changing initiatives such as Startup India Hub and Learning & Development program launched by DIPP for benefit of budding entrepreneurs. 

The role of States/UTs in creation of a strong startup ecosystem in the country was focussed upon in the sessions. Several states showcased key initiatives they had taken to promote startups. Odisha showcased various tools they have developed to equip startups, including a comprehensive portal, helpline and various learning & development initiatives. Tamil Nadu presented the extensive network of innovation centers which have been developed on a hub and spoke model across colleges in the state. Jharkhand showcased their bottom up approach of fostering innovation by reaching out to schools to nurture a culture of innovation through a ‘germinator.’ Other States viz. Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh also made presentations showcasing their efforts in supporting Startups. 

The event witnessed dedicated sessions on ‘Incubation facilities across States: Challenges and Solutions’ and ‘Funding for Startups - Role of State Government’. The panelists debated on how State Governments in collaboration with Startup enablers can facilitate setting up of incubation facilities and funding for Startups across States/UTs. 

Another session on ‘Making regulations easier for Startups’ brought forth suggestions from Startups on resolving regulatory issues in e-vehicles, e-pharmacy and other disruptive technology business domains. 

The conference provided a platform that saw all the Startup ecosystem players from Central and State Governments to Startups, Incubators, investors and mentors coming together. The sessions highlighted key learnings as takeaways that would encourage State Governments to undertake initiatives for development of their respective Startup ecosystems. The healthy cross-pollination of ideas and best practices augurs well for the entire startup ecosystem in the country.

                The Cell for IPR Promotions & Management (CIPAM) under the aegis of Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has launched a social media campaign to promote Indian Geographical Indications (GIs) with #LetsTalkIP which is an ongoing movement initiated by CIPAM to make more people aware about the importance of Intellectual Property Rights.

A Geographical Indication or a GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to its origin in that defined geographical locality. Darjeeling Tea, Mahabaleshwar Strawberry, Blue Pottery of Jaipur, Banarasi Sarees and Tirupati Laddus are some of the GIs.

GIs are of utmost importance to the country as they are an integral part of India’s rich culture and collective intellectual heritage. The promotion of GIs is in line with the Government’s ‘Make in India’ campaign. It’s an area of strength and optimism for India, whereby the GI tag has accorded protection to a number of hand-made and manufactured products, especially in the informal sector.

Certain GI products can benefit the rural economy in remote areas, by supplementing the incomes of artisans, farmers, weavers and craftsmen. Our rural artisans possess unique skills and knowledge of traditional practices and methods, passed down from generation to generation, which need to be protected and promoted.

In the recent past, the government had launched similar initiatives such as #IWearHandloom and #CottonIsCool to promote and revive traditional handwoven textiles.

This time around, CIPAM will be talking about interesting facts and stories related to GIs from across the country on its Twitter handle @CIPAM_India and Facebook Page @CIPAMIndia using #LetsTalkIP hashtag. The government will also be coming up with various other initiatives to promote registered GIs in the future.

                  Hortinet is an integrated traceability system developed by APEDA for providing Internet based electronic services to the stakeholders for facilitating farm registration, testing and certification of Grape, Pomegranate and Vegetables for export from India to the European Union in compliance with standards. To harness the potential of mobile technology, APEDA has developed a mobile app to allow farmers to apply on-line to facilitate their farm registration, tracking the status of application & approvals by State Government and Lab sampling by authorized Laboratories. This mobile app initiative is expected to increase the accessibility and reach of the Traceability software system among the farmers and other stakeholders.

             This new Mobile app will also assist State Horticulture/ Agriculture Department to capture real time details of farmers, farm location, products and details of inspections like date of inspection, name of inspecting directly from field. After registration and approval of farm, farmer gets approval information.

The key features of the app are :

·         Online Farm registration application and status tracking

·         Processing and approval on on-line farmer applications by State Horticulture /Agriculture department.

·         Registration of farmers, farms and products by State Horticulture/Agriculture department

·         Capture geo location of the farms registered through the app

·         Sample collection by APEDA authorized Laboratories along with geo location of the sample.

             Dr Tarun Bajaj, GM APEDA initiated the proceedings  by outlining the new mobile app concept and its evolution . Chairman, APEDA, Shri DK Singh  welcomed the dignitaries and then addressed the gathering . He mentioned the various initiatives taken by APEDAin the past like introduction of TraceNet for organics, AnarNet , GrapeNet  traceability softwares . He cited the importance of the new mobile App Farmer Connect which is a giant leap in connecting the farmers through mobile network for registration procedure  at his comfort from any location.  He also mentioned that through this App not only the process of farmer and farm registration will be convenience but laboratory testing of product samples will also be easier. The three dots in the App logo signify the farmers,  state government and the laboratory which is the essence of this Farmer Connect App. He also mentioned that this app is being launched in Hindi and Marathi apart from English so that it becomes user friendly.

             Shri Sumanta Chaudhary, MD, SFAC appreciated the new mobile app and highlighted the areas of mutual cooperation between SFAC and APEDA  through networking of clusters of FPOs and APEDA clusters .

             Commerce Secretary , Government of India, Smt Rita Teaotia launched the app. The occasion was followed by display of a film depicting  all the facets of the utility of the new app.

             Addressing the gathering, the Commerce Secretary expressed her happiness at meeting the APEDA family. She mentioned that Indian agriculture exports are worth 34 bn USD in the total merchandize exports of 435 bn USD. The level of agricultural exports is low considering that we have enormous population and most of what is produced is consumed domestically. Though we have only 2.2% share ,yet we are amongst the top 10 players in global agricultural trade. The efforts made by APEDA in promoting exports especially the use of traceability softwares has benefitted Indian agricultural trade and ensuring that importing countries get the product of  quality and standards that they desire. It is true that there could always be stray cases of failure of samples  which could have repercussions on the farmers . It is important for us to make best use of technology so that any problems areas are tracked and solutions found . The use of mobile app technology and traceability systems is a great tool in identifying the farmers and laboratories from where the produce was sourced and tested . She advised that APEDA make all out efforts in enrolling larger number of farmers and exporters through the new technology tool . Commerce Secretary mentioned that there is need to move towards adoption of similar standards for domestic market and export market since the Indian consumer is also expecting and entitled to the best quality product. She suggested that the Mobile App be also  be made available on IOS system apart from Android  and that the  app and other traceability systems should be made in vernacular languages for better understanding by users.

Mrs Rekha Mehta, AGM, APEDA then tendered the Vote of Thanks.

Delivering the inaugural speech at the India Mobile Congress-2017 here, the Minister said that driven by the adoption of smartphones and exponential increase in data consumption, telecom industry is expected to generate revenue of approximately up to USD 38.25 billion by 2017, registering a CAGR of 5.2% during the period 2014 to 2017. He said that investment into the sector has increased by approximately 220% in last four years and to enhance and expand mobile coverage, operators have rolled out more than 0.2 million sites in the last 15 months and every 3 minutes a new site is being put up.

 

Shri Sinha said that it is also expected that the telecom industry generates approximately 4 million direct and in-direct job opportunities on account of continued focus of government and telcos in the rural market and continued surge in the sale of mobile phones and data usage. Traffic from mobile devices contributes to 70% of overall e-commerce traffic. Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow 2.8 times by 2021 to USD 125 billion and mobile devices will drive this growth.

 

He said, fundamental to the goals of digital India is the country’s communications industry that has not just connected people, but also created jobs, become a tool for knowledge, contributed to the exchequer and the economic growth and amplified financial inclusion. There are three key visions areas of the Government’s Digital India plan –

·         digital infrastructure as a utility to every citizen,

·         governance & services on demand and

·         digital empowerment of citizens.

 

 The Minister said that in the past few years, the Government has put the spotlight firmly on technology, smart cities, connected super highways, and enhanced e-governance services delivery for the citizens. All of these are highly dependent on the telecom sector. He said, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), it will not only be people connecting to the internet but also billions of machines and appliances such as wearables, cars, homes, industrial equipment, white goods, etc. Introduction of low cost smartphones coupled with government initiatives focussed on ‘Digital India’, rise of convergence, and exponential growth in adoption of latest technologies will play a critical role in connecting the next billion to the internet.

 

The Minister said that the Telecom and IT presently contribute 16.5 percent to the GDP, and there are immense possibilities for increasing its share even as other sector also show robust growth. It is expected that with NTP 2018, Indian telecom market will cross the Rs 6.6 trillion revenue mark even by the year 2020 itself. The Government is undertaking many significant steps for further augmentation of ease of doing business and creating an environment for innovation and investment.

 

Shri Sinha said that India is at the cusp of a next generation of wireless technology 5G. 5G has been conceived as a foundation for expanding the potential of the Networked Society. A digital transformation brought about through the power of connectivity is taking place in almost every industry. The landscape is expanding to include massive scale of “smart things” to be interconnected. Therefore, the manner in which future networks will cope with massively varied demands and a business landscape will be significantly different from today.

 

Shri Sinha said, for India, 5G provides an opportunity for industry to reach out to global markets, and consumers to gain with the economies of scale and citizens to reap the benefits of doorstep governance and availability of services, medical support, benefits transfers, education, entertainment and build a digital payment, knowledge and services economy. He said, India has constituted High Level 5G India 2020 Forum and joined the race in 5G technologies and it is open for collaboration with all stakeholders.

 

In her address, Secretary, Telecom, Ms Aruna Sundararajan said that India Mobile Congress promises to be the platform for Prime Minister’s vision of a fully connected and digitally empowered India, which is well on its way of realisation. She said that there was seven-fold acceleration in the implementation of Bharat-Net Project for connecting one lakh Gram Panchayats with broadband by the end of the year. Similarly, there is a target of 1 million wi-fi hotspots by 2019 and 700 million internet users in India by 2022. She said that IMC is a marquee event to showcase India’s deep capabilities in IT, Telecom and Internet sectors. The Secretary said that three specific goals of the event are-How India can position itself as a world leader in emerging technologies; unprecedented opportunities for Make in India and Design in India and thirdly, the opportunity to grow together in a global environment of convergence. She said that the theme of the event-“Connecting the Unconnected” has a deep resonance for the government.

India is at the cusp of a next generation of wireless technology 5G. 5G has been conceived as a foundation for expanding the potential of the Networked Society. A digital transformation brought about through the power of connectivity is taking place in almost every industry. The landscape is expanding to include massive scale of “smart things” to be interconnected. Therefore, the manner in which future networks will cope with massively varied demands and a business landscape will be significantly different from today.

The economic benefits from the 5G technology are also quite immense. As per the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Committee on Digital Economic Policy, it has been stated that 5G technologies rollout will help in,

a) Increasing GDP

b) Creating Employment

c) Digitizing the economy.

For India, 5G provides an opportunity for industry to reach out to global markets, and consumers to gain with the economies of scale. Worldwide countries have launched similar Forums and thus, India has joined the race in 5G technologies. We are open for collaboration with them. 

Government has constituted High Level 5G India 2020 Forum with three Secretaries of key Ministries/Departments Telecom, Meity and DST, and also comprising of renowned experts like Dr. A. Paulraj, Professor Emeritus, Stanford University, USA, Mr Gururaj Deshpande - Chairman of Sycamore Networks, Sandstone, USA, Indian industry led by CEOs of ICT industry, Telecom Standard Development Organisation of India (TSDSI), Professors from IIT Madras, IIT Mumbai, IIT Delhi, IIT Hyderabad, IISc Bengaluru, IT industry and stakeholders from industry associations.

                Department of Telecommunications has formulated guidelines for settlement of claims for compensation on accidents applicable to this Department and its PSUs so that the compensation to the family of the victims can be paid directly by the authorities without the intervention of the Courts. The guidelines have been effectuated from 01.12.2016.

 

The guidelines provide for a compensation of Rs.10 Lakh in case of death or permanent disability resulting loss of both limbs and Rs.7 Lakh in case of other permanent disabilities in the event of any accident resulting solely and directly from any unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence caused during the maintenance, operation and provisioning of any public services undertaken by this Department and its PSUs. This compensation will be in addition to the existing provisions of compensation under various welfare legislations.

 

A Junior Administrative Grade(JAG) Officer or equivalent has been designated for the purpose of receiving and processing claims for compensation as per the prescribed procedure mentioned in the guidelines and to dispose of the same within 30 days in any case. In case where no application is received from the victim (any person who suffers permanent disablement or dies in an accident as defined in the guidelines)/dependents of victim, the Designated Officer may on receipt of the detailed accident report proceed suo-moto to initiate the process for consideration for grant of the compensation to the victim/dependents of victims. Detailed guidelines can be downloaded from the Department’s website www.dot.gov.in.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for hiving off mobile tower assets of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) into a separate company, fully owned by BSNL.

This approval authorizes BSNL to monetize its telecom tower infrastructure with the formation of a separate subsidiary company.

There are around 4,42,000 mobile towers in the country out of which more than 66,000 mobile tower are of BSNL. An independent, dedicated tower company of BSNL with a focused approach will lead to increasing of external tenancies and consequentially higher revenue for the new company.

Background:

The telecom tower industry has emerged as an independent business to harness the potential for sharing of infrastructure. The business model arose from the need to achieve economies of scale and to reduce capital investment costs for providing mobile services. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) policy allows sharing of passive infrastructure i.e. the tower structure, Diesel Generator sets, battery units, power interface unit, air-conditioning etc., which has facilitated the growth of the telecom infrastructure industry. A tower infrastructure company essentially owns the passive infrastructure asset and leases it to telecom service providers enabling them to minimize duplication of investments and economize on costs of Operation and Maintenance (O&M), thereby improving profitability.

Besides the captive model in BSNL and MTNL where the service provider owns their passive infrastructure also, there are three different business models within the telecom tower industry:- companies created by hiving off the tower assets portfolios of service providers into subsidiaries, companies established as independent joint venture entities by service providers jointly and companies promoted by specific service providers but established as independent entities with the promoter being the anchor tenant for the tower company.

Declaration of the changed retail sale price (MRP) was allowed to be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be. 

Use of unexhausted packaging material/wrapper was also been allowed upto 30th September, 2017 after making the necessary corrections. 

Considering the requests received to extend the permission for some more time it has been extended to display the revised MRP due to implementation of GST by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing for a further period of three months, i.e. up to 31st December, 2017.

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution today launched the Web Portal of Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) & “Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipt (e-NWR) System” in New Delhi, today. Addressing the gathering on the occasion Shri Paswan lauded the initiatives taken by the WDRA in simplifying the Warehouse Registration Rules, digitizing the entire process of registration, monitoring and surveillance as well as creation and management of Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) in electronic form through two repositories. 

Shri Paswan informed that the e-NWRs would have no chances of any tempering, mutilation, fudging, loss or damage and with no possibility of any multiple financing. Hence, these NWRs will not only facilitate an easy pledge financing by banks and other financial institutions but also smooth trading on various trading centres like commodity exchanges, electronic National Agriculture Markets (e-NAM) and other electronic platforms. He felt that these e-NWRs will save expenditure in logistics as the stocks could be traded through multiple buyers without physical movement and can be even split for partial transfer or withdrawal. 

Shri Paswan expressed that these initiatives would revolutionise the marketing of agricultural commodities and help farmers realize better price for their produce which will be a step towards doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 as well as Digital India mission as envisaged by the Hon’ble Prime Minister. 

Shri C R Chaudhary, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution also attended the function as Guest of Honour and addressed the gathering. 

Shri G.C. Chaturvedi, Chairman, WDRA presented an overview of various steps taken by the WDRA under its Transformation Plan to fully digitize its functioning. He indicated that the whole purpose of simplifying the processes and moving towards online system would enhance WDRA’s regulatory functions and bring greater fiduciary trust among banks, depositors and the trade on the e-NWR system. 

Coinciding with the ongoing Swachhta Pakhwada, Shri Paswan also administered the Swachhta pledge to the gathering and requested everyone for their wholehearted participation in keeping their surrounding clean and realizes the dream of a Swachh Bharat.

                Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) is regularly monitoring the prices and availability of essential food items including onion. It has noted that 3rd advance estimate of production of onion for 20016-17 is higher at 217.2 LMT as compared to the earlier production estimated of 215.6 LMT. Therefore, there appears to be no underline cause for prices for onion to increase. However, prices of onion have recorded increase over the last month. To discourage speculative and unscrupulous trade activities, Department of Consumer Affairs has enabled States to impose stock limit on onion. In addition DoCA in coordination with Department of Commerce has recently held meeting with traders/importers, where the current onion price and availability situation was reviewed. It transpired that import of around 2,400 MT of onion has arrived while another 9,000 MT is expected shortly. Recent production does indicate that as per the fundamentals, there is no rational for prices of onion to rise any further. DoCA will regularly review the price situation with stakeholders and facilitate imports by private traders to help moderate speculation in the market if prices go up unreasonably.

                Taking forward the initiative launched by the Government of India to curb the menace of shell companies, money laundering and black money in the country and prevent misuse of corporate structure by shell companies for various illegal purposes, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) have now concluded a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for data exchange, on 6th September, 2017.

The MoU will facilitate the sharing of data and information between CBDT and MCA on an automatic and regular basis. It will enable sharing of specific information such as Permanent Account Number (PAN) data in respect of corporates, Income Tax returns (ITRs) of corporates, financial statements filed with the Registrar by corporates, returns of allotment of shares, audit reports and statements of financial transactions (SFT) received from banks relating to corporates. The MoU will ensure that both MCA and CBDT have seamless PAN-CIN (Corporate Identity Number) and PAN-DIN (Director Identity Number) linkage for regulatory purposes. The information shared will pertain to both Indian corporates as well as foreign corporates operating in India. In addition to regular exchange of data, CBDT and MCA will also exchange with each other, on request, any information available in their respective databases, for the purpose of carrying out scrutiny, inspection, investigation and prosecution.

The MoU comes into force from the date it was signed and is an ongoing initiative of MCA and CBDT, which are already collaborating for near real time allotment of PAN and TAN also at the time of Incorporation of companies itself. A Data Exchange Steering Group also has been constituted for the initiative, which will meet periodically to review the data exchange status and take steps to further improve the effectiveness of the two agencies.

The Secretarial Standards on Meetings of the Board of Directors and Secretarial Standard on General Meetings were approved by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India under sub-section 10 of Section 118 of the Companies Act, 2013 and are in place with effect from 1st July, 2015.

                In continuation of the Government’s resolve to strengthen the rules and procedures of Corporate Governance, the Government today took some major decisions to further strengthen these norms. It has been decided that in case the Director or authorized signatory of any “struck off” company tries to unauthorizedly siphon-off money from its bank account, he/she may attract punishment of imprisonment of not less than six months extendible to 10 years. If it is found that the fraud involves public interest, the punishment shall not be less than 3 years and fine may also be imposed which would be three times the amount involved.

Consequent to instructions issued by Department of Financial Services (DoFS) to all the Banks on 5thSeptember 2017, the Directors (ex-) or their authorized signatories had been restricted from operating the Bank accounts of such companies and they cannot siphon off money from the accounts of these “struck off” companies. However, even prior to such action, if they have siphoned off any money, strict action would still be taken against them.

In a Review Meeting chaired by the Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary today, it was also decided that the Directors of such shell companies which have not filed returns for three or more years, will be disqualified from being appointed in any other company as Director or from being reappointed as Director in any of the companies where they had been Directors, thereby compelling them to vacate office. It is expected that as a result of this exercise, at least two to three lakh of such disqualified Directors shall get debarred.

Apart from the action restricting the operation of bank accounts of these companies and consequential effect on the Directors, all efforts are also being made to identify the actual beneficiaries and persons behind such Shell Companies. Profiles of Directors such as their background, antecedents and their role in the operations/functioning of these companies are being compiled in collaboration with enforcement agencies. Identification of more Shell Companies is also in progress. The Professionals, Chartered Accountants/ Company Secretaries/ Cost Accountants associated with such Shell Companies and involved in illegal activities have been identified in certain cases and the action by Professional Institutes such as ICAI, ICSI and ICAoI are being monitored.

The MoS (Corporate Affairs) Shri Chaudhary said that as a result of the exercise of weeding out shell companies, it would not only help in checking the menace of black money but also would promote an ecosystem of “Ease of Doing Business” and enhancing investors’ confidence to which the present Government is fully committed. He said that the financial status of the companies would be reflected in a true and fair manner which would minimize the possibility of frauds and tax evasion. Further, the availability of funds for illegal purposes will also be choked. Shri Chaudhary concluded that the interest of stakeholders would be fully protected and the image of the country in the global business arena and fora would substantially improve.

Earlier, pursuant to the action of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs of removing/striking-off and consequent cancellation of the registration of around 2,09,032 shell companies, the Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance had directed all the Banks to restrict operations of bank accounts of such companies by the Directors of such companies or their authorized representatives. The decision to restrict the operation of the bank accounts of such shell companies was also taken in a Review Meeting held by the Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Shri. Chaudhary, immediately after taking over the charge of the Ministry. In the meeting, the Minister had stressed upon the need of taking holistic steps and expeditious action for addressing the menace of the shell companies and their role in money laundering and black money circulation. He had then asked the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs to take-up the issue immediately with DoFS, Ministry of Finance to ensure that banks are instructed to restrict operations of bank accounts of shell companies. DoFS, in turn, took prompt action in this regard and advised the Banks to take expeditious action accordingly.

                The Vice President of India Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu released a Commemorative Coin on Bharat Ratna Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi and inaugurated an exhibition entitled “Kurai Onrum Illai-MS: Life in Music” on the occasion of Birth Centenary Commemoration of Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi here today. Minister of State (Independent charge) for Culture Dr. Mahesh Sharma was the Guest of Honour.

 

Addressing on the occasion, the Vice President said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi was a legendary and iconic figure who mesmerized everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to common man. India is a land of rich cultural heritage with music in diverse genres representing the truly myriad mosaic of plurality. He further said that what defines India is this rich heritage of music and its unifying role in bringing people together cutting across religions, regions, castes and communities.

 

He said that the roots of Indian music can be traced to Vedic literature, Sama Veda in particular and as such every note and cadence associated with our ancient music systems have to be preserved and propagated. He further said that this is our bounden duty to see such cultural heritage is preserved which is given to us by our fore fathers and pass it on to the next generation.

The Vice President said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi’s music is immortal and everyone in this country was influenced and thrilled by her music. He further said that music acquired a divine dimension when she lent her voice to various compositions. She was the first musician to be awarded Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour and first Indian musician to have performed at the United Nations General Assembly, he added.

In his address Dr Mahesh Sharma said that Bharat Ratna Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi performed in 50thanniversary celebration of the United Nations and it was a very moment for all Indians. Mahatma Gandhi Ji asked her sing “Prabhu Tum Haro Jan Ki Pir” and she had sung it with full dedication. Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi was not only a singer but was an encyclopaedia of singing. It is a proud occasion for us to celebrate her anniversary from 16th September, 2016 to 16th September, 2017. India is known by its rich cultural heritage and our new generation should try to preserve our rich and diverse cultural heritage.

The title of the exhibition draws from an iconic song composed by Rajaji and rendered by Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi, perhaps only by her. The song tells God that she has no complaints about life, about him. The exhibition looks at the life of Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi from her early years to the people who moulded her the composers and songs she immortalized, her contribution to the freedom movement, her magnanimous charity work, her role in films and the many awards and accolades world decorated her with.

                Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) has completed 60 years of its existence. Minister of State for Defence, Dr Subhash Bhamare, graced the Diamond Jubilee celebration at DRDO Bhawan here today to mark the occasion. Addressing the august gathering, Dr Bhamre complemented DGQA for firmly supporting the combat effectiveness of the India Army and Navy while handling a very large bandwidth of technology and an inventory of equipment unparalleled anywhere in the country. 

Dr Bhamre appreciated professionalism, dedication and excellence of the personnel of the DGQA and went on to stress that Self-Reliance was the corner stone on which the military capability of any nation must rest and that has been the guiding principle of the government policies. He pointed out that preference given to Indigenous Design, Development and Manufacture (IDDM) has been reflected in DPP-2016. Dr Bhamre went on to highlight that numerous initiatives of Department of Defence Production like Green Channel Status and Self Certification would go long way in realising the objective of ‘Make in India’. He urged DGQA to realign itself with the best practices all over the world. 

Director General of DGQA Lt Gen Shamsher Singh highlighted the achievements of the organisation. He stated that all its 36 laboratories are NABL accredited and 99 of its establishments have been granted ISO certification. The organisation has quality assured Defence stores worth Rs. 28,878 crore during the financial year 2016-17. In addition, the organisation has been providing assistance to the User and Manufacturer in difficult and trying situations, warranting the technical expertise and hands-on experience. He also informed that during the last one month as part of their celebrations, the organisation which is spread pan India has organised a tree plantation drive wherein 23,000 saplings were planted. 

Though, the origin of the DGQA dates back to 1869, when the first Inspectorate was set up at Ammunition Factory, Kirkee, the organisation came into its present incarnation in 1957 when Maj Gen Pratap Narain was appointed as the first Director General on 27 September 1957. 

Dr Bhamre released the ‘First Day Cover’ to commemorate the occasion. He also launched a portal for e-registration of vendors. Secretary (Defence Production) Shri Ashok Gupta also addressed the gathering. This was followed by an awards ceremony wherein officers and staff were awarded DGQA Commendation Cards and Cash Awards for their commendable performance and exemplary services rendered.

                His Excellency Mr. James Mattis, Secretary of Defence of the United States, Representatives of the media,

Ladies and gentlemen,

It is indeed a privilege to receive Secretary Mattis in Delhi. I extend a warm welcome to him on his first visit to India as Secretary of Defence.

He is a special visitor for me personally as he is the first Ministerial counterpart I have met since taking over my responsibility as Defence Minister of India.

We have just concluded very substantive, constructive and forward-looking talks. I thank Secretary Mattis for generously sharing his deep knowledge and wisdom of defence matters. I am confident that his knowledge and experience will contribute to further deepening defence and security cooperation between India and the United States.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

India and the United States share a strong and vibrant strategic partnership. As the world's largest democracies, we also share fundamental values and interests.

Defence cooperation between India and the US has grown significantly in recent years and emerged as a key pillar of our strategic partnership.

Our military-to-military engagement continues to grow. We recently concluded the trilateral Malabar Naval Exercise in the Bay of Bengal along with Japan. This edition of Malabar demonstrated the progress made in operational synergies between our Navies. As we speak, our Armies are conducting their Exercise Yudh Abhyas. In our talks today, we agreed to explore additional, specialized exercises.

Cooperation in defence equipment has grown steadily over the past years. The US is now a leading supplier of state-of-the-art defence equipment to India. I appreciated Secretary Mattis' willingness to share further cutting-edge platforms which would enhance India's defence preparedness to meet current and emerging threats.

Secretary Mattis and I agreed that we need to expand on the progress already made by encouraging co-production and co-development efforts. I reiterated India's deep interest in enhancing defence manufacturing in India under Prime Minister's Make in India initiative. I thank Secretary Mattis for his supportive position in this regard and look forward to working closely with him to realize joint projects.

In this context, we agreed that the full implementation of the understanding reached following the announcement by the US last year recognizing India as a Major Defence Partner will provide further energy and momentum to our collaboration on defence technology and manufacturing.

We also discussed how to refocus and re-energize the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) as a mechanism to promote technology sharing as well as co­ development and co-production efforts.

We also exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest. The situation in our neighbourhood and the growing menace of cross-border terrorism were discussed in depth. There is growing convergence in the approaches of both our countries on this issue. We both recognize the importance of holding those who use terrorism as an instrument of state policy to account and to dismantle the infrastructure that supports terrorism.

As you are aware, India welcomed President Trump's new US Strategy for Afghanistan announced last month. Today, I had useful discussions with Secretary Mattis on how we could strengthen our cooperation bilaterally as well as with the Government of Afghanistan in pursuit of our common objective of a peaceful, democratic, stable and prosperous Afghanistan.

We also discussed the issues relating to maritime security in the Indian Ocean and the broader Asia-Pacific Region as well as regional connectivity issues. India supports the freedom of navigation, over-flight and unimpeded lawful commerce. We also believe that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with the universally recognized principles of international law. I am happy to note that Secretary Mattis reaffirmed the US position in support of these principles. I also welcome his reiteration of the US commitment to work with India in ensuring maritime security in the lndo Pacific and as first responder to HADR situations.

From our discussions today, l am confident that we are entering a new phase in our strategic defence partnership with the United States. I once again thank Secretary Mattis for visiting India. I also thank him for inviting me to visit the United States to carry forward our discussions.

                INS Tarasa, a Water Jet Fast Attack Craft was commissioned into the Indian Navy by Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command at the Naval Dockyard, Mumbai today. At an impressive commissioning ceremony, Vice Admiral Luthra expressed confidence that the new INS Tarasa will discharge her duties with élan and resolve, and bring laurels to the Western Naval Command and the Nation.

Complimenting the designers, builders, engineers, overseers, and the officers and the men whose efforts have fructified in the commissioning of the ship, he said that the ship is of proven design, has good endurance, low draught, high speed and manoeuvrability,  thus making her most suited for her primary role of extended coastal and offshore surveillance and patrol. He reserved special praise for the ship’s crew and the Warship Overseeing Team, Kolkata for ensuring that the ship has been commissioned with all Weapon and Sensor trials completed. The passage of the ship during her maiden voyage from Kolkata to Mumbai, in rough weather, bears testimony to the seaworthiness of the ship. 

INS Tarasa is the fourth and last of the follow-on Water Jet FAC's built by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata. The first two ships of the class i.e. IN ships Tarmugli and Tihayu were commissioned in 2016 and are based at Visakhapatnam; while the third ship INS Tillanchang was commissioned earlier this year at Karwar on 09 March 2017.  These ships are an upgrade of the Car Nicobar class Fast Attack Crafts with the Indian Navy, which were also indigenously designed and built by GRSE, Kolkata.

INS Tarasa is 50 m long and powered by three waterjets which give it speeds of over 35 knots (65 kmph). The ship is armed with a 30 mm main gun indigenously built , and a number of light, medium and heavy machine guns to undertake costal defence operations. The ship is an ideal platform for missions like coastal and off-shore surveillance, EEZ Patrol, law enforcement as well as non-military missions such as Search and Rescue, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. The commissioning Commanding Officer of the ship is Lieutenant Commander Praveen Kumar.

This is the second ship of the Indian Navy to be named INS Tarasa. The first INS Tarasa was in service of the Navy from 1999 to 2014. She was gifted to Seychelles Coast Guard as a symbol of India's partnership with friendly maritime nation in IOR. The new INS Tarasa will be based at Mumbai under the operational control of Western Naval Command.

The Director General Armed Forces Medical Services and Headquarters IDS (Medical) in collaboration with the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India organized a path breaking Seminar on “IMPLEMENTATION OF AYUSH IN THE ARMED FORCES MEDICAL SERVICES: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES” on 26 Sep 2017 at Army Hospital (Research and Referral), New Delhi.

        

The benefits of the Indian indigenous systems of Medicine and Yoga are well recognized nationally and globally. The Government of India has taken major initiatives to promote the practice of AYUSH in the country. Lt Gen MK Unni, the Director General Armed Forces Medical Services said mainstreaming of the Indian System of Medicine has been one of the key stated objectives of policy makers in the Government for several years. The integration of AYUSH in the Armed Forces is challenging due to the unique environmental and operational conditions.

       

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research said well-coordinated research and clinical trials to establish the efficacy, safety and replicability of the AYUSH medicines will go a long way in promoting mutual trust and respect between the practitioners of the two systems.

 

Lt Gen CS Narayanan, DCIDS (Medical), the organizing Chairman of the seminar highlighted the fact that clear-cut policies on cross referral and cross practice and accountability mechanisms must be put in place before integrating the modern and traditional systems of Medicine.

    

            Senior faculty from institutes of excellence across the country, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences participated in the deliberations which put the various issues related to the topic in perspective and charted the way forward.

                A multi-agency exercise was conducted on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake as the final event of ‘Pralay Sahayam’ in Hyderabad today. The event demonstrated efforts of all central and state agencies, National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and the Armed Forces towards jointly tackling an urban flooding scenario in Hyderabad. 

The Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre who was the Chief Guest on the occasion, congratulated the organising committee for the successful conduct of the exercise. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana Shri Mohammad Mehmood Ali was the Guest of Honour. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) Southern Command Lt Gen PM Hariz was the conducting authority of the exercise. For the purpose of the exercise, Hussain Sagar Lake was transformed into urban colonies partly submerged under water, post heavy showers in the city. A large number of dummy structures depicting multi-storied buildings and houses with stranded people, power stations, educational institutes etc., were erected in the lake in an inundated condition. The hapless stranded occupants of these dwellings were rescued in joint operations carried out by the State Government agencies, Police, State Fire & Emergency Services, NDRF, CISF and the Armed Forces. The Indian Air Force and the Army Aviation employed the Mi-17 helicopters, Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and Chetak Helicopter for aerial evacuation, demonstrating special skills in hovering and winching. The massive Mi-17 lowered a Gemini class inflatable boat of the Indian Navy for rescuing the trapped citizens. The agile ALH and Chetak Helicopters virtually hovered over the roof tops and winched in people trapped in stranded, inaccessible buildings. Special Forces such as the Army Commandos and Marine Commandos from the Indian Navy carried out a highly synchronized Search and Rescue operation in the flooded colonies. Dog Squad of NDRF and Telangana State police were pressed into action to search for trapped personnel. Relief activities such as evacuation of rescued people, provisioning of medical care and distribution of essential supplies was carried out by multiple agencies in a coordinated and efficient manner. 

The exercise brought out the role and function of the State Emergency Operations in coordinating conduct of the joint operations. Further the significance of early warning systems of agencies like Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) was emphasized. 

The exercise culminated with a static display which demonstrated the efficient and functional layout of a relief and rehabilitation camp for the displaced persons. The camp catered for emergency medical assistance and other essential services for the needy. Indian vendors showcased state-of-the-art disaster management equipment and related wares. NGOs such as Plan India, Care India, Sphere India, etc., also participated, bringing out their capabilities, organization and operational strategies.

                DGMO level talks on behest of Pak DGMO was held on 22 Sep 17. During the talks the Pak DGMO raised the issues of targeting of Pak Civilians opposite the Jammu Sector by own troops.

Indian DGMO in response highlighted that all Cease Fire Violations in the Jammu Sector were initiated by Pak Rangers and the BSF troops deployed only responded appropriately to them. It was also emphasised that no targeted firing on civilians was carried out by own troops. Apart from these, firing by BSF troops were initiated onto Armed intruders attempting to infiltrate from close proximity of Pak posts along Amritsar Border.

DGMO also put across emphatically that the trend of infiltration along the LC continued with active support of Pak forward posts impacting peace and tranquility along the LC and also the internal security situation. This was evident from continued attempts of sniping and targeting of our troops undertaken through cross-border actions duly supported by Pak Army troops.

DGMO reiterated that the Indian Army is a professional Army and reserves the right to retaliate appropriately to any incident leading to loss of life of our troop. He reaffirmed the sincerity in the efforts of Indian Army to maintain peace and tranquility along the LC provided there was a reciprocal effort from Pakistan.

                Admiral Tin Aung San, Commander-in-Chief, Myanmar Navy, is currently on a visit to India from 18 to 21 September 2017. The visit is intended to consolidate and enhance bilateral defence relations between India and Myanmar. The Admiral visited various Naval establishments at Mumbai and Kochi as part of his itinerary prior arriving New Delhi where he is scheduled to call on the Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Air Staff.  The Admiral will also hold discussions with various dignitaries from the Ministry of Defence at New Delhi.

Naval cooperation between India and Myanmar has been traditionally strong, encompassing a wide span which includes operational interactions through Coordinated Parols, Training, Port Calls, Passage Exercises along with Capacity Building and Capability Augmentation initiatives. During the recent visit of the Hon’ble Prime Minister to Myanmar in early September 17, three MoUs with respect to maritime cooperation were signed between both countries. The visit of the Admiral also closely follows the recent visit of the Commander in Chief, Myanmar Defence Forces in August 2017 and is reflective of the growing level of cooperation between both Navies.

Mortal remains of the Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh (MIAF) - a legendary icon of IAF were cremated with full state honours at Brar Square Crematorium in Delhi Cantt today. The Marshal breathed his last at the Army Hospital (R&R), New Delhi on 16th September 2017 following a cardiac arrest. He was 98. 

This morning at 0815 hrs, the funeral procession started from the Marshal’s residence at 7A, Kautilya Marg. His mortal remains were carried in a Gun Carriage to Brar Square Crematorium. The Inter Services Guard presented the salute followed by a wreath laying ceremony. Wreaths were laid on behalf of the President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister. The wreaths were laid in person by Dr. Manmohan Singh former Prime Minister, Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri MoS Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri LK Advani, Shri Anil Baijal Lt. Governor of Delhi, Shri Vijai Kapoor former Lt. Governor of Dehli, Commissioner Dehli Police Shri Amulya Patnaik. Three Service Chiefs also paid homage by laying wreath. Former Chiefs of Army and Air Force also laid the wreaths. 

After the religious rituals, the mortal remains were consigned to flames while seventeen Gun salutes boomed. The Indian Air Force paid their last respect to the Marshal of the Air Force through a fly past led by three Mi-17 V5 aircraft trooping IAF colours. Three Su-30 MKI aircraft thereafter flew over the crematorium in a ‘Missing Man’ formation. ‘Missing Man’ formation is flown to honour a deceased comrade in arms celebrating the spirit of an eternal warrior. 

Earlier on 17th September 2017, the mortal remains of the MIAF were taken to his residence in New Delhi, where he lay ‘in state’ for people to pay their homage. President Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman and many dignitaries including the three Service Chiefs paid glowing tributes to the departed soul. 

As the last post was sounded by the bugle at Brar Square it marked the end of a glorious era of the Indian Air Force.

          The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been experiencing heavy rains and resultant rough/very rough seas since 13 Sep 17. On 17 Sep, a message was received from Civil Administration that due to a defect in the hull, the return trip for tourists from Havelock by civil ferry MAKRUZZ had been cancelled. It was also intimated that a number of passengers, who had their flights scheduled for the morning of 18 Sep, were stranded and required to be brought to Port Blair. As the Civil ferries do not ply at night to Havelock, Andaman and Nicobar Command had been approached for ferrying the stranded tourists.

            Two ships of the Naval Component, INS Bangaram and INS Battimalv (Fast Attack Craft class) were sailed for the mission despite torrential rains and very rough weather. 24 civilian tourists (10 ladies, 10 men and four children) were embarked onboard INS Bangaram at Havelock and ferried to Port Blair. Additionally, 54 Officers from Defence Services Staff College, who are on a visit to the islands and stranded due to cancellation of MAKRUZZ, were also embarked on the ships. Thus a total of 78 stranded personnel were ferried back to Port Blair on the two ships. In the traditional role of support to civil authorities, the tourists were given accommodation inside the ship as the sea state was very bad and were also served with refreshments.

            On arrival in Port Blair, at about 2230 hrs, the tourists were provided a Naval transport to their places of stay in Port Blair. The prompt action by the ANC and the help extended by the ships was highly appreciated by the stranded tourists.

Smartly turned out soldiers who are residents of the Cantonment were also present for the event in large numbers. The Defence Minister flagged off the new garbage collection vehicles provided to the Cantonment Board under the Swachh Bharat Mission. She also participated in the cleanliness drive organized in Gopinath Bazaar of the Cantonment area. The event then shifted to Srinagesh Garden where a painting and fancy dress competition in which children of the various Army and Cantonment Board schools displayed their creative best with respect to ensuring clean surroundings, hygiene and sanitation. 

The two hour programme amply highlighted the innovative measures being practiced in the Cantonment area by the Army and the Cantonment Board and the sincerity which is accorded to make this campaign a grand success,

                R&DE (Engrs), a premier system engineering laboratory under Armament & Combat Engineering (ACE) cluster of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has recently undertaken the design and development of Trawl System for the minefield area in the battle zone to meet the operational requirements of Indian Army.

The indigenous developed Trawl System is employed for breaching of land mines and creating a vehicle safe lane, through a minefield for the advancing columns of mechanized forces in combat zone. The equipment consists of Trawl roller, track width mine plough and electro- magnetic device (EMD), which caters to the need of all types of mines usually encountered by the battle tank in such a scenario. The Trawl System developed by DRDO is capable of breaching a variety of land mines including passive and active influence mines.

The Trawl system recently crossed a major milestone with the successful completion of blast trials in collaboration with HEMRL Pune, which demonstrated the survivability of the equipment, when subjected to successive series of blast directly underneath it. The fieldable prototype of the Trawl System is in final stage of realization and would be shortly ready for conduct of User Evaluation Trials by the Army.

The indigenous development of Trawls by DRDO is an important step towards achieving self-reliance in area of critical military equipment under ‘Make in India’ initiative and would result in saving of precious foreign exchange for the country.

                The final Development Flight Trials of Astra - Beyond Visual Range Air to Air Missile (BVRAAM) were successfully conducted over the Bay of Bengal, Off the Coast of Chandipur, Odisha during 11-14 Sep 2017. A total of seven trials were conducted against Pilotless Target Aircrafts (PTA) successfully.

The missions included engagement of target at very long range, engagement of high manoeuvring target at medium range and multiple launches of missiles in salvo to engage multiple targets. All the sub-systems including the indigenous RF Seeker performed accurately, meeting all the mission parameters and objectives. Two missiles were also launched in the combat configuration with warhead and the targets were neutralized.

This effort for building a state-of-the-art BVRAAM by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), together with Indian Air Force (IAF) has completed the development phase of the weapon system successfully. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has played a role in modifying the aircraft for weapon integration. More than 50 public and private industries have contributed in building the Astra weapon system. Dr S. Venugopal, Programme Director led the launch operations and flight trials along with the teams from multiple organisations.

The Defence Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman congratulated DRDO, IAF Air Force, Defence Public Sector Undertaking (DPSU) and industries for the successful trials of ASRTA Missile. Chairman DRDO and Secretary Department of Defence (R&D) Dr S. Christopher congratulated the ‘Team Astra” (DRDO, IAF, DPSU & Industries) for developing and flight testing such a formidable class of weapon system. Director General, Missiles and Strategic Systems Dr G. Satheesh Reddy, said the technologies developed under the programme will be the building blocks for development of more variants of Air-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles.

                While ‘Swachhta’ and ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ is being run all over the country, the Indian Army takes pride in environmental conservation being intrinsic to its character, ethos and traditions. Army troops deployed in remote areas of the nation have always taken keen interest in environmental conservation. As part of routine, the long range patrols covering snow bound, high altitude and treacherous areas of Himachal Pradesh, along the borders with China and Tibet make it a drill to clean the areas where they patrol. All expedition to these areas bring back non-biodegradable wastes and clean areas in the process.

The Indian Army covers the conservation drive in various verticals which include serving personnel, ex-serviceman, and initiatives within and outside the cantonments and in operational areas.

‘Shramdaan’ and clean the area in and around the place one works, is intrinsic into the character and routine activities of Indian Army personnel. Daily cleanliness drive is carried out by serving personnel on almost daily basis. The families and children join men in tree plantation, hygiene and sanitation awareness camps and cleanliness drives. Roll calls, Sainik Sammelans and briefings during everyday routine find this aspect being highlighted.

Ex-Servicemen are true ambassadors of such disciplined and holistic initiative. They on their part involve societies and civilian population with them to focus on fundamental issue of overall cleanliness, menace of open defecation and tree plantation. In most of our ESM camps and interactions steps are taken to facilitate them to achieve the same.

Cantonments are one of the cleanest places. All actions possible are taken within the cantonment to keep them clean. Other than the composite conservancy staff, additional manpower and equipment have been bought by stations and cantonments to clean their respective areas. Events like ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’, ‘Cleanliness Drives’, ‘Run for clean environment’, are a regular feature to bring in the awareness. All the schools run by the Army have a special focus on this very important aspect other than tree plantation.

All stations and cantonments have been working very closely with CEOs and Cantonment Boards to arrive at a robust cleanliness mechanism. Huge cantonments like Delhi, Lucknow, Ambala, Pathankot, Kolkata etc today can easily be nominated as the cleanest areas of the country. Biodegradable toilets, neat cubicle toilets have been established in almost all such stations and cantonments.  Efforts are on to ensure that there is no open defecation in any of the cantonments of Indian Army.

Even in operational areas while Indian Army is deployed at far flung places in mountains, deserts or in other treacherous areas, the brave soldiers make genuine endeavour to clean the areas wherever it is. They involve local population and enmass create campaign for cleanliness and awareness. The patrols which go out to snow bound high altitude areas in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and in border areas of Tibet and China clean the areas where they patrol. The Indian Army does not leave any stone unturned to ensure that their areas are clean, hygienic and worthy to live in.

Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Hon’ble Raksha Mantri flagged-off Indian Naval Sailing Vessel Tarini (INSV Tarini) with an all women crew from INS Mandovi boat pool, Goa at 01:00 PM today (10 Sep17). This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew and shall attempt to circumnavigate the globe on Indian Navy’s sailing vessel INSV Tarini. The crew is expected to return to Goa in April 2018, on completion of the voyage. The expedition will be covered in five legs, with stop-overs at 4 ports viz. Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), and Cape Town (South Africa). 

The event was attended by Shri Manohar Parrikar, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Goa, Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral AR Karve Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command, Vice Admiral R Hari Kumar, Controller Personnel Services, IHQ MoD (Navy) besides other senior naval retired and serving officials as well as civilian dignitaries including family members of the crew and sailing enthusiasts. 

During the ceremony at Goa, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri said that, “this is a historic day for the country, which will be marked in the Navigation history of the world, and globally our women are going to stand out for something which most navies of the world would not have even thought of”. She further said that, “For this initiative I appreciate the Indian Navy and the mentors for inspiring, motivating and training these brave and courageous women”. She expressed her absolute pleasure for being present at the momentous occasion and felt honoured to be amongst the crew and wished them a successful voyage. 

The Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba expressed satisfaction at continuation of the legacy of Indian Navy’s Ocean sailing expeditions which commenced in 1988 with expedition ‘Samudra’. This was followed by first solo circumnavigation by Captain Dilip Donde (Retd) and non-stop circumnavigation of the globe by Cdr Abhilash Tomy resulting in India joining a select group of nine nations which have achieved such feats. He said that the present circumnavigation by an all women crew is an extension of the above efforts and reflection of the Government’s efforts at Women Empowerment – “Nari Shakti”. 

INSV Tarini is a 55-foot sailing vessel, which has been built indigenously, and was inducted in the Indian Navy earlier this year, thus showcasing the ‘Make in India’ initiative on the World forum. INSV Tarini is being skippered by Lt. Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprises Lt. Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta. 

During the voyage, the crew would monitor and report marine pollution on the high seas, as also interact extensively with local PIOs during various port halts to promote Ocean sailing. 

During their voyage, the crew would also collate and update Meteorological/ Ocean/ Wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and subsequent analysis by research and development organisations. 

The expedition titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’, is in consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. It also aims to help discard the societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of their participation in challenging environment. 

Sailing encourages the use of environment friendly non-conventional renewable energy resources and this expedition therefore aims at harnessing the renewable energy.

                India’s indigenously developed 3rd generation Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), Nag has been successfully flight tested twice by DRDO on 8-9-2017 against two different targets in the ranges of Rajasthan.

The ATGM Nag missile has successfully hit both the targets under different ranges and conditions with very high accuracy as desired by the Armed Forces.

With these two successful flight trials, and the flight test conducted earlier in June in the peak of summer, the complete functionality of Nag ATGM along with launcher system NAMICA has been established and marked the successful completion of development trials of Nag Missile.

                In pursuant of the India’s ‘Act East Policy’, two Indian Naval Ships proceeded on deployment to East and South-East Asia this year. INS Satpura and INS Kadmatt departed Visakhapatnam today to visit 12 ports in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Brunei and Russia. The two ships will be deployed for more than 3 months away from home port. 

During this deployment, the ships will participate in the International Fleet Review hosted by the Association of South East Asian Countries (ASEAN) at Thailand. They will visit Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia and Brunei to commemorate the 25th anniversary of India-ASEAN dialogue. The ships will also participate in the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) exercise at Malaysia. At Russia, the ships will participate in the annual India-Russia bilateral exercise INDRA. This year, for the first time, Ex-INDRA will witness the joint participation of Army, Navy and Air Force of both countries, thus, a major milestone in the bilateral relations between the two countries. 

The Indian Navy routinely undertakes deployment of ships to friendly nations. The visit of Indian Naval Ships to East and South-East Asia underscores India’s peaceful presence and harmonious relations with the countries in the region. The deployment aims to strengthen existing bonds between India and the regional countries. Besides making port calls, the visit of ships will help in people-to-people interactions, meetings between Indian Naval delegations with local dignitaries, and naval exercises to share best practices at sea and enhance interoperability. 

India had made great strides in field of warship design and construction. INS Satpura and INS Kadmatt are both indigenously built warships. INS Satpura, synonymous with the formidable mountain range in Central India, is a multi-role stealth frigate and is commanded by Captain Rahul Shankar. INS Kadmatt, named after an island in the beautiful Lakshadweep chain, is an Anti-Submarine Corvette and is commanded by Commander Nithin Cariappa.

                As part of the ongoing Indo-US defence cooperation, a joint military training, Exercise Yudh Abhyas - 2017 is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington, USA from 14 to 27 September 17. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is one of the largest joint running military training and defence corporation endeavors between India and USA. This will be the 13th edition of the joint exercise hosted alternately between the two countries.

Exercise Yudh Abhyas will provide an opportunity to the armed forces of both countries to train in an integrated manner at Battalion level with joint planning at Brigade level. Multiple scenarios will be rehearsed during the joint exercise with a view to understand each-other’s organisational structure and battle procedures which would result in a higher degree of jointmanship that would further facilitate interoperability between the armed forces of both countries to meet any unforeseen contingency across the globe. The exercise is also an ideal platform to learn from each-other’s experiences of planning and execution of operations.

Both armies will jointly train, plan and execute a series of well-developed operations for neutralisation of threats of varied nature. In the end a joint exercise will be undertaken by both countries in an operational setting under a UN mandate. Experts from both sides will also hold expert academic and military discussions to share each other’s experiences on varied topics for mutual benefit.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh held discussion on the various options, opportunities and possibilities of investment in Northeast with a delegation of the ""Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India"" (ASSOCHAM) led by its national team of office bearers, who called on him here yesterday. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Ministry for Development of Northeast (DoNER) is encouraging investments, both through the Government agencies as well as private parties. In this regard, he cited the example of huge collaboration with the Government of Japan, which is planning a heavy investment in the region as well as Singapore which has offered to set up a Skill Center in Assam. In addition, he disclosed that a number of India-based leading industrial and trade houses have also stepped in to make investments in different States including Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur. 

The ASSOCHAM, being a leading representative body of India’s trade and business industry, Dr Jitendra Singh said, can take the lead in spreading awareness about the avenues available and also act as a bridge between the Government and the private industry to facilitate the PPP model in trade promotion. The handicraft, herbal and medicinal plant entrepreneurship has already attracted some of the leading business houses across India to set up their establishments in Northeast, he said and added that ASSOCHAM can perform the role of a catalyst as well as a bridge to fill up the missing gaps. 

The fast-track thrust by the Union Government in the last 3 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, has resulted in a sea-change by improving the connectivity scenario, both in air, rail and road connectivity, and this is bound to overcome many of the earlier constraints faced by the potential entrepreneurs. With the Union Government's emphasis on “Act East” policy, he said, this is a great opportunity to explore the new possibilities of growth production for international trade in the region. 

Citing a number of recent initiatives like, for example, North East Industrial Promotion Policy (NEIPP), Venture fund for Start-Ups, revival of NERAMAC etc., Dr Jitendra Singh said, the 8 States of North Eastern region are now ready to uplift themselves at par with the more developed States of India and the respective Governments in these different States are also highly motivated by the priority and focus shown by the Central Government. 

The members of ASSOCHAM delegation assured Dr Jitendra Singh of full cooperation and said that in very near future, they are planning a number of events focusing on investment opportunities in the Northeast.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the North-Eastern States can show the way to other States and particularly the other hill States of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand can emulate several of the successful experiments and initiatives taken in the Northeast.

Addressing the 3-day ""Sustainable Mountain Development Summit"" at Mizoram University in Aizawl yesterday, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the other States of India have much to learn from the North-Eastern States and in this regard, he cited the example of Mizoram, where the conference was being held. He said, a small State, which formed just over 30 years ago and has a population of just over 10 lakh, has a very high literacy rate which is, perhaps, next only to Kerala. Not only this, he said, the State of Mizoram, comprising four hill districts with more than 50% of the state’s population living in these districts, has successfully introduced ""New Land Use Policy"" by giving the farmers an alternate sustainable land based activity through this policy wherein the farmers have successfully switched over to other vocational activities like horticulture, sericulture, bamboo plantation, etc. He also complimented Mizoram for having introduced the new ""Economic Development Policy"" as a comprehensive growth strategy for the State.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the proposal for introducing ""Air Clinics"" comprising helicopter based OPD to cater to people in far-flung areas is almost through and very soon this, first of its kind, healthcare experiment in India, will be introduced in the North-Eastern States. He further said that this is one of the initiatives which could also be emulated by States like Jammu & Kashmir.

In the last three years of the Union Government, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a number of new initiatives have been undertaken which could have actually been undertaken several years ago. In this regard, he referred to the declaration of 19 new rivers in Northeast as ""National Waterways"" with thrust on the ""Barak Waterways"". This will not only provide alternative means of transport but the cost will be nearly four times lesser than the other modes of transport, he said.

The Indo-German collaboration with regard to Mizoram has already begun, disclosed Dr Jitendra Singh and added that Japan has also come forward to invest in Manipur and other States of the region.

                The Government of Singapore will set up a Skill Center at Guwahati which will cater to the entire North-Eastern region. This was stated here by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh after a meeting with a high-level delegation represented by the High Commissioner of Singapore, Mr Lim Thuan Kuan here yesterday. The Indian side led by Dr Jitendra Singh, consisted of senior officers from the Ministry of DoNER, Department of Space and Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, which are the three main areas where Singapore has expressed its keenness to collaborate with India. 

As far as Skill Centre at Guwahati, it was stated that an MoU has already been formalized between Singapore and the State Government of Assam. As a follow-up to this, a Skill Center is proposed to be set up at Guwahati by the year 2019 and the Ministry of DoNER will coordinate in this initiative. 

The Singapore delegation also expressed its preference to engage with India in the area of Space Technology for collaboration in “peaceful uses of Outer Space”. To this, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the issue will be followed up in an appropriate manner. 

The Singapore delegation also wanted to seek the experience and expertise of India's Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions to bring about value addition in public administration and governance in Singapore. Dr Jitendra Singh shared with them that there already exists an arrangement between Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) Mussoorie with Singapore, wherein a certain number of passing out Civil Services/IAS officers, accompanied by two faculty members, regularly undertake a visit to Singapore. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, India and Singapore have always been favourably inclined towards each other and referred to the recent visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore when a stimulating lecture by him was organized under the auspices of the NITI Aayog.

Dr Jitendra Singh informed Shri Khandu that his request regarding deputation of certain IAS officers in the State had been processed as desired and the needful would be done very soon. 

Referring to the recent visit by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to assess the flood situation in Arunachal Pradesh and other affected States, Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that Rs.10,000 crore flood relief package announced by the Prime Minister is an indication of the Central Government’s concern and high priority for the people of the region. He also disclosed that the Ministry of DoNER is sponsoring a research study through Brahmaputra Study Centre at Guwahati University to evaluate the ways of preventing such flood-like situation in future. The Chief Minister informed him that the flood situation has now almost come back to normal and the follow-up action has also been carried out effectively. 

In reference to some of the major projects in Northeast during the last three years, Dr Jitendra Singh mentioned about the new State Secretariat Building at Itanagar, which had been funded by the Ministry of DoNER. He also expressed the hope that the construction work will start soon to set up a Film and Television Institute in the State. 

Dr Jitendra Singh expressed satisfaction that the land identification and acquisition process for setting up an Airport at Itanagar has been finalized even though after some delay. He said, the major achievements of three years of the Central Government will include the setting up of the first-ever airport in the State and also at the same time, bringing Arunachal Pradesh on the rail-map of India. Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Ministry of DoNER is coordinating with the other concerned Ministries for promotion of tourism and entrepreneurship through fruit industry, etc. 

Shri Pema Khandu appreciated Dr Jitendra Singh for his keen personal interest in the development of the region and said, Arunachal Pradesh, being one of the peripheral and lesser developed States, finds itself immensely benefitted because of the liberal support from the Prime Minister and diligent efforts of the DoNER Minister.

He said that during each given fortnight, at least eight Union Ministers from New Delhi visit Northeast which means that one Minister each is available in each of the eight States every 15 days. This helps them to make an assessment of the development works related to their Ministries and also enables them to gain first-hand inputs from the local population there, he added. He said that ‘Purbashree’ stalls have been set up at Dilli Haat for the products of North East region. He also said that the rail and air connectivity is also on the focus of the Government.

(1.32 acre) at Sector-13, Dwarka, New Delhi, to North Eastern Council (NEC) for the purpose of construction of this Centre. He also talked about setting up of “Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Centre for Policy Research & Analysis” at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Shillong and Brahmaputra Study Centre in the Guwahati University.

Continuing the trend of celebrity support to this campaign Malayalam superstar Mammootty has accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi invitation to participate in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.

The campaign also saw endorsement from faith leaders. In a special event, hundreds of volunteers came together to participate in a swachhata drive from Laxman Jhula to Ram Jhula in Rishikesh. Organised by members of Parmarth Niketan, Rishikesh’s largest ashram, the event also saw participation of Swachh Bharat Mission officials as well as foreign visitors from more than 10 countries.

Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand have launched several “Swachhta Hi Seva Rath” reaching the unreached areas and spreading the message about the safe toilet technology, health and hygiene amongst community.

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu, today inaugurated the “Swachhta Hi Seva” and “Shouchalayakkagi Samara” (A Crusade For Toilets) Programme in Karnataka. He was presiding as the Chief Guest over a public event at Hubli.

The Vice President later visited Konnur Village, in Naragund Taluk, Gadag District, where he initiatied the activity of ‘Tippe Samskarane’ (Waste Processing). He also inaugurated a “Shudda Kudiyuva Neerina Ghataka” (Purified Drinking Water Plant), visited the Janata Colony in the village, and addressed a “Shouchalayakkagi Samara” public gathering at the local high school.

Speaking on the occasion, the Vice President emphasized the need for Swachhata to become a jan aandolan. He complimented the taluka, district and State for the good progress made by them. He urged all present to participate in Swachhata activities and said that Swachh Bharat Mission is a national program, a people's program, and not one of any particular political party. He gave several examples of ordinary people making extraordinary contributions, including Ms Lavanya, a young girl from Karnataka who persuaded her unwilling family to build a toilet and then went on to inspire her entire village. The Vice President appreciated the fact that many young women are now demanding toilets before they get married into another family.

On the occasion, the Vice President also honoured 13 Village Panchayat Presidents and the Naragund Taluka Panchayat President, the achievers of “Shouchalayakkagi Samara”. He also declared the rural areas of Naragund Taluk as an ODF block.

Shri Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, the Governor of Karnataka, began his address by thanking the Vice President for starting the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign from Karnataka. He also emphasized the importance of caring for one another, as enshrined in the slogan of the government, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. He said that to care for others, we need to start by taking the initiative ourselves in the direction of a Swachh Bharat.

Shri Ramesh Jigajinagi, the Minister of State, Drinking Water and Sanitation, congratulated the State government on the occasion and re-emphasized the importance of the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign. He reiterated the fact that the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in his recent visit to Uttar Pradesh, had appreciated the naming of a toilet as “Izzat Ghar”.

Shri H.K. Patil, Karnataka Minister for Rural development and Panchayati Raj, gave a snapshot of the progress being made by the State under the Swachh Bharat Mission and said that both, the State and the nation, were moving at a good pace towards becoming clean and free from open defecation.

In his welcome address at the gathering, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, shared a nationwide progress update on Swachh Bharat Mission and appreciated the good progress being made by the Government of Karnataka in meeting the goals of the Mission.

Shri P.C. Gaddigoudar, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, and Shri B.R. Yavagal, MLA, Naragund, were also present on the occasion.

                The nation wide Swachhata Hi Seva campaign is now entering its second week. The inaugural week saw a wave of cleanliness activities across the country.

In Chennai to keep the city ‘clean and green’, a battery of Judges from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court joined hands with public, students, officials of the district administration, city corporation, police, Public Works and Income Tax departments in a massive cleaning drive along the Vaigai river.

In Maharashtra 430 GPs have been declared ODF and over 58 thousand toilets have been constructed since September 15th. In what can be described as an act of deep commitment, world famous sand artist, Mr Sudarshan Pattnaik, used his award money to construct two toilets for fisherman in Puri, Odisha after receiving a personal letter from the Hon’ble Prime Minister to engage with the cause of swachhata. A young girl from Bihar created a song on Swachhata which is drawing significant attention and accolades. In Jharkhand swachhata sentiment was spread to educational institutions by appealing to the universities to clean their campuses.

The week also saw significant newspaper articles on swachhata from opinion leaders across industries and sectors. Media also played a supportive role through channels like DD Sahayadri which started a special series on ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ to be broadcast everyday till 2nd October.

Over 100 journalists, development agencies and community workers attended a National Media Consultation on the Swachh Bharat Mission in the Capital. The Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, presided over the consultation. In his opening remarks, Shri Iyer shared details of the nation-wide mass mobilization drive, “Swachhata Hi Seva”, which follows an impassioned call by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, ahead of the 3rd anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission that falls on 2nd October. He said that the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign is seeing large scale mobilization of people from all walks of life to undertake shramdaan for cleanliness and construction of toilets, and cleaning up of public and tourist places. The participation has already begun in full swing, and has ranged from the President of India to the common citizen, involving Union Ministers, Governors, Chief Ministers, legislators, celebrities, faith leaders, and corporate leaders spearheading the campaign in their respective areas of influence. He particularly appreciated the tremendous efforts being made by school children, central police services and defence personnel. 

The Secretary also shared a snapshot of the progress made by the Swachh Bharat Mission so far, mentioning that 5 States, nearly 200 districts and nearly 2.4 lakh villages across the country have already declared themselves as Open Defecation Free. 1.5 lakh villages have ranked themselves on the Village Swachhta Index based on the solid and liquid waste management in the villages. He also quoted an independent survey conducted across 140,000 households by the Quality Council of India, which found household toilet usage to be 91%. He concluded by calling upon the media to spread the message of sanitation and cleanliness during the fortnight and beyond. 

Mr Nicolas Osbert, Chief, WASH, UNICEF India, in his welcome address, spoke about the impact of lack of sanitation on the health and growth of small children. He said that it was heartening to note that, with the Swachh Bharat Mission and the personal leadership of India’s Prime Minister himself, concrete action is happening on the ground with respect to changing old habits through genuine focus on behavior change. 

He also shared with the media present, the results of an independent survey conducted by UNICEF across 10000 households in 12 States of the country, to measure the economic impact of sanitation at a household level. He said the survey found that, in fully ODF communities, considering the medical costs averted, value of mortality averted, and the value of time savings, an average family that invests in a toilet will save Rs 50,000 per year. The cost-benefit ratio of a household found in the study was 430% in fully ODF communities. This meant that a single rupee invested in sanitation, allows a family to save Rs 4.30. He added that these benefits are the highest for the poorest quintile of the population in a community, which was encouraging as it established that improved sanitation helps the poorest of the poor the most. 

Swachh Bharat Champions from the grassroots, Ms. Madhu Chauhan (Sarpanch, Bijnor district, Uttar Pradesh), Shri Rajneesh Sharma (Primary School Principal, Meerut district, Uttar Pradesh), and Ms. Deepa Joshi (ANM supervisor, US Nagar, Uttarakahand), also shared their experiences with the media on the occasion.

                A volunteer group in Delhi called We Mean To Clean planted 600 ecologically valuable trees in Delhi. Earlier they transformed a slum in Kirti Nagar, Delhi. Swachhata Hi Seva is fast becoming a movement that the people themselves are running. Many such organisations run by common people is the feature of the overall Swachh Bharat programme – citizens becoming inspiring leaders, owning the movement and run it. 

Enthusiastic cleanliness initiatives among the people have become a feature ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat initiative. Lending further impetus towards a cleaner India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to the nation during his recent Mann Ki Baat address to dedicate the last few weeks of September towards Swachhata Hi Seva, an initiative to pay a real tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on Gandhi Jayanti. 

On the 15th of September, 2017, President Ram Nath Kovind had launched the Swachhata Hi Seva movement in Uttar Pradesh from a village in Kanpur. Ever since, the movement started it had begun to generate action and positivity. However, with the birthday of Prime Minister Modi on September 17th, it has taken off at a higher trajectory. 

Cleanliness volunteers, NGOs and many karyakartas have enthusiastically dedicated themselves to Shramdaan towards cleanliness initiatives to celebrate his birthday as a ‘Seva Divas’. 

It also came to light that the Prime Minister had written touching personal letters inviting people from across the nation and across domains, to participate in the movement and spread the message of cleanliness. Accomplished Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor took to social media to thank PM Modi for honouring him with an invite to participate in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement and assured he would do his best. Reports said the PM had written to Malayalam superstar Mohanlal inviting him to participate in the movement. K T Rama Rao, young politician from Telangana belonging to the TRS party also received a letter from PM Modi, reports said. 

Most ministries, government departments and prominent public servants have been carrying out cleanliness activities in every state across the nation. While Vice President Venkaiah Naidu was seen administering Swachhata Hi Seva pledges to citizens, Governor of Rajasthan, Kalyan Singh was seen picking up the broom by himself to clean his office. 

While it was natural for government machinery to take up cleanliness activities for Swachhata Hi Seva, well-known citizens too have ardently joined the movement. In Maharashtra, music director Anu Malik was seen cleaning a place along with a number of citizens. Telugu movie superstar couple Nagarjuna and Amala along with citizen volunteers conducted cleanliness activities in Hyderabad. Actor Ravi Kishan led cleanliness initiatives in Mumbai. Internationally renowned sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik first led a group of citizens in cleaning up the Puri beach in Odisha and then created a sand art wishing PM Modi on his birthday. 

From Kargil to Ramanathapuram, Manipur to Maharashtra, a renewed sense of eagerness was seen for cleanliness. While the cleanliness movement was kicked off in Kargil with great energy, the District Collector and municipal officials participated in cleanliness activities. Apart from the sheer geographic spread of the movement in just 2 days, yet again, just like its mothership Swachh Bharat, citizens became engines for the movement. NCC cadets of girls’ wings of Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district cleaned the offices and several areas of the Poonch district. The cadets also took out an awareness rally with a message of clean India. Volunteers conducted cleaning activities in Indore. In Puducherry, a cleanliness drive to clean the beach was organised by NSS volunteers and Karaikal Municipality. 

Citizens were seen cleaning the Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station in Delhi. Heroes from the Navy cleaned up the South Mumbai mangroves and sea front. On the occasion of International Coastal Cleanup day, citizens groups also removed trash and garbage from Mumbai’s beaches. Women from Self Help Groups in Agra took Swachhata Shapath and discussed initiatives towards a clean and green India. In many places across the nation, Shramdaan and sanitation drives were held, besides activities around open defecation-vulnerable spots with participation of community, self-help groups and local NGOs. 

On social media too, #SwachhataHiSeva was a top trend on the day it was launched. Subsequently, the hashtag has become a hub of positivity where people have posted their Shramdaan activities towards cleanliness using this hashtag. A heightened sense of awareness and participation has ensued since the launch of the movement on social media. 

Finally, two happenings showed positive signs for the future of a clean India. 

One, that NTPC has invited national and international players to set up 100 waste-to-energy pollution-free plants across the country under the Swachh Bharat mission. This bodes well for a clean and green India. 

Two, the future of clean India seems to be in safe hands. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation had announced a Swachh Bharat painting competition for primary school students from mainly government schools earlier. A total of 2.46 crore children studying in class 1-5 have submitted their entries for the Swachh Sankalp Swachh Siddhi painting competition. The enormous magnitude of participation and the awareness being created in these children towards cleanliness augurs well.

                The President Shri Ram Nath Kovind today launched the nationwide jan aandolan, Swachhta Hi Seva, from Iswarigunj, a village in Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. With this the whole country swings in to mass Shramdaan for toilet making and cleaning of public places for next two weeks. 

“Swachhta Hi Seva” Campaign is an unprecedented campaign to highlight, once again, the jan aandolan that is the Swachh Bharat Mission. This follows an impassioned call by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, ahead of the 3rd anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission that falls on 2nd October, 2017. The objective of the campaign is to mobilise people between 15th September and 2nd October, reigniting the “jan aandolan” for sanitation. Union Ministers, MLAs, MPs, iconic celebrities of India, sports stars, inter-faith leaders, corporates, etc. have been appealed to join in this campaign towards swachhta. 

The President administered the nation-wide “Swachhta Hi Seva” pledge in Kanpur, which simultaneously initiated parallel action in all Gram Panchayats and cities of the country. He honoured village level champions from Uttar Pradesh who have contributed to making various villages, including Iswarigunj, open defecation free. The President also launched the Solid and Liquid Waste Management activities in the village which is the next major step in Swachhta after getting the villages Open Defecation Free. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that every citizen who works for Swachhta is a rashtr-nirmata (nation builder). He called upon all citizens to join the Swachhta Hi Seva movement and become a rashtra-nirmata. He congratulated all award winning Swachhta champions present and said that they were the real heroes of this jan aandolan. He quoted a World Bank study that says that lack of Sanitation costs the country 6% of GDP annually, adding that the weakest sections of society are the ones most affected by this problem. He spoke about diseases transmitted by open defecation, concerns around dignity and safety of women, and economic loss to the family. 

He called upon people from all sectors - elected representatives, corporates, NGOs, women, children, senior citizens, Panchayati Raj institutions, media and the youth - to come forward and contribute to the Swachh Bharat movement with vigour and enthusiasm. 

In his address, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, welcomed the President back to his native village and said that Swachh Bharat, when it was first launched by the Prime Minister, had seemed like an impossible goal. He said, that Swachh Bharat is a critical component of the development of the country, and reaffirmed his government's commitment to achieve an Open Defecation Free (ODF) Uttar Pradesh by October 2018. He said that such an ambitious goal cannot be achieved without people's participation and partnership. For this, he mentioned that he is reaching out to grassroots leaders and elected representatives personally to involve all sections of society in this movement. He announced that Shamli, Bijnor, Hapur and Ghaziabad have already been declared ODF, and that 30 districts will be declared ODF in the State by December 2017. 

Sushri Uma Bharti, Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, in her address, said that she felt great pride that the President's first public appearance after taking office was for the launch of the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign. She spoke about the crucial role of public participation in making Swachh Bharat a reality. She said that Swachhta was both, a right and responsibility, of each and every citizen of the country, and that this was fundamental to the realization of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's vision of Swachh Bharat. 

The occasion was also marked by experience sharing by 7 persons representing various sectors of society, who have been involved in supporting the Swachh Bharat Mission. These were Ms Anuradha Joshi Sarpanch, Kodariya, Indore; Ms Lavanya, school student, Karnataka; Mr Banzop Kharrymbal, Sarpanch, Mawlynong (cleanest village in Asia), Meghalaya; Mr Bindeshwar Pathak, Founder, Sulabh International; Ms Naina Lal Kidwai, Chairperson, India Sanitation Coalition; Mr Sanjay Gupta, Executive Editor, Dainik Jagran, Kanpur and Cadet Mansi Dwivedi, 17 UP Girls Battalion, NCC. They each represented different sections of society and took the Swachhta pledge symbolically on behalf of their respective sectors. They also made short addresses at the occasion, highlighting the work done by them in the past, and their Swachhta commitments for the upcoming fortnight and beyond. 

In his welcome address at the inauguration, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer spoke about the clarion call made by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, for every section of society and each and every citizen to contribute to the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign. He also gave a progress update of Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin and Urban, saying that Sanitation coverage in the country has gone up from 39% to 68% since the launch of the Mission. 

This launch kicked off the nationwide campaign to mobilise people to do large scale shramdaan. 

Shri Murli Manohar Joshi, Member of Parliament, Kanpur constituency, Governor, Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, and Minister of Panchayati Raj department, Uttar Pradesh, Shri Bhupendra Singh, were also present on the occasion.

An award ceremony based on ‘SWACHHTA’ Ranking 2017 of Higher Educational Institutions was held in New Delhi today. Union Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekargave away the prizes to the awardees.

Shri Prakash Javadekar congratulated the awardees of ‘SWACHHTA’ Ranking- 2017 of Higher Educational Institutions. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is the most significant cleanliness campaign by the Government of India. Under this mission more than four crore and eighty lakhs toilets were constructed in India since 2nd October, 2014 and more than two lakhs villages are now open defecation free.

The Minister said the students are cleanliness ambassadors and along with the support of people and institutions they will lead the vision of Clean India of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He also said to make Higher Educational Institutions a smart campus, we should focus on cleanliness as well as waste management. Save water, save electricity, promote cleanliness and manage waste to become smart campus.Shri Javadekar praised the efforts made by the various departments of Ministry of HRD for organising such ranking system which is in line with Swachh Bharat Mission and contributing toward a cleaner India. He said, we should participate in these programmes to inform others too.

An exercise to rank Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) on the basis of cleanliness and hygiene has been undertaken and concluded. Parameters for a clean campus were formulated, like student/toilet ratio, kitchen hygiene, availability of running water, modernity of toilet &  kitchen equipment, campus green cover, garbage disposal in hostels and academic buildings, disposal techniques, water supply systems and also a certain weightage to whether the institutions has adopted any neighbouring locality or village to spread awareness & activities in Swachhta.

About 3500 HEIs responded to the online invitation, submitting all their details as per format. The top 174 institutions were shortlisted as per criteria and officials from UGC and AICTE inspected the premises of all 174 institutions. Finally, the top 25 institutions across various categories like Universities, Technical Institutions, Colleges and Government institutions were selected and they were awarded on the occasion. This exercise will help generate peer pressure amongst institutions in the all important area of cleanliness.

Clusters of villages have been adopted by certain HEIs under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyanprogramme in consultation with District Collectors. All Collectors and HEIs under the programme were invited to participate in the Best Collector & HEI Award by converting, before 31st August 2017, One Village into Open Defecation Free, with solid and liquid waste facility. Many participated in the exercise and finally, 5 districts completed the exercise – Medak, Jhabua, Warangal, Ajmer and Indore. The Collectors made presentations in MHRD on 5th September 2017 on their achievement. Those 5 Collectors along with the HEIs assisting them were awarded on the occasion.

Among the dignitaries Shri K.K Sharma Secretary, Department of Higher Education, ShriV.L.V.S.S. Subba Rao, Economic Advisor MHRD, Sh. Anil D. Sahasrabudhe , Chairman AICTE, Dr. V.S. Chauhan ,Chairman UGC, Dr. Manpreet Singh Manna, Director AICTE were present on the occasion. Shri R. Subrahmanyam Additional Secretary (Technical Education) gave vote of thanks on the occasion.

                The National level function to celebrate 51st International Literacy Day was organised by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India in New Delhi today. Honorable Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu was the Chief Guest on this occasion. The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu also presented the Saakshar Bharat Awards – 2017 to the winners at state, district and panchayat level.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu congratulated the winners of Sakshar Bharat Awards – 2017 for their contribution in promoting literacy at grass root levels. He said that literacy can play an important role of empowering, transforming and improving quality of life of individuals as well as society. He said that the development has no meaning in democracy without literacy. He added that we have committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all nations at the United Nations in January 2016. The global agenda envisages a “world with universal literacy” and one of the targets set in the agenda, to be achieved by 2030, is specifically focused on youth and adult literacy.

 

Shri Naidu said we have a long way to go as nearly 35 crore youth and adults are outside the literate world. The Vice President suggested ways to achieve universal literacy; firstly to improve the quality of pre-primary and school education; secondly, we must provide opportunities for learning to those who have never been to school or have dropped out of school. He also congratulated Human Resource Development Ministry for taking various successful initiatives to promote quality education and literacy in the country.

 

On the occasion Shri Prakash Javadekar told that literacy rate from 18% in 1947 has now reached to 81% approximately till date. He said that we should identify the potential children who are not going to school and must get them enrolled in schools. Also every literate person in the family must educate other illiterate persons of the family. The minister assured that next year government will start ‘School Chalo Abhiyan programme. These efforts will help overcoming the remaining 19 % illiteracy and we will be able to achieve 100 % literacy and 100% digital literacy by 2022 which is a dream of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

 

Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha said that the time has come when the last man in the line has understood the importance of education in our life and even an underprivileged person wants his child to be educated and literate. He assured that the ministry is making efforts to achieve 100 % literacy in our country. He also said presently apart from functional literacy we are also focusing on various other kinds of literacy like Financial literacy, Digital literacy etc.

 

Addressing on the occasion Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh said it is the responsibility of the government to provide schools, colleges, teachers and infrastructure to ensure quality education but it is the responsibility of the parents to send their children to schools. He requested to follow our ancient education system in which the aim of education were to provide good training of skills to the students and to enrich their knowledge, character and personality for overall development.

 

Smt Rina Ray, Special Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy gave vote of thanks on the occasion.

 

Among the dignitaries Shri Anil Swarup, Secretary (Department of School Education & Literacy), Mr. Shigeru Aoyagi, Director, UNESCO, New Delhi were present on the occasion.

 

The message of Ms. Irina Bokova, Director – General, UNESCO was circulated on the occasion. In the message she said that the International Literacy Day offers a moment to review the progress and come together to tackle the challenges ahead. She highlighted that the digitally-mediated knowledge societies are changing what it means to be literate, calling for new and higher-level literacy skills. Therefore, this year, the event is devoted to better understanding the type of literacy required in a digital world to build more inclusive, equitable and sustainable societies.

 

Saakshar Bharat Awards were instituted to encourage a healthy competition for better performance among the programme implementing and support agencies. The Awards also recognize the achievements and invaluable contributions of functionaries and volunteers in the field of adult education and skill development. Each Award carries a trophy and a certificate. A total of 11 Saakshar Bharat Awards were given this year.

The 51st International Literacy Day is being celebrated on 8th September, 2017 at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi and the theme announced by UNESCO is `Literacy in a digital world’. The programme would include; felicitation to the dignitaries, distribution of Saakshar Bharat Awards to the best performing States, Districts, Gram Panchayats and NGOs.

 

The International Literacy Day is celebrated on 8th September every year throughout the world.  On this day, in the year 1965 the World Congress of Ministers of Education met in Tehran for the first time to discuss the programme of education at the international level.  The UNESCO in its 14th Session in November, 1966, declared 8th September as the International Literacy Day.  Since then, ILD is celebrated on 8th September every year by most of the member countries. The key aspect of the observance of ILD is to mobilize public opinion in favour of struggle against illiteracy. ILD is a forum to disseminate information on literacy and raise the public awareness and the significance of literacy for individual and national development.

The National Literacy Mission Authority started celebrating International Literacy Day every year from 1988 onwards.  The   eradication of illiteracy has been one of the major national concerns of the Govt. of India since independence. The occasion of ILD is used for raising public awareness to eradicate illiteracy and create environment in favour of adult education programmes.

From 1996 onwards some new elements were introduced to make the programme more attractive. In the year 1996 a ‘Mashal March’ was organized involving school students and literacy functionaries. In subsequent years, variety of activities were included as a part of ILD celebration which includes: Competitions (Rangoli, Drawing etc) for the literacy functionaries at the State level by SLMAs, Exhibition of JSS products (KRITI), International Conferences, Seminars, Cultural Progrmmes etc.

                In his Independence Day address to the nation on 15th August, 2014 Hon’ble Prime Minister called upon that all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls. Only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools mid way…

The Department has taken new initiative for furtherance of Swachh Vidyalaya Campaign and instituted Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar in 2016-17 to recognize, inspire and celebrate excellence in water, sanitation and hygiene practices in schools. Swachhta in schools plays a significant role in determining the health of children, attendance, dropout rate, and learning outcomes. For the first time, government schools have been ranked on the basis of Swachhta on various criteria viz. Water, Sanitation, Hand washing with soap, Operations and Maintenance, Behaviour Change and Capacity Building.

35 States and UTs participated in this Puraskar, at District and State levels, in an online mode. Thereafter, these were evaluated and awarded at district and state levels. Out of 643 schools shortlisted by the states, 172 schools have been selected for the National awards for Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2016-17.

In the national award ceremony held at Dr S. Radhakrishnan Auditorium, Delhi Cantt. HRD Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar gave away the prizes to the national awardees. Shri Upendra Kushwaha, Minister of State (HRD) also graced the occasion.

While addressing on the occasion Shri Upendra Kushwaha said that we have to take the cause of Clean India Campaign in the mission mode and we should set the target to achieve it. He stressed to take ‘Sankalp se Siddhi’ pledge to make our country clean and beautiful. He added that these awards given by the ministry are in line with Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Mission. He asked teachers and parents to teach students about cleanliness and regularly monitor them too.

Shri Prakash Javadekar congratulated the winners of Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2017-18 and also told that next year this competition will be open to private schools also. This year 2, 68,402 schools from both central and state governments participated voluntarily in the competition which is in itself an achievement and a beginning of ‘New India’. Speaking on the occasion the Minister said that the students are ‘cleanliness ambassadors’ and they will lead the vision of Clean India of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He added that it is the need of the hour to change our mindsets and inculcate the habit of cleanliness everywhere in the country. He also thanked CSR partners, panchayats and various other organizations for their contribution in furthering the cause.

The schools were given an award of Rs. 50,000/- each as additional school grant, to be utilized for swachhta related activities, which was digitally transferred to them, along with a Certificate. School principals/teachers and students from the schools collected the awards. Besides, awards to 11 districts with highest participation for the National Level Awards for Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2016-17 were given to concerned District Collectors/District Education Officers. Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan who have been declared top three States with maximum number of schools in Five Star and Four Star ratings (green & blue category) were given a Certificate of Recognition. The best practices in sanitation and maintaining Swachhta in schools by states were also shared on this occasion. UNICEF and ASCI were the technical and knowledge partners with Department of School Education and Literacy in this endeavour.

The Department also released Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Swachhta in schools and started registration for Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2017-18 from 1st September, which coincides with the commencement of Swachhata Pakhwada for the Ministry. The registration for Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2017-18 closes on 31st October and is open to government, government aided and private schools as well.

 Speaking at a conclave on ‘Financial Inclusion’ organized by the United Nations, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Electronics & Information Technology and law & Justice said, “Digital inclusion is the foundation of financial inclusion. We have certain fundamental approach for commitment as far as digital platform is concerned. The first and foremost is, we want to become the leaders in the field digital revolution in the world. Second important attribute of our initiative is, we simply don’t want to digitize India, but we want to create a technology that is transformative, which will empower India, and also empowers Indians.”

 

“This is the age of information, and information is power. This is the age of technology, and technology is power; and this technology must empower India. We also want to create a digital ecosystem, which leads to digital inclusion. Digital India is more for poor and underprivileged. WE are undertaking a lot of transformative initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, Start-up India, Smart Cities, Skill India. These are all technology based programmes; digital inclusion must be the common thread.” added Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.

 

“Three more attributes are important to be kept in mind when we talk about digital inclusion. First, technology must be affordable; second, technology must lead to inclusion, and, third, technology must be developmental.” concluded Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.

 

On the completion of 3 years since the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), one of the largest financial inclusion programmes in the world, India‘s example for leading innovations in financial inclusions, access and technology can provide important learnings for other countries. The United Nations in India is bringing together leaders of this financial revolution, with senior level stake holders from the government, the banking sector, innovators, technology partners, intergovernmental organizations and the UN.

 

The daylong conclave focused on physical access and infrastructure of financial inclusion, maximizing financial access and literacy for women and marginalized groups and using technology and innovation to determine the way forward.

	     The Hackathon would be conducted by NIC and IAMAI as a part of the Startup Eco-system Development Programme
	    A 24hours Hackathon themed on Drinking Water & Sanitation, Transport, Education, Crime & Health will take place in seven cities


Union Minister for Electronics & Information Technology Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad today launched a nation-wide hackathon #OpenGovDataHack. As part of the Startup Eco-system Development program, NIC and IAMAI have collaborated to conduct Nation Wide Hackathon #OpenGovDataHack across seven states of India. It aims to Support & Showcase potentially great Ideas/Talent from Inner India by reaching out in their own State/City (7 Cities). It is to enable them making their ideas developed into Apps/Infographics primarily by use of Open Government Data around the themes ofDrinking Water& Sanitation, Transport, Education, Crime and Health to a stage, after which it can be evaluated by jury and be selected for Prizes and future support/funding.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Electronics and Information Technology said, “The government is committed to make best use of big data in establishing rule of precision governance. While doing so every care would be taken to ensure that strict privacy rights of individuals are protected. However, unauthorised use of data would be dealt with iron-hand to ensure that nothing comes in the way of making data-analytics a national movement.”

 

“The big data analytics should focus on poor & under privileged and facilitate inclusive growth. While aiming at taking lead in data analytics it must be ensured that technology is inclusive, affordable, transformative & developmental. #OpenGovDataHack being taken up in seven states would catalyse further start up movement. I would like assure you all that the Government is determined to hand-hold successful start-ups and make it a big success.” added Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.

 

Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, said, “The open data platform is a huge opportunity for the country and a brilliant foundation in place to have so much of data already being made available. However, there is big gap between data being available and data being utilized. I believe there are not only gaps, but we have serious opportunities available. A lot of intellectual effort needs to go into creating that value. On one side, we have this wonderful platform in reach our country, on the other side there is this huge opportunity for new services that can be made available, and thirdly there is massive resource available to us in terms of creative young minds in institutions, industry, start-ups across the country. I think Hackathon is a great opportunity, it fits in to our start-up movement as well, and I hope that our youngsters will be able to not only come out with new ideas, they will be able to provide valuable services to departments, to citizens, to communities across the country.”

 

 

 

The workshops will be organized for Stakeholders Sensitization, identifying Problem Statements and Data Gathering at respective cities. Students, Community, Startups, Academia, and Industry etc. can participate.

 

The #OpenGovDataHack will being with the oonsite City Challenge, a 24 hours Hackathon event will be held at 7 centres/ institutes/ organizations across Hackathon cities on different weekends. The participating teams will be required to submit Apps prototypes and Info-graphics. Selected Apps prototypes from all seven onsite city Centre and online submissions will be taken forward for App development. Each team will be given 2 months of mentorship/incubation to develop the App, post which the teams will submit the final Apps for evaluation.

 

The apps will be evaluated by a panel of jury comprised of the members from the Community, Government, Academia and Industry etc., and the shortlisted teams will be invited for a presentation on the App. The Hackathon process will conclude with an International conference on Open Data, wherein the winners of the Apps Challenge will be awarded.

                In an attempt to address illegal wildlife trade across 19 countries of Asia and Africa, India is hosting the Global Wildlife Programme (GWP) jointly with World Bank and United Nations Development Programme. Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan will inaugurate the Global Wildlife Programme on October 2. Briefing mediapersons on the Global Wildlife Programme here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that India is playing a leadership role in management of wildlife through involvement of local communities. Pointing out that no programme can succeed solely because of Government policies, the Minister said that peoples’ participation at societal level can ensure its success. “Five crore people living around national parks and sanctuaries are working as partners in environment conservation”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. The Minister pointed out that a 15-year National Wildlife Action Plan (2017-31), with a special focus on peoples’ participation will also be launched on October 2. He emphasised that the Conference will act as a platform for knowledge exchange and coordination on the action taken on the ground to combat illegal poaching of wildlife and improve governance on wildlife conservation. Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined the fact that the number of rhinos, tigers and elephants is in fact, increasing. 

The Minister said that till now programmes and plans related to wildlife were focused on and around national parks and sanctuaries. However, the strategy and programmes will now be based on the landscape of the region. He added that the impact of such issues as global warming, climate change and disaster management on the people living around wildlife areas and on the wildlife will also be discussed. 

Coinciding with the ‘Wildlife Week’, the theme of the Conference is - “Peoples’ participation in wildlife conservation”. The meeting will bring about strengthened cooperation between India and the 18 GWP countries in better management of wildlife habitats and minimizing human-wildlife conflict situations. It will also enable India to strengthen its enforcement mechanism to control illicit trade. 

The GWP will hold discussions on management of wildlife habitat, securing sustainable community livelihood, enhancing enforcement, monitoring, cooperation to reduce wildlife crimes such as poaching and related threats. The Conference will provide an opportunity for India to showcase its conservation efforts through joint forest management, vana sanrakshan samitis, eco-development committees in and around Protected Areas. 

The proposed outcomes of New Delhi Conference include: Reiterating Mahatma Gandhi principles to the world, as the Conference coincides with Gandhi Jayanti and UN International Day of Non- Violence on October 2, 2017; Take leadership in Wildlife Conservation by showcasing India’s conservation models for Asiatic lion, single horn rhino, tiger and Asiatic elephants; Consolidating “people’s participation for wildlife conservation”; Need to strongly address unaccounted black money generated through illegal wildlife trade at global market; Sensitise stakeholders like Governments, corporate, banks, public sectors, media, youth etc for investments in wildlife conservation and develop sustainable models for wildlife conservation thorough peoples’ participation in 19 GWP countries. 

The meeting will host wildlife experts, leading practitioners across 19 GWP countries, government representatives from India’s forestry and conservation sectors, leading corporate associated with environmental and biodiversity conservation, civil society organisations and school children. The participating nations include – Afghanistan, Botswana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Philippines, Republic of Congo, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In addition, representatives of World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) will also be present. Earlier, four similar Programmes had been convened at Gland (Switzerland), Hanoi (Vietnam), Nairobi (Kenya) and Liberville (Gabon).

                Emphasising the need for spreading awareness and sensitization on crimes against wildlife, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the law of the land must be upheld, since many species are on the verge of extinction.

Addressing the inaugural session of the seminar on ‘Role of security forces in combating wildlife crimes’ organized by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), at Vigyan Bhawan here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined the need for human beings to live in harmony with nature, as an increasing number of animal species are today on the endangered list.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the job of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) is more difficult, since it guards the open borders with friendly neighbouring countries, where force alone cannot be used to enforce the law of the land. He pointed out that development activities have increased tremendously after India’s Independence and in this process, people destroyed the natural abode of wild animals by cutting down forest for agricultural and industrial use. The Minister added that tremendous loss has already been caused to environment and wild animals due to human mistakes. ‘Certain plants and wild animals either have either become extinct, or are on the verge of extinction, if whatever is now left with us is not taken care of, then in the coming days, we will see forests and wild animals only in books’, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. He appreciated the SSB’s initiative of organising this seminar with sister agencies, NGOs and special dignitaries The Minister pointed out such seminars enhance inter-departmental co-ordination and in the process, crime against forests and wild animals will be checked. Dr. Harsh Vardhan assured the gathering that the recommendations made during the seminar will be examined by Ministry of Environment & Forests as Action Points for implementation.

In her welcome address, Director General, SSB, Smt. Archana Ramasundaram, made an appeal to all the dignitaries and representatives of sister agencies and NGOs to put forward ideas for formulating a long-term strategy for protection of forest and wild animals. She said that of the total 629 Border Outposts of the SSB, as many as 229 BOPs are located in the classified forested areas. Elaborating the SSB’s efforts in this direction, she said that last year, the force had not only arrested 62 criminals in 60 cases, but had also saved the lives of Tokay- Lizard and sand-boa snakes. Dr. Ramasundaram added that this year, in just 8 months, 85 cases have been registered, while 95 smugglers have been arrested. Apart from these, SSB confiscated body parts of endangered spices, dear, Turtles, rabbits, pigeons and elephant tusks.

The purpose of the seminar was to sensitize the CAPF and other stakeholders towards the magnitude of wildlife trade and emphasise the necessity for inter-agency cooperation. ADG, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Smt. Tilotma Verma and other dignitaries attended the seminar.

On the first day of the workshop, the participants were taught about the procedure of performing successful immobilization, capture and restraint.  On the second day, a Jaguar was immobilized in the sequence of immobilization; examination of the animal, sample collection, (blood draw for CBC/Chem/bank) checked microchips and then monitored recovery. This was followed by a roundtable discussion among participants (success, challenges, discussions and questions), dart preparation and dart practice.  On September 13, 2017, immobilization of a Jungle cat was done in the sequence of immobilization, examination of the animal, sample collection, (blood draw for CBC/Chem/bank) checking microchips and then monitored recovery. This was followed by another roundtable discussion among participants (success, challenges, discussions and questions). A Classroom session continued on discussion of field diseases, and operant conditioning.

On the concluding day of the workshop on September 14, 2017, a white tiger was immobilized in the sequence of immobilization, examination of the animal, sample collection, (blood draw for CBC/Chem/bank) check microchips and then monitored recovery. This was followed by a roundtable discussion among participants (success, challenges, discussions and questions).

 

The closing session of the training workshop was chaired by the Chief Wildlife Warden of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Ramesh Kang. Member Secretary, CZA, Dr. D. N. Singh, elaborated the idea behind conducting such a training in collaboration with Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington D.C, USA.   Director, National Zoological Renu Singh, delivered the vote of thanks.   At the end, the participants said that the workshop will benefit them to work confidently on the subject at their respective work places.

                Emphasising the need to create an enabling environment through small steps such as planting more trees, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that new and innovative ways must be thought of, to bring more areas under forest and tree cover. Inaugurating a two-day conference on “Sustainable landscapes and forest ecosystems: Theory to Practice” here today, the Environment Minister urged the gathering to deliberate and come out with out-of-the-box ideas and solutions on increasing the forest cover much beyond the stipulated 33 per cent. “Innovation is the need of the hour. Innovation co-efficient now is more important than any other co-efficient”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said.

Reiterating the Government’s commitment to increase the country’s forest cover from 24% to 33% of the geographical area and creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in forests, as reflected in Nationally Determined Contribution, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the target is proposed to be achieved through a number of planned afforestation drives and initiatives. The Minister advocated the balancing of environmental and developmental concerns and also urged the gathering of scientists and foresters to devise a solution to the problem of weeds.

Referring to the forests being an integral part of Indian culture and tradition, the Environment Minister said that India has managed to successfully conserve and enhance its forest resources. He reminded the gathering that our ancestors had given us clean air and clean water and we must make efforts to preserve them for the future generations.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan launched the “Wood is Good” campaign on the occasion. Wood is a climate-friendly material, as it is a renewable resource, having zero carbon footprint.

The Partnership for Land Use Science (Forest-Plus) is a joint programme by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to strengthen capacity for REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) implementation in India. The programme brings together experts from India and the United States to develop technologies, tools and methods of forest management to meet the technical challenges of managing forests for the health of ecosystem, carbon stocks, biodiversity and livelihood. Some of the objectives of the conference include – exploring issues and opportunities for ecosystem approach to land management in India; discussing how the approaches and tools developed under the Forest-PLUS programme can be used to improve forest management in India and to document and disseminate that learning with a wider group.

                Appreciating the difficulties faced by the Zoo Veterinarians in the diagnosis of diseases and treatment of the wild animals kept in captivity, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that advancements such as C.A.T scan and M.R.I must be used for the benefit of animals. Speaking at the inaugural session of the training workshop on “Capacity Building Of Indian Zoo Veterinarians On Animal Health Management In Captivity” here today, the Minister said that such capacity-building workshops should be organised more by the Central Zoo Authority, in association with organisations having expertise similar to that of the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. He reiterated that National Zoological Park, New Delhi must strive to become the best Zoological Park in the world.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan gave an assurance that the Government will adequately support the proposals from zoos that come up with ideas to develop model zoos. The Minister noted that interaction of the participants with the experts from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park will certainly help our zoos in adoption of modern trends in animal care. He also recalled the importance of the day, being the 125th anniversary of the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of Religion held at Chicago in the year 1893.

The Minister also released two manuals on the occasion, namely Manual for Biological Sample Collection and Preservation for Genetic, Reproductive And Disease Analyses and Manual on Chemical Immobilization of Wild Animals.

The Training Programme is being organised by the Central Zoo Authority in collaboration with the Smithsonian National Zoological Park (SNZP), Washington D.C., U.S.A. at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi from September 11-19, 2017. The veterinarians are responsible for the diagnosis of diseases of the wild animals kept in captivity, their treatment, nutrition and diet and for taking measures for preventive healthcare. In the present training programme, the veterinarians will not only be exposed to the technique and procedures being followed in USA, but they will also carry out hands-on exercises. It is expected that these hands-on exercises, coupled with discussion and sharing of experiences with experts and among participants would develop higher level of confidence. The ultimate aim of the training is to impart necessary knowledge, skill and attitude to the Veterinarians of the Zoos, at par with the international levels in the field.

An MoU was signed between the CZA, intended to develop and implement joint research studies focussed on animal health and capacity building. This MoU is upto March, 2020. After signing of the MoU, a delegation comprising of Senior Veterinary officers visited the National Zoological Park, Delhi, the Lion Safari, Etawah, Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysusru, the Bannerghatta Biological Park, Bengaluru and the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur, Chennai in the month of June, 2016 and shared technical information for improvements in the conservation of endangered species of wildlife in India.

The training of Zoo Keepers is conducted on regional basis, considering the linguistic diversity of India. In all, 240 personnel working in the Zoos for the animal housing, upkeep, veterinary care and other management aspects are covered through training programmes every year. Recently, the training of Zoo Directors was conducted at Dehradun Zoological Park, Dehradun in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun on “Identification and marking of animals in captivity”. The Zoo Keepers’ training has been conducted at the Sepahijala Zoological Park, Sepahijala for Zoos of North-East Region, Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, Patna for Zoos of Eastern Region, Kanpur Zoological Park, Kanpur for Zoos of Northern Region, Kamla Nehru Zoological Garden, Ahmedabad for Zoos of Western Region and the Zoological Garden, Thiruvananthapuram for Zoos of Southern Region respectively.

The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) is a statutory body created under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. It came into existence in 1992 to oversee the functioning of zoos and provide them technical and other assistance. Zoos in India are regulated under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and are guided by the National Zoo Policy, 1998. The Government of India has formulated Recognition of Zoo Rules, 2009 to lay down standards and norms for management of zoos in the country. At present there are 166 recognized zoos in the country.

The Central Zoo Authority has executed MoU for cooperation in the field of research & education with reputed international organizations. Some of them include - Wildlife Reserve, Singapore; National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), Nepal; Leipzig Zoo, Germany; University of California, USA; Prague Zoo, Czech Republic; Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington D.C., USA.

Smithsonian National Zoological Park (SNZP), Washington DC

The Smithsonian National Zoological Park (SNZP), Washington DC is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, mandated by the Congress of the United States of America. It is home to approximately 2,000 individual animals of nearly 400 different species. SNZP is also a research, conservation and education centre for endangered species, with a state-of-the-art veterinary hospital and extensive research facilities.

The Environment Ministry will launch an environment awareness initiative, under which an online environmental quiz competition named “Prakriti Khoj” – an Environment Quiz to be conducted at the national level. The quiz is being launched on September 5 on the occasion of Teachers’ Day. It will be an ideal medium to reach out to young minds through a fun-filled interactive learning mode to trigger their sensitivity towards environment protection and conservation. This quiz, in a way, will provide a unique platform for students to measure their awareness level regarding environmental issues. It aims to motivate them towards effective participation in other major programmes related to conservation and protection of the Ministry. 

The objective of the quiz is to generate interest among school children about the science related to environment, interactions within it and the problems therein. This will help in sensitizing the children/youth to issues related to environment and development and motivate children towards environment conservation-oriented lifestyles. It will trigger their sensitivity towards nature appreciation and conservation, leading to positive environmental actions at different levels.

The quiz is planned in two phases. For the first phase, it is envisaged that maximum number of children of schools under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry should get an opportunity to participate in this environmental quiz. NGC was initiated by Ministry in 2001-02 for creating environmental awareness among children by formulating “Eco-clubs” in schools across the country. There are around 1,00,000 Eco-clubs across the country, making it one of the largest conservation networks, wherein students are involved in various kind of activities such as cleanliness drives, carrying out waste segregation, composting using bio-degradable wastes, subsisting the concept of three R’s, viz, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; Nukkad Nataks etc. Three age groups is planned to be covered in Phase-I which will be open only to Eco-clubs i.e. in the age-groups 8-12 years, 13-15 years and 16-18 years. After this, based on the feedback received from the participants, the second phase of the quiz will be open to students from all schools across the country in the year 2018. 

The mode of quiz will be online through multiple choice questions. Thematic areas like climate change, biodiversity, forest and wildlife, pollution, waste management, rivers and lakes, natural history, international conventions such as Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora etc. have been chosen for the quiz. A separate webportal - www.ngc.nic.in containing information on the quiz has been developed by Ministry. Dates of the quiz will be updated on the Prakriti Khoj portal, as well as the Ministry’s website. The students from Eco-clubs specially registered on the portal will be able to participate in the qualification round from September 18, 2017 onwards. 

During the first phase, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in cooperation with State nodal agencies of National Green Corps programme, which are State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), State Government Bodies within the Environment Departments, State Science Council will implement the quiz programme through online mode. Quiz will be organized in school premises under the supervision of Principals/Eco-club Coordinators. There will be cash prizes for the winners. All participants will receive an E-certificate of participation, duly signed by Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. On June 15, 2017, at the concluding function of Swachhta Pakwada held in National Zoological Park, Delhi, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan had said that environment awareness campaign and its successful implementation relating to protection and conservation, youth across the country should be continued as a movement. Accordingly, under the Swachh Bharat Mission “Prakriti Paryavaran aur Hum – Green March” was considered to be launched as a continuous activity and campaign. He further suggested that children and youth must be made an integral part of this campaign and should be made aware about the importance of environment related issues. Dr Harsh Vardhan further directed that children/youth should be actively involved in promoting a mass movement. Youth can make a difference at both local and community level, which in due course will lead to awareness at village, city, state and country level. He wanted youth to become “Paryavaran Prerak”.

This will help in sensitizing the children/youth to issues related to environment and development and motivate children towards environment conservation-oriented lifestyles. It will trigger their sensitivity towards nature appreciation and conservation, leading to positive environmental actions at different levels.

The quiz is planned in two phases. For the first phase, it is envisaged that maximum number of children of schools under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry should get an opportunity to participate in this environmental quiz. NGC was initiated by Ministry in 2001-02 for creating environmental awareness among children by formulating “Eco-clubs” in schools across the country. There are around 1,00,000 Eco-clubs across the country, making it one of the largest conservation networks, wherein students are involved in various kind of activities such as cleanliness drives, carrying out waste segregation, composting using bio-degradable wastes, subsisting the concept of three R’s, viz, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; Nukkad Nataks etc. Three age groups is planned to be covered in Phase-I which will be open only to Eco-clubs i.e. in the age-groups 8-12 years, 13-15 years and 16-18 years. After this, based on the feedback received from the participants, the second phase of the quiz will be open to students from all schools across the country in the year 2018. 

The mode of quiz will be online through multiple choice questions. Thematic areas like climate change, biodiversity, forest and wildlife, pollution, waste management, rivers and lakes, natural history, international conventions such as Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora etc. have been chosen for the quiz. A separate webportal - www.ngc.nic.in containing information on the quiz has been developed by Ministry. Dates of the quiz will be updated on the Prakriti Khoj portal, as well as the Ministry’s website. The students from Eco-clubs specially registered on the portal will be able to participate in the qualification round from September 18, 2017 onwards. 

During the first phase, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in cooperation with State nodal agencies of National Green Corps programme, which are State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), State Government Bodies within the Environment Departments, State Science Council will implement the quiz programme through online mode. Quiz will be organized in school premises under the supervision of Principals/Eco-club Coordinators. There will be cash prizes for the winners. All participants will receive an E-certificate of participation, duly signed by Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. On June 15, 2017, at the concluding function of Swachhta Pakwada held in National Zoological Park, Delhi, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan had said that environment awareness campaign and its successful implementation relating to protection and conservation, youth across the country should be continued as a movement. Accordingly, under the Swachh Bharat Mission “Prakriti Paryavaran aur Hum – Green March” was considered to be launched as a continuous activity and campaign. He further suggested that children and youth must be made an integral part of this campaign and should be made aware about the importance of environment related issues. Dr Harsh Vardhan further directed that children/youth should be actively involved in promoting a mass movement. Youth can make a difference at both local and community level, which in due course will lead to awareness at village, city, state and country level. He wanted youth to become “Paryavaran Prerak”.

                Small exporters have brought to the notice of the Government the difficulties in furnishing bond with requisite bank guarantee. To facilitate exports under GST, it has been decided that the facility of furnishing Letter of Undertaking, in place of a bond, for exporting goods or services or both shall be allowed to exporters and no bank guarantee will be required.The relevant notification for this shall be issued in due course. 

The issue of cash blockage is expected to be partially addressed by this measure. More measures are under consideration.

                  The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley said that Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has taken various initiatives in the last 2-3 years in order to bring about efficiency, transparency and fairness in tax administration. Highlighting the initiatives, the Finance Minister said that a Single Page ITR-1 (SAHAJ) Form was introduced for tax payers having income up to Rs. 50 lakhs. Rate of tax for individuals having income of Rs. 2.5 lakhs to Rs.5 lakhs was reduced from 10% to 5%, which is one among the lowest in the world, the Finance Minister added. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley further said that the concept of ‘no scrutiny’ was introduced for the First Time Non-Business Tax Payers having income up to Rs. 5 lakhs so that more and more people are encouraged to join the tax net and file their IT returns and pay the due amount of taxes.

            The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley also highlighted the initiatives of the Income Tax Department as far as Ease of Doing Business and promoting Financial Markets are concerned. In this regard, he specifically mentioned about introduction of Presumptive Taxation Scheme for Professionals having income up to Rs. 50 lakhs.

He said that changes in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) with Mauritius and Singapore have been incorporated to allow for source based taxation of capital gains on shares and interest income of banks.

 

            As far as the drive against black money is concerned, the Income-tax Department has taken various initiatives since the present Government came to power. In this regard, the Finance Minister mentioned about the enactment of the Black Money Act, 2015, Comprehensive Amendments to the Benami Act 1988 and Operation Clean Money among others. The Finance Minister said that after the intense follow-up of demonetization data from 9th November 2016 to 10th January, 2017, about 1100 searches were made resulting into seizure of Rs. 610 crore including cash of Rs. 513 crore. He said that undisclosed income of Rs. 5400 crore was detected and about 400 cases have been referred to ED and CBI for án appropriate action. 

 

            In order to promote less cash economy and digital transactions, the Finance Minister said that the Income Tax Department took various initiatives including penalty for cash receipt of Rs. 2 lakh or more, limit of cash donation to charitable trusts reduced from Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 2000/- and no cash donations of Rs. 2000/- or more to political parties.

 

            Highlighting the impact of demonetization and the proactive initiatives of the Income Tax Department, the Finance Minister said that the revenue collections in case of direct taxes rose to Rs. 8,49, 818 crore during the Financial Year 2016-17 at a growth rate of 14.5 per cent. The Finance Minister further said that net collections up to 18th September, 2017 in the Current Financial Year 2017-18 rose to Rs. 3.7 lakh crore with a growth of 15.7%.

            Earlier, the Chairman CBDT, Shri Sushil Chandra made a presentation about the initiatives of the Income Tax Department before the Committee.

 

            Participating in the discussions, the various members of the Consultative Committee gave various suggestions in order to improve both the revenue collections and the overall performance of the Department.  The members congratulated the Finance Minister for making historical tax reforms both in case of direct and indirect taxes. Some of the members suggested that some more incentives be given to the new tax papers so that more and more people are encouraged to file tax returns and pay due taxes which in turn would help in widening the tax base. They appreciated the initiatives of the Department to reduce the tax rate from 10% to 5% in case of individual tax payers having income of Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh per annum. Some members also suggested for reducing the tax slabs in order to give incentive to the people to pay their due taxes. They appreciated the initiatives of the Income Tax Department for issuing Appreciation Letters to the honest tax payers. Some of the members suggested reducing the banking or transaction charges in order to promote digital transactions. They said that only by reducing or waiving off these charges moré and more people will be encouraged to go for digital transactions. The members also suggested that more time be given to the people living in those areas where there is either frequent power failures or having no internet facilities to file their returns. Some of the members also suggested that more searches may be conducted against the black money holders as still many people are transacting in black money.

As hitherto, all the auctions covered by the calendar will have the facility of non-competitive bidding scheme under which five per cent of the notified amount will be reserved for the specified retail investors.

 

Like in the past, the Government of India/ Reserve Bank of India will continue to have the flexibility to bring about modifications in the above calendar in terms of notified amount, issuance period, maturities etc. and to issue different types of instruments including instruments having non-standard maturity and floating rate instruments, depending upon the requirement of the Government of India, evolving market conditions and other relevant factors after giving due notice.

 

Government of India/ Reserve Bank reserves the right to exercise the green-shoe option of upto 
` 1000 crore in each maturity bucket, which will be indicated in the auction notification. However, such green-shoe option will be within the notified amount.

The auction of Treasury Bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the General Notification No. F4(8)-W&M/2015 dated May 26, 2016 issued by the Government of India, as amended from time to time.

                Certain transitional issues arising with respect to payment of service tax after 30th June 2017 have been clarified by CBEC vide circular dated 28-9-2017. 

It has been clarified that in cases where service was received before 1-7-2017 and payment for the value of the service was also made before 1-7-2017, but the service tax was paid by 5th /6th July 2017, details of credit should be indicated in Part I of Form ST-3 by filing a revised return. In order to give compliant assessees who had filed their ST 3 return by the due date or some days later, an immediate and viable window to file revised returns, all ST3 returns for the period 1-4-2017 to 30-6-2017 which have been filed upto and inclusive of the 31st day of August 2017, shall be deemed to have been filed on 31-8-2017. Once details of such credit are reflected in the ST-3, the assessee may proceed to fill in the details in Form GST TRAN-1. 

In the case of assessees who were not registered under ACES, who want to make payment of service tax on or after 1-7-2017, they may avail of the category of “non assessee registration” in the registration module of ACES.

The Union Finance Minister Sh Arun Jaitley today reviewed capital expenditure programme and status of dividend distribution of central public sector undertakings and authorities with the Secretaries of concerned Ministries/Departments and CMDs of major CPSEs, including Petroleum, Defence, Power, Road Transport, Railways, Coal, Mines, Steel, Atomic Energy. Finance Secretary, Shri Ashok Lavasa and Secretary, Economic Affairs, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg were present in the meeting. 

Finance Minister, while addressing the Secretaries and CMDs, stressed that the CPSEs may not only complete their budgeted capital expenditure but should also look to aggressively push capital expenditure in the interest of boosting investment in Indian economy. Secretaries/senior officers from the 10 Ministries and the CMDs/Directors (Finance) of the CPSUs apprised the Finance Minister that their capital expenditure programme for the current year are completely on track for achieving the capital expenditure of Rs. 3.85 lac crore budgeted in 2017-18. Some PSUs informed that they were planning to increase their capital expenditure programme, which in the aggregate, might be of the order of additional Rs. 25,000 crore. Finance Minister, while appreciating the commitments of the Ministries and CPSUs, assured that the Government would make available adequate resources but no slackness under any circumstances would be acceptable. Finance Minister indicated that the capital expenditure programme would again be reviewed at the end of November/early December. 

In the discussions for raising capital investments, it also came up to attention that most PSUs have very low or no debt on their balance sheet which is reflected in their low debt to equity ratios. CPSEs were, therefore, asked to raise more debt and not to rely entirely on cash and free reserves for finding new investments and capital expenditure. The CPSEs which have free reserves and surplus cash were asked to consider declaring liberal dividends so as to promote more productive use of such resources for financing much needed physical and social infrastructure. Finance Secretary advised the CPSEs to release outstanding payments expeditiously to help improve the liquidity in the market. Secretary, Economic Affairs advised the CPSEs to consider raising more resources through innovative financing arrangements like InvITs, ToT, monetization of assets, to undertake more projects of capital nature.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley along with the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu released a book on financial management in New Delhi on September 26, 2017. The Union Minister for Civil Aviation Sh Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Minister of State for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Shri Y.S. Chowdary were also present on the occasion. The book titled “A to Z of Financial Management in Autonomous Institutions” is authored by Dr. Rajat Bhargava and Shri Deenanath Pathak. 

Public Financial Management – The fine art of budgeting, spending and managing public money has undergone a major revolution. The unique interdisciplinary combination of economics, science, public administration and accounting has seen influx of innovative ideas and reform that has sought to address some of perennial challenges of managing finances in Autonomous Institutions. The effective and efficient use of taxpayer’s money by Autonomous Institutions requires sound financial management with infusion of e-governance and transparency. There have been a number of efforts to enhance financial management in Autonomous Institutions, like local and urban authorities, independent public institutions such as universities, but these efforts were piecemeal in nature, focusing on just a few aspects of financial management, e.g., budget or amounting. Hence, there were varying degrees of success in improving in their performance in term of fiscal management or allocative and technical efficiency. 

This book covers almost all aspects of financial management in Autonomous Institutions and offers an insightful perspective on the challenges of managing public money. Considering the current trends in financial management, the authors have analysed all facets. Their analysis is empirically based on broad spectrum of sources.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the signing of the (i) Interbank Local Currency Credit Line Agreement and (ii) Cooperation Memorandum Relating to Credit Ratings by Exim Bank with participating member banks under BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism. As both the Agreement and the MoU are umbrella pacts, and are non-binding in nature, the Board of Directors of Exim Bank has been authorized to negotiate and conclude any individual contracts and commitments within their framework.

 

Impact

The Agreements will promote multilateral interaction within the area of mutual interest which will deepen political and economic relations with BRICS nations.

Signing of the Agreement will position Exim Bank in the international platform along with large development finance institutions, like CDS, VEB and BNDES. At an appropriate time, Exim Bank, leveraging this umbrella agreement, could enter into bilateral agreement with any of these member institutions to raise resources for its business. As and when an opportunity arises for co-financing in commercial terms, by any two member institutions (say India and South Africa), lending in single currency by both the institutions would also be possible.

 Background

 Exim Bank finances, facilitates and promotes India's international trade. It provides competitive finance at various stages of the business cycle covering import of technology, export product development, export production and export credit at pre-shipment and post-shipment stages and investments overseas.

 

Interbank Local Currency Credit Line Agreement

The initial Master Agreement on Extending Credit Facility in Local Currency under the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism had a validity of five years, which has expired in March 2017. It is understood that some of the member banks (like CDB and VEB; CDB and BNDES) have entered into bilateral agreements for local currency financing under the Master Agreement signed in 2012. Although the current conditions are not conducive to usage, it was useful to keep the same alive as an enabling feature in case a suitable opportunity materializes in future. Exim Bank raises resources in the off-shore market in diverse currencies and swaps to mitigate the risk. The umbrella Agreement would serve as an enabler to enter into bilateral agreements with member banks subject to national laws, regulations and internal policies of the signatories.

Cooperation Memorandum Relating to Credit Ratings

It would enable sharing of credit ratings amongst the BRICS member banks, based on the request received from another bank. This would be an ideal mechanism to mitigate the credit risks associated with cross-border financing. In future, such a mechanism could also serve as pre-cursor to the proposal of having an alternate rating agency by BRICS nations.

The Agreement and the MoU have also been highlighted in the BRICS Leaders Xiamen Declaration made in Xiamen, China on 4th September 2017.

In the press release dated 29th August, 2017, it was reported that the total revenue of GST paid under different heads for the month of July, 2017 (upto 29th August) was Rs. 92,283 crore. Out of the total GST collection of Rs. 92,283 crore, the total CGST revenue was Rs. 14,894 crore, SGST revenue was Rs.22,722 crore, IGST revenue was Rs.47,469 crore (of which IGST from imports was Rs.20,964 crore) and Compensation Cess was Rs.7,198 crore (of which Rs.599 crore is Compensation Cess from imports). Many assessees have been filing the returns for July 2017 belatedly and till 31st August, 2017 and the total GST paid for July is Rs. 94,063 crore.


	The last date for payment of GST as well as filing of GSTR 3B return for the month of August 2017 was 20th September, 2017. The total number of tax payers who were required to file monthly returns for August 2017 is 68.20 lakhs, of which, as on 25th September, 2017, 37.63 lakh GSTR 3B returns have been filed.
	The total revenue of GST paid under different heads (upto 25th September, 2017) is Rs. 90,669 crore. The total CGST revenue is Rs. 14,402 crore, SGST revenue is Rs. 21,067 crore, IGST revenue is Rs. 47,377 crore (of which IGST from imports in August 2017 is Rs. 23,180 crore) and Compensation Cess is Rs.7,823 crore (of which Rs. 547 crore is Compensation Cess from imports in August 2017).
	The above figures obviously do not include the GST to be paid by 10.24 lakh assessees who have opted for the composition scheme. Additionally, there are still a number of assessees who have not filed their return either for July or August, 2017. The increase in the above stated figures will be informed in due course.

                There are lot of apprehensions expressed in the media about the problem of blockage of working capital for exporters post-GST. There are various figures also being discussed on the blockage of such funds, which are wild estimates. Such media reports are not based on facts.

i) First of all, it may be mentioned that in respect of 66% value of exports, exporters have preferred the duty drawback scheme instead of taking actual refund of input taxes in the pre-GST regime. Duty drawback scheme was actually extended in the post-GST regime for a period of 3 months, i.e. upto 30th September, 2017, subject to that exporter not taking input tax credit under GST. This means that as of now, for 66% of the value of exports, there is no blockage of funds.

ii) The remaining 33% of exporters always used to prefer a normal refund route for taxes paid on inputs for Central Excise separately and for VAT separately and that was made available to them only after the actual exports took place and, for such class of exporters, earlier also there was a normal blockage of funds for a period of 5 – 6 months at least except for those using facility of advance authorisation. Hence, the problem is not as grievous as it is made out to be. Notwithstanding this, the Committee on Exports is working on issues of export sector.

iii) A lot of people are speculating that the refund for inputs in case of exports under GST will be available only when regular form GSTR 3 is filed for every month. This is not the case. We are trying to find a way of giving refund by linking form GSTR 1 with form GSTR 3B and, therefore, for the month of July, where form GSTR 1 is already filed, the authorities would be in a position to process the refund applications. Therefore, the exporters, who have not yet filed form GSTR 1 for July 2017, may be advised to file it immediately and not to wait till the deadline. GSTN application for refund is also getting ready. But, in the meantime, we are also finding other ways of giving refund, if necessary through a manual procedure.

iv) The Committee on Export set up by the GST Council met on 19th & 20th August, 2017 and have discussed various methods of resolving the issue of blockage of funds for the exporters. The Committee also interacted with the exporters of eight sectors who made detailed presentations on the problems being faced by them. The Committee would present the solution to their problems before the GST Council as soon as possible.

v) In the meantime, the authorities of State Governments as well as Central Government have been requested to clear the pending refund claims of Central Excise and VAT for the pre-GST period, so that the exporters will get immediate relief.

                There are lot of speculations in the media about the credit of Rs. 65,000 crore claimed by taxpayers in respect of Central Excise and Service Tax in the pre-GST period. Some people are under the impression that because of Rs. 65,000 crore claimed as transition credit, the income of Government this month has plummeted.

Firstly, Rs. 65,000 crore is the credit claimed by the taxpayers in the TRANS 1 form as their balance of credit. It does not mean that they would have used all of this credit for payment of their output tax liability for the month of July 2017.

It may be clarified that this is far from the truth. Secondly, it may be clarified that an amount of Rs. 95,000 crore, which was received in the month of August 2017 for GST, is the amount actually paid in cash other than availing credit.

Thirdly, this figure of transition credit claimed is also not incredibly high, since Rs.1.27 lakh crore of credit of Central Excise and Service Tax was lying as closing balance as on 30th June, 2017 as per department’s record. This includes credit in Central Excise as well as Service Tax. Of course, some of these credits may not be admissible under GST regime, for example the credits, which are blocked under Section 17 (5) of CGST Act or which are not covered under the definition of GST. Also, some of the credits, which are claimed in TRANS 1 form may be under litigation and, therefore, it may not be available to the assesse to carry forward or utilisation. It is from this angle that CBEC is examining the transition credits, which are claimed by the assessees in TRANS I form in certain cases.

It is possible that some assessees would have committed mistake in filing TRANS 1 form of admissible credit. It has, therefore, been decided to provide facility for revision of TRANS 1 by the GST Council. This facility would be available by middle of October 2017 and assessees are requested to revise their TRANS 1 form before 31st October, 2017, so that they themselves can remove the error.

                The GST Council, in its 21st meeting held on 9th September, 2017 at Hyderabad has, interalia, recommended that for 5% GST rate on cereals, pulses and flours etc. put up in unit container and bearing a registered brand name: 

a) A brand registered as on 15.05.2017 shall be deemed to be a registered brand for the purposes of levy of 5% GST, irrespective of whether or not such brand is subsequently deregistered. 

b) A brand registered as on 15.05.2017 under the Copyright Act, 1957 shall also be treated as a registered brand for the purposes of levy of 5% GST. 

c) A brand registered as on 15.05.2017 under any law for the time being in force in any other country shall also be deemed to be a registered brand for the purposes of levy of 5% GST. d) A mark or name in respect of which actionable claim is available shall be deemed to be a registered brand name for the purposes of levy of 5% GST.

2. Notifications giving effect to the Council’s recommendations relating to changes in GST rates on goods and conditions appended thereto are proposed to be issued on 22nd September, 2017. 

3. Regarding aforesaid recommendations of the Council, these notifications, interalia, provide that 5% GST will apply if on brand name [as defined in the notification] an actionable claim or enforceable right in court of law is available. In this context, these notifications also provide that this 5% GST will, however, not apply if the person concerned voluntarily foregoes any actionable claim or enforceable right on such brand name, subject to the conditions that he: 

a) files an affidavit to the effect that he is voluntarily foregoing his actionable claim or enforceable right on such brand name with the jurisdictional Commissioner of Central Tax or State Tax, or the jurisdictional officer of Union Territory Tax, as the case may be, and

b) prints in indelible ink, both in English and local language on each such unit container, that in respect of brand name printed on the unit containers he has voluntarily foregone his actionable claim or enforceable right.

                A taxpayer who is liable to discharge part of its tax liability by way of advance tax has to bear additional burden of interest for default of advance tax, in case total advance tax paid for the year falls short of the assessed tax by ten percent or more. This interest is levied as per the provisions of section 234B of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”). Such taxpayers are further liable to pay interest for deferment of advance tax, in case any quarterly instalment of advance tax paid falls short of the prescribed percentage of total advance tax paid. This interest is levied in accordance with the provisions of section 234C of the Act.

 

It is of utmost importance for such taxpayers to arrive at a reasonably accurate estimate of their current income and advance tax liability, so that the additional burden on account of interest for default/deferment of advance tax can be avoided.

 

Needless to say, a continuous flow of tax revenues throughout the year is critical for the Government so as to meet various budgetary allocations such as welfare schemes, infrastructure development, defence expenditure etc. A reliable and advance estimate of tax revenues for the year would also provide much needed perspective for planning and prioritizing the Government expenditure.

 

            In order to address these concerns, it is proposed to create a mechanism for self-reporting of estimates of current income, tax payments and advance tax liability by certain taxpayers (companies and tax audit cases) on voluntary compliance basis. The proposed reporting mechanism is sought to be created by way of inserting a new Rule 39A and Form No. 28AA in the Income-tax Rules, 1962. The proposed draft notification has been placed in public domain on the website of Income Tax Department (www.incometaxindia.gov.in) for inviting comments from stakeholders and general public.The comments and suggestions on the draft Rule and Form may be sent electronically at the email address dirtpl4[at]nic[dot]in by 29th September, 2017.

                The 23rdIssue of the Annual Publication ‘India’s External Debt: A Status Report 2016-17’ prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India presents a detailed analysis of India’s External Debt position at end-March 2017, based on the data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 30, 2017 and data and information available from other sources. Apart from analysing the trend, composition and debt service of India’s external debt, the Report provides a comparative picture of India’s external debt vis-a-vis other countries, particularly developing countries.

 

The salient features of the Report are:

 

·         India’s external debt stock stood at US$ 471.9 billion at end-March 2017, decreasing by US$ 13.1 billion (2.7 per cent) over the level at end-March 2016.The decline in external debt was due to the decrease in long-term debt particularly NRI deposits and commercial borrowings.

 

·         At end-March 2017, long-term external debt was US$ 383.9 billion, showing adecrease of 4.4 per cent over the level at end-March 2016. Long-term external debt accounted for 81.4 per cent of total external debt at end-March 2017as compared to82.8 per cent at end-March 2016.

 

·         Short-term external debt increased by 5.5 per cent to US$ 88.0 billion at end-March 2017. This is mainly due to the increase in trade related credits, a major component of short-term debt with a share of 98.3 per cent.

 

·         Government (sovereign) external debt increased from US$ 93.4 billion at end-March 2016 to US$ 95.8 billion at end-March 2017, and constituted 20.3 per cent of the total external debt, as compared to 19.3 per cent in the previous year.

 

·         India’s external debt has remained within manageable limits and the external debt situation has improvedin 2016-17over 2015-16 as indicated by the increase in foreign exchange reserves cover to debt to 78.4 per cent from 74.3 per cent,and fall in the external debt-GDP ratio to20.2 per cent from 23.5 per cent. External debt of the country continues to be dominated by the long-term borrowings. India’s external debt position in recent years is given below:

Notes: R: Revised; P: Provisional     # Short term debt is based on original maturity.

Debt Service Ratio is the proportion of gross debt service payments to current account receipts (net of official transfers)

 

A cross country comparison based on “International Debt Statistics 2017” of the World Bank which presents the debt data for 2015, shows thatIndia continues to be among the less vulnerable countries with its external debt indicators comparing well with other indebted developing countries. The ratio of India’s external debt stock to gross national income (GNI) at 23.4 per cent was the fifth lowest and in terms of the cover provided by foreign exchange reserves to external debt, India’s position was sixth highest at 69.7 per cent in 2015.

                A Conference on Portability from Superannuation and recognized Provident Funds to National Pension System (NPS) was organized by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) in coordination with Willis Towers Watson in national capital. The Prime objective of the Conference was to provide a knowledge base platform to the Corporate by providing solutions to address the issues / challenges of portability of superannuation funds to NPS.

160 participants comprising Corporate, Points of Presence (POPs), Pension Funds, Central Record Keeping Agencies (CRAs) participated in the Conference.

Dr. B. S. Bhandari, Whole Time Member (Economics), PFRDA, highlighted the need to expand the coverage of NPS in an efficient and sustainable way. He asserted the fact that there are more employees in the Corporate - Private sector than in the government sector and hence there is a great potential for NPS in the corporate sector. PFRDA has been constantly engaging with its stake holders in the NPS and has been working with industry associations for promotion of NPS in the Corporate - Private sector. To make NPS entry easy and the interface user friendly, various modifications have been carried out in the product.

Shri Rohit Jain, Head, Willis Towers Watson (India), speaking on the occasion, told that the average life expectancy of persons in India has risen and hence there is a greater need for a retirement / pension product for all. Traditional pension products cover only 30% of the population. In this changing scenario there is a latent demand for product like NPS as there is no universal pension product.

Shri Hemant Contractor, Chairman, PFRDA in his key note address, informed that, earlier, people used to retire from the same job not only in the government sector but also in private sector. With opening up of economy people started getting more job opportunities switching jobs suitable to their skills and talents. Job switching has become more frequent and people seek more controls on their finances, when they start moving jobs and place from one to another. The concept of portability came in and people started thinking about having better control on their retirement savings.

Defined Benefit Pension schemes, which were predominant, became unsustainable not only for the government sector but also for the private sector because of various factors. A Defined Contribution scheme was therefore launched in 2004 which was initially only for Central Government employees, but which was later extended to State Government employees and later to the private sector. This scheme is the National Pension System (NPS), which is regulated by PFRDA.

NPS addressed the concerns of subscribers relating to portability and freedom of choice, and gradually started to pick up momentum in the private sector. The other features of NPS, namely, low cost, attractive returns, transparency, flexibility and domain expertise in each area of pension activity were the other factors which appealed to the private sector. Innovations and changes are made from time to time in the NPS product and processes, some recent examples being, introduction of two new life cycle funds, inclusion of alternative assets in investment portfolio, online entry and exit etc.

The entry age to NPS is now proposed to be increased to 65 years from 60 years and there is an option to continue up to age of 70 years.

The Chairman also mentioned that NPS should also be explored, as an additional retirement benefit, for corporates where superannuation funds are not available and employees are covered only under the mandatory EPFO schemes.

He highlighted the growth of 47% in AUM and 26% in number of subscribers in the last financial year (2016-17). He also made a reference to Atal Pension Yojana, the pension platform available for unorganized segment through Government of India / PFRDA and its year on year growth indicating the underlying demand for pension products in India.

During the conference, a panel discussion comprising industry experts such as Willis Towers Watson, HDFC Pension Funds, Siemens Limited, Vedanta Group and NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited eyeing the opportunities, addressing the challenges / issues and preparation of necessary guidelines on superannuation funds and NPS portability was conducted.

In the second half, a Conference for Point of Presence (PoPs), the distribution channel for NPS, was conducted.

Shri Hemant Contractor, Chairman, PFRDA, in his keynote address stressed on the need for robust distribution of the NPS through the current distribution network being managed by POPs which are Banks and other financial institutions. He also laid emphasis on the fact that, the key to last mile connectivity is increased distribution network by the POPs by registration and activation of more branches and through awareness campaigns. He informed that PFRDA has empanelled IL&FS Skill Development Corporation Limited as its training agency to impart training on NPS to POPs and Corporate and urged the POPs to utilise the services of the Training Agency for training of their staff member on NPS.

During this conference, awards were distributed to the POPs, for their performance in FY 2016-17 under various categories.

Currently, NPS has more than 1.71 crore subscribers with total Asset under Management (AUM) of more than Rs. 2.04 lakh crores.

                The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that the present Government brought the policy of financial inclusion to the centre stage and launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) Scheme on a massive scale in August 2014. He said that the Government has tried to exploit the full potential of financial inclusion with the help of banks. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley further said that this is one area where Public Sector Banks(PSBs) did better than others. The Finance Minister was delivering the Key Note Address at the Conclave on Finance Inclusion organized by United Nations (UN) in India in the national capital today.

Speaking further on the occasion, the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said when the PMJDY was launched in August 2014, only 58% people had their bank accounts and 42% were outside the banking network. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley said that now the number of total bank accounts opened under PMJDY is more than 30 crore. He said that the number of zero balance accounts under PMJDY has declined from 76.81% in September 2014 to less than 20% as of now. Shri Jaitley said besides it, more than 22 crore RuPay cards have also been issued to the account holders alongwith an overdraft facility of Rs. 5000/-.

The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that in addition to Financial Inclusion, the present Government has taken steps to provide security to the poor via life insurance under the Pradhan Mantra Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and accident insurance through Pradhan Mantra Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY). As on 7th August, 2017, total enrollment was 3.46 crore under the PMJJBY and 10.96 crore under PMSBY. In both schemes, close to 40 percent of the enrollees are women, the Minister added.

Speaking on the results of demonetization, the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that it has helped in reducing the volume of cash transactions and increase in digitisation, widening of the tax base and more formalization of the economy among others. He said that post demonetization, there is emphasis to reduce overall quantum of cash in the economy.

As regards Aadhar, the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that it has been an important leap forward for the country as now we are beginning to understand its full potential. He said that 92% of our people have Aadhar cards. Shri Jaitley further said that he is sure that Aadhar Legislation will stand the test of constitutionality. He said that Aadhar has helped in targeting the subsidies which, in turn, helped in avoiding wastage of resources. He said after implementation of Aadhar system, such Government support/subsidy is confined to the vulnerable and those who are entitled for the same. The Finance Minister said that since this financial assistance goes directly into the bank accounts of the deserving people, it has, in turn, helped in more operationalization of PMJDY bank accounts and thereby reducing drastically the number of dormant/non-operational accounts.

Concluding his Key Note Address, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the present Government has succeeded in the last three years in bringing financial inclusion on the centre stage of its political and economic agenda and in times to come, the policy makers will have to follow this direction only and will not be able to reverse this trend.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for release of additional 1% Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to pensioners. It will be applicable from 01.07.2017.

The release of the additional instalment of DA represents an increase of 1% over the existing rate of 4% of the Basic Pay/Pension, to compensate for price rise. This increase is in accordance with the accepted formula, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission.

The combined impact on the exchequer on account of both DA and DR would be Rs.3068.26 crore per annum and Rs.2045.50 crore in the financial year 2017-18 (for a period of 8 months from July, 2017 to February, 2018). This will benefit about 49.26 lakh Central Government employees and 61.17 lakh pensioners.

                Government has stepped up decisive action against companies falling within the ambit of Section 248 of the Companies Act. The names of 2,09,032 companies have been struck off from the Register of Companies under Section 248 (5) of the Act. The existing Directors and Authorized Signatories of such struck off companies will now become ex Directors or ex Authorized Signatories. These individuals will therefore not be able to operate bank accounts of such companies till such companies are legally restored under Section 252 of the Companies Act by an order of the National Company Law Tribunal. The restoration, as and when it happens shall be reflected by change in the status of the company from ‘Struck off’ to ‘Active’. 

Since such ‘Struck off`’ companies have ceased to exist, action has been initiated to restrict the operation of Bank accounts of such companies. The Department of Financial Services has, through the Indian Banks Association, advised all Banks that they should take immediate steps to put restrictions on bank accounts of such struck off companies. A list of such companies, Registrar of Companies wise, has been published on the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. 

In addition to such struck off companies, Banks have also been advised to go in for enhanced diligence while dealing with companies in general. A company even having an active status on the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs but defaulting in filing of its due Financial Statement (s) or Annual Return (s) of Particular of Charges on its assets on the secured loan should be seen with suspicion as, prima facie, the company is not complying with its mandatory statutory obligations to file this vital information for availability to its stakeholders.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into 4 more Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) during August, 2017. Out of these 4 Agreements, 3 are Unilateral and 1 is a Bilateral. The Bilateral APA is for international transactions between an Indian company and a UK-based company. This is the 8th Bilateral APA with the United Kingdom and 13th overall (the other 5 being with Japan).

With the signing of these 4 Agreements, the total number of APAs entered into by CBDT has reached 175. This includes 162 Unilateral APAs and 13 Bilateral APAs. In the current financial year, a total of 23 APAs (2 Bilateral and 21 Unilateral) have been signed till date.

The 4 APAs entered into during August, 2017 pertain to various sectors of the economy like Telecom, Banking, Manufacturing and Education. The international transactions covered in these agreements include payment of Royalty, Provision of IT Enabled Services, Provision of Software Development Services, Provision of Manpower Services, Import of Raw Materials, Export of Finished Goods, Provision of Engineering Design Services, etc.

The APA provisions were introduced in the Income-tax Act in 2012 and the “Rollback” provisions were introduced in 2014. The APA scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and setting the prices of international transactions in advance. Since its inception, the APA scheme has been well-accepted by taxpayers and that has resulted in more than 800 applications (both Unilateral and Bilateral) being filed so far in five years.

The progress of the APA scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA programme has been appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to address complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent manner.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) tax was introduced on 1st of July 2017.  The last date for payment of GST for the month of July 2017 was 25th August 2017.  Payment of GST is complete only when amount of tax payable is debited from electronic cash / credit ledger.

 

            Now late fee for all taxpayers who could not file GSTR 3B for the month of July 2017 has been waived, but not the interest on late payment of Tax liability.

 

            GSTR 1 is to be filed by all taxpayers by 5th of September 2017 and GSTR 2 and GSTR 3 to be filed by all taxpayers by 10th and 15th of September 2017 respectively.

 

            Taxpayers who have committed errors in GSTR 3B will be able to put the correct details in GSTR 1-2-3. However, interest will be leviable from all taxpayers who have not discharged their complete Tax liability for July 2017 by 25-08-2017.

 

            Furthermore, vide Circular dated 01-09-2017, procedure for systems based reconciliation of GSTR 1-2 with GSTR 3B has been clarified.

Since April-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Office (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, is bringing-out a Quarterly Report on Public Debt Management on regular basis. The Current Quarterly Report pertains to the quarter April-June 2017 (Q 1 FY 18).

 

            The liquidity in the economy remained in surplus, after the demonetization, during the quarter, which kept the yield environment low.  However, the cash position of the Government of India (GoI) was somewhat stressed during the quarter, due to mismatch in receipt and payment which is generally seen during the first half of the financial year. To tide over these mismatch in cash flows of GoI,  Cash Management Bills of varying durations amounting to Rs. 1,30,000 crore were issued during the quarter. CMBs of Rs. 40,000 crore were reedemed during the quarter itself. Govt. also took recourse to W&M advance from RBI during the spells of cash deficit and drew overdraft briefly during the quarter. However, through cash management guidelines, attempt was made to time expenditure as per receipt trends.

 

            The weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average yield (WAY) of the G-Sec issuance made during Q1 FY18 was 14.92 years and 7.01 per cent respectively. During Q1 FY18, Government issued dated securities worth Rs.1,68,000 crore (29.0 per cent of BE), higher than Rs. 1,65,000 crore (28.4 per cent of BE) in Q1 of FY 17. Auctions of both, Government dated securities and Treasury Bills during Q1 of FY18 were held smoothly.

 

            The Public Debt (excluding liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Central Government provisionally increased  by 3.6 per cent (provisional) in Q1 of  FY 18 on Q-o-Q basis. Internal debt constituted 93.0 per cent of Public Debt as at end-June 2017 while marketable securities accounted for 83.2 per cent of Public Debt.  About 26.6 per cent of outstanding stock has a residual maturity of up to 5 years at end – June 2017 or 5.3 per cent of outstanding stock will mature every year over the next five years, which implies that rollover risk in the debt portfolio continues to be low.

 

            G-Sec yields witnessed a volatile trend during the quarter but yields softened at the end of quarter.Yields hardened during Apr 2017 due to factors such as, cautious mood ahead of 1st Bi-monthly monetary policy of RBI for 2017-18 which maintained a hawkish stance and RBI deciding to maintain the status quo on its key policy rates, but narrowed key policy rate corridor around Repo rate to ±25bps [± 50bps earlier]. Incidences of devolvement of G-Secs on PDs, issuance of T-Bills of near 1 year term under MSS, wave of debt waivers announced by few States, which may lead to higher State borrowing, OMO sales by RBI, cut in SLR from 20.50% to 20% lowering the requirement of banks to hold G-Secs, geo-political issues etc. also contributed to the hardening of the yields from 6.65% at the beginning of the quarter to 6.99% during the quarter (May 2, 2017) . The trading volume of Government securities on an outright basis during Q1 FY 18 increased by 2.65 per cent over the previous quarter.

 

 

Full Quarterly Report on Public Debt Management is also attached here with for ready reference.

                India has registered a significant decline in Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). According to the just released SRS bulletin, IMR of India has declined by three points (8% decline), from 37 per 1000 live births in 2015 to 34 per 1000 live births in 2016, compared to two points decline last year. Not only this, India also recorded a major drop in birth cohort, which has for the first time come down to below 25 million. India has registered 90000 fewer infant deaths in 2016 as compared to 2015. The total number of estimated infant deaths have come down from 930000 (9.3 Lakhs) in 2015 to 840000 (8.4 lakhs) in 2016.

According to the SRS Bulletin the gender gap in India for child survival is reducing steadily. The gender difference between female and male IMR has now reduced to <10%, giving a major boost to the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme of the Government.

The results signify that the strategic approach of the Ministry has started yielding dividends and the efforts of focusing on low performing States is paying off. Among the EAG States and Assam, all States except Uttarakhand have reported decline in IMR in comparison to 2015. The decline is reported as 4 points in Bihar, 3 points in Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand and two points decline in Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Rajasthan.

These remarkable achievements in merely one year is also the result of a countrywide efforts to increase the health service coverage through various initiatives of the Government that includes strengthening of service delivery; quality assurance; RMNCH+A; human resources, community processes; information and knowledge; drugs and diagnostics, and supply chain management, etc.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India signed a Letter of Intent with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Norway to extend the cooperation within health sector through the Norway India Partnership Initiative (NIPI) for a period of three years starting from 2018, here today. Shri C K Mishra, Secretary (HFW) and His Excellency, Mr. Nils Ragnar Kamsvag, Ambassador of Norway signed this Letter of Intent. Shri Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary & Mission Director (AS&MD), Ms. Vandana Gurnani, JS (RCH), Dr. Tore Godal, Special Adviser to Prime Minister of Norway, Dr Maha-noor Khan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway were also present during the signing ceremony.

Through this letter, the cooperation between India and Norway will continue to be aligned with the development goals of the Indian Government as outlined in its National Health Policy 2017 for achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The cooperation shall focus on global health issues of common interest.

The partnership shall also include areas related to reproductive, maternal, new-born, child, adolescent health and health system strengthening, and shall build on experiences from NIPI phase I and II. The cooperation will continue to focus on innovative, catalytic and strategic support, taking the Indian Government’s Intensification Plan for Accelerated Maternal and Child Survival in India as the starting point.

The Governments of Norway and India had agreed in 2006 to collaborate towards achieving MDG 4 to reduce child mortality based on commitments made by the two Prime Ministers. The partnership was based on India's health initiative, the National Health Mission (NHM), and aimed at facilitating rapid scale-up of quality child and maternal health services in four high focus states - Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The main activities in Phase I (2006-2012) were home-based new born care (HBNC), Yashoda through State health system, establishing Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCU), techno managerial support, and providing strategic support for immunization and Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives.

The Governments of India and Norway decided to extend the partnership to coincide with the second phase of National Health Mission plan (NHM) for a period of five years (2013-17). Besides the four states already supported by NIPI, Jammu & Kashmir was added as a fifth state with NIPI being the lead partner for RMNCH+A activities.

Norway India Partnership Initiative (NIPI) through its work in the last ten years (2007-2017) has resulted in newer initiatives. In addition to trying out innovations, NIPI has also supported NHM by providing credible technical support in the five states and at national level. This has resulted in development and release of multiple policies and guidelines for the NHM.

                The second India-U.S. Health Dialogue (September 26-27, 2017) concluded in New Delhi today. The bilateral dialogue was jointly inaugurated by Shri C K Mishra, Secretary (MoHFW), Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary (DHR) and DG (ICMR), Mr. Garrett Grigsby, Director of Global Affairs at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Mr. Mark Anthony White, Mission Director, India, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 

Representatives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Affairs (OGA/HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/HHS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA/HHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH/HHS) and USAID interacted with their counterparts from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), and Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to encourage bilateral collaboration across several aspects of health pertinent to both nations. 

Addressing the participants, Shri CK Mishra, Secretary (H&FW) said that ""India and U.S. have a long history of health cooperation which has now started converging on the platform of the India-U.S. Health Dialogue. By institutionalizing the dialogue, we have reaffirmed our commitment to work together in the areas of health, for better addressing the health challenges faced by our people in both countries, such as cancer, R&D, communicable and non-communicable diseases, traditional medicines, access to medicines, food and drug regulation, antimicrobial resistance, etc. It is mutually beneficial for us to continue to engage on these and other health issues, to not only address our health challenges but to also, in the process, contribute to global health objectives and outcomes.” In its most comprehensive iteration yet, the 2nd Health Dialogue touched upon several issues of bilateral importance - communicable and non-communicable ‎diseases, health systems, biomedical research and low-cost innovations, science and health data, food and drug regulations, traditional medicine and access to medicines. Participants reaffirmed the commitment to strengthen scientific, regulatory, and health cooperation between the two nations and the global community; highlight priorities and ongoing activities, and exchange information on policies, regulations, research, technologies, programs, activities, and practices. The final goal is to identify emerging areas of mutual interest and facilitate the development of new collaborations. 

“Today’s India-U.S. Health Dialogue highlights the many areas of ongoing co-operation between India and the United States. These collaborations form a key part of our larger Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Working together, we can tackle problems relevant to both our nations, such as global health security, research on understudied diseases, and access to medicines” said Mr. Garrett Grigsby, Director of Global Affairs at HHS. 

In addition to the discussions at the Health Dialogue, the U.S. delegation visited several Indian institutes in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru to highlight collaborations to control and manage HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistance, cancer, acute encephalitis syndrome, mental health, vision and traditional medicine. The Health Dialogue’s closing ceremony was attended by U.S. Charge D’Affaires Ms. Mary Kay Carlson, who said, “The strong showing from ministries and agencies on both the U.S. and Indian sides shows the level of commitment to this relationship. We look forward to continued strong cooperation in the scientific, regulatory, and health sectors – not only between our two nations, but with the global community.” Discussions will be strengthened at the next U.S.-India Health Dialogue in Washington, DC.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister ShriNarendraModi has approved ex-post facto, the enhancement of superannuation age of doctors other than doctors of the Central Health Services (CHS) falling under various Departments/Ministries/autonomous organisations, to 65 years. Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda, welcomed the Cabinet decision and stated that it is a very visionary and pragmatic decision that will strengthen the health services in the country. “Through this forward looking step, the services of experienced doctors shall be available to bring quality health services to the people. It will help in retaining the existing strength of experienced doctors thereby providing better patient care satisfaction,” ShriNadda added. 

Terming the decision to be people-centered and pro-patient, ShriNadda further stated that it will address the shortage of doctors. “This is a strong signal that the Government is taking all steps to enhance services/service delivery.This would also help in improving doctor-patient ratio in the country,” ShriNadda said. 

Speaking further on the cabinet decision, ShriNadda said that the decision will help in proper academic activities in Medical Colleges as also in effective implementation of national health programmes for delivery of health care services. “The decision may not have much financial implications as large numbers of posts are lying vacant and the present incumbents would continue to work in their existing capacity against sanctioned posts. Around 1445 doctors of various Ministries/Departments of the Central Government would be benefitted,” ShriNadda informed. 

According to the Cabinet decision, the superannuation age of doctors under the administrative control of the respective Ministries/Departments [M/o AYUSH (AYUSH Doctors), Department of Defence (civilian doctors under Directorate General of Armed Forces Medical Service), Department of Defence Production (Indian Ordnance Factories Health Service Medical Officers), Dental Doctors under D/o Health & Family Welfare, Dental doctors under Ministry of Railways and of doctors working in Higher Education and Technical Institutions under Department of Higher Education) has been enhanced to 65 years. 

The Union Cabinet has approved ex-post facto, the enhancement of superannuation age of doctors working in Central Universities and IITs (Autonomous Bodies) under Department of Higher Education to 65 years; and approved enhancement of superannuation age of doctors in Major Port Trusts (Autonomous Bodies) under Ministry of Shipping to 65 years. 

The Union Cabinet has approved that doctors shall hold the administrative posts till the date of attaining the age of 62 years and thereafter their services shall be placed in non-administrative positions.

                Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda today expressed deep gratitude to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modiji for sanctioning AIIMS Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh. On behalf of the people of the hilly state of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Nadda thanked the Prime Minister for agreeing to lay the foundation stone of the premier national medical institute on 3rd October. 

The Union Health Minister stated that AIIMS Bilaspur is another milestone in the list of achievements of the NDA government in the health sector. Under the guidance and visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, the Ministry is fast moving in strengthening the tertiary care network in the country. He stated that AIIMS Bilaspur will provide the much needed tertiary medical services to a vast population of not only Himachal Pradesh but the other northern states too. 

Health forms a very crucial peg in the development story of any state, and with a pragmatic and progressive leader such as the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, the health sector of Himachal Pradesh is greatly benefitted. AIIMS Bilaspur, with its multiple disciplines, will herald the hilly state towards comprehensive development and growth, Shri Nadda stated.

The Union
Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval
for introduction of the Dentists (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in Parliament subject
to modifications of drafting or consequential nature, if any, as may be
considered necessary by the Legislative Department by amending the Dentists
Act, 1948 (16 of 1948). The amendment will reduce the redundancy.  

 

The clauses
being amended include those pertaining to certain modifications in the
provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948 with regard to: 

 

1.     
the Membership  of  the Dental Council
of India under clause (f) of   section 3 and

2.     
the  Membership  of  State  and  Joint 
State Dental Councils under clause (b) of section 21 and clause (b) of section
23 of the said Act.

 

Background:

 

As
per the existing Act, it was required to have the representation of dentists
registered in Part B as Central Government nominees in the Dental Council of
India and the election of four/ two members from Part B to the State/ Joint
State Dental Councils.  However, it has lost relevance. With a view to reducing
the redundancy of the provisions of their representation, the Central
Government has decided to delete these provisions so that their representation
does not remain mandatory any more.

At the event, Shri Choubey also felicitated the doctors, particularly the specialists who have successfully treated patients by e-application without actually visiting them in remote and far-flung areas. He further stated that new technology will not only enhance efficiency but will also bring greater transparency in the healthcare and health administration.

The Minister congratulated Dr. Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, Professor Deepak Aggarwal, Professor in-Charge Computer Facility and the organizing Committee of AIIMS for organizing the conference on highly contextual and important theme. The Minister also hoped that the e-Initiative of AIIMS would go a long way in implementing the Digital India vision of the Prime Minister.

                “The Health Ministry is committed to technology integration in the health sector. Digital technology can help to reduce health care costs overall, but we need to ensure our investment in new technologies is done cost effectively and frugally.” This was stated by Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare at the inaugural of 10th Medical Technology Conference, Medical Technology Shaping Universal Healthcare, organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), here today.

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel stated that the scope of digital technology in the public health sector has gone beyond service delivery. She further stated that the Health Ministry is already at the forefront of incorporating the benefits of digital technology towards achieving the goals elucidated in National Health Policy (2017) which are synchronous with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The National Health Mission (NHM) is already using throughout the country a web-based Health Management Information System(HMIS) to collect and collate data related to the health infrastructure.

Smt Anupriya Patel further informed that dispensing health insurance, registration of vital health statistics like births and deaths, monitoring of Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) through Geographical Positioning Systems(GPS) and preventing female foeticide through implementation of The Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition Of Sex Selection) Act 2003 Act are some of the additional tenets that are being brought online for ease of implementation, progressively decreasing costs and most importantly, increased accountability and transparency.

The Minister further stated that the government is committed to making India a manufacturing hub for medical devices as our medical technology industry is increasing manifolds and is expected to grow from 4.5 Billion US Dollars currently to 14 Billion US Dollars in 2022. “My Government has notified the Medical Devices Rules, 2017 and we are in the process of finalizing the Draft of Medical Device Regulation Bill for comprehensive regulation of the medical devices in the country,” she elaborated. She also added that to support the corresponding need for trained human resource, the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Ahmedabad has been mandated to initiate a National Centre for Medical Devices (NCMD) for development of skilled manpower.

Also present at the function were members of the medical technology industry including the science community, industry - big corporates as well as small and medium businesses represented by their associations, consumer and citizen organizations, international organizations and development partners, experts and government officials from central ministries and States and other key stakeholders.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched two new contraceptives, an injectable contraceptive MPA under the ‘Antara’ programme and a contraceptive pill, ‘Chhaya’, in the public health system to expand the basket of contraceptive choices to meet the emerging needs of couples. The contraceptives, which are available for free in Medical Colleges and District Hospitals at present, have so far been launched in 10 states that includes Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Haryana, West Bengal, Odisha, Delhi and Goa. The contraceptives are safe and highly effective, the ‘Antara’ injectable being effective for three months and the ‘Chayya’ pill for one week, and will help meet the changing needs of couples and help women plan and space their pregnancies. Training of healthcare practitioners from all the states has been completed as well, with a pool of state and district level doctors and staff nurses being trained to support the roll-out.

To help improve the supply and distribution of contraceptives, the Ministry had recently launched a new software, Family Planning Logistics Management Information System (FP-LMIS), designed to provide robust information on the demand and distribution of contraceptives to health facilities and ASHAs.

In addition, Mission Parivar Vikas, a central family planning initiative has also been launched by the Ministry. The key strategic focus of this initiative is on improving access to contraceptives through delivering assured services, ensuring commodity security and accelerating access to high quality family planning services.

• The mission is being implemented in 146 high focus districts with the highest total fertility rates in the country. These districts are in the seven high focus, high Total Fertility Rates (TFR) states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Assam, which constitute 44% of the country’s population.

• The main objective of the Mission Parivar Vikas family planning initiative is to bring down the Total Fertility Rate to 2.1 by the year 2025.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, through its sustained family planning efforts, aims to achieve its goal of increasing modern contraceptive usage and ensure that 74% of the demand for modern contraceptives is satisfied by 2020, with continued emphasis on delivering assured services, generating demand and bridging supply gaps. The Ministry’s focus remains on increasing awareness and demand through a holistic communications campaign that has simultaneously been rolled out across all states of India.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is observing National Nutrition Week from 1st September to 7th September, 2017. The theme of this year’s National Nutrition Week is “Optimal Infant & Young Child feeding Practices (IYCF): Better Child Health.” During this period, a week-long campaign is also being carried out to create mass awareness about the importance of appropriate nutrition in protection and promotion of health and wellbeing of children.

For promotion of Optimum IYCF practices, MoHFW has launched “MAA- Mothers’ Absolute Affection” programme to improve breastfeeding coverage and appropriate breastfeeding practices in the country. Around 3.7 lakhs ASHAs and around 82,000 healthworkers including programme managers at district and block level, doctors (MOs), staff nurses (SNs) and ANMs have been sensitized for breastfeeding promotion strategies under MAA programme and more than 23,000 health facility staffs (MOs, SNs and ANMs) are trained in IYCF training. In addition, more than 1.49 lakh mothers’ meetings were also carried out by ASHAs at village level to sensitize mothers regarding importance of appropriate breastfeeding practices.

Community sensitization activities such as mothers’ meetings and block/ district level workshops with programme managers, services providers’ e.g MOs, SNs and ANMs along with FLWs are also planned during the National Nutrition Week (NNW). Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs) will be held at village level in Anganwadi centres to increase the awareness and bring about desired changes in the IYCF practices in the community. In addition, “National Guidelines on Lactation Management Centres in Public Health Facilities” have been recently released to facilitate establishment of lactation management centres for ensuring that the sick and pre-term babies are fed with safe human breast milk.

Breastfeeding is an important, efficient and cost-effective intervention promoting child survival and health. Breastfeeding within an hour of birth could prevent 20% of the newborn deaths. Infants who are not breastfed are 15 times more likely to die from pnuemonia and 11 times more likely to die from diarrhoea than children who are exclusively breastfed, which are two leading causes of death in children under-five years of age. In addition, children who were not breastfed are at increased risk for diabetes, obesity, allergies, asthma, childhood leukaemia, sudden infant death syndrome etc. Apart from mortality and morbidity benefits, breastfeeding also has tremendous impact on improved IQ.

The trend of breastfeeding has shown an upward trend. As per recent data, initial breastfeeding has been nearly doubled in last decade. i.e from 23.4 per cent to 41.6 per cent (NFHs-3, 2005-06 and 4, 2015-16). Significant improvement has also been reported for exclusive breastfeeding as proportion of children under age 6 months exclusively breastfed, has gone up to 54.9 (NFHS-4) per cent from 46.4 per cent (NFHS-3). However, there is further scope of improving initial breastfeeding rates considering the high proportion of institutional deliveries in the country.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has exhorted young IAS probationers to help realise the Prime Minister’s dream of a New India. Addressing the Officers Trainees of 92nd Foundation Course at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA), Mussoorie in Uttarakhand today, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “You need to work hard to help the people. You have to create a sense of confidence among the people with your hard work.”

Noting that God has given them an opportunity to serve humanity and common citizens of the country, the Union Home Minister said the Officers should empathise with the citizens who come out with their problems. “You should not try to postpone the resolution of their problems,” he said, adding, “Your approach should never be individual centric. Always be system centric.”

Cautioning the young IAS Officers against harbouring egos, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “Ego is like a decimal point which if added before a number reduces the value of that number.” He also inspired them to remain committed to high moral values and become role models. “You will become role model for others only when you adhere to high moral values. You should always be cautious in public life,” he said, wishing the probationers a bright future and successful career.

The Union Home Minister will visit the Mana Border Out Post (BOP) of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) later today. During his four-day visit, Shri Rajnath Singh will also visit the Lapthal and Rimkhim Border BOPs of ITBP and witness Rock Climbing and Commando Storming Operations at ITBP’s Mountaineering and Skiing Institute, Auli. He will also inaugurate the Civic Action Programme and Blood Donation Camp at Joshimath.

Yesterday, Shri Rajnath Singh was received by Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat as he arrived in Dehra Dun on a four-day visit to the state. The two leaders later held talks on various issues.

                The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju has highlighted the need to strengthen the first responders by building their capacity to ensure swift and efficient response during a disaster. Delivering the valedictory address at the 13th Formation Day function of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) here today, with School Safety as its theme, Shri Rijiju said Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) education should be integrated into the school curriculum to give a fillip to the culture of disaster preparedness. 

Shri Rijiju said that under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has taken several steps towards building capacities in Disaster Management. Referring to the 10 point-agenda for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) given by our Prime Minister during the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) last year, Shri Rijiju said the Government is committed to the vision of a safer, stronger and resilient India. 

Underlining the fact that India is a disaster prone country and facing disasters is inevitable, Shri Rijiju said positive results in DRR can only be achieved with the participation of the State Governments, district and local administration and community-based organizations as the first responders in a disaster eventuality. He said the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has conducted training for earthquake preparedness at schools across the country and hundreds of school children have been sensitized. We will have to mainstream Disaster Management into our day-to-day activities, he added. 

Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, said education is the backbone of any kind of development and it starts from the school. He added that ensuring the safety of our schools and schoolchildren is absolutely necessary. Citing the examples of Gujarat and Latur earthquake, Dr. Mishra said after a disaster strikes, the reopening of schools helps boost morale of the victims and the affected people and rebuild lives. 

The Formation Day function of the NDMA was inaugurated by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh earlier today. Appreciating NDMA for its efforts to mainstream DRR in the country, Shri Singh reiterated India's commitment to stand with other countries on humanitarian issues, including disaster prevention, mitigation and response. 

Speaking during the Inaugural Session, the Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba said that legal and institutional systems in place for Disaster Management should be further strengthened. Speaking on the theme of ‘School safety’, he said that lot of school infrastructure is lost in disasters and education services also get affected in post-disaster phase. Children become more vulnerable, so special care and attention needs to be given to them, he added. 

Setting the agenda for the day, NDMA made a presentation on the National Disaster Management Guidelines on School Safety Policy. The Guidelines, released by NDMA in February last year, aim to strengthen the risk resilience of schools across the country. 

Secretary, Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Shri Anil Swarup spoke about the role of Education Departments in the implementation of these Guidelines. He said that implementation of the laws and regulations on ground is very important. He also said that the Department will extend all support in the efforts of NDMA for school safety. 

Various States shared their experiences in terms of Best Practices and lessons learnt in their initiatives towards school safety. They covered various aspects of school safety such as safety audits, capacity building and training, simulation exercises, structural safety and incorporation of Disaster Management in school curriculum.

Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) gave a detailed presentation on retrofitting of unsafe school buildings and explained how it is important for ensuring safety of schoolchildren. 

Representatives of schools spoke about how they ensure Disaster Preparedness and the key challenges that they face while implementing their DM Plans. They also highlighted the need for collaboration between school authorities and government agencies for school safety. 

In his welcome address, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA said that Disaster Management requires all stakeholders to come together to ensure implementation and monitoring of all initiatives. 

National Disaster Management Guidelines on Boat Safety and Cultural Heritage Sites & Precincts, and a study report on Chennai Floods of 2015 were also released during the day.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 13th Formation Day of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) here today. The theme of this year’s formation day is ‘School Safety’. 

Delivering the inaugural address, Shri Rajnath Singh said that NDMA has covered a long distance in short time span of 13 years since its formation. He said that NDMA has established credibility of India across world. He further said that there was no institutional framework for disaster management earlier, but after the setting up of NDMA, a mechanism has been developed not only for disaster management, but also for disaster risk reduction. He expressed happiness that India got appreciation due to NDMA’s work at Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on Disaster management held in Kyrgyzstan last month, where he had participated. He said that NDMA has done good work for enhancing the disaster management capabilities. The Home Minister said that he had also moved a proposal to organise a Joint Urban Earthquake Search and Rescue exercise to improve collective preparedness and this proposal was accepted unanimously by all the members of the SCO. 

The Home Minister said that all countries stand together when there is any humanitarian issue. He said that there could be differences on some issues among the countries, but we stand together in case of any disaster in the world. He said when any country enhances its capabilities and expertise; it gets success in getting others close to it. Shri Rajnath Singh said that every country has a boundary, but the nature does not recognise these boundaries. Any disaster happening in any country is bound to affect the neighbouring country in that geographical area, he added. He said that India had extended help to earthquake-hit Nepal in 2014 and also India had sent NDRF team to Japan for help. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that diplomatic efforts are also required in managing disasters arising out of floods. He said that hydrological data on rivers should be shared by the neighbouring countries and a consensus needs to be developed in this regard. He expressed hope that a beginning in this regard will be made during BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise next month. 

Speaking on this year’s theme of ‘school safety’, Shri Rajnath Singh congratulated NDMA for focussing on integrating children in their disaster management exercise. He said that the children can volunteer in this area and their energy and imagination can be of great help to NDMA. He further said that children should be involved based on their interest in this subject. He congratulated NDMA for making efforts for disaster safety and he expressed belief that NDMA will fulfil dream of a ‘Safe India’. 

The Union Home Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba said that legal and institutional systems in place for disaster management should be further strengthened. He said that our climatic conditions and density of population make us prone to disasters. He added that 2% of GDP is lost due to disasters. Shri Gauba said that now there is a paradigm shift from relief-centric approach to holistic approach towards disasters. Speaking on the theme of ‘School safety’, he said that lot of school infrastructure is lost in disasters and education services also get affected in post-disaster phase. Children become more vulnerable, so special care and attention needs to be given to them, he added. 

The Secretary, Department of School Education & Literacy, Shri Anil Swarup said that implementation of the laws and regulations on ground is very important. He also said that the department will extend all support in the efforts of NDMA for school safety. 

On the occasion, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA highlighted the activities undertaken by NDMA during the last one year since the last formation day. He said that in November last year, India had hosted the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) in New Delhi which was first such conference after Sendai framework. He said that New Delhi Declaration, Asian Regional Plan were adopted during the AMCDRR, 2016. He also said that second meeting of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction was held in New Delhi in May this year. He also informed that India is hosting first ‘BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise- 2017’ from 10th-13th October this year. He highlighted India’s efforts in conducting joint exercise by SAARC nations (SAADMEx) to respond to simulated disaster situations, urban flooding and cyclones. He also said that a comprehensive plan to mitigate the effects of earthquake and landslides is also being formed. 

During the event, a message of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was also presented to the participants. 

On the occasion, the Union Home Minster also released National Disaster Management Guidelines on Boat Safety and Cultural Heritage Sites & Precincts. A study report on “Tamil Nadu floods: Lessons learnt and best practices’’ was also released by Shri Rajnath Singh. 

During the event, the stakeholders are discussing the roadmap, their roles and key challenges in the implementation of the School Safety Policy across the country.

Over the years, tens of thousands of children around the world have been badly affected simply because their schools were not safe. It is, therefore, imperative that a safe environment for our children is created, starting from their homes to their schools and back.

Stakeholders will discuss the roadmap, their roles and key challenges in the implementation of the School Safety Policy across the country. States will share their experiences in terms of best practices and lessons learnt through their efforts towards school safety initiatives.

National Disaster Management Guidelines on Boat Safety and Cultural Heritage Sites & Precincts, and a study report on Chennai Floods of 2015 will also be released.

NDMA Members and officials, senior officials from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), Ministries/Departments of the Central Government, State Governments, Municipal Commissioners, District Collectors, NGOs, and ex-Members and Advisory Committee members of NDMA will participate in the event. Representatives of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), technical institutions, educational institutions such as Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, District Education Officers (DEOs), school principals, teachers and schoolchildren will also be present.

Discussions at the event will increase awareness and ensure better implementation of the School Safety guidelines. Shri Kiren Rijiju, MoS, Home Affairs, will deliver the valedictory address later in the afternoon.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has appealed the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) to withdraw the ongoing bandh in the Darjeeling Hills. He also asked the Union Home Secretary to convene an official level meeting in the Ministry of Home Affairs within a fortnight to discuss all related issues.

 

Following is the text of appeal of the Union Home Minister:

 

""On the call of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) an indefinite strike is currently on in the Darieeling Hills since 12-06-2017.

 

Eleven precious lives have been lost so far, several have been injured and the entire people of Darjeeling hills have suffered a lot since the strike. I have been pained immensely by what has happened in Darjeeling hills.

 

In a democracy, dialogue is the only way out to resolve any problem. Solutions can be found through restraint, mutual dialogue and within the legal ambit.

 

I have asked the Home Secretary to convene an official level meeting in the Home Ministry within a fortnight to discuss all related issues. I also appeal to the GJM and its leader Shri Bimal Gurung to withdraw the ongoing bandh and to help create a conducive atmosphere for allowing normalcy to return to the area, particularly in view of the festive season.”

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said that in Indian culture, the focus has always been on duties and not on rights; if everybody attends to his duties, the rights of all automatically get protected. He was addressing at a National seminar on Good Governance, Development and Human Rights, organized by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) here today. He said that the concept of Human Rights in the centuries old Indian ethos is rooted in peace, unlike the West where it shaped up with conflict post- World War-II. The concept of protection of Human Rights in India is linked with the wellbeing of the whole universe, wherein all elements live in mutual coexistence peacefully. This, he said, reflects even in our spiritual and divine invocations. 

Referring to the issue of governance, Shri Rajnath Singh said that any sovereign nation is free to take action against illegal migrants. He said that the issue of deportation of Rohingyas for India is not a matter of ego and confrontation but of principles. Those who, in the name of human rights, are expressing concern on the rights of others should bother first for the rights of the citizens of India. The citizens of the country have the first right on its resources and not the illegal migrants. Rohingyas are illegal migrants; they are not refugees for which a process is required to be completed, which they never followed. 

He said that India is not a signatory to International Laws on Refugees or to the UN Refugee Convention 1951, hence, the question of its violation does not arise. The principle of non-refoulement would apply to Rohingyas only if, they were given asylum in India. He said that the Government is very clear on the issue and to this effect has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. The Union Home Minister said the Government of India has extended aid to Bangladesh for the welfare of Rohingyas there. He described both Bangladesh and Myanmar as friendly countries and said that the State Counsellor of Myanmar, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has raised a ray of hope by saying that her country is prepared to take back Rohingyas. He expressed the hope that Myanmar would take some solid steps in this direction at the earliest. 

The Union Home Minister said that Good Governance, Development and Human Rights are an inseparable trio and the Government is committed to uphold them. Describing the seminar organized by the NHRC as very relevant, Shri Rajnath Singh said that development without bringing dignity to human life would be meaningless. He said that the PM Ujjwala Yojna was meant to ensure dignified life to crores of women and we believe development without dignity is of no use. He listed several measures and schemes introduced by the Government during the last three years, which are aimed at overall welfare of the people by bringing transparency and accountability in its initiatives so that benefits of welfare schemes reached out the real beneficiaries. He said that the Government aims to provide ‘Housing to All’ by 2022 and electricity to all villages. 

Earlier, inaugurating the seminar, Shri Justice H L Dattu, Chairperson, NHRC said that the universality of Human Rights, their focus on human dignity and their concern for accountability make them uniquely appropriate for reshaping notions of development, cooperation, good governance and combating discrimination and exclusion to reach the goal of achieving a society where ‘Human Rights for All’ becomes a reality. He said that for any country to find its due place among civilized nations, the most important factors are eradication of poverty and provision of healthcare, education and equitable life opportunities to all without distinction. Unfortunately, even after more than half a century of independence, our country stands only at the fringe on all these counts. Justice Dattu said that there is a need to bring together politics, economics and culture in a more symbiotic relationship to constructively contribute to humanity so that the human being can become the pivot around which all governance and development activities, policies and programmes can revolve. 

Shri Ambuj Sharma, Secretary General, NHRC, welcoming the participants, underlined the significance of the national seminar and how the Commission has been making efforts to strive for good governance both in-house and outside through its interventions and functioning. Dr. Ranjit Singh, Joint Secretary, NHRC in his introductory remarks emphasized the importance of good governance and development and how significant are these to the protection of human rights. 

The Seminar is divided into five technical sessions spread over two days. These are being chaired by NHRC Members and participants include domain experts and top government functionaries from the Centre, State Governments and Union Territories. The discussion will focus on the role of media in civil society in promoting good governance and human rights, discerning indicators of good governance, global best practices and impact of information technology on good governance, service delivery mechanism and measures to enhance transparency and accountability, health and Swachh Bharat initiatives, new paradigm and challenges in good governance with an Indian perspective. 

Union Minister for Law & Justice and Electronics and Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad will deliver the valedictory address in the concluding session tomorrow.

                The First ‘BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise- 2017’ (BIMSTEC DMEx-2017) will be conducted by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) as the lead agency from October 10-13, 2017 in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). This Exercise will be a platform for sharing Best Practices on all aspects of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), strengthening regional response and coordination for Disaster Management among the BIMSTEC member countries.

Delegates from all seven nations of the ‘Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation’ (BIMSTEC) grouping, - namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, representatives from Embassies/High Commissions of BIMSTEC nations in Delhi, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and Senior Officers from the Nodal Ministries are participating in the event.

At the 17th BIMSTEC Senior Officials Meeting held in Kathmandu, Nepal on February 7, 2017, it was decided that India would organize the first annual Disaster Management Exercise for the region.

The main focus of the BIMSTEC DMEx-2017 will be on testing the region’s preparedness and resilience towards effective activation of inter-Governmental interaction/dialogue/agreements for immediate deployment of regional resources for disaster response. It will help create synergy and synchronize efforts to institutionalize regional cooperation among the member countries. The exercise will help strengthen the effective utilization of the Search & Rescue Teams for Disaster Relief & Emergency Response, including Emergency Rapid Assessment Teams and Management of mass casualties especially in situations involving breakdown of infrastructure and communication.

At the end of the four-day Exercise, a publication will be brought out on the outcomes and recommendations of the Joint/Common Exercise and include Agreement among BIMSTEC Nations on regional cooperation for Disaster Management and Emergency Response. This would be presented to the BIMSTEC Leaders at the Summit to be hosted by Nepal in October/November, 2017.

The BIMSTEC DMEx-2017 is being conducted in two phases in Delhi and NCR. The main exercise will comprise of Table Top Exercise (TTX), Field Training Exercise (FTX) and After Action Review (AAR) which is scheduled for October 10-13, 2017. Earlier, the first phase comprising a Preparatory Meeting and field visit of site selected for FTX during the main exercise, was held in Delhi NCR on August 8-9, 2017.

India has been at the forefront of DRR efforts by hosting the South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise (SAADMEx) and the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR). India has also offered its expertise and capabilities in DRR such as the South Asia satellite, GSAT-9, and the Tsunami Early Warning Centre to other countries. Disaster Management was one of the important Agenda items the BIMSTEC leaders deliberated upon during the Goa BRICS Summit in October last year where BIMSTEC leaders were the Special Invitees.

The BIMSTEC region is home to around 1.5 billion people, constituting around 22% of the global population with a combined GDP of US $2.7 trillion economy. Majority of the BIMSTEC countries are situated in the South Asian Region (SAR), prone to natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, earthquakes, avalanches and drought.

Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh chaired a meeting of all concerned agencies and representatives of certain States to review the measures being taken to arrest the growing trend of cybercrime in the financial sector. He expressed concern over the disturbing rise in cyber frauds using cards and e-wallets in particular.

Officers from various agencies made presentations and appraised the Home Minister of the current trends of financial cybercrimes in the country and the steps being taken by their agencies to address this challenge. 

It has been noted that both legal and technological steps need to be taken to address this situation. Capacity Building of various stakeholders such as police officers, judicial officers, forensic scientists as well as officials in the banking sector has been identified as a key measure. It has been decided to expedite the implementation of cybercrime prevention initiatives in these agencies towards this end along with measures required to acquire critical cyber forensics equipment. 

The Union Home Minister directed all concerned agencies to undertake required measures in a time bound manner and emphasized on coordination of all concerned agencies in this regard. It was decided that an inter-ministerial committee may be set up to identify action points and monitor the implementation.

Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh operationalised the New Intelligence Set-up of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) at a function here today. This marked the culmination of a long pending aspiration of the Force following approval of the Union Home Minister. 

SSB has been declared as the Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) for both the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders. Thus, it was felt that a well knit intelligence network of the highest capabilities that can function and deliver would be the prime requirement of comprehensive Border Management. This was quite essential as the operations of SSB have to be Intelligence based so as to prevent criminals and smugglers from taking advantage of the friendly borders with Nepal and Bhutan. MHA has accordingly sanctioned 650 posts in various ranks from Battalion to Frontier Headquarters. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said the job of SSB is much more demanding and challenging since it is vested the responsibility of guarding open borders unlike other borders. This makes the task much more challenging and demands highest alertness to check illegal activities like smuggling of arms, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN), drugs and human-trafficking. 

Commending the leadership shown by Smt. Archana Ramasundaram, who is the first woman to head any CAPF, the Union Home Minister said she has proved her mettle by leading a paramilitary force with exemplary skills. Shri Rajnath Singh cautioned the Forces’ personnel to keep a tab on rumour-mongering over the social media. Assuring the Government’s concern about the welfare of the CAPF personnel and their families, the Union Home Minister said he has taken steps to ensure a martyr’s family gets atleast Rs. 1 crore compensation. He urged the CAPF Officers each to adopt a CAPF martyr’s family. 

On the occasion, the Union Home Minister launched the Welfare and Rehabilitation Board (WARB) Mobile App for CAPF personnel. The App is available on Google Play store and is user friendly. It contains various useful features to facilitate retired CAPFs and Assam Rifles personnel to get their genuine grievances redressed, seek skill development training through National Skill Development Corporation under “Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, re-employment and other relevant and important information. This mobile App shall also help retired personnel to have better co-ordination with WARB and its field formation at states/UTs and district level. 

Later Shri Rajnath Singh released the book “Pride of India”, a compilation on SSB martyrs and awardees. He also distributed scholarships to children of SSB martyrs. 

Till date 43 Officers and personnel of SSB have sacrificed their lives for national security. This year Shri Amal Sarkar made the supreme sacrifice after gunning down one militant in an encounter with NDFB militants in Chirang district of Assam. 

SSB Wives’ Welfare Association “SANDIKSHA” has taken up the task to help out wards of such martyrs under the ‘Sanrakshan’ scheme. “SANDIKSHA” is providing financial help to children of martyrs who are still studying in school, colleges and universities to continue their studies. 

In his address MoS (Home) Shri Hansarj Gangaram Ahir said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has laid emphasis on Police Modernization and the Government is committed to carry it forward. 

Welcoming the new Intelligence Wing of the SSB, Director, Intelligence Bureau, Shri Rajiv Jain said it will act like a force multiplier. Directors-General of CAPFs were present on the occasion. 

Director General, SSB, Smt. Archana Ramasundaram said that the Force’s Operations are mostly based on Intelligence hence the new Intelligence set-up will help effective guarding of India’s open borders with Nepal and Bhutan. The Force has undertaken Modernization programme and the SSB has acquired two UAVs while the MHA has approved three Bomb Detection and Disposal squads for the SSB, she added.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme to enhance the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers to respond to CBRN emergencies, encompassing threats emanating from the use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material at the airports. 

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS). 

""It is one major step towards enhancing CBRN safety at our airports"" said Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA while highlighting the fact that handling CBRN emergencies need specialised skills and efforts. 

The training programme, which started today at the Kamaraj Airport in Chennai, was inaugurated by Dr. S. Christopher, Secretary, Department of Defence Research & Development and Chairman, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). 

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination, including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Apart from equipping the airport emergency handlers to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. A total of 200 personnel will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies during the week-long training. 

""Even a small CBRN related event can cause panic among people at the airports. It is, therefore, important that airport emergency handlers are able to respond appropriately till the arrival of highly trained and better equipped response teams,"" said Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA. This is the first in a series of such training programmes that have been planned for various airports across the country.

                While participating in the nation-wide programme of ‘Swachchta Hi Seva Hai’ in the premises of Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (TRIHMS), Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh today coinciding with the birthday of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Vishwakarma Puja, Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju passionately appealed the people of the state to make cleanliness drive a habit and daily routine. 

Shri Rijiju told the huge gathering that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was very concerned about the health of all the Indians and had asked the country men to make Swachchta a mission a goal to cherish in order to build a clean and healthy India. Shri Rijiju urged everyone to take proper care of their health by keeping the surroundings they live in and their houses neat and clean, adding that most of the diseases were caused by the unhygienic surroundings. While expressing his grave concern over the increasing numbers of cancer patients, most of them at last stage, being evacuated to Delhi and other metros for treatment, the minister assured to grant Rs 40 crores to establish a cancer unit in the TRIHMS to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of cancer at early stage. He said that he was fully alive to the lack of infrastructure in the hospitals and health centres in the state and assured to provide Ambulance and Hearse to all the hospitals and health centres in the state. While expressing his concern over the unplanned growth of the twin capital, the minister said that the people must change their mindset and strive hard to make Itanagar a model city by creating a clean and beautiful ambience to attract tourists from across the globe. He urged the people to love their state and make a difference by their continued and persistent effort to keep every nook and corner of the state clean and green. 

The Deputy Chief Minister Mr. Chowna Mein while participating in the Swachchta programme extended his greetings to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on his birthday on behalf of the Chief Minister and the state government. He urged the people to create awareness on the importance of cleanliness all over the state. 

The Swachchta Hi Sewa Hai programme will culminate on 2nd October, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. Later, Shri Rijiju and other dignitaries planted saplings along the roads in the campus of the newly built Inter State Bus Terminal at Lekhi in Naharlagun.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh will operationalise the New Intelligence Set-up of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) at a function here on September 18, 2017. On the occasion, he will also launch the Welfare and Rehabilitation Board (WARB) App and distribute scholarship to the children of SSB martyrs. 

The SSB has been mandated the responsibility of guarding the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders where there are no restrictions on the movement of people on either side. The border population on both sides has strong regional, cultural and economic ties. There is trans-border movement of criminals and anti-national elements which pose a major challenge on the border in the context of the visa free regime. Besides, SSB has also been declared as the Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) for both the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders. Thus, it was felt that a well knit intelligence network of the highest capabilities that can function and deliver would be the prime requirement of comprehensive border management. This was quite essential as the operations of SSB have to be intelligence based so as to prevent criminals and smugglers from taking advantage of the friendly borders with Nepal and Bhutan. MHA has accordingly sanctioned 650 posts in various ranks from Battalion to Frontier Headquarter. 

The Mobile App named “WARB” is available on Google Play store and is user friendly. It contains various useful features to facilitate retired CAPFs and Assam Rifles personnel to get their genuine grievances redressed, seek skill development training through National Skill Development Corporation under “Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, re-employment and other relevant and important information. This mobile App shall also help retired personnel to have better coordination with WARB and its field formation at states/UTs and district level. 

It’s a matter of great pride that 43 Officers and personnel of SSB have sacrificed their lives for national security. In this year only in Chirang district of Assam Shri Amal Sarkar in an encounter with NDFB militants not only killed one militant but also sacrificed his life. SSB’s Women Welfare Association “SANDIKSHA” has taken up the task to help out children of such martyrs. SSB’s Women Welfare Association is providing financial help to children of martyrs who are still studying in school, colleges and universities to continue their studies.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju will inaugurate the 2-day National Conference on “Uniformed Women in Prison Administration” here tomorrow.

The Conference is being organised for women officers of the rank of Jailors to Dy. Superintendents of Prisons. This Conference will have Panel Discussions, Deliberations and Syndicate Discussions on 4 themes:

• Are Woman Prison Officers getting mainstream duties?

• Difficulties in balancing family and work environment of Women Prison Officers.

• Training needs of Woman Prison Officers and Correctional Staff

• Is there need for change of uniform for Woman Prison Officers?

All the syndicates will make presentations based on their interactive session with different State Prison Officers, Academicians, Representatives from NGOs and students. It will be followed by an open house interaction, in which participants will be encouraged to interact to share their problems, ideas and experiences in connection with their day-to- day work in prisons as well as dealing with prison inmates.

The Conference is expected to benefit the participants being in their impressionable stage of service, by implementation of the knowledge gained through the Conference. Repeated exposure/training will inculcate attitudinal change and reorientation of work culture of officers, leading to tangible deliverables. The sharing of best practices will motivate the prison officers and correctional staff and encourage others to evolve and adopt similar practices in their districts. It will help acquire latest technology to provide citizen-centric services in a time bound manner. The Uniformed Woman Officers will navigate towards gender equality in working environment. It will help bridge the gap between theory and practice through exchange of ideas.

The BPR&D charter includes study of problems affecting the Prison Administration and promotion of research and training in this field. Our country has 1401 prisons, 17834 women prison inmates and around 3200 women officers out of the 55000 total prison officers and staff. Review and discussion on circumstances and environment under which prison officers discharge their duties is imperative in the context of the objectives of correctional administration including reformation rehabilitation and re-socialisation of prison inmates.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Armenia on Cooperation in the field of Disaster Management 

The MoU would enhance cooperation in the field of Disaster Management and contribute to the well-being and safety of the people of both the countries in the event of disaster. It will also result in exchange of information in the relevant fields of disaster management which is of mutual interest. 

Further, the MoU seeks to put in place a system, whereby both India and Armenia will be benefited from the disaster management mechanisms of the other country and will help in strengthening the areas of preparedness, response and capacity building.

Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh visited the Jammu and Kashmir Police Lines and CRPF camp in Anantnag district today. He was accompanied by the State’s Deputy Chief Minister Dr. Nirmal Kumar Singh and Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba. 

On the second day of his visit to J&K, Shri Rajnath Singh also paid rich tributes to Constable Imtiyaz Ahmed, who was killed in a terrorist attack on a police patrol yesterday barely a kilometer away from the venue of today’s meeting of the Union Home Minister at the J&K Police Lines, and Assistant Sub Inspector Abdul Rasheed who was martyred in a terrorist attack in Anantnag last month. 

“This is not an ordinary sacrifice, this is the supreme sacrifice,” said Shri Rajnath Singh, addressing the J&K Police personnel. “I am short of words to salute your bravery in the line of duty, even the Prime Minister has praised your courage,” he added. The Union Home Minister said it’s not only the J&K State, but the whole nation is proud of the bravery and valour of the Security Forces in facing the terrorism sponsored by the neighbouring country. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government is fully aware of the extremely challenging circumstances the Police and Security Forces are working under, and is making all out efforts for the security and welfare of the Police and Paramilitary personnel. He said a trauma centre has been sanctioned and bullet proof vehicles will be provided at all police stations in the State. The Union Home Minister said the Centre has also released adequate funds for procurement of bullet proof vehicles vests and latest equipments for Police Stations. 

The Union Home Minister said that the nation is indebted to the supreme sacrifices and no amount of money can compensate these sacrifice. He said we will again make J&K into a “heaven on earth” and no force can stop the country from achieving this goal. Shri Rajnath Singh said this is his fifth visit to the State within the space of a year. Reiterating the commitment of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Union Home Minister assured that the Centre will provide all assistance to the State, including resolving the Housing problem of the jawans. 

The Union Home Minister later addressed a Sainik Sammelan at the CRPF 90 Battalion Camp in Anantnag. “Courage is not something that can be bought from the market; you are born with unassailable and unmatched courage,” he said. Assuring that the Centre is ready to extend more facilities to the CRPF personnel, Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government will consider providing helicopter services to the CRPF personnel in J&K. The Union Home Minister said, “It is my aim to provide at least Rs. 1 crore to the families of our martyrs from the CAPFs.” He said the Government launched the “Bharat ke Veer” portal to support the families of our martyrs and the nation as a whole has given tremendous support to their cause. 

The Union Home Minister also interacted with the J&K Police and CRPF personnel. 

Earlier, addressing the State Police personnel, Director General of Police, J&K, Dr. SP Vaid underlined the need for providing a safe and secure environment to the families of the Police personnel. Despite inadequate infrastructure and maintenance grant and the enemy’s nefarious designs to demonize the Police personnel through the social media, they are performing the most difficult task with utmost bravery and devotion.

HUA Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri says country can’t be made clean without fixing Delhi’s garbage crisis

Invokes the pride of being a resident of national capital to spur people into action

 

Stressing that the country can’t be made clean without fixing the garbage problem in Delhi that has reached crisis proportion, Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri today invoked the pride of being a resident of the national capital to spur people into collective action for effective solid waste management.

Shri Puri today participated in the ‘Swachhat Hi Sewa’ campaign at Bhikaji Cama Place in South Delhi by sweeping and collecting the litter and later addressed the people, sanitation workers and officials of the Ministry and South Delhi Municipal Corporation  who undertook shramdan along with him. He also inaugurated modern litter pickers imported by South MCD.

The Minister noted that being a citizen and resident of Delhi is a ‘matter of pride’ and is a unique privilege that brings several advantages in the form of better services and amenities not available in other cities. He quoted the example of Delhi Metro on which the central and State Governments incurred huge expenditure with more in the offing. Shri Puri said this pride would however, be punctured if Delhi is  not made clean and the garbage issue was not addressed properly.

Urging the people of Delhi into effective action, Shri Puri said “I would like to invoke that pride of being residents of the national capital and shed lethargy and make due contribution to effective solid waste management so that we can overcome the garbage which is threatening to adversely impact the lives of all”.

Shri Puri observed that the central  government has accorded sanitation higher priority over even economic transformation given its importance in several ways. He said the intent, passion and energy with which Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been piloting Swachh Bharat Mission has resulted in an unprecedented ‘individual connect’ with sanitation across the country. This has led to construction of about five crore toilets across the country including over 38 lakh in urban areas in a short span of three years.

Stating that solid waste management in cities is the major challenges in urban areas over the next two years of the mission, Shri Puri stressed on the need to convert the ‘individual connect’ with sanitation demand  into ‘social connect’ to ensure the success of the solid waste management chain through collective action. Noting that people have a better connect with immediate neighborhood, the Minister unveiled ‘My Home-My Neighborhood’ (Ghar Bi Saaf-Pados Bhi Saaf) campaign with the following six components:

1.Segregation of waste at source

2. Compost  making from wet waste within the premises/neighborhood/area

3. Recycling of dry waste

4.Freeing the neighborhood from open defecation and open urination

5. Motivating the residents of neighborhood against throwing  garbage in open spaces; and

6.Adopting a near by park or open place for collection and waste segregation.

 

Shri  Puri said this neighborhood action plan leads to substantial reduction in the quantum of solid waste sent to landfill  besides enabling better performance of Waste-to –Compost and Waste-to-Energy plants. Neighborhood could be a residential housing society, a colony,mohalla,  market area etc., he said.  

The Minister said this neighborhood action plan will be  launched in all the cities and towns across the country on the occasion of the third anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission on the second of next month and appealed to the residents of Delhi to take the lead in making a success of it so that their pride is not punctured.

Shri Puri watched a nukkad performance by the students of Malviya Nagar SDMC School on the causes and consequences of poor hygiene and the need for citizen participation in ensuring a Clean India. Appreciating the performance, the Minister encouraged the students by paying a cash of Rs.1,000.

Shri Puri inspected the Bhikaji cama Place area and expressed concern over poor maintenance of buildings and urged the Municipal Commissioner of SDMC to take necessary action.

Ms. Kamaljeet Sherawat, Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Dr.Puneet Goyal, Commissioner of SDMC besides senior officials of the Ministry and SDMC and the public participated in shramdan.

                The central government today announced that the benefit of interest subsidy of about Rs.2.60 lakh on home loans under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) will now be available for beneficiaries belonging to Middle Income Groups (MIG) fir fifteen more months beyond December this year.

This was announced by Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (Housing & Urban Affairs), Government of India, while addressing the ‘Real Estate and Infrastructure Investors Summit’ organized by NAREDCO, in Mumbai today. He said that the government decided to give more time for MIG beneficiaries to avail interest subsidy under PMAY(Urban).

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, in his announcement on the 31st of December last year made applicable the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under PMAY(Urban) to MIG, till the end of December this year. Under CLSS, MIG beneficiaries with annual income of above Rs.6.00 lakhs and up to Rs.12.00 lakhs would get an interest subsidy of 4.00% on a 20 year loan component of Rs.9.00 lakhs. Those with annual exceeding Rs.12.00 lakhs and up to Rs.18.00 lakhs would get interest subsidy of 3.00%.

Reiterating the Government’s commitment to meet the Housing for All targets in urban areas by 2022, Shri Mishra urged private investors to invest in affordable housing, being promoted by the Government in a big way with several incentives and concessions.

Shri Mishra later an hour long discussions with a 30 member delegation of NAREDCO and assured them that the Government would look into various issues raised by them in all sincerity and possible interventions would be considered.

The delegation referred to what they called anomalies in GST rates for completed and under construction housing projects, Stamp Duties being higher and kept outside the purview of GST, scarcity of land, delays in granting construction permits, lack of coordination among different municipal agencies, RBI’s high risk weightage for lending to real estate sector despite Real Estate Act coming into force, inadequate bank financing despite Non-Performing Assets in respect of construction being much less than other sectors etc.

The delegation expressed concern over GST and other taxes accounting for over one third of the cost of residential properties.

Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, who addressed the summit yesterday suggested to NAREDCO to have a detailed discussion with Secretary(HUA) for resolving the issues so that affordable housing could be given a boost.

                Central Government today announced a new PPP Policy for Affordable Housing that allows extending central assistance of up to Rs.2.50 lakh  per each house to be built by private builders even on private lands besides opening up immense potential for private investments in affordable housing projects on government lands in urban areas.

Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri announced this policy that gives eight PPP (Public Private Partnership) options for private sector to invest in affordable housing segment. He was addressing the ‘Real Estate & Infrastructure Investors Summit-2017’ organized by real estate body NAREDCO in Mumbai.  Shri Puri explained that this policy seeks to assign risks among the government, developers and financial institutions, to those who can manage them the best besides leveraging under utilized and un-utilized private and public lands towards meeting the Housing for All target by 2022..

The two PPP models for private investments in affordable housing on private lands include extending  central assistance of about Rs.2.50 lakh per each house as interest subsidy on bank loans as upfront payment under the Credit Linked Subsidy Component (CLSS) component of Pradhan Mantri Awas yojana (Urban). Under the second option, central assistance of Rs.1.50 lakh per each house to be built on private lands would be provided, in case the beneficiaries do not intend to take bank loans.

Shri Puri stated that eight PPP options, including six for promoting affordable housing with private investments using government lands have been evolved after extensive consultations with States, promoter bodies and other stakeholders. The six models using government lands are:

1.DBT Model: Under this option, private builders can design, build and transfer houses built on government lands to public authorities. Government land is to be allocated based on the least cost of construction. Payments to builders will be made by the public authority based on progress of project as per agreed upon milestones and buyers will pay to the Government.

2. Mixed  Development Cross –subsidized Housing : Government land to be allotted based on number of affordable houses to be built on the plot offered to private builders,  cross subsidizing this segment from revenues from high end house building or commercial development.

3. Annuity Based Subsidized Housing: Builders will invest against deferred annuity payments by the Government. Land allocation to builders is based on unit cost of construction.

4. Annuity-cum-Capital Grant Based Affordable Housing: Besides annuity payments, builders could be paid a share of project cost as upfront payment.

5. Direct Relationship Ownership Housing: As against government mediated payments to builders and transfer of houses to beneficiaries in the above four models, under this option, promoters will directly deal with buyers and recover costs. Allocation of public land is based on unit cost of construction.

6. Direct Relationship Rental Housing:  Recovery of the costs by builders is through rental incomes from the houses built on government lands.

Under these six Government land based PPP models, beneficiaries can avail central assistance of Rs.1.00 to Rs.2.50 lakh per house as provisioned under different components of PMAY(Urban). Beneficiaries will be identified as per the  norms of PMAY(Urban).

Shri Puri expressed concern over the private sector so far not entering affordable housing segment despite huge scope for the same under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana(Urban) and an enabling eco-system put in place through several concessions and incentives offered including the grant of infrastructure status for this segment.       

Referring to the ‘Way Forward’ for heralding a new era of growth in real estate sector suggested by KPMG and NAREDCO in a publication last month, Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri said that the Government has already initiated action in respect of each of the suggestions made therein. Elaborating on this, Shri Puri said that only last week he announced a time bound review of FSI/FAR norms in 53 cities with  a population of million and above each and State capitals to enable better utilization of scarce urban land parcels.

The Minister informed that a view would soon be taken on allowing urban housing projects in peripheral villages and talks are going on this regard with the Ministry of Rural Development. Online mechanism for time bound approvals for building plans and construction permits has already been introduced in Mumbai and Delhi and the same would happen soon in 53 cities with population of above one million each, he said. Shri Puri informed  that Model Tenancy Act and National Rental Housing  Policy would be announced soon.

Shri Puri exhorted private developers to seize the investment opportunities in affordable housing in the prevailing enabling environment saying ‘’It is time to stop debate and swing into action”.

                The Andhra Pradesh Government today assured the centre that over five lakh affordable houses will be built in urban areas of the State under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) in the next fifteen months. 

Progress of PMAY(Urban) in the State was discussed in detail when the Andhra Pradesh Minister of Housing & Urban Development Dr.P.Narayana met the Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri here today. Noting that Andhra Pradesh was sanctioned the highest number of houses under PMAY(Urban), Shri Puri enquired about the progress of this mission in Andhra Pradesh. 

Dr.P.Narayana informed Shri Puri that the State Government spent considerable time in identifying appropriate technology for constructing houses under PMAY(Urban) while at the same time conforming with the norms for disaster resilience etc. He said that after detailed consideration, the State Government chose ‘shear wall’ technology for this purpose and recently Foundation Stone was laid for construction of over one lakh dwelling units under PMAY(Urban). 

Dr.Narayana also stated that construction of 5.39 lakh houses for urban poor sanctioned by the central government under PMAY(Urban) will be completed in the next fifteen months. 

Shri Hardeep Singh Puri complimented the Andhra Pradesh Government for this commitment and also for good performance under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban).

   Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri today announced a Rs.300 cr action plan for a visible improvement in Solid Waste Management in Delhi. Addressing the  ‘Public Affairs Forum of India’ here today, the Minister said this initiative will be supported by the Ministry from the ‘Urban Development Fund’ operated by Delhi Development Authority.

            Shri Puri informed that under the Plan, automated machinery, equipment and other systems will be procured for better collection, transport and storage of garbage, decentralized treatment and better maintenance of sewers and drains. Soon after assuming office, Shri Puri raised the issue of garbage problem in the national capital during a discussion on Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) in the Ministry on the fifth of this month and desired an action plan for improving the situation.

            North, South and East Municipal Corporation of Delhi will spend Rs.100 cr each on procuring a total of 549 units of modern equipment. An assistance of Rs.80 cr will be provided to each MCD from the Urban Development Fund. All equipment including treatment plants are to be procured and commissioned by the end of this year.

            This initiative will quickly add a waste treatment capacity of 670 metric tons of bio-degradable waste besides preventing release of foul gases, smell and proliferation  of germs, pathogens, pests etc.

                Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs is considering market borrowings to incentivize speedy execution of urban infrastructure projects under various new urban missions launched over the last two years. this was stated by the Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri while addressing ‘Public Affairs Forum of India’ on challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization here today.

Shri Puri said “To overcome the severe infrastructure deficit accumulated over long years, huge order of investments is required. To meet various contingencies and to ensure fund availability to meet the targets under new urban missions, we are thinking of mobilizing resources from the market. We have undertaken an assessment of requirement of funds till 2022 and likely flow of funds. To ensure assured fund flow, setting up of a Special Purpose Vehicle to tap the market is under examination. Once this idea is firmed up, we will take it forward in an appropriate manner”.

The Minister assured that the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will spare no efforts to realize a new Urban India and will work shoulder to shoulder with State and city governments in the true spirit of Team India. He further noted “These are happening times in India and Urban India is an integral part of this exciting and challenging journey. I am confident that success will be with the people of India”.

Elaborating on the ongoing efforts to further improve urban governance, planning and execution, Shri Puri announced that a comprehensive evaluation of implementation and outcomes of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) will be undertaken which will serve several purposes, it being the first concerted effort to make a difference in urban sector. He said “The terms of evaluation will cover the extent of realization of stated goals of JNNURM, an assessment of improvement in urban governance further to implementation of reforms, identification of lacunae and reasons for shortfall in physical and financial progress. This evaluation will provide useful guidance to city and State Governments in the context of current thrust on urban rejuvenation”.

JNNURM was implemented during the period 2005-14, before it was wound up by the previous government. This government, however, continued to finance some of the incomplete projects based on certain criteria, to enable their completion.

Referring to the impact on the ground of new urban missions, Shri Puri said that though the new Missions like Smart City Mission, AMRUT and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) were launched only a little over two years back, substantial work is being executed on the ground with hundreds of projects under implementation. He asserted that visible impact will be visible in the next few months and expressed confidence that targeted outcomes will be achieved within given time frames. To prove his point, the Minister gave an account of performance during 2014-17 and the earlier ten years.

Elaborating on the paradigm shift in urban development approach of this Government, the Minister said “The city level action plans for improving urban infrastructure under different new missions have not been drafted in Delhi. They all emanated from the ground level and are collective expression of the aspirations of the citizens and city governments. Ownership of these plans is with them and not with Delhi. So, they have the obligation of ensuring their timely implementation”.

Shri Puri announced that a National Conclave of States and Union Territories will be organized for a high level mid-tem review with Ministers of the progress of various urban missions, for sharing of experiences for mutual benefit and a structured discussion on speeding up of implementation to meet time bound targets.

                            Central government has asked the States to focus on early implementation of smart city projects that have a visible and transformative impact in the lives of citizens in identified smart cities. Further to review of Smart City Mission by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during PRAGATI on the 30th of last month, Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (Housing & Urban Affairs) wrote to the Chief Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories in this regard the next day.



            Shri Mishra urged the States and UTs to ensure commencement of work by November this year on 261 impactful smart city projects in 60 cities that were announced during January- September, 2016. These identified projects accounts for an investment of Rs.31,112 cr . States and UTs have also been asked to speed up work on 370 PPP projects that involve an investment of 32,410 cr.  

            The impactful projects identified range from building 40 outdoor fitness centres in New Delhi Municipal Council area at a cost of Rs.1.31 cr to redevelopment of 340 acre area in Bhopal at a cost of Rs.3,000 cr.

                The new Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has said “ The Urban housing and development challenges are daunting and transformative and I intend to give my best to meet the targets under various new urban missions”.

Shri Puri spoke to media after assuming office in Nirman Bhawan here today. Speaking about his priorities, he said “The priorities for urban sector have already been outlined by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and I would like to work on them”. He further said that the Prime Minister who has the mandate of the people is transformative in several ways and the new ministers would like to draw upon their strengths to achieve the tasks given by the Prime Minister.

Shri Puri noted that the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs is a hard core development oriented ministry and various new urban missions launched over the last three years have been doing well on ground and ‘’I have no doubt we are on way to accomplishing the tasks in given timelines”.

Responding to a question on how does he look at the challenge of achieving targets under various missions, Shri Puri said “There are two sets of targets viz., some to be achieved by 2019 and some by 2022. If challenges are not met in two years, they can’t be met even in six years. Going by the progress on ground, they can be met”.

The new Minister later held a two hour review of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and elicited information about various aspects of the target of ensuring decent pucca houses to all the needy urban poor by 2022. He also queried about the expected demand for affordable housing in urban areas besides well performing and not so well performing States and reasons thereof.

Shri Puri will be attending the inauguration of first phase of 8.50 km stretch of Lucknow Metro between Transport Nagar and Charbagh tomorrow.

                City governments in Uttar Pradesh will provide an additional assistance of Rs.12,000 per each individual household toilet to be built in the urban areas of Uttar Pradesh to enable all the 655 statutory cities and towns in the State become ‘Open Defecation Free (ODF)’ by October, 2022, under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on October 2, 2014.

            The decision regarding additional assistance for toilet building was taken during a high level review of progress in Uttar Pradesh of new urban missions launched by the central government during the last three years. The three hour long  review held in Lucknow today was chaired by Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (Housing & Urban Affairs), Government of India and Shri Rajiv Kumar, Chief Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh. National and State level Mission Directors of six new urban missions besides senior officials of central and state governments attended the review.

            In Uttar Pradesh, construction of about eight lakh individual household toilets is being targeted out of which 1.56 lakh toilets have so far been built. Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), central and state governments provide assistance of Rs.4,000 each viz., a total of Rs.8,000 per each toilet. Urban Local Bodies will now provide an additional Rs.12,000 each to give a momentum to toilet building. Grants given to city governments under the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission will be used for this purpose, the State official explained.

            Shri Mishra complimented the State Government for its efforts to speed up implementation of new urban missions. Areas that needed improvement were also identified and discussed in detail. The review covered implementation of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart City Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -NULM.

             Under Atal Mission, 13.30 lakh urban households in Uttar Pradesh will be provided tap water connections, informed the officials. Water supply and sewerage networks are being improved in the State under this mission with  an investment of Rs.11,176 cr. Parks and open spaces are being developed in cities and towns at a cost of Rs.246 cr.  

            Shri Rajiv Kumar, Chief Secretary (Uttar Pradesh) directed the concerned officials to ensure that adequate number of housing proposals are sent to the centre regularly over the next one year for approval so as to meet the demand for affordable housing in the State. He also directed to ensure time bound implementation of various projects in Varanasi.

            After the official level review, Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary to Government of India met the Chief Minister Shri Yogi Adityanath and briefed him about the urban missions. Chief Minister was given a detailed account of Varanasi development projects including redevelopment of Varanasi Nagar Nigam building. Chief Minister suggested to Shri Mishra to explore providing proper connectivity between Delhi and the proposed airport at Jewar.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh launched the Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour (PENCIL) Portal at the National Conference on Child Labour organised by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India here today. The PENCIL is an electronic platform that aims at involving Centre, State, District, Governments, civil society and the general public in achieving the target of child labour free society. Shri Rajnath Singh also launched the Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the enforcement of legal framework against child labour. The SOP is aimed at creating a ready reckoner for trainers, practitioners and monitoring agencies to ensure complete prohibition of child labour and protection of adolescents from hazardous labour ultimately leading to Child Labour Free India.

After launching the portal, Shri Rajnath Singh said that any decent society cannot allow the child labour. Child labour is a curse, he said. He said that India needs to take a resolve to eradicate the child labour from the country. He expressed faith that with conviction and resolve, we can eradicate this menace. Shri Rajnath Singh said if India could attain freedom in five years after taking resolve of ‘Do or Die’ of Mahatma Gandhi during the Quit India Movement, then there is no reason why India cannot attain a child labour free society in coming five years if the whole country gets united and takes resolve to do so. He said that childhood is the best period of an individual’s life gifted by God. But he expressed sadness at the fact that one in every 10 children is involved in child labour and is not able to lead a normal life during his childhood.

Shri Rajnath Singh said that ratification of treaties by India in this regard shows our resolve to eradicate child labour in a time-bound manner. He said that only portal will not be able to suffice our efforts, but social awareness is needed in this regard. He quoted the example of special drives undertaken under ‘Operation Smile’, where 70,000-75,000 children could be saved. He emphasised that for the success of PENCIL Portal also, one month’s special drive in the country, even at block levels, is required, so that everybody becomes aware of it and acts in the direction of elimination of child labour. He said that child labour not only has social implications but economic implications also. Appreciating the Ministry of Labour and Employment’s efforts in releasing SOPs for enforcement agencies, he said that this will help in the better implementation of the schemes, as many schemes are good at the formation stage, but are not being implemented in an effective manner on the ground due to lack of guidance.

The Minister of State for Labour and Employment (I/C), Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that children are the country’s assets and its future. He said that due to short-term economic and social constraints, the income from child labour may appeal to be good, but in the long run, it is not so. He said that keeping in mind the overall development of children, the employment of children under the age of 14 years is not allowed under the law for any occupation and for the children between 14-18 years, the employment is not allowed in occupations that are harmful to their physical and mental health. He said that main hurdle in the implementation of laws is lack of awareness and guidance and the SOPs released today will be useful to the enforcement agencies. He further said that child labour is a social problem and positive attitude is very important in this regard. He expressed hope that all sections of India will rise above law to realise the dream of child-labour free society. The Labour Minister stated that India ratified the two Core Conventions of International Labour Organization (ILO), Convention 138 regarding admission of age to employment and Convention 182 regarding worst forms of Child Labour in June 2017 which shows our commitment to a child labour free nation.

Shri Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Laureate and Child Right Activist was the Guest of Honour on the occasion. Expressing happiness over the release of PENCIL portal, he said that today is a historic day for India. India is telling the world that it will give PENCIL in the hands of children and not tools to work, he added. He emphasised that the top leadership should be involved in these campaigns. He said that PENCIL and SOPs are important not only for India but also for the world in showing a new direction to them. He said this proves that fact that technology can be converted into instruments of social upliftment and power. Shri Satyarthi said that currently, he is on ‘Bharat Yatra’ to spread awareness and sensitise on issues related to child sexual abuse and child trafficking. He also emphasised on the institutional mechanism and exclusive courts for handling cases related to child sexual abuse.

Earlier while delivering the welcome address, Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, Smt. M. Sathiyavathy said that Government has taken various initiatives and developed a legal framework to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of eliminating child labour by the year 2025. She said that child labour has come down in India as per 2011 census as compared to 2001 census. She further stated that broad consultation was done with all the stakeholders before finalizing the amendments in central rules which was notified on 2nd June 2017. For the first time we have provided for prevention, rescue and rehabilitation of children in the central rules and institutional set up at the district level in the form up district task force. She said that SOPs will provide step by step guidelines and will be a ready reckoner for trainers, practitioners and monitoring agencies.

In a video message during the conference, Mr Guy Ryder, DG, ILO, congratulated India for its foresight and expressed the hope that India will play a critical role in supporting ILO’s efforts around the globe.

On the occasion, a short film on child labour and an animated detailed presentation on PENCIL portal were also shown.

The PENCIL Portal (pencil.gov.in) has various components, namely Child Tracking System, Complaint Corner, State Government, National Child Labour Project and Convergence. The Districts will nominate District Nodal Officers (DNOs) who will receive the complaints and within 48 hours of receiving, they will check the genuineness of the complaint and take the rescue measures in coordination with police, if the complaint is found to be genuine. Till date, 7 states/UTs have appointed the DNOs.

The State Labour Ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Rajasthan participated in the conference. The conference was also attended by Labour Secretaries of the State, Secretaries of Central Ministries, District Nodal Officers as well as the Project Directors for National Child Labour Project (NCLP).

 Children are valuable assets for any country who need to be nurtured for the better future of the country. The census 2011 showed a substantial decline in child labour as compared to the data of Census 2001, but a lot is required to be done to protect their childhood. Realizing the multifaceted nature of this problem, Government has embarked on a holistic and multi-pronged approach to eliminate child labour from the country in a phased manner. Government has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from 1st September, 2016. With this amendment, employment of a child below 14 years is completely prohibited in any occupation or processes. This is a historic progression since the inception of the Act in 1986, when a complete ban in engaging children below 14 years is foreseen as a reality by this amendment. : First time the age of child is linked with the age of the child in the Right of Children to free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. Also, for the first time the definition of adolescent has been introduced and the ambit of the Act is enhanced to include adolescent in the age group of 14-18 years. The amendment prohibits the employment of adolescent in hazardous occupations and processes.

 Government has taken several initiatives subsequent to the enactment of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 to strengthen the governance of the legislative provisions. This include Framing of State Action Plan and circulating to all States/ UTs for enforcement of the Amended Act, Framing of Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Central Rules subsequent to the Amendment in the Act (notified vide notification dated 02.06.2017) and Review of the Schedule of hazardous occupations and processes by Technical Advisory Committee. A series of stakeholder consultations have taken place to develop these initiatives.

 The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme initiated in the in 1988 to rehabilitate working children by eliminating  all forms of child labour through identification and withdrawal of all children in the Project Area from child labour, Preparing children withdrawn from work for mainstream education along with vocational training. NCLP has been revised expanded and aligned to the new legislative provisions. 

 

The legislative changes have been accompanied by creation of additional institutional mechanisms at the district, state and national level for identification and rescue, along with revamping the rehabilitation scheme and a centralized database for case to case monitoring and accountability. The Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) is aimed at creating a ready reckoner for trainers, practitioners and monitoring agencies to ensure complete prohibition of child labour and protection of adolescents from hazardous labour ultimately leading to Child Labour Free India.  

The genesis of the portal is in the felt need to create a robust implementing and monitoring mechanism for both enforcement of the legislative provisions and effective implementation of the NCLP  especially in the backdrop that the subject of Labour is in the concurrent list and enforcement to a large extent depends of respective State Governments. It was felt that an online portal which connects Central Government to State Government, District and to all Project Societies would provide a mechanism for implementation. In this backdrop the online portal PENCIL was conceptualized. PENCIL Portal has following components:

 

a.       Child Tracking System

b.      Complaint Corner

c.       State Government

d.      National Child Labour Project

e.       Convergence

 

The event:

 

“PENCIL”: an electronic platform for effective enforcement for no child labour developed by Ministry of Labour and Employment is going to be launched by Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singhji on 26thSeptember 2017 in the National Conference on Child Labour at Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra, Chanakya Puri, New Delhi. The Conference is being attended by State Labour Ministers and Labour Secretaries of the State, Secretaries of Central Ministries, District Nodal Officers as well as the Project Directors for National Child Labour Project (NCLP).  Nobel Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi will be the guest of honour while the Labour and Employment Minister, Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar will precide over the conference. The conference will have a detailed technical session.

This year these 28 awards are being shared by 111 individuals.

National Safety Awards (NSA)

The NSA is given in recognition of outstanding safety performance of industrial establishments, construction sites, ports and installations under AERB to stimulate and maintain the interests of both the management and the workers in accident prevention programmes.  The awards are given under twelve schemes, out of which ten are meant for Factories /Construction sites /Installations under AERB and two are for Ports.  Under each award, a Shield and a Certificate of Merit is given to each of the Award Winners and Runners-up.  The establishments are classified in different schemes on the basis of working of highest man-hours. 

The criterion for presentation of these Awards is indicated as below:

·         Lowest Average Frequency Rate over a period of three consecutive years ending in the contest year as compared to the National Average for that group of industries.

·         Accident Free year based on man-hours worked during the contest year.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the Parliament.

The Amendment will increase the maximum limit of gratuity of employees, in the private sector and in Public Sector Undertakings/ Autonomous Organizations under Government who are not covered under CCS (Pension) Rules, at par with Central Government employees.

Background:

The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 applies to establishments employing 10 or more persons. The main purpose for enacting this Act is to provide social security to workmen after retirement, whether retirement is a result of the rules of superannuation, or physical disablement or impairment of vital part of the body. Therefore, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 is an important social security legislation to wage earning population in industries, factories and establishments.

The present upper ceiling on gratuity amount under the Act is Rs. 10 Lakh. The provisions for Central Government employees under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 with regard to gratuity are also similar. Before implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 was Rs. 10 Lakh. However, with implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, in case of Government servants, the ceiling now is Rs. 20 Lakhs effective from 1.1.2016.

Therefore, considering the inflation and wage increase even in case of employees engaged in private sector, the Government is of the view that the entitlement of gratuity should be revised for employees who are covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Accordingly, the Government initiated the process for amendment to Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

                As part of labour law reforms, the Government has undertaken the exercise of rationalisation of the 38 Labour Acts by framing 4 labour codes viz Code on Wages, Code on Industrial Relations, Code on Social Security and Code on occupational safety, health and working conditions.

1. The Code on Wages Bill 2017 has been introduced in Lok Sabha on 10.08.2017 and it subsumes 4 existing Laws, viz. the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; the Payment of Wages Act, 1936; the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965; and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976. After the enactment of the Code on Wages, all these four Acts will get repealed. The Codification of the Labour Laws will remove the multiplicity of definitions and authorities leading to ease of compliance without compromising wage security and social security to the workers.

2. At present, the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act and the Payment of Wages Act do not cover substantial number of workers, as the applicability of both these Acts is restricted to the Scheduled Employments / Establishments. However, the new Code on Wages will ensure minimum wages to one and all and timely payment of wages to all employees irrespective of the sector of employment without any wage ceiling.

3. A concept of statutory National Minimum Wage for different geographical areas has been introduced. It will ensure that no State Government fixes the minimum wage below the National Minimum Wages for that particular area as notified by the Central Government.

4. The proposed payment of wages through cheque or digital/ electronic mode would not only promote digitization but also extend wage and social security to the worker. Provision of an Appellate Authority has been made between the Claim Authority and the Judicial Forum which will lead to speedy, cheaper and efficient redressal of grievances and settlement of claims

5. Penalties for different types of violations under this Code have been rationalized with the amount of fines varying as per the gravity of violations and repeat of the offences. Provision of compounding of offences has been made for those which are not punishable by a penalty of imprisonment.

6. Recently, some news reports have been published regarding the fixation of minimum wage as Rs. 18000/- per month by the Central Government. It is clarified that the Central Government has not fixed or mentioned any amount as “national minimum wage” in the Code on Wages Bill 2017. The apprehension that minimum wage of Rs. 18000/- per month has been fixed for all employees is, thus incorrect, false and baseless. The minimum wages will vary from place to place depending upon skill required, arduousness of the work assigned and geographical location.

7. Further, the Code on Wages Bill 2017, in the clause 9 (3), clearly states that the Central Government, before fixing the national minimum wage, may obtain the advice of the Central Advisory Board, having representatives from employers and employees. Therefore the Code provide for a consultative mechanism before determining the national minimum wage.

8. Some reports have also been appearing in the media regarding the revised methodology for calculation of minimum wages by enhancing the units from three to six. It was purely a demand raised by Trade Unions in the recent meeting of the Central Advisory Board on Minimum Wages. However it is clarified that such proposal is not part of the Code on Wages Bill.

Background:

The Government of India formulated the Public Procurement Policy, 2012 which states that 20% of total procurement of goods and services by Central Ministries, Departments and CPSEs shall be made from MSEs and 20% of such procurement (4% of total) shall be from SC & ST owned MSEs.

NSSH is a unique initiative launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 18th October 2016. This initiative is aimed empowering SC ST owned MSEs in order to achieve the 4% mandate of the Public Procurement Policy.

In view of the above, the NSSH initiative has the potential to work on ground and have an impact till the last mile. Due to the social and economic bearing the programme can have, it requires a strategy that delivers sustained and measureable impact, on the entire MSME ecosystem. Therefore, there have been continual efforts to include all relevant stakeholders including state, industry associations, incubators, CPSEs to identify synergies and work collaboratively and cohesively towards a shared goal.

Some of the milestones achieved by the hub are as follows -

1.      Data analysis completed for 5 lakh SC/ST units to identify suppliers to CPSEs

2.      Physical verification of over 4,900 SC/ST entrepreneurs completed that had potential to supply to CPSEs

3.      Telephonic interaction with over 2,590 SC/ST MSMEs completed to understand challenges in securing PSUs’ tenders

4.      Information of 1,003 SC/ST enterprises mapped with 42 CPSEs for vendor empanelment and procurement

5.      Appointment of nodal officers in 67 CPSEs. Discussion with over 60 CPSEs conducted

6.         Special Marketing Assistance Scheme - 950 units participated in domestic and international fairs/exhibition

7.         2,107 units facilitated with CPSE linkages under Special Vendor Development Programme

8.         512 SC/ST units benefitted under Special Performance & Credit Rating Scheme

9.      Training programme conducted in IIM Noida (Satellite institute of IIM Lucknow), IIM Lucknow, IIM Raipur, IIM Kolkata and XLRI Jamshedpur (on pilot basis) for SC/ST entrepreneurs for over 100 SC/ST entrepreneurs.

Key highlights of the discussion were:

1.         Getting support from Industry Associations on data consolidation and Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum (UAM) registration.

2.         Providing on ground support to adopted SC-ST owned MSEs by Industry Associations and Incubators.

3.         Assisting NSSH in future endeavours in spreading awareness by participating, organizing various events, seminars, workshops, knowledge sessions etc.

4.         Mentoring and handholding support to potential SC-ST entrepreneurs during and post incubation programme.

5.         Providing capacity building trainings to SC-ST Entrepreneurs.

6.         Technology collaboration with overseas partners is required to upgrade existing technology

Also, the following suggestions were made -

1.         While releasing tenders, CPSEs should focus on quality based products manufactured by MSMEs, especially SC-ST entrepreneurs rather than established brands.

2.         It was proposed that there is a need to create awareness around the various schemes of the Government in addition to the NSSH

3.         It was suggested that the prequalification criteria for CPSE tenders should be eliminated for SC ST MSEs.

4.         For VDP programmes, it was suggested that instead of conducting the VDPs in neutral locations, these should be done at the premises of the respective CPSEs.

5.         It was proposed, that sanctioned loan tenure should be extended to provide sustainable support to SC ST MSEs.

6.         It was suggested that traditional businesses like Handicraft sector, Leather sector etc. needs to be promoted and requires government’s intervention for growth and development

                Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Shri Giriraj Singh was presented with Evaluation Study of Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) conducted by Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurugram. The institute was entrusted with the task of conducting Evaluation Study of PMEGP in January, 2017.

The aim of the study was examine the impact of the scheme in terms of employment generation and improvement in income of the rural and urban artisans and unemployed youth, major problems in implementation of Scheme and ways to resolve them and to make recommendations on making further improvements in the Scheme.

The sample size was selected on stratified random sampling basis.  The total number of micro units setup from 2012-013 to 2015-16 was 2,00,885 units. This units were taken into consideration, out of these a sample coverage of 5% i.e. about 10,108 units were sought listed on random basis from among the three implementing agencies viz. KVIC, KVIB and DIC in proportion of 30:30:40.





Key observations of the Study:

·         Scheme has been able to provide Sustainable Employment. Units set up under the scheme provided employment throughout year and for large number of years.

·         Scheme has good reach, it has targeted at almost all sections of the society (based on social background, education background, location etc)

·         Average Employment Per Project                         – 7.62

·         Average Cost of Generating Unit Employment    – ₹  96,209

·         Maximum Cost of Generating Unit Employment – ₹  2,75,621 (Nagaland)

·         Minimum Cost of Generating Unit Employment  – ₹  64,735 (Tamil Nadu)

·         Average Cost per Project                                       - ₹ 7,33,423

 

Problem Areas:

•      Delay in the process of sanctioning of loans at different stages.

•      Hypothecation & collaterals asked for.

•      Physical verifications & delay in adjustment of margin money.

•      Records keeping, hand holding, access of data & reporting by implementing agencies.

•      Marketing for products.

 

Key recommendations:


	Increased availability of field officers (They are a key connect between beneficiary and agencies and are currently sparse)
	EDP Training content needs to be more relevant and rigorous. On line EDP could be encouraged.
	Content partnership/Integration with MOOCs (Massive Open Online Coursewares) of recognized reputational technical and managerial institutes (such as IITs and IIMs)
	Agencies could consider hiring interns from leading management institutions (India/Abroad) to further handholding of beneficiaries
	Integration with Aadhar to authenticate the trainee identity and progress.
	For motivating beneficiaries to repay loans – The people whose Margin Money has been successfully adjusted, need to be rewarded with an option of 2nd round of subsidized loans (at say 15% of subsidy).
	Enforcement of deadlines (either of 60 or 90 days) on banks to decide about decision (acceptance or rejection) of the loan application


viii.            Cash credit account (CCA) component of the loan could be reduced. Maximum CCA may range up to 40% of total loan.

The interaction aims to bring together leading CPSEs from different sectors and initiate discussion to understand the gaps and their challenges in realizing the mandate of Public Procurement Policy. The interaction is envisioned to put forth a strategy that delivers sustained and measurable impact on the entire MSME ecosystem. With participation from over 50 CPSEs from 20 Ministries, the conclave also aims to develop an understanding of procurement requirements of CPSEs and facilitating them in vendor development programme by providing support in mobilizing SC/ST entrepreneurs.

Ministry of MSME, through National SC-ST Hub, is continuously thriving to achieve its objectives, and in order to accomplish desired goals has taken up multiple initiatives. The conclave will give a brief on all ongoing activities and also give a snapshot on the roadmap for the near future.

A brief presentation by Joint Secretary, MSME, on the achievements and challenges faced by CPSEs in procuring goods and services from SC ST entrepreneurs was given. In order to receive inputs and suggestions from CPSES, an open discussion was organized during the conclave to decide upon the future course of action. Key highlighted from the discussion were:

1. Current status of procurement done by CPSEs from MSMEs (including SC/ST MSEs) during the last Financial Year

2. Need for one consolidated database of SC/ST Vendors including details of products and services provided by them

3. Focus on organizing Special – Vendor Development Programmes (VDPs) and capacity building programmes for addressing the skills gap of SC/ST MSEs

4. Use of technology as a medium for dissemination of information

The conclave brought various insights from CPSEs to understand the gaps in realizing the mandate of Public Procurement Policy and put forth innovative strategies for holistic development of MSEs owned by SC/ST Entrepreneurs. The discussion help was extremely fruitful and will go a long way in meeting the objectives of the National SC ST Hub

Background:

National SC-ST Hub, launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, aims to create a supportive ecosystem for SC/ST entrepreneurs by assisting in technology upgradation and capacity building thereby enabling them to effectively participate in public procurement processes. The Government of India formulated the Public Procurement Policy, 2012 which states that 20% of total procurement of goods and services by Central Ministries, Departments and CPSEs shall be made from MSEs and 20% of such procurement (4% of total procurement) from MSEs shall be made from SC & ST owned MSEs.

Explanatory Note on Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Bill, 2017

 

The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2017 is designed to put in place mechanisms for:

 

  i.         Grant of composite licence ‘exploration licence-cum-production lease’ or ‘production lease’ on the basis of auction through competitive bidding for the sake of introducing a transparent and non-discriminatory regime for grant of operating rights in the offshore areas. The scheme of composite licence envisages that the successful bidder will conduct the exploration work at his own cost and risk, to establish mineralisation required for grant of production lease. On successful completion of exploration, the licencee will have a right to get a production lease.

 

ii.         Easy transferability of ‘production lease’ and ‘exploration licence-cum-production lease’ to encourage and attract private investment and induction of the state-of-art technology in offshore production.

 

iii.         Establishment of ‘Offshore Area Mining Fund’ for the purposes of research, administration, studies and related expenditure with respect to offshore areas and mitigation of any adverse impact that may be caused to the ecology in the offshore area, due to operations undertaken pursuant to the OAMDR Act; providing relief upon the occurrence of any disaster in the offshore area; exploration in the offshore area; and other prescribed purposes.

 

iv.         Stricter penal provisions to check various offences/contravention of terms and conditions.

 

v.         Assured tenure of fifty years for Production Lease to do away with the concept of renewal and to remove discretionary powers.

 

vi.         Restricting eligibility to any person who is a company as defined in clause (20) of section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) or a consortium of two or more companies registered under the Companies Act, 2013 with joint and several liabilities and satisfies prescribed conditions. It is felt that undertaking offshore operations by an individual may not be appropriate considering: (a) the high costs of offshore operations; and (b) the propriety of allowing only Company registered under the Companies Act which has a comprehensive body of statutory compliances not only under the Company law but also in respect of compliances under all other applicable laws.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs, Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that tolerance is the culture and commitment of India and Indians and it is our Constitutional duty to protect and strengthen this culture, in Mumbai, today. 

While inaugurating “New India- We Resolve to Make” exhibition cum cultural event at Bandra Railway Station, Mumbai, jointly organised by Parliamentary Affairs Ministry and Container Corporation of India, Shri Naqvi said that any type of violence and anarchy is a conspiracy to weaken the fabric of the country’s social harmony and strength of “unity in diversity”. It is our Constitutional duty to protect this unity and defeat such evil forces who want to disturb our social harmony. 

Under “New India” vision, the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been working with commitment to welfare and empowerment of that poor section of the society which remained the below poverty line even after seven decades of Independence. Shri Naqvi said that our Government has worked keeping this section in centre of all the welfare schemes. 

Shri Naqvi reminded that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given a call for “New India” and all sections of the society have to work together to fulfil this commitment. 

Shri Naqvi said that Cenre is making every effort to take everyone in “Sankalp se Sidhi” campaign to make India free from corruption, poverty, filth, communalism, terrorism and casteism. We have taken a pledge to make a “New India” by 2022. 

Shri Naqvi said that with this objective, Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is organising photo exhibition “New India- We Resolve to Make” at 39 places across the country. The exhibitions are aimed at promoting the campaign launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for “New India”. 

The focus of the exhibitions will be on India’s freedom movement from 1857 to 1947 showing the various activities initiated to attain the freedom from the British rule- “The First War of Independence, 1857”, “The Champaran Satyagrah”, “The Non-cooperation Movement”, “The Dandi Yatra” and “The Quit India Movement”. 

Besides this, the period of five years from 1942 to 1947 is being reflected to show how the movement of India’s struggle for freedom transformed the entire country into one to fight for the freedom from the British Rule and in the end, the vision of new India from 2017 to 2022 will be showcased, when we will be celebrating 75 years of India’s Independence.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri R K Singh has emphasised the need for setting up more waste management plants around the country. Shri Singh said this while inaugurating a Workshop on “Waste to Energy” – Swachchata Se Swachh Urja here today. The workshop was organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy as a part of “Swachchata Hi Sewa” campaign.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Singh added that there is a huge amount of waste generated in a country like India and said that there is an urgent need to convert the waste into energy. Citing the example of the Timarpur Okhla Waste Management Company Private Limited, the Minister called for setting up more such plants. A framework will be worked on for energy thus generated by these plants and subsequently rates fixed for them, the Minister added. Shri R K Singh also pointed out the need for change in the habits of the people to ensure effective waste collection and segregation. He said the citizens should be educated on effective waste management so that it would be easier for the industries to process the waste. He also added that effective waste management will help in creating a cleaner and greener India. 

In his address, Shri Anand Kumar Secretary of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said that the Ministry’s focus is on energy generation from urban, industrial and agricultural waste/residues, municipal solid wastes, vegetable and other market wastes, slaughterhouse waste and industrial wastes and effluents. These initiatives, he said, not only support generation of energy from the waste but also help in reducing pollution. It will also address the issue of burning of paddy straw by producing bio-CNG. 

In his address the Secretary said, that since the inception of Swachcha Bharat Mission in 2014, the Ministry has already supported around 180 projects mainly based on production of Bio-CNG/ Biogas for various energy applications in industries and transport sector.

Three major waste to energy projects of 52 MW, based on Municipal Solid Waste(MSW) have already been installed and running successfully in Okhla, Ghazipur and Narela-Bawana in Delhi which help in converting solid waste to electricity.

In addition, under Swachcha Bharat Mission, about 40 projects with installed capacity of 344 MW supported by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs are under various stages of commissioning.

The workshop deliberated upon how to utilize Waste for generation of energy through various proven technologies and established business models to scale up the programme in close association with all stakeholders including corporate houses.

On her suggestion the Committee agreed to include a programme on solar supported e-mobility.

Shri Upendra Tripathy, interim Director General of the ISA informed about the progress in implementation of various activities under ISA. He specifically mentioned about the progress under the three programmes launched under the ISA “Affordable finance at scale”, “Scaling solar applications for agricultural use”, and “Scaling Solar Mini Grids”. He further informed about the ISA Secretariat’s initiative “ Common Risk Mitigating Mechanism (CRMM)” . The objective of the mechanism is de-risking and reducing the financial cost of solar projects in the ISA member countries. The instrument will help diversify and pool risks on mutual public resources and unlock significant investments. He informed that an international expert group has been   working on the blue print of the mechanism and it will be rolled out by December 2018.

International Steering Committee was establishment under the mandate of the Paris Declaration of ISA to provide the guidance and direction to establish the ISA.  India has offered a contribution of Rs 175 crore for creating ISA corpus fund and for meeting the cost of ISA secretariat for initial five years.

The ISA is an Indian initiative jointly launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on 30 November 2015 at Paris, on the sidelines of COP-21. It aims at addressing obstacles to deployment at scale of solar energy through better harmonization and aggregation of demand from solar rich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.

                Smt Sumitra Mahajan, The Speaker, Loksabha inaugurated Exhibition-cum-Seminar ‘New India – We Resolve to Make’ here today. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was present on this occasion. Shri Rajiv Yadav, Secretary, Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs was also present on this occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Sumitra Mahajan, The Speaker, Loksabha said that this programme is not just an exhibition, it is like a Sankalp. India got independence just in 5 years of starting Quit India Movement due to its Sankalp. Every freedom fighter fought for Independence in a different method. In Loksabha, all parties have made a Sankalp to make a New India in next 5 years. She also said that Exhibition is for children who is our future of India to know that our India’s rich traditions and to make a New India in a better way.

Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs said that very few people who participated in August Kranti Andolan are alive today. In this context, it is very important to make our children know about how we have got our Independence. With programmes like these children would be connecting with the freedom struggle. Government is making every effort to take everyone in Sankalp se Sidhi to make India free of corruption; free of poverty; free of filth; free of communalism; free of terrorism and free of casteism. We have taken a pledge to make a New India by 2022.

Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs coordinated in organizing Exhibition-cum-Seminar in association with willing Central Public Sector Units (CPSUs) at 39 places across the county on the theme ‘Naya Bharat – Karke Rahenge’ or ‘New India – We Resolve to Make’ to commemorate the 75 years of Quit India Movement and forthcoming 75 years of Independence in 2022.

The focus of the exhibitions will be on India’s freedom movement from 1857 to 1947 showing the various activities initiated to attain the freedom from the British rule- “The First War of Independence, 1857”, “The Champaran Satyagrah”, “The Non-cooperation Movement”, “The Dandi Yatra” and “The Quit India Movement”. Besides this, the period of five years from 1942 to 1947 will be reflected to show how the movement of India’s struggle for freedom transformed the entire country into one to fight for the freedom from the British Rule and in the end, the vision of new India from 2017 to 2022 will be showcased, when we will be celebrating 75 years of India’s Independence.

The five year period from 2017 to 2022 is to give a unique opportunity of ‘Sankalp se Sidhi’ towards a ‘New India’. This programme is in tune with the mass campaign started by the Prime Minister to take the six resolves to make the country- free of corruption; free of poverty; free of filth; free of communalism; free of terrorism and free of casteism. This programme is organized with the purpose of spreading Prime Minister’s message amongst the people of the country to help in achieving the vision of new India.

                As part of their Valedictory Session as Assistant Secretaries, IAS officers of the 2015 batch today made presentations before the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

8 selected presentations on various themes of governance were made by the officers, on themes such as rapid response for accident victims, tracking individual carbon footprints, financial inclusion, improving rural incomes, data driven rural prosperity, heritage tourism, railway safety, and central armed police forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it was indeed significant that the junior-most and senior-most officers are spending such a lot of time communicating with each other. The Prime Minister said that the young officers must imbibe all the positives from these interactions. The Prime Minister asked young officers to focus on subjects such as GST implementation and boosting digital transactions, especially via the BHIM App.

He urged all officers to speed up the adoption of Government e- Marketplace (GeM) in their respective departments. He said this would eliminate middlemen, and result in savings for the government.

Giving examples of ODF targets and rural electrification, the Prime Minister urged the officers to work towards 100 per cent achievement of targets. He urged the officers to work towards creating the India of the dreams of freedom fighters, by 2022. He said that officers who have risen from humble backgrounds, should meet young students, and motivate them. Communication leads to compassion, the Prime Minister added.

He said that the key aim of officers today is the welfare of the nation and its citizens. He urged the officers work with team spirit, and make teams wherever they go. Speaking on the occasion, the Cabinet Secretary Shri P.K. Sinha said all the 175 Officers were designated and posted as Assistant Secretaries in 42 Ministries (58 Departments) of the Central Government for three months from July 03, 2017 to September 29, 2017 after their Phase-II training at the Lal Bahadur Shashtri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie. During their three-month central deputation they were provided a holistic overview of the functioning of the Central Government through individual projects, group projects, concurrent review of projects suggested by earlier batches with a view to providing exposure of office functioning of Government of India to the young IAS officers at a very early stage in their career, he said.

The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Union Home Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba, who is holding the additional charge of Secretary, DoPT and the Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr. P.K. Mishra were also present.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will address Valedictory Session of the Assistant Secretaries (IAS-2015 batch) here tomorrow. This is the third batch of IAS Officers to have commenced their career with a stint in the Central Government.

All the 175 Officers were designated and posted as Assistant Secretaries by the Government of India in 42 Ministries (58 Departments) of the Central Government for three months from July 03, 2017 to September 29, 2017 after their Phase-II training at the Lal Bahadur Shashtri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie.

During their three-month central deputation they were provided a holistic overview of the functioning of the Central Government through individual projects, group projects, concurrent review of projects suggested by earlier batches with a view to providing exposure of office functioning of Government of India to the young IAS officers at a very early stage in their career.

The Officers were assigned important desks related to Policy and Flagship Programmes of the concerned Ministries and Departments. They were groomed by mentoring from nine sectoral Groups of Secretaries. The Assistant Secretaries made presentations of the key learning before their Mentor Groups where 35 presentations were shortlisted. Eight of the shortlisted 35 have been selected for presentations to be made before the Prime Minister.

The objective of this Initiative is to provide exposure of Government of India functioning to the IAS officers at a very early stage in their career. As primary implementers in the field, this exposure also facilitates a broader macro-perspective when they work in the field.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today interacted with a group of students from Jammu & Kashmir, currently on a visit to the Union capital. The students were mostly in the age group of 16 to 20 years and were mostly studying in different government schools or government degree colleges in Jammu and Kashmir.

In a lively interaction, Dr Jitendra Singh answered a wide range of questions from the students and also responded by offering his views on a number of current topics as well as elaborating several youth-centric initiatives taken by the Union Government. He said, these young students are going to have the privilege of being the architects of New India which is soon going to emerge as a global power. He said, most of the students in this age group have their aspirations but need to work out their inner aptitude and their inner capacities. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, they have the privilege of being globally connected with their counterparts across the world. Many of them, who have moved out to other parts of the country, have made name for themselves at a young age. 

The students thanked the Minister for this interaction. Some of the students also demanded his support for improving sports facilities in these districts. 

Arrangements were made for the students, most of whom were visiting Delhi for the first time, to visit the museum of Rashtrapati Bhavan which was a rare and unique experience for them at this tender age. In addition, they went for sightseeing to historic destinations like Red Fort and Qutub Minar. Dr Jitendra Singh suggested that a visit could also be arranged for them during the Parliament session so that they can witness the proceedings.

The 23rd Lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) was delivered by Justice Shri M.M. Kumar, President, National Company Law Tribunal, here today on the topic, “Rule of Law: Achievements and its Trivialization.”

In his lecture, Justice Kumar gave an elaborate historical perspective of the “Rule of Law” in the context of the Constitution of England, delving upon topics such as the Magna Carta charter of June 1215, Petition of Right of 1628 and the Bill of Rights of 1689. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are the cornerstones of the Constitution in a democratic society, he observed. He gave a detailed account of how the judiciary has been upholding and protecting the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. Justice Kumar also cautioned on how the Rule of Law can be trivialized.

The Central Vigilance Commissioner, Shri K.V. Chowdary and the Vigilance Commissioners, Shri Rajiv and Dr. T.M. Bhasin were present on the occasion. The lecture was attended by full time and part time Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) of Government Departments based in Delhi NCR as well as CMDs, Directors and other officers of Government Ministries / Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Nationalized Banks, and other Organizations.

The webcast of the lecture may be viewed online and it is available on the website of the Central Vigilance Commission  www.cvc.nic.in.

                As a part of the ongoing “Swachhata Hi Sewa” campaign around 50 officials/officers of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) visited NP Co-ed Sr. Sec. School at Tilak Marg here today to sensitise the children about “Swachhta” and also to clear the premises of the School. 

From NDMC Shri Virender Singh, Director (Personnel) was present. Shri N.C. Joshi, Principal of the School welcomed the officials of DoPT and explained about the Swachhta related activities being carried out jointly with DoPT in the school premises. From DoPT, Shri Suresh Kumar and Shri D.K. Sengupta, both Deputy Secretaries and Shri Rajeshwar Lal and Smt. Manjula Juneja, both Under Secretaries, attended the event. 

The children, along with teachers of the school, played two short “Nukkad Natak” on Swachhta. Thereafter, a pledge on Swachhta was taken and officials appended their signature on the pledge board to mark the event. A short presentation was arranged on this occasion by the school regarding usage of Smart Boards which have been installed in all class rooms for digital knowledge of the subject matter and technology as well. 

The e-library of the school i.e. “e-Granthalaya” was inaugurated by Women officers/officials of DoPT which is meant for the use of students of the school. Thereafter, officials of DoPT cleaned the premises of the school. At the end of the event there was an interactive session with the children of the School in which Shri Rajeshwar Lal and Smt. Manjula Juneja sensitized the children about hygiene and various Swachhta related issues. 

Around 150 children present on this occasion enthusiastically participated in the interactive session and cited self-composed poems in Hindi and English on Swachhta. The children were happy to see the government officials in interactive mode and cleaning their premises. Director NDMC and Principal of the School thanked the officials of DoPT for carrying out such an exercise which will develop their zeal and interest in keeping their surroundings neat and clean. 

The DoPT has drawn up an elaborate Action Plan for the ‘Swachhta Hi Sewa’ campaign running from September 15, 2017 to October 2, 2017. The Department has constituted Swachhta Monitoring Committees in each of its three premises in Delhi. The DoPT is moving vigorously towards 100% implementation of e-office which will result in reduced paper consumption and less garbage.

                ‘Maximum Governance, Minimum Government’ is the motto of the Central Government. To achieve this motto Government is concentrated on “Citizen-First” mantra, said Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (Independent Charge), MoS for PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space. He was speaking at the valedictory session of the two-day regional conference on 'Good Governance and Replication of Best Practices' which concluded in Goa today.

 “Our dream is to bring Government closer to citizens so that they become active participants in the governance process. An important step for Good Governance is the simplification of procedures and processes in the Government so as to make the entire system transparent and faster. To this end Government has taken the decision to scrap 1,500 obsolete rules, started the self-certification process etc.  To achieve this, the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances has a key role to play,"" said Dr. Jitendra Singh.

Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration were instituted 10 years back and first awards were presented on the 2nd Civil Services Day on April 21, 2007 to the Civil Servants for their innovative ideas and efforts in addressing the problems locally. This motivation is required for improving governance and delivery of services. He said the Priority Programmes for PM’s Award to be presented next year are (i) Pradhan Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY); (ii) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY); (iii) Promoting Digital Payments;  and (iv) Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural &Urban).

Talking about Grievance cell, he informed that Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) enabled a quantum shift in Online Government Service delivery across the country. This aims to further Government’s efforts at revamping of Public Administration system, Public Grievance Redress Mechanism, ushering in e-Governance, Digital India, more so in the context of the goal of ‘Minimum Government with Maximum Governance’ through e-Governance based Citizen Centric End-to-End Online Services. Compared to 2.70 lakh grievances in 2014, 11.94 lakh grievances were received on CPGRAMS(Central Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) in 2016. In 2017, 9.32 lakhs grievances have already been received till 25.8.17. Due to higher expectations, the grievances have increased more than 4 times in 2016, compared to 2014. However, due to intensive monitoring, the disposal rate has also increased significantly and is presently more than the rate of receipt of grievances. Action on grievances can be tracked with the help of unique grievance registration number. A timeline of two months has been prescribed for disposal of grievances. In case it is not possible, an interim reply with reasons for delay has to be provided.

Right to Information Act (RTI) is now online and from last six months it is available on mobile also, he informed.

Development Manual for District level functionaries by DARPG Swachh Bharat Mission [Gramin] was also launched during the Valedictory function. The purpose of the Development Role manual is to create an enabling mechanism for improved implementation of the Centrally sponsored schemes at the cutting edge, leading to enhanced outcomes in nature and extent. The manual is prepared with inputs from a combination of sources, including interaction with the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS), review of extant scheme guidelines and circulars issued by MDWS and discussions with the key personnel involved in the implementation of the scheme.

Chief Minister of Goa, Shri Manohar Parrikar also shared his thoughts on Good Governance, Swachh Bharat, and Grievance redressal mechanisms during the valedictory session.

Shri C. Viswanath, Secretary DARPG in his address said that conferences like these are useful for promoting meaningful confluence of interactions and insights, cross-fertilization of ideas and exchange of constructive views among the policy makers, public figures, peers, practitioners and professionals who may have championed and facilitated the successful implementation of innovations in government processes, administrative reforms, and public service delivery.

With this, the two-day Regional Conference on ‘Good Governance and Replication of Best Practices’ concluded.  The DARPG has so far organized 26 such regional conferences to share experiences in the formulation and successful implementation of good governance practices and to facilitate speedy and efficient delivery of public services

The two-day Regional Conference on 'Good Governance and Replication of Best Practices' began in Goa today. Shri C. Viswanath, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India, Shri Dharmendra Sharma, Chief Secretary, Government of Goa, Shri Mathew Samuel, DG, Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development, Smt Smita Kumar, Joint Secretary (AR&PG) and other senior officers were also present at the inauguration. 

Shri C. Viswanath, in his inaugural address, emphasised on the need for Good Governance. To achieve Prime Minister's call for speedy delivery of services, the bureaucracy has to change its mindset, he said. Ultimate aim of Good Governance is to benefit people, he added. Since 2007 Civil Services Day is being celebrated, but for the last two years, the pattern of celebration of Civil Services Day has totally changed. Civil Services Day is a great opportunity for bureaucrats to perform and to get recognized, he further said. 

Now, with the overwhelming response for Civil Services Day, last year 599 districts in the country had enrolled for the PM Awards, he said. For this year’s Civil Services Day, so far 601 districts have registered. To enhance the performance of bureaucracy, a Group of Secretaries has been formed in the Centre to decide on the Good Governance Index. The Centre for Good Governance, Hyderabad has been roped in as knowledge partner for this initiative. So, Good Governance Index is going to become a reality very soon, he informed. By implementing Good Governance Index, there will be a healthy competition among the States for reforms. 

Inaugural Session was followed by Power Point Presentations on different success stories and new projects initiated by the Central Government. 

Smt Nila Mohanan, Collector, North Goa, in her presentation elaborated on the successful Solid Waste Management Project and other initiatives by Government of Goa. The Government of Goa has started e-krishi initiative for farmers in the state. There is a dedicated portal for farmers. 65 services are available online and 31,000 farmers in the state have been given Krishi cards, she said. Saligaon Solid Waste Management Facility Project is country’s first integrated solid waste management project. This project owes its origin to Prime Minister’s dream of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Smt. Mohanan, mentioned about Registration Facilitation Centre, Goa Excise Management System, Prisons Management System, e-Revenue, and Goa Online, - single window online portal for all services. 

Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, General Manager, Agricultural Insurance Company, threw light on implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. He informed that the scheme is applicable to all crops. Earlier it took six-seven months to settle claims. Now claims are being settled within three weeks and till date 50% claims have been settled. 

Shri Anil Subramaniam, Director, Ministry of Skill Development informed about the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), an initiative by Government as part of Sustainable Livelihood Mission. Now we have only 4 to 5 percent skilled workforce. The Government has targeted 400 million skilled workforce in the national policy. 

For promoting Digital Payments, apart from bank issued cards, Government has started Aadhaar Enabled Payment Service, BHIM, Bharat QR Code. In the financial year 2017-18, Government has targeted Rs 2500 crore transaction through digital mode, informed Smt Archana Dureja, Senior Director, Ministry of Information and Technology. 

Presentations were also made on Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural). 

The two-day Conference is an effort to create a common platform to share experiences in the formulation and implementation of citizen centric governance, improved public service delivery through e-Governance, transparent, accountable and citizen friendly effective administration. Delegates from 25 States/UTs are participating in the conference. 

The DARPG has so far organized 26 such regional conferences to share experiences in the formulation and successful implementation of Good Governance practices and to facilitate speedy and efficient delivery of public services.

                The Jammu & Kashmir Minister for Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs and Information & Public Relations, Chowdhary Zulfkar Ali called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed wide range of issues related to development as well as some of the immediate problems faced by the border districts.

Chowdhary Zulfkar Ali gave Dr Jitendra Singh an update about the progress of various Central schemes and projects in his Ministry as well as in other sectors in general. He said that with the support of Union Government, the development activity has received an impetus and as the situation gradually returns to normalcy, the benefits of development will be realized in full measure. He also gave a resume of the various flagship programmes including the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. He also requested for initiating the work on Rajouri-Poonch railway line. He also made a plea for increasing the employment opportunities for the people of the region.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that he would put forward the issues raised by him before the concerned Ministries, like Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, however, he suggested that the State Government should get into a more active mode and try to fast-track the works which have already been approved and for which even the funds have been sanctioned by the Central Government.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Union Government is liberal in offering all kinds of support, both financial and otherwise, to the states of Jammu & Kashmir and Northeast, but it is up to the respective State Governments to make the best use of this patronage. 

Emphasizing the need to fast-track construction of roads sanctioned through Central Roads Fund (CRF) by the Government of India and rural electrification under ""Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana"" (DDUGJY), Dr Jitendra Singh said that J&K Government should expedite work to achieve the fixed timelines and targets set to be achieved by 2019.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that continuous efforts are required to update the mechanisms, as the society and the means always keep on changing. He said that the ultimate objective of any society should be to achieve the level of incorruptibility. This is important keeping in view the fact that we are a young and evolving democracy, he added. The Minister further said that the role of society is equally important in curbing corruption, and this task cannot alone be left to Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

Highlighting the steps taken by the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he said that the Government has been following a policy of ‘zero tolerance’ towards corruption. He said that the Government has always focused on checking corruption, and at the same time to ensure an environment to every officer to perform without feeling intimidated by anyone. The bureaucracy cannot succeed without providing good governance tools, he added. He said that this environment is important to ensure the policy of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ and fulfill the aim of citizen-centricity. Dr Jitendra Singh also said that the future of India will depend on the youth who are going to be the change-makers in the society.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the concept of ‘preventive vigilance’ is the step in right direction. He emphasized that awareness needs to be created in the society on a regular basis for various sections of society. He also complemented the Commission for putting the manual in the public domain.  The Minister emphasized that timeframe is very important in handling the cases related to corruption and the same is being streamlined in the amendments to be made in the Prevention of Corruption Act. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the steps such as online RTI, online Vigilance manual will bring in transparency and good governance in the system.

The Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri KV Chowdary said that this edition was released keeping in view the fact that guidance is required for the people working in this area with the changing times and laws. He said that the first edition was released in the year 1968 after the formation of the Commission in 1964 and the 6th edition was released in the year 2005 after the Commission became a statutory body in 2003. He said that a lot of changes including automation have happened in the last twelve years, so the new edition of the manual was required. He said that the major iniitative and change is to put the manual in the public domain. The online version is the dynamic one and will be reviewed online. Any changes including changes in the guidelines and court judgments will be updated on a continuous basis, the CVC said. He said that it will act as a reference book for the vigilance practitioners and bring in transparency.  He also said that a new chapter on Preventive Vigilance and separate chapters on Banking and Insurance services have been added in the Manual. Shri KV Chowdary said that the Commission is developing an e-learning module for vigilance officers. The Commission is also shifting to e-office, he added.

The last edition of the Vigilance Manual was released in the year 2005 and a need was felt to undertake a comprehensive review of the existing Vigilance Manual. The present edition of the Vigilance Manual is a public document accessible through CVC’s website www.cvc.nic.in. The online version has been released along with the printed version for the first time. The 2017 edition of the Vigilance Manual incorporates 567 Paras divided into 11 Chapters with appropriate citations.

It has been made a complete document by hyperlinking orders/circulars cited in the Manual (in the online version). This Manual will be a reference for almost all aspects of vigilance administration. Several new topics of vigilance have been included in the present edition. The manual includes numerous guidelines issued by the Chief Technical Examiners’ Organisation of the Central Vigilance Commission. Issues of relevance such as the Standard Operating Procedure in Legal Cases, Procedure for Obtaining and Grant of Vigilance Clearance, Right to Information Act, 2005, International Cooperation against Corruption, Public Participation in Promoting Integrity and Eradicating Corruption and Forensic Science as a Tool for Enquiry/Investigation, etc. have also been included.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh awarded the Certificates of Appreciation to the Ministries/Departments based on their performance in the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), here today.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh complemented the award winning departments/ministries. He congratulated the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for winning the certificate for four consecutive quarters. He said that other departments should also learn from the mechanism developed by CBDT for grievance disposal. Due to such mechanisms, the system can be sustained, he added. He also appreciated other ministries for working in the direction of disposal of grievances. He said that DARPG has also conducted a study to analyse the grievances received. The Department has also released the Grievance Study Analysis of 20 Ministries recently. He said that DARPG is also taking inputs and suggesting new reforms. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that timelines have been framed for timely disposal for grievances, but many grievances are lodged due to lack of awareness. He said that the people need to be educated about the process and be made aware about the information already available in the public domain. He said that the number of grievances lodged has already reached 12 lakh per year and it is an indication of increasing faith of the citizens in the grievance redressal mechanism. The Minister also suggested that input should be received from the ministries which received the maximum number of grievances. He also appealed to the States to make their grievance redressal mechanisms function in a more effective manner. 

 

Shri C. Viswanath, Secretary, DARPG, said that now the focus of the grievance redressal should be on quality of disposal. He said that the department has conducted an analysis of forty ministries to find out the root cause of the grievances and to see that the root causes are tackled and systemic reforms implemented. He also said that from the study of 20 ministries, 65 reforms have been introduced which has had a positive impact on governance. Study has been undertaken for 20 more ministries recently and 180 reforms have been suggested.

 

Shri Ajay Mittal, Secretary, DoPT said that we should focus on the reasons of grievances. He also complemented winners of the certificates for their meritorious performance.

The DARPG has instituted this Award Scheme for recognizing meritorious performance by the Ministries/Departments for effective redress/disposal of public grievances received on CPGRAMS. Under the Scheme, Certificates of Appreciation are awarded to three Ministries/Departments which are found to have done outstanding work during a quarter as per the prescribed criteria.

The Certificates are awarded to Ministries/Departments on the basis of volume of grievances received & disposed during a quarter. There are three Categories: Ministries/Departments receiving up to 300 grievances are included in Category A, 301-2000 are included in Category B and more than 2000 grievances are including in Category C during the quarter.

The parameters for evaluating the performance are as follows: (a) percentage reduction of grievances pending for more than one year (b) pending for more than six months (c) total disposal of grievances during the period. (d) feedback received on CPGRAMS from petitioners whose grievances have been closed.

Smt. Vasudha Mishra, Additional Secretary, DARPG and other senior officers of the Department were also present on the occasion.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production



 

 

 

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 

1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during August, 2017 was 1898.47 TMT which is 2.98% lower than the monthly target but 1.78% higher when compared with August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-August, 2017 was 9457.74 TMT which is 1.16% lower than target for the period but 2.52% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

Ø Offshore: Natural decline and increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore. Due to severe monsoon and harsh weather conditions, wells at unmanned platforms could not be attended / monitored which affected regular operations like Gas Lift De-optimization, ESP failure & minimum well monitoring / stimulation etc.

Ø Onshore: Power shut down in Mehsana (heavy rain) and Assam Assets.

 

1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during August, 2017 was 288.48 TMT which is 8.99% lower than monthly target but 6.03% higher than production in August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-August, 2017 was 1416.81 TMT which is 9.46% lower than target for the period but 5.50% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø Less than planned achievement due to higher decline in production potential of wells mainly in Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari areas.

Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

 

1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2017 was 832.98 TMT which is 7.76% lower than the monthly target and 10.47% lower than August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2017 was 4230.06 TMT which is 5.06% lower than target for the period and 7.60% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ. Poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17.

Ø Panna-Mukta (Shell): Certain wells closed due to integrity issues in Aug’17. Also, natural decline in Panna-Mukta.

Ø CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.

Ø CB-ONN-2004/2 (ONGC): Underperformance of wells.

Symbolising the growing hydrocarbon engagement between India and Myanmar, the first consignment of 30 MT of High Speed Diesel was sent today from India to Myanmar by land route. Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. (NRL), which has been supplying HSD to Bangladesh, despatched the first diesel consignment through NH 37 across the Moreh Custom Check Point on the Indian side and Tamu Custom Check Point on the Myanmar side.  

Supply of diesel consignment to Myanmar is another step in realizing the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to enhance hydrocarbon synergy with neighbouring countries as well as promoting India’s Act East Policy.  NRL has entered into an agreement with Parami Energy Group of Companies for the supply of diesel and collaboration in the retail petroleum sector of Myanmar.  NRL refinery, situated at 420 km from the India-Myanmar border, is ideally suited to supply diesel to Northern Myanmar where connectivity is a challenge, particularly in the rainy season. 

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan visited Myanmar in February this year during which he discussed opportunities for collaboration in the oil and gas sector including setting up of LNG terminal, retail marketing, refurbishment of refineries, participation in upstream sector and capacity building. ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL), GAIL India Ltd. and Oil India Ltd. have assets in the upstream sector as well as pipelines. In their effort to strengthen the oil and gas engagement, more Indian companies are planning to set up their offices in Myanmar soon. OVL has an office in Yangon. 

NRL has already exported 1700 MT of Paraffin wax to Myanmar.  It was a special privilege for India to contribute hand made wax candles to the 2500 year old Shwedagon Pagoda earlier this year.

                ·         Tender awarded through an International Competitive Bid

·      Electric Vehicles to be procured in 2 phases; first 500 cars to be on road by November 2017

 

Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), under the administration of Ministry of Power, Government of India (GoI), will procure 10,000 electric vehicles from Tata Motors Limited. The company was selected through an international competitive bidding aimed at increased participation. Tata Motors won the tender and will now supply the Electric Vehicles (EVs) in two phases – first 500 e-cars will be supplied to EESL in November 2017 and the rest 9,500 EVs will be delivered in the second phase. 

The tender floated by EESL is the world’s largest single electric vehicle procurement. Three leading manufacturers – Tata Motors Limited, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Nissan participated in the tender and the bids for TATA Motors Limited and Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) were opened. 

EESL is driven by the objective of facilitating faster adoption of disruptive technology solutions while balancing economic development and environmental sustainability. With this specific initiative EESL seeks to create the market for electric vehicles, a technology which is poised to boost e-mobility in the country; through its unique business model of aggregation of demand and bulk procurement. EESL is seeking to leverage the immense potential of replacement of existing vehicles in the government departments for initial demand aggregation.   

Tata Motor Limited quoted the lowest price of Rs. 10.16 Lakh exclusive of GST in the competitive bidding. The vehicle will be provided to EESL for Rs. 11.2 Lakh which will be inclusive of GST and comprehensive 5 year warranty which is 25 % below the current retail price of a similar e car with 3 year warranty. 

EESL’s EV programme is a comprehensive solution to facilitate adoption of the disruptive technology in the country. Along with procurement of 10,000 EVs through international competitive bidding, EESL will also identify a service provider agency. This agency, also appointed through competitive bidding, will carry out end-to-end fleet management of the procured vehicles for the concerned government customer. Apart from continuing to aggregate demand, EESL will also be responsible such as co-ordination between appointed agencies, monitoring and supervision, reporting, complaint redressal and payments. These cars will be used to replace the petrol and diesel cars used by Government and its agencies over a 3-4 year period. The total number of vehicles used by the Government and its agencies  is estimated to be 5 lakhs. 

As per the report published in May 2017 by Niti Aayog, making India’s passenger mobility shared, electric, and connected can cut its energy demand by 64% and carbon emissions by 37% in 2030. This would result in a reduction of 156 Mtoe in diesel and petrol consumption for that year & at USD 52/bbl of crude, this would imply a net savings of roughly Rs 3.9 lakh crore in 2030. The shift to EVs through this programme will reduce dependence on oil imports and promote power capacity addition in India thereby enhancing energy security of the country and will also lead to reduction in GHG emissions from the transport sector.

                Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana –“Saubhagya” a new scheme was launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to ensure electrification of all willing households in the country in rural as well as urban areas on 25th September, 2017.

The following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) give a detailed view of objectives, features, expected outcomes and implementation strategy of the Scheme.

Qs. No. 1 What is the objective of this new scheme?

Ans. The objective of the ‘Saubhagya’ is to provide energy access to all by last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in rural as well as urban areas to achieve universal household electrification in the country.

Qs. No. 2 What all is included in the last mile connectivity and electricity connection to households?

Ans. The electricity connection to households include release of electricity connections by drawing a service cable from the nearest electricity pole to the household premise, installation of energy meter, wiring for a single light point with LED bulb and a mobile charging point. In case the electricity pole is not available nearby from household for drawing service cable, the erection of additional pole along with conductor and associated accessories shall also be covered under the scheme.

Qs. No. 3 Will electricity connection would be totally free of cost for every un-electrified households?

Ans. Yes. Poor households would be provided electricity connections free of cost. Other households would also be provided electricity connections under the scheme on payment of Rs.500 only which shall be recovered by the DISCOMs/Power Departments in ten (10) instalments along with electricity bills.

Qs. No.4 Does the free electricity connection also includes free power for consumption?

Ans. There is no provision in the scheme to provide free power to any category of consumers. The cost of electricity consumption shall have to be paid by the respective consumers as per prevailing tariff of the DISCOM/Power Deptt.

Qs. No. 5 The earlier programme of Government of India ‘24x7 Power For All’ has similar objective.? How is it different from this programme ?

Ans. ‘24x7 Power for All’ is a joint initiative with the states covering all segments of power sector i.e. Power generation, transmission and distribution, energy efficiency, health of Discom etc. to finalise State/UT specific roadmap and action plan to ensure 24x7 power for all in consultation with States/UTs. The Power for All documents contain details of various interventions required across the value chain of power sector.

Providing connectivity to all households is a prerequisite to ensure 24x7 power supply. Saubhagya is a schematic support to address the issue of energy access.

Qs. No. 6 In distribution sector, two major schemes; DDUGJY for rural areas and IPDS in urban areas are already under implementation- then what is the need for a new scheme?

Ans. Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) envisage creation of basic electricity infrastructure in villages / habitations, strengthening & augmentation of existing infrastructure, metering of existing feeders / distribution transformers / consumers to improve quality and reliability of power supply in rural areas. Besides this, last mile connectivity and free electricity connections are also provided to BPL households only identified by the States as per their list. However, in villages which are electrified in past for a long period, many households do not have electricity connections for many reasons. Some of the really poor households do not have BPL cards but these households are not capable of paying applicable initial connection charges. There is also lack of awareness as to how to get connection or taking connection is not an easy task for illiterate people. There may not be electricity pole nearby and the cost of erection of additional pole, conductor is also chargeable from the households for obtaining a connection.

Similarly in urban areas, Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) provides for creation of necessary infrastructure to provide electricity access but some households are not yet connected mainly on account of their economic condition as they are not capable of paying the initial connection charges.

Therefore, Soubhagya has been launched to plug such gaps and comprehensively address the issues of entry barrier, last mile connectivity and release of electricity connections to all un-electrified households in rural and urban areas.

Qs. No. 7 Is the cost of Saubhagya scheme over & above the outlay available under DDUGJY?

Ans. Yes, the cost of Saubhagya scheme i.e. Rs. 16,320 crore is over and above the investment being made under DDUGJY.

Qs. No. 8 What is the criteria for allocation of funds to the States?

Ans. Projects under the scheme would be sanctioned based on the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) to be submitted by the States. There is no upfront allocation of fund under the scheme.

Qs. No. 9 How the scheme would be implemented in the entire country?

Ans. Project proposals shall be prepared by the State DISCOMs / Power Deptt. and sanctioned by an inter-ministerial Monitoring Committee headed by Secretary (Power), GOI. The electrification works under the sanctioned projects shall be executed by respective DISCOMs/Power Deptt. through turnkey contractors or departmentally or through other suitable agencies capable of doing this work as per norms.

Qs. No.10 What is strategy for achievement of target in a time bound manner?

Ans. In order to hasten the process of release of connections to households, camps would be organised in villages / cluster of villages for identification of beneficiaries using modern IT technology with a Mobile App / Web Portal. Application for electricity connections shall also be registered electronically and requisite documentation including photograph of applicant, copy of identity card and / or details such as mobile number/Aadhar number/bank account number etc. shall be completed on spot in the camps, so that connections are released at the earliest.

The Gram Panchayat / public institutions in rural areas shall also be authorized to collect application form, complete documentation and also for distribution of bills, collection of revenue and other activities, as applicable.

Qs. No.11 What would be estimated rise in power demand with the inclusion of 4 crore households in the electricity network?

Ans. Considering an average load of 1 KW per household and average uses of load for 8 hours in a day, there will be requirement of additional power of about 28,000 MW and additional energy of about 80,000 million units per annum. This is a dynamic figure. With the enhancement of income and habit of using electricity, the demand of electricity is bound to vary. This figure will also vary if the assumptions are changed.

Qs. No.12 What is the provision for households where it is not feasible to extend grid lines?

Ans. For households located in remote and inaccessible areas, solar power packs of 200 to 300 Watt and battery back with 5 LED light, 1 DC Fan, 1 DC power plug along with repair and maintenance for 5 years would be provided.

Qs. No.13 How many un-electrified households would be covered under Saubhagya.

Ans. There are about 4 crore un-electrified households estimated in the country of which about 1 crore BPL households in rural areas are already covered under sanctioned projects of DDUGJY. Thus, total of 300 lakh households, 250 lakh households in rural areas and 50 lakh in urban areas, are expected to be covered under the scheme.

Qs. No.14 Would the Scheme envisage providing amnesty to illegal consumers to come and register? Is that also something the Scheme targets?

Ans. The illegal connections need to be dealt with by the respective DISCOMs/Power Deptt in accordance with their rules/regulations in this regard. However, the scheme categorically provides that the defaulters whose connections have been disconnected shall not be given benefit of the scheme.

Qs. No.15 In what manner, the Scheme would be useful for people in their daily life?

Ans. Access to electricity definitely has positive impact on quality of life of people in all aspects of daily household chores and human development. Firstly , Access to electricity would substitute use of Kerosene for lighting purposes resulting in reduction in indoor pollution thereby saving people from health hazards. Further, electricity access would help in establishing efficient and modern health services in all parts of the country. Lighting after the sunset also provide a sense of enhanced personal safety especially for women and increase in post sunset social as well as economic activities. Availability of electricity will boost education services across all areas and quality lighting post sunset would facilitate children to spend more time on studies and move ahead further in prospective careers. Household electrification also increases the likelihood that women would study and earn income.

Qs. No.16 In what manner, the Scheme would facilitate economic growth and employment generation?

Ans. Substitution of use of Kerosene with electricity for lighting purposes would reduce annual subsidy on Kerosene and would also help reduce the import of petroleum products. Electricity in each home would provide improved access to all kind of communications like Radio, Television, Internet, mobile etc. through which everyone would be able to access all kind of important information available through these communication mediums.Farmers can access information about new and improved agriculture techniques, agro-machinery, quality seeds etc. resulting in significant increase in agriculture production and consequently increase in income. Farmers and youths can also explore the possibilities of setting up agro based small industries.

Availability of reliable electricity services would also facilitate establishment of new shops of daily use goods, fabrication workshops, flour mills, cottage industries etc. and such economic activities would generate direct as well indirect employment. Implementation of scheme itself would result into employment generation in view of the requirement of semi-skilled / skilled manpower for execution of works of household electrification. About 1000 lakh man-days works would be generated for implementation of the scheme.

The expenditure of over Rs 16,000 crore will create positive externalities which will further help in generating employment and benefit the economy.

Qs. No.17 Is there any plan for creating awareness amongst public at large about the Scheme so that more & more people are benefited from the Scheme ?

Ans. Government of India would take up publicity campaign through Radio, Print Media, Television, Sign Boards etc. Lack of awareness about procedure to obtain electricity connection including cost of connection, uses of electricity, cost of uses vis-à-vis Kerosene, benefits of using electricity (Direct & Indirect) etc. has been cited as one of the major reasons of slow progress on household electrification in various research studies.

Therefore wide multi-media campaign would be undertaken to make people aware of all aspects the Scheme. The DISCOM officials would also organise camps in rural areas for creating awareness about electricity as well as Saubhagya. School teachers, Gram Panchayat members, local literate/educated youth would also be associated in the awareness campaign.

                Energy Efficiency Services Limited ( EESL) , under Ministry of Power, Government of India has launched UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable Lighting for All) Scheme in the State of Melaka, Malaysia today . The Scheme was launched by Chief Minister of Melaka Datuk Seri Utama Ir. Hj. Idris Bin Hj. Haron. In due course of time, the successful Indian model of UJALA scheme has become a sought-after example for the different nations of the world and will now be implemented in Melaka to extend programme benefits to people of the region.

Under this scheme, each household in Melaka will get 10 high quality 9-watt LED bulbs at a cost of only RM 10, which is a special price and is almost half of what in begin offered in the market. The distribution of these LED bulb will take place from 28 numbers of Japerun in the region. These Japerun are a unique community welfare and engagement centers, which are situated across the Melakan State. Under the extensive and ever-expanding idea of UJALA, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) plans to distribute about 1 million 9W LED bulbs, which will replace 18W CFLs. The initiative will have the logistical assistance and facilitation support from Green Growth Asia, which is a not for profit organization. The price of each bulb will be way lesser than global average price of the LED bulbs, which still swings between 3-5 USD. Notably, each bulb that is being provided by EESL under the UJALA scheme in Melaka comes with a 3-year free replacement warranty against any technical defects. These bulbs sent from India will be of leading brands and manufacturers like Osram, Philips along with other companies of repute.

Giving an overview of expectations from the UJALA scheme, Chief Minister of Melaka, Malaysia, Datuk Seri Utama Ir. Hj. Idris Bin Haron, said, “India’s zero-subsidy UJALA programme has paved the way for a brighter future and has now travelled to our country. We will do our bit to seize the learnings of this programme and replicate the same in Malaysian State of Melaka. This will not only benefit the environment, but will also foster new avenues of economic growth in the region.” A reflection of State Government’s aspirations, this inclusive scheme will positively impact the economy of the region. This programme will further improve the quality of life of the people residing in the region. With an aim to reduce the annual household electricity bills by approximately 10.22 million RM every year, households will be able to make significant monetary savings in their electricity bills.

UJALA’s impact in Malaysia will bring about clean energy, contribute to climate change targets and save the already dwindling energy resources. With a fairly large switch to LED bulbs, Melaka will be able to reduce carbon emissions by around 19,000 tonnes per year. An innovative zero-subsidy model, this scheme will help reduce the subsidy burdens of the State Government. The concept of energy efficiency has strongly overcome many bottlenecks and this adoption by a Malaysian State is yet another achievement towards furthering the idea of energy efficiency to conserve the resources, money and environment.

Sh. Rajkumar Rakhra, National Programme Manager of the UJALA scheme at EESL said, “It is a joyous occasion for us all that EESL’s UJALA scheme has taken a new stride. Post the United Kingdom, the latest entrant is the Malaysian market. This unique model promises prosperity and Energy Efficiency Services Limited will extend all possible assistance to Melaka for reaping the benefits alike India. We will showcase our best practices from India to take UJALA scheme forward in the region.”

The UJALA programme has been one of the prime achievements of Government of India in promoting and executing the concept of energy efficiency. A simple act of change of one light bulb to LED at South Block Prime Minister's office in India heralded a movement in the entire country for considering the same change. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India Sh. Narendra Modi on January 5, 2015 had launched the world's largest and most extensive LED distribution programme, UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable Lighting for All). In this initiative, the nodal organisation, EESL, had undertaken the task of setting up phase-wise LED distribution centers across the nation to provide people with affordable LED bulbs and energy efficient appliances. Due to bulk LED bulb procurement by EESL, a healthy competition rose among the manufacturers and this brought down the prices of LED bulbs in India from a range of about Rs. 300 - Rs.400 to about Rs. 70 per bulb. Through this journey, EESL began to majorly transform the market for energy efficient lighting in India in a mere span of only a year.

Currently, over 25-crore LED bulbs have been distributed under the UJALA scheme in India, which are resulting in 33,828 mn kWh of energy savings per year. While about 13,531 crores are being saved in energy bills of consumers per annum, about 2,74,00,887 tonnes of CO2 reduction is taking place per year. Social surveying in India had strongly indicated a public contentment with the scheme and people openly expressed their happiness after witnessing reduction in their electricity bills.

                Taking the technical cooperation in Rail Safety ahead, a team/ Mission of Safety experts from Japan concluded its second visit early this month. This team comprised of representatives of Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) and railway operators etc. This mission discussed detailed scope of cooperation. This Mission visited Indian Railway’s (IR) coach/wagon/loco maintenance facilities. The Mission also observed rail welding and track maintenance practices followed by IR. 

Earlier, in response to the request from Indian Railways, MLIT deputed a team of Japanese Railway experts to India to assess incidents of rail breakage and suggest measures to improve safety in train operations. The first meeting was held on 9.1.2017 with Japanese Experts. Following this first visit, a separate Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on Railway safety was signed on 17.2.2017 between Ministry of Railways, Government of India (GoI) and MLIT, Japan to cover the area adequately. 

The MoC envisages cooperation in Rail Safety on area such as maintenance of Track (welding, rail inspection, track circuit etc.) and rolling stock maintenance. ‘Capacity Development’ has been taken as a Technical Cooperation project under the MoC to develop Indian Railways’ capacity in respect of the above identified areas. These areas have been incorporated in the Terms of Reference of cooperation. 

Japanese Railways is one of the oldest Rail system in the world. Japan is the pioneer in the High Speed Rail ‘Shinkansen’. Japanese Railways has an impeccable record with Safety. Ministry of Railways (GoI) had requested Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) for technical cooperation in Rail Safety. 

The cooperation will facilitate exchange of information and visit of experts from both sides. A workshop is proposed to be organised in the first week of Nov’2017 in association with Japanese experts.

Encouraged with the success of campaign launched by Railway Protection Force (RPF) to rescue distressed children, Ministry of Railways has now decided to implement this campaign in 47 additional Railway stations in addition to existing 35 stations. With these additional stations, the RPF campaign to rescue children will be implemented from 82 Railways stations. In this way, all A1 Category stations numbering 75 will be covered under this campaign.

 

‘Operation Muskaan’, is an initiative of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to rescue/rehabilitate missing children. It is a dedicated campaign where several activities are taken up by Police organizations to trace and rescue missing children and reunite them with their families. The Government Railway Police and Railway Protection Force are required to take preventive measures and also take action in case children in need of care and protection are found in trains and Railway Premises.

 

During the years 2014, 2015 & 2016, Railway Protection Force personnel have been able to rescue 20,931 children including 1,317trafficked children (944 Boys & 373 Girls) over Indian Railways. In the current year 2017, upto August, 7,126 children have been rescued by RPF including 185 trafficked children (124 Boys & 61 Girls).

 

The Railway Protection Force rescue 20-25 such children daily from trains and Railway premises and hand them over to the safe and secure hands of their parents, relatives, NGOs, Child Welfare Committees or other legal rehabilitation institutions established by Law and thereby bring smile on the faces of thousands of aggrieved parents/relatives of missing children every year.

 

As a result of tireless, vigilant and prompt action with compassion and humane touch, RPF has been conferred with the ‘Service of Excellence Award’ by the Ministry of Home Affairs for the efforts in rescue of missing children under operation “MUSKAN’’ drive.

 

Special Kiosks/Child Help Desks are set up at the designated stations which are manned round the clock by RPF staff and the staff of Childline/NGO nominated by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India. This entire exercise is being undertaken as per the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Railways to ensure care and protection of children in contact with Railways jointly developed by Ministry of Railways , National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Ministry of Women and Child Development.

 

Background:

 

A large number of run-aways, unaccompanied and trafficked children travel to different parts of the country. The Railways carry significantly large proportion of such children and many use railway premises for shelter and livelihood. These children are highly vulnerable to all forms of abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation.

 

With the aim to prevent the plight of millions of children, who lose their way and get separated from their parents in Railway network, Railway Protection Force is dedicated to prevent trafficking of children and take appropriate action to rehabilitate destitute children found in Railway areas

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to pay Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days wages to eligible non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the financial year 2016-17. About 12.30 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision. This payment will be made before Dussehra/Puja holidays, bringing a smile to lakhs of families ahead of the festive season.

The payment of PLB would serve as an incentive, and result in motivating a large number of Railway employees, particularly those involved in execution and operations of railways, to improve their productivity and ensure safety, speed and service for Railway customers. Indian Railways operates on the principle of maximum public welfare, and in this context, this bonus payment will help in improving accountability and efficiency in railways operations.

The financial implication of payment of 78 days' PLB to railway employees has been estimated to be Rs. 2,245.45 crores. The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB is Rs. 7,000/- p.m. The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is Rs. 17,951 for 78 days.

                Minister of Railways Shri Piyush Goyal briefed media about Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Train Project (popularly referred to as Bullet Train project) in Rail Bhavan today i.e. 11th September 2017. Minister of State for Railways & Minister of Communication (I/c), Shri Manoj Sinha was also present to brief the media. Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani and other board members were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways, Shri Piyush Goyal said, “The commencement of work on the Country’s First High Speed (Bullet train) will begin on 14th September, 2017 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The groundbreaking ceremony shall be held in the presence of Prime Minister of  India Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of Japan, Shri Shinzo Abe. This would be a historic moment as India will gets it first bullet train. It was envisioned by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi to take Indian Railways towards most modern technologies like developed countries. This bullet train is an endeavour to bring economic growth & prosperity in the country with the growth of  Indian Railways adopting most modern technologies. New Shinkansen Technology by the Japanese shall ensure more growth opportunities. The cost will go down further as the technology will grow massively and it will be developed under Make in India. The financial assistance given by Japan is at a minimal interest and will not be a burden as it will be paid after 50 years at a minimal interest. This technology will revolutionize and transform the transport sector of India. This is an occasion to celebrate the advent of the most modern technology in India. It shall also benefit the farmers for transportation of agricultural produce in a fast mode.”

 

 

Background:

This Mumbai – Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) project (popularly known as the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train)is a  visionary project which will herald a new era of safety, speed and service for the people and help Indian Railways become an international leader in scale, speed and skill.

 

Low cost of the project

·        Major portions of large scale infrastructure projects are financed by debt, and the cost of debt is a significant portion of the total costs. As a part of cooperation agreement between India and Japan, Government of Japan will provide a soft loan of about Rs. 88,000 crore at miniscule interest rate of 0.1%. The repayment period of the loan is 50 years.Repayment of loan is to begin after 15 years of receiving the loan, making it practically free since, this loan interest works out to roughly Rs. 7-8 crore per month

·        Generally, any such loan even from World Bank or such other agencies costs about 5-7% with a repayment period of 25-35 years, thus India is getting loan for the High-Speed Rail Project at almost zero cost without putting any strain on existing financial resources available with the country, as more than 80% of the project cost is being funded by Government of Japan. Clearly Peter is not paying for Paul.

·        It is for the first time in the history of the country that an infrastructure project is being funded on such favourable terms.

 

Make in India

·        One of the prime objectives of the project is “Make in India”, which is to be realized before commissioning of the project.

·        As per the agreement between Governments, the MAHSR Project has “Make in India” & “Transfer of technology” objectives.Under the guidance of task force (DIPP and Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO)), action is being taken as per accepted concept paper guidelines.

·        Four sub-groups with representatives from Indian industry, Japanese industry, DIPP, NHSRCL & JETRO to identify potential items & sub-systems for make in India

·Active interactions are already taking place between the industries of India and Japan. It is expected that many joint ventures will be formed in the time to come to take up manufacturing of various components including rolling stock. This will not only benefit the Indian Industry with new technology but will also create several job opportunities within the country.

· The Make in India objective will also ensure that most of the amount invested in this project would be spent and utilized within India.

·The construction sector in India will also get a big boost not only in terms of investment but also with respect to new technology and work culture. This project is likely to generate employment for about 20,000 workers during the construction phase, who will be trained specially to take up construction of such projects in India. Some of the new areas where construction skills would be developed are ballast-less track, under sea tunnel etc.

 

· A dedicated High Speed Rail Training Institute is being developed at Vadodara. This institute will be fully equipped with equipment and facilities such as simulator etc. as are existing in the training institute at Japan. This institute will be functional by the end of 2020.The facilities at this institute will be utilized to train about 4,000 staff in next three years, who will then be utilised for operation and maintenance ensuring that this work is through skilled people in India rather than foreign dependent. They will also serve as a backbone for future development of other High Speed Corridors in India

·  In addition, 300 young officials of Indian Railways are being trained in Japan to give them exposure in high Speed Track Technology.

·Keeping in view the long-term plan for human resource development, Government of Japan has also offered 20 seats per year for Master’s course from the universities of Japan, for serving Indian Railway officials. This programme is fully funded by Government of Japan.

 

Cutting edge versus catch up technology

·  Unlike other areas,for high speed, country is getting a cutting-edge technology in totality. The Shinkansen Technology is known for its reliability and safety and is proven for more than 50 years. The train delay record of Shinkansen is less than a minute with zero fatality.

· Thus,the project is set to provide reliable and comfortable service with high standards of safety. The technology regarding disaster predictions and preventions will also be acquired as a part of the project. Such safety systems ensure that the train operation safety is maintained in case of any natural calamity such as earthquake etc.

·   With the presence and availability of this technology, India will be leapfrog to the cutting edge of latest train developments with passengers able to reach their destination in 2 hours as against the current 7-8 hours by train.

·   As the engineering staff learns the latest technology it will also help in developing the same in India

·  Keeping this scale-up in mind, there are other high speed corridors which are being reviewed -  Delhi Kolkata, Delhi Mumbai, Mumbai Chennai, Delhi-Chandigarh, Mumbai-Nagpur, Delhi- Nagpur. All these corridors will also be able to operate high speed trains in the future. For this, the Ministry of Railways has constituted the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited, which is also implementing this MAHSR project.

                Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal today held a marathon meeting with members of full Railway Board & Safety Directorate of Railway Board to comprehensively review Safety measures for train operations. A detailed presentation on Safety was made at the meeting. There was threadbare discussion on the subject and the root cause of repeated cases of train accidents in recent past was thoroughly analysed. In the meeting, the Minister emphasised that the safety is paramount and there cannot & should not be any compromise on this front.

 

Two major causes leading to accidents were identified as :

a)      Unmanned Level Crossings accounted for 34% of accidents in 2016-17

b)      Derailments due to defects in tracks

The special focus of the meeting was to identify measures to reduce accidents due to derailments which has emerged as one of the major causes of Train accidents. Minister of Railways gave following directions to the Railway Board to ensure Safety:

 

1)      All unmanned level crossings should be eliminated expeditiously on the entire Indian Railway network in a year’s time from now. The earlier target was to eliminate these in 3 years but by using Transformative mantra of “Speed, Skill and Scale” this target has been expedited to less than 1 year now.

2)      Track Replacement/renewal should be accorded Priority & the tracks (rails) earmarked for use for constructing new lines should be diverted to places/ stretches which are prone to accidents & where replacement is due.

3)      The procurement of new rails should be expedited on a large scale with a view to complete construction of new lines in time.

4)      The manufacturing of conventional ICF design coaches should be stopped forthwith & new design LHB coaches only should be manufactured.

5)      Anti-Fog LED lights should be installed in Locomotives so that unhindered safe train operations can be ensured during fog season.

The Minister directed the Railway Board to monitor implementations of this action plan on a regular basis.

                The ongoing and targeted projects of National Highways Authority of India would generate estimated employment of approximately 50 crores man days over the next four years on a seasonal basis. This would be averaging to nearly 12.5 crore man-days yearly from 2018-2022. Of this, about 1.0 crore will be professional man-days, 3.5 crore skilled labour man-days and 8.0 crore semi-skilled and un-skilled man days.

The NHAI currently has 282 projects having length of about 20,000 km under implementation across the country out of which 10,000 km of length is targeted to be completed over next one to two years. There are around 220 projects having length of about 31,000 km which are targeted to be awarded and completed in the next 3 to 4 years across all the States in the country under NHDP and Bharat Mala Schemes. Thus, NHAI plans to construct approximately 50,000 km Highways in next 4 years.

This will generate seasonal employment opportunities as successful and efficient execution of projects invariably requires qualified professionals, skilled and semi-skilled work force.

In order to meet the requirement of professionals, skilled and semi-skilled work force, NHAI has undertaken an elaborate exercise for Skill Development. The Chairman, NHAI Shri Deepak Kumar, held a meeting with the officers of Ministry of skill Development and Entrepreneurship to chalk out the road map for skilling of professionals, skilled and semi-skilled workers. Various issues connected with the Skill Development were discussed in the meeting. The Chairman, NHAI asked the officers of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to submit detailed plan of Skill Development in tune with the requirement of NHAI projects. The plan would be finalized in discussion with the concerned stakeholders.

                The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) under Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has constructed nearly 30,000 Km world-class National Highways and has another 20,000 Km scheduled for completion in the next couple of years. The sustained growth will ensure that Indian National Highway network will measure approximately 50,000 Km of highways in the next two years, which is third largest Highways Network in the world. 

However, this achievement also signals the need of focusing on the Highway Operations for rendering world class services to the highway users. Thus the NHAI has created a new Highway Operations Division. This division will focus on all non-commercial Highway Operational activities for efficient network utilization and providing hassle-free services. 

The Highway Operations Division at NHAI will be headed by Member (Admin) and assisted by CGM (IT & HO) and a team of experienced officers. The Highway Operation Division will be in charge of the Electronic Tolling, Wayside Amenities, Road Safety & Security, Incident Management–Helpline, Tracking of Ambulance, Cranes on Highways, Highway Traffic Management System, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Highway Plantation, Road lighting, Wi-Fi and other modern amenities on National Highways.

                The 38th meeting of Transport Development Council is scheduled to be held at Vadodara in Gujarat on the 19thSeptember of September, 2017. Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation said in a statement today that Transport Ministers of all states will come together in the day long meeting to discuss issues like public transport reforms, the status of Vahan and Sarathi sites under Transport National Register, Seamless Transport across state borders, identification of Black Spots, Digitalisation of payments, Inter-State transfer of private vehicles and citizen facilitation.

The Council meeting will give an opportunity to the state Transport Ministers to get an exposure on the new and upcoming reforms in the transport sector. There will be a discussion on the subject of Public Transport Reforms and way forward to Bus Ports. Director, Transport for London (TFL) will participate in this discussion via video conferencing, along with other experts in the sector. The Transport Ministers will also be taken on a visit to the modern Vadodara Bus Terminal and also the Vadodara Automated Driving Testing Track. The objective is to give them a first hand exposure to such modern facilities, so that they can help develop the same in their respective states.

The Transport Development Council is the highest body to advise the Govt. of India on all matters relating to roads and road transport. The Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways is the Chairman of the Council. The Transport Development Council meets at least once in a year.

In their meeting on 19th September the Transport Ministers will also discuss the issue of All India Tourist Bus Permits. In view of the apprehension raised by certain states about loss of revenue, it was decided to place the matter before the Group of Transport Ministers of States for consideration and recommendation.

The Council will also be apprized about the status regarding Vahan and Saarthi sites under Transport National Register. The Transport National Register currently comprises 21.2 Crore Vehicle Registration records and 11.5 Crore Driving License records covering more than 1300 RTOs across 36 states/UTs. This includes real-time data from a large number of RTOs which have now migrated to a Centralized architecture (450 Vahan sites and 650 Sarathi sites till now).

Regarding road safety the Ministry had asked all states to prepare action plans to reduce road accident fatalities. In addition to this, the Supreme Court appointed Road Safety Committee had also directed states to prepare target oriented action plans. In the upcoming meeting all states/UTs will furnish the action taken by them in this regard. The status of rectification of Black Spots will also be reviewed.

The Transport Council will also discuss Seamless Transport across state borders under the GST regime. A Task Force has been constituted by GST Council to suggest measures for creating an Eco-System for seamless road transport connectivity across the country. This would provide for integration of the proposed GST e-Way bill system with the VAAHAN platform of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and help in reducing barriers in road transport.

In order to promote digitalization of payments in the transport sector, a Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Transport Commissioner, Uttar Pradesh and comprising Transport Commissioners of Gujarat, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Assam. The status in this regard will also be discussed.

The Council will also discuss the status of action they have taken with regard to the implementation of guidelines for the protection of Good Samaritans.

                Various establishments like dhabas, buildings, factories, restaurants, hoardings and advertisements have come up along National Highways illegally. These establishments are safety hazards for traffic plying on National Highways as they allow illegal access and parking of vehicles on the highways. Further, unauthorized hoardings and advertisements are safety hazards as these distract drivers.

Setting up of these illegal establishments is a punishable offense under Control of National Highways (Land and Traffic) Act, 2002 (Chapter 3 & 4). The NHAI has issued an Appeal to all such establishments to close the illegal access activities at their level and apply for legal access to their establishments under the policy. They have also been asked to remove all the hoardings and advertisements distracting the attention of drivers for safety of the road users. Failing this, Field Officers have been directed to start a special drive to terminate these illegal access, remove hoardings/ advertisements from the ROW of National Highways and take action against illegal parking of vehicles on National Highways with the help of local police and district administration, including lodging of police complaint against such defaulters.

NHAI achieved the first milestone in Electronic Toll Collection when it operationalised one dedicated FASTag lane at all toll plazas from today. Now FASTag enabled vehicles can cruise through the dedicated FASTag lane without stopping at toll plazas on National Highways.

The FASTag is an RFID tag available both online and offline through banks and Common Service Centres. Two mobile applications were launched by NHAI on 17th August, 2017,for ease of obtaining FASTags, which have received tremendous response. Thousands of road users have downloaded the applications and purchased FASTags in less than two weeks. The penetration of FASTag has increased to 18 % as on 31st August, 2017.

The Government of India has mandated that new vehicles being sold with effect from 1st October, 2017 will be affixed with active FASTag. The “FASTag Partner App” will facilitate more than 6000 dealers in the country to access a single platform and activate the FASTag at the time of delivery of vehicle.

NHAI has also launched massive awareness campaign to make road users aware of the FASTag and its benefits. NHAI officers have been tasked to visit toll plazas personally and ensure operationalisation of single dedicated Electronic Toll Collection lane. NHAI plans that as penetration of FASTag increases, more and more lanes will be dedicated to ETC.

Staying true to the spirit of Antyodaya Mission, which lies in ‘reaching out to the last person, the event, was graced by almost 800 plus candidates and alumni to celebrate and honour beneficiaries from both of MoRD’s flagship skill development programmes i.e. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI).

The event was significant as it was on this day 3 years ago that the Ministry of Rural Development announced DDU-GKY with a focus on building capacity of rural youth to address the needs of domestic and global skills requirements. Additionally, MoRD has re-energized RSETI through alignment with Common Norms for skills development schemes. And through sustained efforts and focus on both programmes, the Ministry has successfully skilled 5.05 lakh rural candidates under DDU-GKY and has also been conducting skilling for self-employment through RSETI with a total of 14.09 lakhs candidate skilled and 9.70 lakhs candidates settled till date.  

 DDU-GKY not only offers industry relevant skill training to candidates, it also works closely with industry and leading corporates to strengthen the post-training employment scenario for its trainees. A result of this is sustained and fruitful corporate linkages pan-India, with leading names like Pizza Hut, KFC, OCIFIT, Safe Express, Matrix to name a few, whose employees i.e. DDU-GKY alumni participated at the event.

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Guest, Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar said that, if India had adopted the skilling mission soon after it got independence, the problem of unemployment would not have achieved such a dimension as it is today. But, he lauded the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to create a new Ministry of Skill Development after it came to power in 2014 and expressed the hope that in coming years more and more youth will be provided training for gainful employment through various skilling missions. He also exhorted the youth present on the occasion to encourage and make aware the rural youth and fellow friends to register on Kaushal Panjee launched at the event from 1stto 15th of October, 2017 for getting quality training and jobs.

In his address, the Minister of State for Rural Development Shri Ram Kripal Yadav said that it is a matter of great pride that after getting training through RSETIs and DDU-GKY, the youth are getting monthly income of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 30,000. He said that quality training imparted at these institutes will make them stand not only at Indian job market, but they can also make a mark  in foreign countries.

The event also witnessed the mobilization platform launch, branded ‘Kaushal Panjee’ (Skill Register). It aims to be citizen centric end-to-end solution to aid mobilization of candidates for RSETIs and DDU-GKY. It facilitates mobilization of candidates through Self Help Group members, Gram Panchayat Functionaries, Block Officials, CSCs and directly by the candidate.  RSETIs and DDU-GKY Partners can access the Kaushal Panjee to connect with the mobilized rural youth. Kaushal Panjee is connected to the Social Economic Caste Census (SECC 2011) which will help the States plan and target their mobilizations based on the socio-economic profile of households in their State.

Another highlight of the event is the re-branding exercise undertaken by MoRD for Rural Self Employment Training Institutes, wherein a new logo for RSETI was unveiled. The logo, depicting ‘reaching for the stars’ aims to portray the RSETI beneficiaries and their achievements.

                Implementation of MGNREGA Scheme has seen major changes in the last two years.  Use of ICT tools, space technology, focus on improving livelihood resource base of people, provision of diversified livelihood opportunities through convergent programme implementation are some of the major features of changes brought in programme management. High budget allocation to meet the objectives of the Act and strengthening of monitoring system have been ensured. Measure like electronic fund management system (eFMS), Aadhaar seeding, Geo tagging of assets and strengthening of Social Audit System are some steps towards bringing in more transparency and accountability in the programme implementation. Emphasis on proper work file maintenance, setting up of Citizen Information Boards as part of Janta Information Systems are some of the other measures.  

The current Financial Year is marked by the highest ever budget allocation of Rs. 48000 Cr. The table below gives a glimpse of the revised estimate at the Centre’s level and the expenditure in the States/UTs over the last 7 years.

* Figures as on 12.09.2017

Availability of funds is not a constraint for the implementation of the program. The Government is committed to provide funds for implementation of MGNREGA.

To ensure that MGNREGA workers receive their wages on time, National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) has been put in place. Almost 96% of wages are being paid directly to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts. Additionally, intense monitoring and fixing accountability for delays in payments has shown significant result in the current financial year. Around 85% of the wages are being paid to the workers in time. This is almost double the percentage in comparison with last FY as can be seen in the graph below:

 



All efforts are being taken by the Ministry to further improve the situation. FTOs for Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal are pending for payment for specific reasons. Internal Audits conducted by the Ministry in the recent past in both the States have detected irregularities in implementation for which the States have been asked to take appropriate steps to rectify the situation. Funds will be released to them once complete and sufficient response is received.  The Ministry reviews the financial status of all States/UTs on daily basis and the issue of release of further funds to the States/UTs wherever FTOs are shown as pending is under examination. It is pertinent to mention that around Rs. 36500 Cr (76% of total allocation) have already been released in this financial year, leading to timely payment of wages in 85% cases.

Through a bottom-up participatory approach, every year the GPs prepare the shelf of works to be executed in the next financial year. These works are taken up considering the 155 permissible activities under the Scheme, which are revised periodically depending upon State requests. The Centre safeguards the decisions of the local bodies through its emphasis on creation of shelf of projects in the GPs and in no way attempts to undermine their authority. However, in accordance with the NREGA Act, Central Employment Guarantee Council (CEGC) under the aegis of the Ministry is expected to guide, regularly evaluate and monitor the implementation of the program on the ground.

Strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor is one of the main objectives of MGNREGS. Apart from meeting the demand for wage employment on the ground, the government is laying stress on strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor and the vulnerable. Close to 1.5 Cr works are taken up every year under MGNREGA. In the last FY, strong push towards work completion led to the highest work completion of 62 Lakhs.

 



These completed works have been geo tagged and made available in public domain improving and enhancing transparency in programme management. More than 2 Cr assets have been geo tagged so far. Now, the Ministry has made it mandatory to geo tag three stages of an asset creation.

In order to optimize public investments, adequate focus is also being laid on convergence of MGNREGS with other schemes. A good example of convergence is houses being constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). While 33 Lakhs houses were constructed in FY 2016-17 with Rs. 18000 from MGNREGS as unskilled wage labour contribution to every house, the current financial year’s target is 51 lakh PMAY houses. Besides, MGNREGA provides Rs. 12000 for construction of household latrines in every PMAY house. Through such examples of convergence, the Ministry is trying to ensure gainful and proper utilization of funds along with provision of wage employment seeking work.

Independent Social Audit Units have been set up in 24 States and 3100 State Resource Persons have been trained to conduct social audit as per auditing standards. Large scale training of Self-Help Group women as Village Resource Persons for social audit is being undertaken.

All initiatives under MGNREGS have been taken in consultation with the States and UTs. The government is committed to make the implementation of the program as effective as possible so that the objectives of the Act can be met.

Multiple assets to a household for augmentation of livelihood potential is a major thrust under MGNREGS. Besides this, skilling the MGNREGS workers through Barefoot Technician program is another initiative. So far, 5380 Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) have been trained so far in 19 States to provide technical support at field level.

 

The Ministry had set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary with representatives of relevant Central Ministries and five State Governments to examine the issue of Alignment of MGNREGA Wages with Minimum Agricultural Wages.  The MGNREGA Wages were notified under Section 6.1 of the MGNREGA Act on 1st December, 2009. For the States where minimum wages were higher than Rs.100/-, those wages were taken as MGNREGA wages. For States where minimum agricultural wages were less than Rs.100/- MGNREGA wages were notified as Rs.100/-.  On   1st December, 2009 only for 4 States, viz. Goa, Haryana, Mizoram and Kerala had minimum wages for agricultural labour was higher than Rs.100/- and these were protected by December, 2009 Notification.  Since then, MGNREGA wages have been indexed to Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour.  The present divergence between MGNREGA wages and minimum wages for agricultural labour is on account of the fact that the States do not follow a scientific and uniform system of indexation of wage rates while MGNREGA wages are increased  based on changes in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labours.

 

The Government has provided much higher allocations to the Ministry of Rural Development in the last three years.  As is evident from the table below, the allocation to Rural Development programmes for creation of infrastructure, rural housing and employment has gone up from 0.50% of the GDP in 2012-13 to 0.63% of the GDP in 2016-17:

The Govt of India is launching a National Mission on Deep Ocean Research which will bring in huge economic benefits by harnessing the ocean resources (water, energy and minerals). A special thematic session on Deep Ocean Research will be held.  

The Scientific departments and Ministries of the Government of India have active international collaboration in science and technology both at the bilateral and regional level. India is engaged in R&D cooperation with more than 44 countries across the globe including advanced, emerging and developing nations. The S&T Ministers Conclave at IISF-2017 will provide an opportunity to exchange the scientific and technological priorities of the participating countries that can help to develop a roadmap for S&T cooperation.This roadmap can be used by all the S&T Departments to engage proactively with each of these countries. The focus will be on capacity building through mechanisms such as fellowships, internships, twinning, training, data sharing, joint projects and technology transfer. The development and deployment of affordable and innovative technologies that provide solution to societal problems will also be a common agenda for the Conclave. Participation of Ministers from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Portugal are expected in the Conclave.

‘Science for New India’ aims to provides a platform to young students, scientists and technocrats from across India for the exchange of knowledge & ideas in the line of flagship programs like 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', ‘Swasth Bharat Abhiyan’, 'Make in India', 'Digital India’, ‘Smart Villages’, 'Smart Cities’, 'Namami Gange', 'Unnath Bharath Abhiyan', etc.

An important event of the IISF-2017 is the Science Village program which is linked with the Pradhan Manthri Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana to reach out to the rural masses and propagate science to the extent of seeking scientific solutions to the diverse challenges facing our society, particularly rural India.. Each Member of Parliament will nominate 5 students from class 9th – 11th and 1 teacher from their adopted village. The Science Village will thus demonstrate a mass representation from the rural parts of India and a continuation of the democratic process: ”Parliament to Panchayat”. The prime goal of the science village is to give exposure to the students from rural India and make them aware of India’s achievements in the frontier areas of science & technology.

As a unique programme of IISF 2017, a Women Scientists & Entrepreneur’s Conclave titled “Game Changers Driving Science for New India” would be organized to promote and encourage science education and entrepreneurship among the women. The aim of the programme is to develop new entrepreneurship and also explore new vistas of opportunities in the field of science and technology among the women.

The Industry-Academia interaction meet aims at Industry – Academic Institutional tie ups in R&D and achieving improved efficiency in production and manufacturing. The interaction will bring out a brief proceeding on the recent paradigm changes in various sectors of Industry. Representatives from industry and academia will also have a good opportunity to discuss the changing trends on management principles, scientific advancement and technological assimilation in industry and economy.

National Innovation Foundation (NIF) will be organising the ‘Innovation Exhibition’ as a part of the Grassroots Innovators Summit, which aims at providing a common platform for various stakeholders—from innovators, students, researchers to policy makers. About 100 innovative technologies from all states of the country will be showcased at the exhibition. The special focus will be given to those which could be diffused socially and generate employment.

The Round Table Meet on Mass Communication will address the various methods and techniques to popularize science and its applications. In the International Science Film Festival, Films on science focusing on science fiction from India and abroad will be screened.

World record attempts have been a key part of IISF since 2015; in IISF 2015, students took a successful shot at the Guinness world record for the World's Largest Science Lesson at IIT Delhi. In IISF 2016, at NPL, Pusa, a group of 550 students attempted the world record for Largest Gathering of People Dressed as Nobel Prize-winning scientist Albert Einstein. In IISF 2017, a World Record attempt will be made in ""Largest Biology Lesson"". 1000 students from Class 9th & 10th will be gathering at the venue in Chennai for this attempt.

The IISF is not only a celebration of science and technology through exhibitions and relevant events, but also has been geared up to spread awareness on the flagship programs like ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, ‘Swasth Bharat Abhiyan’, ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’.

The Honourable Vice President of India and many Union Ministers will be participating in IISF-2017.

The IISF will go a long way in delivering the goal of imparting ‘spirit of enquiry’ to the public masses.

The exhibition comprised of demonstration of models, and technologies explaining scientific and technological intervention brought in by these ministries.

 

CSIR showcased the technology of Terafil and tiles made from plastic waste. Terafil is a low cost burnt red clay porous media (disc/candle), used for filtration & treatment of turbid raw water into clean drinking water for domestic/ community applications.   It can be fixed with any container for purification of water.    It operates without electricity, spent water and sludge management.  

 

Tiles made from waste plastics were demonstrated. Novel features of these tiles include its high mechanical strength, flame retardency, UV protection and anti-static response. These tiles can be used in designing of structure like Smart Toilets that will be beneficial for the villages and large section of the society.

 

Several posters depicting the technological intervention made for Swachh Bharat were also displayed.  CSIR undertook the study of special properties of Ganga water which include medicinal and anti-bacterial properties. Rich and diverse population of bacteriophages against various type of bacteria were observed in Ganga water. CSIR monitored sediment and water quality of river Ganga from Gomukh to Gangasagar at 70 locations and also 35 locations along river Narmada and river Yamuna for comparative study.

 

CSIR demonstrated, how mobile van developed by its Laboratory monitors air quality and provide instantaneous data relating to vehicular emissions. Data helps to identify the areas with high level of air pollution and suggest remedial measures to contain air pollution. CSIR also displayed technology for eco-restoration of mine through use of biotechnology.

 

CSIR has developed Phytorid Waste Water Treatment technology. The technology involves a constructed wetland exclusively designed for the treatment of municipal, urban, agricultural and industrial wastewater.     The phytorid technology can be constructed in series and parallel modules / cells depending on the land availability and quantity of wastewater to be treated.  

 

 Multi-sector application of climate and weather informatics which is helpful for society and industries was also displayed.

 

CSIR-CLRI has developed and deployed the technologies for end-of-pipe treatment for the waste generated in leather processing and increasing the efficiency of the common effluent treatment plants.  

 

 The autonomous institutes of Department of Science & Technology(DST) exhibited the technologies they developed that are relevant to Swachhata Mission as part of ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’.

The Institute of Nanoscience & Technology, Mohali has developed a technology for low cost water purification system for domestic and industrial waste water treatment.  It uses nano absorbents to treat water from toxic wastes.

The other technology is for recovering Nanostructured materials from the used batteries waste and industrial waste using environment friendly approach. The materials recovered include metal oxide, silica, sodium nitrate and sodium carbonate which can be used for treatments of organic pollutants in water.

National Innovation Foundation showcased ideal technologies developed by innovators for waste collection to fulfill the objective of “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan”.  It can be boon for sanitation workers as it reduces effort and time but increases coverage and frequency of area being cleaned. The first one is Wrapper Picker, designed to collect light weight garbage except fine dust. It is battery operated device with an in-built provision to indicate the status of charge in battery. The other one is INSPIRE awarded innovation called Manual Waste Lifting and Dumping Device. It is helpful in providing manual and mobile waste tool with picking and dumping facility to make it more effective. 

Vigyan Prasar  showcased sanitation and hygienic practices in a very simplified manner  that should be carried out in day to day lives by  different sections of society.

Department of Bio-Technology (DBT)   showcased a range of technologies like clean energy, river cleaning initiatives, technologies to clean up waste water, supporting bio-toilets and a range of other waste management & utilization technologies. 

India’s first home grown technology to convert biomass to ethanol with speed and efficiency was developed by the Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai. The rate of conversion of biomass to ethanol in this technology is faster than other technologies currently available in the international market.

                Department of Science and Technology is implementing several initiatives for upliftment and economic development of rural areas in the country.  A number of appropriate technologies have been developed, demonstrated and deployed at several locations in the country.

The Minister of Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harshvardhan today launched “Pt Deen Dayal Upadhayay Vigyan Gram Sankul Pariyojana” which will experiment and endeavour to formulate and implement appropriate S&T Interventions for Sustainable Development through cluster approach in Uttarakhand.

Addressing the press, the Minister said that this project has been inspired by teachings and ideals of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhayay whose birth centenary is being celebrated this year.

DST has conceived to adopt a few clusters of villages in Uttarakhand and transform them to become self-sustainable in a time bound manner through the tools of Science and Technology (S&T). The key deliverable in this approach is to utilise local resources and locally available skill sets and convert them in a manner using science and technology, that substantial value addition takes place in their local produce and services which can sustain the rural population locally.  Further, the local communities are not compelled to migrate from their native places in search of jobs and livelihoods. Once this concept is validated in the few selected clusters, it can be replicated across large number of village clusters in the country.

Four clusters at Gaindikhata, Bazeera, Bhigun (in Garhwal) and Kausani (in Kumaon) have been selected for the intervention through a series of dialogues held among officials of DST and Uttarakhand State Council of Science and Technology (UCOST); Gramodaya Network, Surabhi Foundation and Uttarakhand Utthan Parishad; and other experts. Intensive interaction with local population and field visits were carried out to identify the challenges and opportunities that exist in the clusters.

About a lakh of people would benefit directly or indirectly through this project in four identified clusters of 60 villages in Uttarakhand for pilot phase which are located at different altitudes (up to 3000 meters). As the living conditions and resources available at different altitude is relatively different, the adopted strategy would help in creating models that are appropriate for different altitudes and could then be replicated in other hill states as well.

Areas of interventions in these selected clusters would be processing and value addition of milk, honey, mushroom, herbal tea, forest produce, horticulture and local crops, medicinal & aromatic plants and traditional craft and handloom of Uttarakhand.  Post-harvest processing of Kiwi, Strawberry, Cherry, Tulsi, Adrak, Badi Elaichi through solar drying technology, extraction of apricot oil using cold press technology. Stringent product and process control interventions for energy and water conservation would also be ensured through this project.

Novel strategies for sustainable development in this ecologically fragile state are important. Practice of agriculture, agro-based cottage industries and animal husbandry in an eco-friendly manner will be emphasized during the implementation of the project.  

Sustainable employment and livelihood options within the clusters such as eco-tourism, naturopathy and yoga, are also planned to be promoted.

These clusters would act as model production cum training and demonstration centres. There is a possibility of replicating this pilot phase initiative in other hill states of the country once it is established and stabilized. Various scientific institutions would participate collectively in this endeavour to accomplish the dream of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay  towards ‘Swavlamban’.

Department of Science and Technology (DST) has committed Rs 6.3 crore support for a period of three years for this project.

Dr. Mahesh Sharma, former Chairman, KVIC and Director General, Madhya Pradesh Council of Science and Technology and now Chairman, Gramodaya Network and Coordinator Gram Sankul Yojana is steering this unique initiative. Addressing the gathering, he said, ”In my opinion, this is not a routine project.  DST has responded to a call from the grassroots by providing technical and scientific inputs which is critical for any project.”

                The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under the Ministry of Science & Technology,  has taken many steps to brings about a paradigm shift in biotechnology in the country’s North-East Region (NER). Eyeing an inclusive growth, DBT has announced a series of new programs and missions to turn this into a reality. DBT has established a dedicated ‘North Eastern Region Biotechnology Programme Management Cell (NER-BPMC)’, with an annual investment of Rs. 180 crores, to evolve, implement and foster biotechnology research in the north east states.

On the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Birth Centenary, the Minister of S&T, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forests & Climate Change,  Dr. Harshvardhan announced three major new initiatives for the North East. These new initiatives are in congruence to the Pandit Deendayal  Upadhyaya’s philosophy of “Integral Humanism” which is a synthesis of the material and the spiritual, the individual and the collective, which the world is now calling as “One Health” embodying the health of human, animal and environment as one.

The Minister said that DBT has committed to dedicate each year, at least 10% of the budget for the North-East.  This year at least Rs.200 crores is expected to be spent for North-East Programmes.  The Minister informed that as a result of the programmes, North East has become a major hub of biotechnology at the foundational level.  The biotech programmes are of the highest quality, the institutions have state-of-the-art facilities and there has now been an impact on innovation and entrepreneurship because of excellent human resources programmes.

 

I.                   Phyto-Pharma Plant Mission: This is a Rs 50 crore Mission aimed at conservation and cultivation of endangered and threatened endemic medicinal plants, and discovery of new botanical drugs for unmet medical needs using the rich traditional ethno-botanical knowledge and biodiversity of these states and at the same time also improve availability of authentic and quality botanical raw material on sustainable basis for a boom in the phyto-pharmaceutical industry. Through this Mission, it is expected to enable farmers from NE states and phyto-pharmaceutical industry to become global leaders in production and export of some quality botanical drugs for unmet medical needs.   For this Mission, DBT will be the nodal coordinating and implementing department and work closely with Ministry of DONER and other identified institutions.

 

DBT has announced launch of the Phyto-pharmaceutical Mission in NER with three major objectives: 

 

(i)                 Captive cultivation of selected medicinal plants of NER, which have great demand to ensure supply of authentic and quality botanical raw material to the user industries in the country. 

(ii)               Development of technology packages for production of GMP grade medicinal plant extracts for export markets.

(iii)             Production of safe and efficacious phytopharmaceuticals from medicinal plants of NER for unmet medical needs using modern scientific tools and following global standards.

 

II.        Brahmaputra Biodiversity and Biology Boat (B4) on the Brahmaputra River, a major ecology hotspot, in NER, in collaboration with DONER,  B4 will establish a large barge on the river with a well-equipped laboratory for analysis of all components of the entire ecosystem of the river and surroundings. The B4 will link to all thelocal research institutions along the river, as well as national and international laboratories.

B4 will have capability to analyse soil, water, environment, plant and animal life, human health andagriculture and  an  equal component that involves local citizens in the experimental process of science in data generation and management. B4 will also have a teaching laboratory for school/college children. It is also proposed to have mobile satellite boat labs which will run along the tributaries of Brahmaputra to feed in data to the mainB4.

 

III.       Frugal microscopy through the Foldscope: a frugal microscope assembled from simple components, including a sheet of paper and a lens, is acting as a tool connecting students and science from the region, with the rest of the country.

A total 525 applications from schools, colleges have been received: 112 from schools, 357 from collegesand 56 from citizen scientists. All applicants will receive a micro grant between Rs 4 lakhs to 8 Lakhs as well as a supply of Foldscopes while being linked with NER.

 

Dr. Harshvardhan informed that in addition to the three new announcements, DBT has many major ongoing projects in the North-East in the following areas:

 Skilling Human Resources:

Twinning R&D Programme:  DBT has initiated 480 R&D twinning programs that link institutes in NER with those across the country. With an investment of Rs. 90 crores in the last three years, this effort has resulted in 252 research publications and 600 Junior and Senior Research fellowships awarded to the students to pursue biotechnology research.

To create an environment of training and research in medial biotechnology, DBT has supported Medical Diagnostic facilities at 11 medical colleges in NER with an investment of Rs. 40.00 crores. This facility is providing quality diagnostic services as well as carrying out research on various health problems prevalent in the region using modern biotechnology tools and technologies. So far more than 4.70 lakhs tests in different disease have been conducted by these diagnostic facility.

DBT’s ‘Overseas Associateship for North East Region’ has seen 208 scientists from NER being trained overseas with Rs. 5.25 crore invested every year to support this programme.  Through the DBT-NER Visiting Research Professorship (VRP) Scheme, 30 Scientists/Faculty are selected for bringing advancement in the field of biotechnology and life sciences in various institutions by sharing their vast experience and expertise with NER researchers and students.

At school levels, DBT has launched the ‘Biotechnology Labs in Senior Secondary schools (BLiSS) programme’, a first of its kind in India, for schools where biotechnology labs have been set up at 88 Senior Secondary Schools from NER with an investment of Rs. 2.20 crores.

For universities, DBT has set up 30 Bioinformatics Centre at an investment of Rs. 9 crores for conducting research on genomics, proteomics and data analysis. 

Under the ‘Biotech Industrial Training Programme’, deserving students have been provided stipends during their training at biotech/life science industries. DBT is also supporting 15 institutes in NER recognised as ‘Star colleges’ to provide them with enhanced lab infrastructure and mentoring by leading scientists and Fellows of various national academies.

To provide these students with access to world-class journals and publications, the DBT e-Library consortium (DeLCON) has been launched in partnership with 18 institutions of NER, which provides access to more than 900 high impact e-journals. With an investment of Rs. 54. crores in last 3 years, this facility has been extended to more than 150 colleges benefiting about 1500 life science students.

Infrastructure and Resource building

Infrastructural support for biotechnology has been provided under many programs. DBT has established 126 ‘Biotech Hubs’ at various institutions, universities and colleges to promote education, training and research in biological sciences including biotechnology. With over Rs. 22 crores invested in last three years, about 1000 training programmes were conducted by these hubs, with more than 1000 students, researchers and school teachers as beneficiaries.

DBT has also created biotech infrastructural facilities at North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (​NEIGRIHMS), Shillong, at an investment of Rs. 4.50 crores.

The DBT has established many centres of excellence across NER to focus on different applications of biotechnology. The DBT-AAU Centre of Excellence on Agriculture Biotechnology at Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Jorhat, promotes agriculture biotechnology research and is helping farmers by developing elite varieties for local crops and improving their yield. The centre, established with an investment of Rs. 36.70 crores.

The Centre of Excellence on Fisheries & Aquaculture Biotechnology (FAB) in Tripura has adopted 2 villages to provide local fishermen with good quality fish seeds to produce high quality fish products, benefiting 200 farmers.

DBT has also sanctioned an amount of Rs. 45.00 cores for the establishment of a regional level Animal House facility at Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Dibrugarh in Assam, which will be accessible to entire biomedical research community of NER for carrying out critical animal experiments in disease biology, molecular medicine, vaccinology and pharmacology.

Another related initiative is the Advance Animal Disease Diagnostic & Management Consortium (ADMaC) for surveillance and control of trans-boundary, exotic and zoonotic pathogens from NER. This programme will house a first Animal-BSL 3 lab in NER.

To conserve the delicate ecology of the region, DBT has sanctioned Rs. 26 crores for a major network programme on chemical ecology of NER in collaboration with leading institutions in India like IISc, NCBS, and UAS Bangalore.

Recognising the rich biodiversity of the region, DBT is also pushing for the development of ‘NER-Scented Rice’ -- a biotechnology inspired variant of the aromatic rice, and NER-Banana. The aromatic rice of NER, especially Joha and Black rice, are of premium value because of their aroma and high medicinal characteristics. But, these are also poor yielders and are susceptible to pest attacks. DBT is now seeking innovative approaches that use biotechnological intervention to ameliorate the agronomic characteristics of this aromatic rice and other scientific properties, besides yield enhancement. Under the various twinning programmes, projects like these are being implemented with an investment of Rs.16.67 crores.

 

Existing programs flagged off by DBT in the region have been enormously successful with almost all the allocated budget being utilised for the proliferation of biotechnology in the North-Eastern states of India. Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Hon’ble Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences has been instrumental in implementing these initiatives in the region and has personally visited each and every state in NER to review on-the-spot progress of these programmes and to interact with students, academia, scientists and local communities. This has resulted in skilled human resources and enhanced research infrastructure and resource building

                Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology,   announced the expansion of its first joint International laboratory with National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST) Japan named as DBT-AIST International Laboratory for Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB) to DAICENTER by signing a contract on September 13, 2017 in Delhi.  

 



DIACENTRE expands the scope of the collaboration to focused research activities with several institutions in India and other Asian countries like Sri-Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand at a Mission mode. It will also provide a platform for translation of research of leads emerging from the bi-lateral co-operations in collaboration with the Industry and opportunity for training of young scientists.

It will involve continued research, training and innovative networking programs enrolling DAILAB@AIST and its Six SISTERs (Satellite International Institutes for Special Training Education and Research).  DAICENTER will focus to connect academia to industry and network innovation to entrepreneurship promoting S&T relationship of the two countries. 

 Signing the contract to extend the collaborations, Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Secretary, DBT commented that India and Japan have lots to share in Science on complementary basis and merge experience to education for the next generations and bring their research outcomes to needs of society worldwide. He added that while Japan stands out with the expertise of its scientists in areas like stem cell research, India can offer its young science brains that can be trained to use this expertise to bring about solutions for diseases.

 “The collaboration so far has created long lasting networks helped accelerate drug discovery, identified anti-cancer properties of traditional plants like Aswagandha, brought out high quality joint research publications. We will look forward to more research leads and translations,” said Dr Ryoji Chubachi, President, AIST.

 Speaking about the benefits of the collaboration to India, Dr Madhan Mohan, Advisor DBT said, “Japan has advanced expertise in areas like stem cells, we expect our young researchers to learn from them and use this to work on applying them to tackle diseases like sickle cell Anaemia which are specific to India.”

 Setting up a DBT lab in the University of Kyoto and an AIST lab in IIT Delhi & another in the Regional Centre for Biotechnology has given a truly international character to the collaboration. While DBT has spent for the infrastructure for the AIST lab at IIT and RCB, University of Kyoto maintains it. On the other hand the infrastructure of the DBT lab in AIST Tsukuba was established by Japan and maintained by DBT.

The DBT-AIST collaboration which started in 2007 has seen a gradual strengthening of ties and has produced high quality research leads over the years.

                The retirement age of superannuation of doctors working in hospitals in 11 Major Ports has been enhanced to 65 years from the existing 60 years by the Union Cabinet on 27th September, 2017.

Availability of skilled healthcare professionals poses a key constraint in expanding the health service delivery in Port hospitals. As there is shortage of doctors in Major Port Trust’s health institutions, efforts are already on to recruit doctors to bridge the shortage.

The decision of the Government to enhance the age of retirement of doctors to 65 years will help in retaining the existing strength of experienced doctors thereby providing better patient care satisfaction. More than 200 doctors working in Port hospital would be benefitted by this decision. This would also help in improving doctor-patient ratio in 11 Major Port Hospitals.

The decision of the Government is people-centered and pro-patient. It will strengthen health services in Major Ports Trusts and services of experienced doctors shall be available to bring quality health services. This move will also address the shortage of doctors in Port hospitals.

                The Ministry of Shipping has issued a notification renaming Kandla Port Trust as Deendayal Port Trust with effect from 25th of September, 2017. Kandla Port, located on the Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat, is one of the twelve major ports in the country. As per the Ministry’s notification, the Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred on it under Indian Ports Act, 1908, made the amendment to replace “Kandla” with “Deendayal”.

While inaugurating various projects at Kandla Port in May this year, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had given the suggestion for renaming of Kandla Port after Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who stood for the uplift of the poor and weaker sections of society. The Ministry of Shipping issued the required notification on the occasion of the closing of the year long centenary celebrations of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.

The Government of India signed a loan deal worth $76 million with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) today, for a project to upgrade the environment management plan at Alang-Sosiya ship recycling yards. The total cost of the project will be $ 111 million, out of which $76 million will be provided as soft loan from JICA. Out of the remaining amount, $25 million as taxes and fees will be borne by Government of Gujarat and the balance $10 million will be shared by Ministry of Shipping & Government of Gujarat. The project will be executed by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) and is likely to be completed by 2022. 

This project will help the Alang-Sosia ship-recycling yards to comply with international safety & environmental regulations. This will attract more business at the recycling facilities at Alang, thereby further consolidating India’s share in the global ship-recycling industry. 

This project will also help in safeguarding the marine and coastal environment. The use of advanced decontamination technology will rule out the possibility of fire accidents in oil and chemical tankers, thereby ensuring workers safety. 

The project is expected to result in increase in direct employment from 50,000 to 92,000 people and in-direct employment from 1.5 lakhs to 3 lakh people.

The Ukrainian Minister assured that she would ascertain the convenience of the Ukrainian side for having the said MoU signed at the earliest.

Secretary also sought the support of Ukraine on the issue of India’s candidature for election to the IMO Council under Category “B”. A formal request has already been sent to the Ukrainian Government through the Embassy of India in Kiev in this regard. The Ukrainian Minister responded positively and assured that concerned authorities in Ukraine would be informed.

The other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Ms. Olga Trofimtseva, Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, Dr..Igor Polikha, Ambassador of Ukraine in New Delhi, Ms. Ivan S.Konovalov, First Secretary, Embassy of Ukraine in New Delhi, Mr. Andre, First Secretary, Embassy of Ukraine in New Delhi and Mr. Oleksiy Ivanyuta, Chief of Sales Department, Energomashspetsstl.

The RFID tagging at gates has been implemented at all ports. This enables seamless entry-exist of trucks and in-port movement to optimize cargo flow, besides enhancing security. Trucks as well as drivers’ entry-exist is recorded using RFID card system doing away with paperwork thus reducing human interface. This is one of the steps taken in order to benchmark major ports with globally renowned ports.

The Ministry has also been proactively undertaking legislative reforms to weed out old obsolete laws and enhancing connectivity of ports to improve their efficiency under its Sagarmala Programme.

With India striving to improve its manufacturing competitiveness with Make in India, the Govt of India is leaving no stone unturned to make ports the drivers of socio- economic change and aid long term growth trajectory of the economy. The resounding success of IPO of Cochin Shipyard Ltd is one such example of the positive investor sentiments. The issue got oversubscribed 76 times. Recently the RBI report has also acknowledged higher growth in cargo traffic as well as efficiency gains measured in turnaround time at ports which is helping in transforming Indian economy.

                In the wake of recent deaths of many persons in Delhi while cleaning sewer/septic tanks, Sh. Manhar  Valji  Bhai Zala, Chairman, National Commission for Safai Karamcharis along with the member of the Commission  Smt. Manju Diler held a meeting with Shri Anil Baijal, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister, Govt. of NCT of Delhi  today in the Raj Bhawan, New Delhi.

Expressing his deep sense of grief and sorrow at the loss of lives of so many persons in the last couple  of  months in the city, the Chairman of the Commission urged the Delhi Government  to ensure implementation of  “The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013”  in its true letter and spirit  to check recurrences of  such accidents. He also urged the Delhi Government to immediately ban the hazardous cleaning of sewers/septic tanks manually and for complete mechanization of   this type of cleaning. He also expressed his reservations about nil reporting of insanitary latrines and manual scavengers by the city government and demanded that a  re-survey in this regard should be conducted through an independent third party.

Sharing his concerns in this regard, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi apprised the Commission about the various steps being taken by the City government to address the problem. The city government has introduced a new safety protocol for cleaning of sewers/septic tanks with emphasis on minimum human intervention for the job.  The Chief Minister of Delhi also informed the Commission that the City government is very much alive and sensitive to the problem and that he himself visited the family members of  all the victims and handed over  the  cheques of Rs. 10.00 lacs each as the compensation.

                Addressing the 45th Annual General Meeting of Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) held here today, Chairman SAIL, Shri PK Singh was confident of improvement in Company’s performance starting this financial year (FY 2017-18) backed by several management initiatives in every area of operations. Shri Singh said that, “Given the current stage of development in Indian economy and the likely growth path for Country's economy in next decade, the steel demand in India will witness significant growth in future. SAIL with newer and better technologies at its disposal aims to leverage potential of growth in steel demand by operating at rated capacities, product differentiation and customer satisfaction.” World steel association too, in its short range outlook has a forecast of 6.1% growth in steel consumption for India in 2017. The Company since inception has produced 475 Million Tonnes (MT) of Crude steel and has partnered in all major national projects requiring steel. Shri Singh added that, “the Company achieved 14% higher turnover during FY 2016-17 over previous year owing to increase in both sales volume (which grew by 8%) and Net Sales Realisation (NSR) of Saleable Steel of five Integrated Steel Plants by about 6%. The increase in NSR was partly due to an overall improvement in price levels and partly due to measures in enriching Company's product mix.”

Sharing the developments on Company’s endeavors towards product value addition, Shri Singh added that, “SAIL has done significant value addition in its product mix, with higher grades of steel like API X-70 from RSP's New Plate Mill for the oil & gas sector, SAIL HT-600 for the automotive sector and high strength LPG steel grade from Bokaro Steel Plant, etc. Continuous product development efforts are being made with intensive R&D efforts especially from the new state of the art mills commissioned under the Modernisation and Expansion Plan. Amongst the Indian steel producers your company continues to be in the forefront in R&D with the highest spending.” Going further he added that, “SAIL’s state-of-the-art New Universal Rail Mill at its Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP) was inaugurated by Hon'ble Steel Minister earlier this year, where World's longest single piece rail of 130 mtrs length is being produced and supplies of welded 260 mtrs rail panels to Indian Railways is in progress. The already operational new facilities under modernization and expansion were ramped up during the year. New Blast Furnace at Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) achieved about 100% of its capacity, whereas, other facilities like the New Plate Mill (NPM) also produced near to their rated capacities and it is very near to operating at 100% of its capacity.” He also added that the Wire Rod Mill of ISP will be soon producing world class Wire rods in special grades to meet the requirement of the Indian and Global Steel industries. He also sounded assured of the global trends in steel industry, and said that, “World economic recovery is on track and a pickup in Global growth presents a healthy sign for industrial and manufacturing activities across globe. Meanwhile, India is projected to become the world's fifth largest economy in 2017, surpassing UK and France and the world's third largest economy by 2023, surpassing Japan and Germany. India's GDP is projected to rise from USD 2.2 trillion in 2016 to USD 3.6 trillion by 2020. This augurs well for businesses that are focused on domestic growth in the future.” He added that such kind of growth will definitely create larger steel demand and boost consumption in country.

Throwing light on Company’s new initiatives towards remodelling its operations, Shri Singh mentioned that, “drives including SAIL steel - Gaon ki ore, a campaign designed to boost SAIL steel consumption in rural India, SAIL Uday for improving SAIL’s all round performance, SAIL management’s large group interactions at every Plant – for improving cross functioning within organization, adopting social media at large to engage a larger audience etc. will all translate into Company’s better, sounder and stronger performance. At a time when domestic steel demand is improving on back of government backed policies and developmental goals, SAIL is also expeditiously equipping itself to serve market requirements fully and claim broader market share.

                The sixth India Minerals and Metals Forum organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) of Kolkata gets underway in New Delhi tomorrow. The Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh will inaugurate it.

The discussion in the seminar focuses on Indian steel industry looking up to 2025; mining, production demand and delivery; Innovative applications for a future ready non- ferrous ecosystem; and Metals industry outlook– present challenges and future prospects. The Indian steel sector has grown rapidly over the past few years and presently it is the third largest steel producer globally, contributing to about 2% of the country's GDP. India has also crossed 100 MT mark for production for sale.

India is seen as a “bright spot” for the global steel production growth on account of the government’s push to augment capacity and demand from the construction, automotive and infrastructure sectors. The government has been spearheading growth in steel production capacity, with upgrades being made to existing steel manufacturing units and state-owned companies stepping in to build new steel plants.

The Cabinet approved the National steel policy 2017 that envisages Rs. 10 lakh crore investment to create more capacity in the steel sector. The development is significant as the steel sector is reeling under weak demand and rising raw material prices. The policy also aims at increasing supply of domestic coking coal to cut dependence on imports by half and production of 300 million tonnes by 2030.

The policy also emphasizes at increasing per capita steel consumption to 160 kg by 2030 and encouraging the industry to be a world leader on energy and raw material-efficient steel production in a safe and sustainable manner by maintaining quality standards for domestic steel products.

India's growing urban infrastructure and manufacturing sectors indicate that demand is likely to remain robust in years ahead.

Despite the current challenges, Indian steel industry still has significant potential for growth, underscored by the fact that the per capita steel consumption in the country at 61 kg is much lower than the global average of 208 kg.

However, in the non-ferrous segment, the non-ferrous metals industry (Aluminium, Copper, Zinc, Lead, Tin and Nickel) is looking for a level-playing field against the surge in imports due to inverse duty structure as well as dumping of cheap subsidized goods from China. The situation has been aggravated by India having the FTAs with ASEAN countries, which allows duty free imports of finished goods.

The Aluminium demand continued to remain strong following the steps taken by the government to boost the industrial production and infrastructure. The demand is also expected to rise following the focus on smart cities and improving prospects of business in construction industry.

Technology and innovation play an important role in achieving sustainable growth and impacting competitiveness. Today, mineral and metal industry across the globe is facing a serious economic crisis due to continuous fall in commodity prices, depleting raw material sources, non-availability of high-grade ores, stringent environmental rules and societal expectations. v To take the discussion forward, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is organizing the sixth India Minerals and Metals Forum in New Delhi on 20 September 2017. On this occasion, Earnest & Young has prepared a knowledge document on the metals sector, which highlights the overview of the volatility in metals sector. The Chief Guest Chaudhary Birender Singh, Union Minister of Steel, Government of India, Shri Arun Kumar, Secretary Mines, Government of India and other dignitaries present during the Inaugural Session, will release the report.

                Welcoming the imposition of Countervailing Duty on imports of Stainless Steelflat products by the Ministry of Finance, Union Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh said in New Delhi today that, “CVD on Stainless Steel will strengthen the ongoing efforts of Indian industry for moving towards 100 % quality regime for better safety and health of users. This will provide a level playing field to the industry to grow to its full potential after attaining 2nd largest rank in stainless steel production in world in 2016.” 

The notification issued by the Ministry of Finance, dated 7th September 2017, prescribes a total of 18.95% CVD on imports of Stainless steel flat products from China for the next five years. Reacting to the development Dr. Aruna Sharma, Secretary Steel said, “This is the first case of imposition of CVD on any steel product in India. This would provide the much needed relief to the stainless steel industry from the subsidized imports from China.” Dr Sharma said that this was one among the many steps taken by the Government to help the domestic Stainless Steel Industry. Among the other steps were the imposition of the Stainless Steel Quality Control Order (QCO) and other trade remedial measures. 

The CVD investigations were initiated on 12th April 2016 by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) in response to a surge in subsidized imports of stainless steel flat products. These imports were distorting the domestic market, which was under huge stress and was leading to financial stress in the industry. Extensive investigations were carried out by DGAD and the final findings were issued by the DGAD vide notification dated 4th July 2017. 

The final findings list a possible 81 known subsidies being provided by China. They were categorized into five different heads including Grants (0.55%), Export Financing (0%), Tax & VAT incentives (2.3%), Provision of Goods & services (15.78%) and Preferential loans and lending totaling 18.95%.

                In his weekly review meeting with senior officials of Ministry of Steel in New Delhi on 5th September, the Union Minister of Steel Shri Birender Singh, tasked the Ministry officials to play active role in transforming and turning around Steel PSUs. Senior Ministry officials will be given responsibility of monitoring the performance of individual steel plants by on-ground visits and reviews, he added. These officials will check the progress of each plant in terms of achievements of the targets set out for them. It is noteworthy that Ministry of Steel had earlier constituted an Expert Committee, which has made recommendations for improving production and productivity of these plants. While outlining the agenda for the future, the Minister remarked that no laxity will be tolerated at any level, and there has to be accountability and a result-oriented approach built into the work culture of Ministry of Steel and the PSUs. He also directed the Ministry officials to work on instituting an award of “Plant of Excellence” for the best performing Plant among Steel PSUs, so that other Plants can get inspired to excel. The steel production target of 300 million tonnes set in the National Steel Policy-2017 will have to be broken down year-wise and exponential annual increase will have to be ensured for realistic achievement, the Minister added.

He appreciated the accomplishments in the past and stated that steel sector has much more potential which needs to be harnessed for the vision of “Make in Steel for Make in India.”

The Secretary Steel, Dr. Aruna Sharma, Joint Secretaries and other officials from Ministry of Steel attended the meeting.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Central Silk Board (CSB), India and National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS), Japan for collaborative research in the field of silkworm and silk industries. 

The MoU was signed on 11.11.2016 between CSB and NIAS for initiating a Collaborative Research for developing prolific bivoltine hybrids of silkworm suitable for the Indian tropical conditions. The MoU is of scientific and technological nature. It would help in developing prolific hybrid silkworms, which would improve the manufacturing capacity and the quality standards of the Indian sericulture industry and thereby enhance exports of silk and silk products. 

It is expected that subsequent to the MoU, the Indian Textiles & Apparel Industry would be able to produce world class silk and silk products. The improvement of quality and productivity would ultimately increase export of silk products.

There is fabulous collection of tribal paintings mainly Saura from Orissa, Gond from Madhya Pradesh, Warli from Maharashtra and Pithora from Gujarat.

 

From a single store in 1999 at Delhi, now TRIFED has established a chain of 42 retail outlets and tie-ups with 13 State level Emporiums. The idea is to provide opportunities to the tribal artisans of the country to market their products on a sustained basis. TRIFED plans to expand this network to other cities as well so as to provide a larger market for tribal products. 

 

Background:

A National Workshop on Minimum Support Price for Minor Forest Produce Scheme was organised by Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED). Tribals constitute 8.6% of our population. Minor Forest Produce is very important to tribals economy. There is lack of proper storage facility and logistics. It is, therefore, important for the Government to intervene for supporting them. The MSP for MFP Scheme provides a safety net for these tribals. Although the Scheme was launched in 2014 it had mixed result for various reasons. Some states did well but in several other States the Scheme is yet to take off. The State has to play the role of as active player and not remain a mere spectator. The Scheme needs to be taken to the next level through value addition and synergy with the programmes of other departments.

 

Minor Forest Produce (MFP) is a major source of livelihood for tribals who belong to the poorest of the poor section of society. The importance of MFPs for this section of the society can be gauged from the fact that majority of 100 million tribals depend on MFPs for food, fodder, shelter, medicines and cash income. It provides them critical subsistence during the lean seasons, particularly for primitive tribal groups such as hunter gatherers, and the landless. Tribals derive 20-40% of their annual income from MFP on which they spend major portion of their time. This activity has strong linkage to women’s financial empowerment as most of the MFPs are collected and used / sold by women. MFP sector has the potential to create about 10 million workdays jobs annually in the country.

 

Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for socio economic development of tribals like introduction of Forest Rights Act, PESA Act and has been implementing schemes for development of MFP by providing financial support to State TDCCs and TRIFED for market development of MFPs. Recognizing the critical importance which MFP hold for tribals and its potential to create large scale employment opportunity thereby, helping in reducing poverty and increasing empowerment of tribals particularly women and poor people of the poorest and backward districts of the country, Govt. of India has now decided to introduce an ambitious scheme of providing fair price for the MFP collected by tribals through Minimum Support price (MSP).

 

The scheme has been started with the objective of providing fair price to MFP gatherers, enhance their income level and ensure sustainable harvesting of MFPs. The MSP scheme seeks to establish a framework to ensure fair prices for the produce collected by them, assurance of buying at a particular price, primary processing, storage, transportation etc while ensuring sustainability of the resource base. It is a holistic scheme for development of MFP trade and covers 24 non-nationalized / non-monopolized MFPs namely,

 

Karanj Seed, Mahua Seed, Sal Leaf, Sal Seed, Lac (Rangini & Kusumi), Chironjee, Wild Honey, Myrobalan, Tamarind, Gums (Gum Karaya), Kusum Seed, Neem Seed, Puwad Seed, Baheda, Hill Broom Grass, Shikakai, Guggul (exudate), Bael (dried & without crust), Nagarmotha, Palash Kesuda (Flower), Shatavari (dried), Madhunashini, Kalmegh,  Tamarind (de-seeded).

 

The scheme is applicable for implementation in all the States across India. Any de-nationalized MFP / items removed from the purview of monopoly procurement in future will also qualify for coverage under the Scheme. Similarly, any nationalized / monopolized procurement MFP will disqualify for coverage under the Scheme. However, if any State willingly wants any nationalized items to be included in MSP, then it shall have to change its nationalized status accordingly. 

 

Government of India has extended financial support for part of working capital requirement of State Implementing Agencies and also share losses, if any, with the State Governments in the ratio of 75:25. It is expected that State level agencies which were not participating in procurement process due to fear of incurring losses will now aggressively pursue procurement and marketing of identified items under MSP as they are assured of financial support as well as substantial sharing of losses. It is expected to increase quantum of MFP procurement substantially thereby benefitting tribal people. The Scheme also envisages training of tribal MFP gatherers on sustainable harvesting and value addition activities including facilitation for marketing of the produces so that natural resources can be optimally utilized in a sustainable manner.

 

The scheme seeks to institutionalize various medium & long term aspects of sustainable collection, value addition, market infrastructure development, knowledge base expansion of MFPs, market intelligence development etc. Strengthening the bargaining power of Gram Sabhas / Panchayats and their involvement shall also be addressed and taken care of during implementation of the scheme.

 

Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India is the Nodal Ministry for implementation of the scheme which will announce Minimum Support Price (MSP) for the selected MFPs with the technical support from TRIFED.  TRIFED will act as the Central Nodal Agency for implementation and monitoring of the scheme through State level implementing agencies. State designated agencies will undertake procurement of notified MFPs directly from MFP gatherers (individual or collectives) at haats notified procurement centers at grass root level at prefixed Minimum Support Price and ensure full & timely on the spot payment to MFP gatherers.

 

Value Addition assumes critical importance in ensuring remunerative prices to the tribals in the renewed approach. Two stage value addition would be the cornerstone for enhancing livelihood income of the tribals under the scheme. The grassroot level procurement is proposed to be undertaken through SHGs associated with Implementing Agencies. Convergence and Networking with other Govt departments / scheme shall be undertaken to utilise the services of existing SHGs, Aajivika etc. These SHGs shall be appropriately empowered to undertake the procurement operations on a scientific and systematic lines. The SHG members shall undertake preliminary value addition like cleaning, grading, drying & home level primary processing under the direction and supervision of State Implementing Agency. The stock after preliminary processing shall be supplied by these SHGs to the storage of State Implementing Agencies. For higher value addition of MFPs, Big Corporates shall be involved under PPP model. This PPP model will be based on utilising Private entrepreneur skills in undertaking processing as well as marketing of the produce and Central / State Government support in terms of creating infrastructure and providing enabling environment for undertaking value addition of systematic scientific lines. These will be sophisticated large value addition hubs managed by Private entrepreneur.

 

The entire operation shall be monitored through State level committee headed by Chief Secretary and district level committees headed by District Collector for effective implementation of the provisions of the scheme. The scheme will touch the lives of tribal people involved in collection of MFPs across all the States and help optimum utilization of natural resources in a sustainable manner. This scheme will be an important milestone in economic development of tribals.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of a 50 MLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) based on Hybrid Annuity-PPP model in Ramana in Varanasi on September 22, 2017. This is the first time ever that Hybrid Annuity-PPP model is adopted in sewage sector. It is a major step forward in realising the dream of Nirmal Ganga under Namami Gange programme.

The work to construct, operate and maintain the 50 MLD STP in Varanasi has been awarded to a consortium led by Essel Infra Projects Limited at an estimated cost of Rs 153.16 crore.

The Government of India had accorded Cabinet approval to implement the Hybrid Annuity based PPP model with 100% central sector funding. Under this model, the development, operation and maintenance of the STP will be undertaken by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) at the local level. As per this model, 40% of the Capital cost would be paid during construction while the remaining 60% of the cost will be paid over the life of the project as annuities along with operation and maintenance cost (O&M) expenses for the next 15 years.

One of the most important features of this model is that both the Annuity and O&M payments are linked to the performance of the STP. This will ensure continued performance of the assets created due to better accountability, ownership and optimal performance.

The Minister informed the members that inundation forecast for Mahanadi Delta in Odisha using Digital Elevation Model of 0.5m contour interval has been attempted with limited data. He said the results are under verification by State Government and the same is likely to be made functional by 2018. Shri Gadkari said the see surge and radar data are to be integrated with the Inundation Forecast Model. Similar Digital Elevation Model for other flood prone areas in the country is planned to be generated by the year 2020, the Minister added.

                The Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that his Ministry will start work on three river interlinking projects within the next three months. These include the Ken-Betwa Linking Project, Damanganga- Pinjal Link Project and the Par-Tapi-Narmada Link projects. Shri Gadkari said that the three projects are ready with all necessary approvals, and he will hold meetings with the concerned Chief Ministers soon to sort out inter-state issues so that the three projects can take off within the next three months.

Shri Gadkari was speaking at the 31st Annual General Meeting of the National Water Development Agency Society in New Delhi today. Ministers of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal and Shri Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion. The AGM was also attended by Water Resources/ Irrigation Ministers from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Rajasthan.

Expressing his concern about the plight of people in the thirteen drought prone and seven flood prone regions of the country, Shri Gadkari stressed upon the need to develop effective means for conserving the available water and sharing what is surplus. In this context he said there is a need to evolve ways to conserve the nearly 60-70 percent of water that runs-off into the oceans.

Shri Gadkari also said that socio- economic cost of water projects should be taken into account while preparing DPR. He also underscored the need for developing innovative funding models for water projects, and accessing loans at very low rates of interest. He assured that he would also take up this issue with the Central Government.

The Minister of State Shri Satya Pal Singh said that successful models of water conservation and water management from different parts of the country should be documented and circulated by the Ministry so that regions can benefit from each others’ experience.

The State Water Resources Ministers drew attention to the specific water related issues in their respective states and how they were dealing with these issues.

  To celebrate and promote women entrepreneurs and farmers in the organic sector from across India, the Ministry of Women and Child Development will be hosting the 3rd annual ‘Women of India Organic Festival’ from October 1st to 15th, 2017, in New Delhi. Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, will inaugurate the festival in the presence of Shri Virendra Kumar, Minister of State, Ministry of Women and Child Development, on October 1 at Dilli Haat (INA).

            The cultural centre of the Capital city, Dilli Haat (INA), will showcase India's most varied offerings of organic products ranging from food, wellness, personal care, home improvement, kitchen composters and solar products. Nearly 530 participants from the remotest parts of the country will have the opportunity to take part in the exhibition, while selling their unique merchandise to the people of Delhi and surrounding areas.

            With the theme ‘Good for Women; Good for India; Good for You’, the Ministry intends to highlight the health and environmental advantages of organic goods, provide a platform for women engaged in it and boost the development of sustainable and easily accessible sales outlets for women producers from the remotest corners of India.

            During the last edition of the festival, over 500 women entrepreneurs from Leh to Kanyakumari and from Kohima to Kutch came together with their organic products such as cereals, rice, pulses, spices, cosmetics, household products, pickles, organic ice cream, oils, honey, tea, hair care, bath care, beauty care, aromatherapy products, solar products, kitchen composters, organic cotton fabric, linen, organic seeds and other bio products. Seeing the success of last year’s Festival in Delhi, the Ministry has extended the duration of the Festival from 10 days to 15 days for this year's edition.

                The Government has provided an additional Rs.12000 Crores to fight malnutrition over next three years in the country by revising cost norms for supplementary nutrition provided in anganwadis and in the scheme for adolescent girls. Briefing media persons in New Delhi today, Secretary, WCD Shri Rakesh Srivastava said that the government has effected a quantum increase of about 33% in cost norms, which have been revised for the first time since 2011 in the case of ICDS. In the case of Scheme for Adolescent Girls, cost norms have been increased first time since 2010. With this, an additional Rs.9900 Crore have been given for supplementary nutrition in anganwadis over the next three years and Rs.2276 Crores in the scheme for adolescent girls over the next three years, he explained. This reflects commitment of the government to tackle malnutrition on a war footing as reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji’s vision, Shri Srivastava said.

The cost norms have now also been linked to the Food Price Index which will enable the government to increase the cost norms annually without any hindrance.  Shri Srivastava disclosed that in the recently held national conference on malnutrition, the district collectors and district magistrates have been asked to take responsibility for eliminating malnutrition in their districts. They have been asked to review comprehensively the nutrition/helath status of children and women once in three months and also ensure 2% to 3% decline in malnutrition/stunting per year.

The WCD Secretary announced that a separate policy/protocol for Severly Acute Malnourished Children will be released at the earliest to enable States to deal with this problem effectively.

The revised Supplementary Nutrition cost norms for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and for Adolescent Girls (11-14 years out of school) under the Umbrella ICDS Scheme, as approved by the Government are as under:

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for revision of cost norms with annual cost indexation for Supplementary Nutrition (SN) for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and Adolescent Girls (out of school 11-14 years) under the Umbrella ICDS Scheme. This addresses a long standing anomaly and ensures that the changes in norms keeps pace with changes in costs on an annual basis.

 

This follows the decision by the Government to provide cash benefits to pregnant and lactating mothers under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, and is part of an intensive effort to improve the nutritional status of women and children.

 

The revised Supplementary Nutrition cost norms for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and for Adolescent Girls (11-14 years out of school) under the Umbrella ICDS Scheme, as approved by the Government are as under:

 


	
		
			
			S.No.

			Revised Rates

			Rs./day/beneficiary

			Rs.6.00
			
			
			Rs.8.00
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM)
			
			
			Rs.7.00

			 
			
			
			Rs.9.50
			
		
		
			
			3
			
			
			Severely Malnourished
			
			
			Rs.9.00

			 
			
			
			Rs.12.00
			
		
		
			
			4
			
			
			Adolescent Girls (11-14 years out of school)
			
			
			Rs.5.00
			
			
			Rs.9.50
			
		
	


 

The revision of cost norms for SN for beneficiaries of Aanganwadi Services would cost additional expenditure of Rs.9,900 crore and for beneficiaries of Adolescent Girls, it would cost Rs.2,267.18 crore as GoI share for a period from 2017-18 to 2019-20.

 

The revision in the cost norms of SN for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services and Adolescent Girls would impact the health and nutritional status of about 11 crore beneficiaries per annum.

                The first ever National Conference on ""Mission Mode to address Under-Nutrition"" was successfully held in New Delhi today. The conference was inaugurated by the Minster of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in the presence of Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Dr. Virendra Kuamr. The CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer; Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Shri Rakesh Srivastava and Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Manoj Jhalani also addressed the participants. The conference was organized by the Ministry of Women & Child Development in collaboration with Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, keeping in mind the goal of “Mission Malnutrition Free India-2022”.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that after the resounding success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji’s Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, the WCD Ministry is now targeting malnutrition. For this, there is urgent need to improve the quality of supplementary nutrition and also make the delivery system efficient, she added. Smt Maneka Gandhi said that we must provide 1000 calories to women and 600 calories to children under ICDS. The focus of the entire programme should be to administer nutrition rather than feeding beneficiaries by giving ""Nutrient Dense Food"". A change in policy is required to implement this, the Minister said. The Ministry of Women & Child Development will soon issue new guidelines on supplementary nutrition in this regard in the next few days which will supersede all existing guidelines. Similarly, a separate self contained protocol for severely and acutely malnourished (SAM) children will also be issued shortly. The Minister also highlighted the importance of child protection alongwith nutrition.

The Minister of State for Women and Child Develoment, Dr. Virendra Kumar said that today's consultation is a landmark event. The MoS said that the country has succeded in eliminating several difficult problems like chickenpox, polio etc. and it should not be difficult for the country to overcome the problem of malnutrition. The Deputy Commissioners/District Collectors along with other district level functionaries will have to take responsibility for the mission to eliminate malnutrition by 2022.

CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant said that the responsibility of tackling malnutrition lies on the shoulders of Deputy Commissioners/District Collectors who should now make a frontal attack on the problem using a convergence approach as well as with the help of IT tools for real time monitoring.

Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer said the problem of malnutrition is closely linked to the problem of drinking water and sanitation. The Swachh Bharat Mission is trying to achieve the goal of total sanitation which will also contribute to reducing problem of malnutrition.

Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava highlighted the issues related to stunting and anemia in India.

Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Manoj Jhalani gave details of the initiatives of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to promote maternal and child health care.

At today's conference, District Collectors/Deputy Commissioners/District Magistrates as well as the District-level officers of Health & Family Welfare, Nutrition (ICDS/SW), Drinking Water & Sanitation Departments in the 113 High Burden Districts along with the Principal Secretaries/Secretaries, in-charge of these three Departments of all States/UTs discussed a multitude of topics relating to stunting, under-nutrition and wasting and the key strategic interventions which are urgently required. Some of the important sessions at today’s conference included efficacy of food fortification, sustainable solution through breast feeding, dietary diversification, improving maternal & child health through Mission Indradhanush, improving program delivery effectiveness, accelerating Real Time Monitoring among others.

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi also gave away awards to three States i.e. Chattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh and Gujarat for substantial reduction in stunting during the ten year period between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4. She also released a book ""Forest Lanterns"" containing essays on solutions to improve nutrition among children in tribal areas.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development will hold the first ever National Conference in New Delhi tomorrow on Mission Mode to address Under-Nutrition in the country. In his curtain raiser briefing in New Delhi today, the Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava said that this conference is being organized by the Ministry of Women & Child Development in collaboration with Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, keeping in mind the goal of “Malnutrition Free India-2022”.

Giving details about the conference, the Secretary WCD said that the Government has decided to lay focused attention on this issue and for this said purpose, Ministry of Women and Child Development has identified 113 districts across the States/UTs based on the composite index of NITI Ayong and prevelance of stunting from NFHS-4 data. At least one district has been selected from each State/UTs so that the action taken in the selected district can be emulated in the other districts also, he explained.

Shri Srivastava said that the National Conference, first of its kind, aims at bringing convergence at District/Block levels of the three key Departments (Health & Family Welfare, ICDS/Social Welfare and Drinking Water and Sanitation) wherein a roadmap would be drawn to evolve an appropriate strategy in tackling the problem of stunting, under-nutrition and wasting comprehensively and conclusively.

The conference would be sensitizing the District Collectors/Deputy Commissioners/District Magistrates as well as the District-level officers of Health & Family Welfare, Nutrition (ICDS/SW), Drinking Water & Sanitation Departments in the 113 High Burden Districts along with the Principal Secretaries/Secretaries, in-charge of these three Departments of all States/UTs on a multitude of topics relating to stunting, under-nutrition and wasting and the key strategic interventions which are urgently required.

The District Magistrates/District Collectors/Deputy Commissioners in these 113 high burden districts, through a dashboard, will regularly monitor and review the schemes covering the aspects of nutrition across the line departments within their jurisdiction at least once in a three month period. Such a review and monitoring at district level would be done in an exclusively and dedicated manner (between 1st to 10th of January, April, July and October every year) to address implementation of schemes having a direct bearing on nutrition and Health.

Shri Rakesh Srivastava said that three States will be awarded at the conference tomorrow. These three states will be awarded for showing good progress in the area of reduction in stunting as measured between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4. These States are Chattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh and Gujarat.

Joint Secretary WCD, Dr. Rajesh Kumar said that several important steps have already been taken by the WCD Ministry recently for a multipronged strategy to manage malnutrition. This includes training ICDS functionaries, developing a curriculum for ECCE, food fortification guidelines among others. He further stated that the WCD Ministry has developed a world class software ‘ICDS-CAS’ for real time monitoring of nutrition related parameters in 8 States. This system is one of its kind in the world and 60,000 Anganwadis have already been given tablets to report growth parameters on a daily basis with the help of this system, Dr. Rajesh Kumar explained.

The problem of malnutrition is inter-generational and is dependent on multiple factors which inter-alia, include proper Infant & Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, Immunization, Institutional Delivery, Early Childhood Development, Food Fortification, Deworming, access to safe drinking water & proper sanitation (WASH), Dietary diversification, full ANC checkup, early initiation of breast feeding, ICT enabled real time monitoring and implementation of Anganwadi Services, Improving infrastructure of Anganwadi Centres along with training of Anganwadi workers and other related factors. These factors can also be Area specific or dependent on particular geographical conditions. Further, it requires a convergent approach among all the three departments i.e. Health & Family Welfare, ICDS/Social Welfare and Drinking Water and Sanitation to tackle the issue of malnutrition comprehensively and conclusively.

Some of the important sessions at tomorrow’s conference include efficacy of food fortification, sustainable solution through breast feeding, dietary diversification, improving maternal & child health through Mission Indradhanush, improving program delivery effectiveness, accelerating Real Time Monitoring among others.

                The Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi released the Guidelines of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana in New Delhi today. The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi had announced the pan-India implementation of this scheme w.e.f. 01st January, 2017. PMMVY is implemented by the Ministry of Women & Child Development in collaboration with State Governments.

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi also released an important training module for anganwadi workers called Early Childhood Care and Education Training Module. The training module is designed to provide the anganwadi workers a basic understanding of the ECCE curriculum and pedagogical approaches to ensure optimal and holistic development of young children so that they are ready to start formal schooling at the age of six years. It also includes a component on psycho social development of children below the age of three years, to help anganwadi workers counsel parents/caregivers on early stimulation.

Another important module i.e. ICDS Training module and e-training module were also released by WCD Minister today. This module aims to improve the service delivery mechanism of ICDS Programme and to accelerate better programme outcomes.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that ECCE training module is a landmark achievement since the government has for the first time ever prepared norms for anganwadi workers to impart pre-school education. Since pre-school education lays the foundation of a child for the future, it is very important to have norms under which anganwadi workers are able to plan and conduct appropriate ECE activities for 3-6 year old children. She urged the State Governments to complete the training of anganwadi workers for ECCE within a year so that the new norms can be implemented at the earliest possible. Smt Maneka Gandhi also asked the States to print advertisements about Childline (1098), POCSO e-box and healthy eating habits at the back of exercise books and text books of all school children.

The Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj said that the pan-India expansion of PMMVY will benefit women across the country.

Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastav assured that since the guidelines of PMMVY have now been issued, funds under the scheme will be transferred to the States very soon. He expressed gratitude to UNICEF and Ambedkar University for assisting in developing the booklets.

Some of the other booklets which were issued today included Activity Books for Children of 3-6 years, Child Assessment Card and Recommended List for Play and Learning Material. The Common Application Software for PMMVY and software user manual for PMMVY-CAS were also launched on the occasion. To maintain transparency and timely disbursal of benefits, the PMMVY Scheme will be run through PMMVY-CAS Software.

Secretaries of State WCD Departments attended today's function through video conferencing. Representatives of UNICEF and senior officers of the WCD Ministry wre also present on the occasion.

                A national workshop on “Sports for All” was organized here today with the participation of about 80 representatives from Indian Olympic Association, Department of Sports , Sports Authority of India, National Observers , National Sports Federations of high priority and priority disciplines, SGFI and AIUs, Sports Secretaries of the States and the Union Territories, Sports promotion Boards and Sports promotion NGOs.

As the Sports development plays a significant role towards individual development, community development, economic development and national development. One of the key objectives of the workshop was to bring about convergence among all the stakeholders and create a shared vision in order to harness the multiple benefits that sports offer.

Inaugurating the workshop, the Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore said that a massive overhaul of the entire sporting system is underway with the Khelo India initiative of the government as per the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said the Khelo India scheme is not limited to development of stadiums; it will also work for the development of athletes and the nation. Khelo India is about broad-basing sports, providing opportunities for playing, creating competition, picking up talent and also awareness of physical fitness and good health.

The minister said, there is a need to create multiple levels of competition. Unfortunately, when we ask which domestic national competitions it takes some time for people to give an answer. School Games Federation of India (SGFI) has been conducting games at school-level for ages, but nobody knows about it. He said, we are going to launch a new programme, 'Khelo India School Games' in December 2017. It will be the best tournament at school-level. It will become a platform for best talent to emerge. He said, the best talent will come to play in Khelo India School Games. Out of these, we would select 1,000 athletes and support them with resources equivalent to Rs 5 lakh per year for eight years. And every year, we will keep adding 1,000 athletes. This will help in creating amazing bench strength in this country across multiple sports.

Secondly to spot the talent, the government has recently launched the National Sports talent search portal on which anyone from anywhere in the country can send us a video of athletes for evaluation of their performance and further training by experts to make them better athletes for domestic and international competitions.

The minister said not only athletes government is also focusing on creating a bank of coaches with constant up gradation of their coaching skills on a regular basis. Col. Rathore said his ministry is creating an IT-based structure where every athlete, from the moment he makes a mark, is tracked. There will be a central database, which can be accessed by anyone who is conducting a competition. The aim is that athletes can focus on their sport without any artificially created hurdles. He said all the coaches, managers and institutions taking care of these athletes need to be reporting to the ministry with their progress on a daily basis.

The Minister said all the stakeholders in sports have to bring professionalism, responsibility and accountability for promotion of sports in the country and the government will have zero tolerance towards misgovernance in sports bodies in different disciplines. On its part the government will hire high performance managers who can deliver the desired results in a professional manner.

                Leader of the Green Revolution Dr. M.S Swaminathan and Padma Shri Dr. H Sudarshan, today, launched the National Nutrition Strategy, along with Vice Chairman Dr. Rajiv Kumar and Member Dr. Vinod Paul. 

With a benefit to cost ratio of 16:1 for 40 low and middle-income countries, there is a well recognized rationale, globally, for investing in Nutrition. The recently published NFHS-4 results reflect some progress, with a decline in the overall levels of under nutrition in both women and children. However, the pace of decline is far below what numerous countries with similar growth trajectories to India have achieved. Moreover, India pays an income penalty of 9% to 10% due to a workforce that was stunted during their childhood. 

To address this and to bring nutrition to the centre-stage ofthe National DevelopmentAgenda, NITI Aayog has drafted the National Nutrition Strategy. Formulated through an extensive consultative process, the Strategy lays down a roadmap for effective action, among both implementers and practitioners, in achieving our nutrition objectives. 

The nutrition strategy envisages a framework wherein the four proximate determinants of nutrition – uptake of health services, food, drinking water & sanitation and income & livelihoods – work togetherto accelerate decline of under nutrition in India. Currently, there is also a lack of real time measurement of these determinants, which reduces our capacity for targeted action among the most vulnerable mothers and children. 

Supply side challenges often overshadow the need to address behavioural change efforts to generate demand for nutrition services. This strategy, therefore, gives prominence to demand and community mobilisation as a key determinant to address India's nutritional needs. 

The Nutrition Strategy framework envisages a Kuposhan Mukt Bharat - linked to Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat. The aim isensure that States create customized State/ District Action Plans to address local needs and challenges. This is especially relevant in view of enhanced resources available with the States, to prioritise focussed interventions with agreater role for panchayats and urban local bodies. 

The strategy enables states to make strategic choices, through decentralized planning and local innovation, with accountability for nutrition outcomes.

On the basis of the result of the written part of the Combined Medical Services Examination, 2017 held by the U.P.S.C. on  August 13, 2017, the candidates with the under mentioned Roll Numbers have qualified for Interview/Personality Test.

The candidature of these candidates is PROVISIONAL subject to their being found eligible in all respects. The candidates would be required to produce the original certificates in support of their claims relating to age, educational qualifications, community, physical disability (where applicable) etc. at the time of the Personality Test. They are, therefore, advised to keep their certificates ready and check before hand the requirement of certificates in accordance with the important instructions available on the website of the Commission before appearing for the Personality Test. 

 

In accordance with the Rules of Examination, all these candidates are required to fill up the Detailed Application Form (DAF), which will be made available on the Commission’s Website i.e. http;//www.upsc.gov.in from 14.09.2017 to 26.09.2017 till 06:00 PM. Important instructions regarding filling up of the DAF and submitting the same ONLINE to the Commission will also be made available on the website. The candidates who have been declared successful have to first get themselves registered on the relevant page of the Commission’s website before filling up the ONLINE DAF and submit the same ONLINE alongwith uploading of the scanned copies of relevant certificates/documents in support of their eligibility, claim for reservation etc. The qualified candidates are further advised to refer to the Rules of the Combined Medical Services Examination, 2017 published in the e-gazette of India, dated 26.04.2017.

 

The instruction for filling up the DAF and Rules of the Combined Medical Services Examination, 2017, must be read carefully with regard to the certificates that will be produced at the time of Interview. The candidates will be solely responsible for not producing sufficient proof in support of his/her age, date of birth, educational qualification, caste (SC/ST/OBC) and physical disability certificate (in the case of PwD candidates). In case any of the written qualified candidate fails to bring any or all the required original documents in support of his/her candidature for the Combined Medical Services Examination, 2017, he/she will not be allowed to present himself/herself before the PT Board and no TA will be allowed.

 

 

Interview of candidates who have qualified for the Personality Test is likely to start in the last week of October, 2017. The exact date of interview will, however, be intimated to the candidates through e-Summon Letter. Interview Schedule will also be  made  available on the Commission's website. The candidates are requested to visit the Commission’s website (http://www.upsc.gov.in) for updates in this regard.

 

No request for change in the date and time of Personality Test intimated to the candidates will ordinarily be entertained under any circumstances.

 

The mark-sheet of candidates who have not qualified, will be uploaded on the Commission's website after the publication of final result (after conducting Personality Test) and will remain available on the website for a period of 60 days.

 

The candidates can access the marks-sheets after keying in their Roll Numbers and date of birth. The printed/hard copies of the marks-sheet would, however, be issued by UPSC to candidates based on specific request accompanied by a self-addressed stamped envelope. Candidates desirous of obtaining printed/hard copies of the marks sheets should make the request within thirty days of the display of the marks on the Commission's website, beyond which such requests would not be entertained.

 

Union Public Service Commission has a Facilitation Counter at its campus. Candidates may obtain any information/clarification regarding their examination/result on working days between 10.00 A.M. to 5.00 P.M in person or over telephone Nos.  (011)-23385271/23381125/23098543 from this counter.

The Informant, Western Coalfields Limited, had approached Competition Commission of India (Commission) alleging bid-rigging by SSV Coal Carriers Private Limited, M/s Bimal Kumar Khandelwal, M/s Pravin Transport, M/s Khandelwal Transport, M/s Khandelwal Earth Movers, M/s Khanduja Coal Transport Co., M/s Punya Coal Road Lines, M/s B. Himmatlal Agrawal, M/s Punjab Transport Co. and Avaneesh Logistics Private Limited, upon noticing identical price quotes given by them in four tenders floated for coal and sand transportation. It was alleged that the conduct of submitting identical bids at higher rates is a blatant act of bid rigging.

 

The case was investigated by the Director General, Competition Commission of India(CCI) who found these parties in violation of Section 3(3)(d) of the Act. The Commission after hearing the parties concluded that they were in agreement to fix prices resulting in bid-rigging in the tenders floated by the Informant. In its order, the Commission noted that such conduct in public procurement besides defeating the tendering process, has an adverse impact on the process of competition resulting in deprivation of efficient outcomes that would have followed otherwise.

 

The Commission has held the said parties to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(d) of the Act. Further, the Commission has also found eight officials of the said parties to be liable in terms of Section 48 of the Act being responsible for running the business or for being a part of the impugned conduct.

 

Resultantly, the Commission passed the following orders: 

 

·         The parties have been directed to cease and desist from indulging in anti-competitive conduct. 

 

·         A total penalty of Rs. 11,81,71,260 (Eleven Crores Eighty One Lacs Seventy One Thousand Two Hundred & Sixty) has been imposed on the ten parties, calculated at the rate of 4% of their average turnover during the last three financial years. The Commission has also imposed penalty on the eight officials of the said parties who were found to be liable in terms of Section 48 of the Act.
