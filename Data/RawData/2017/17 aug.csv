                Rt. Honourable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Prime Minister of Nepal, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 24, 2017). 

Welcoming the Nepalese Prime Minister, the President congratulated him on becoming the Prime Minister of Nepal for the 4th time. He expressed happiness that the Prime Minister of Nepal is the first foreign dignitary to stay in Rashtrapati Bhavan during his Presidency, and thanked Mr. Deuba for accepting his invitation. 

The President congratulated the Government and people of Nepal for successfully conducting two phases of local elections. He also conveyed his best wishes for the conduct of the upcoming provincial and federal elections in Nepal. 

The President of India condoled the loss of lives and destruction of property during recent floods in Nepal. He said the Government and people of India were committed to stand by Nepal. 

The President expressed satisfaction on the state of India-Nepal relations which have seen eight high level visits in the past three years. He said that India-Nepal relations derive their strength from a shared history, common culture, trade links and an open border. This is symbolised by the “national” treatment both countries give to each other’s citizens. India is looking forward to expanding its economic and development cooperation with Nepal, as per Nepal’s national priorities. 

The President expressed happiness at the large number of Nepalese students studying in India. He emphasised that the Government of India provides several scholarships to Nepalese students, and they are always welcome in India.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow-citizens on the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi.

 

In his message, the President has said, ""On the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I convey my heartiest greetings and good wishes to my fellow citizens.

 

Lord Ganesha, widely worshipped as the God of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune, is traditionally invoked at the beginning of new ventures. The great freedom fighter, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak championed the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi to garner support for our country’s freedom movement. Let us on this day recall this inclusive vision and re-dedicate ourselves to building a strong and caring India where peace and prosperity prevail.

 

May the celebrations of the birth of Lord Ganesha remove all obstacles in India’s path of progress and bless us all with joy, prosperity and peace”.

 

Hindi version of the President’s message is attached.

Former Chief Minister of Manipur, Shri Rishang Keishing was a towering leader of the North-East and the member of the first Lok Sabha. He also served as the member of Rajya Sabha from Manipur. A great leader, he actively participated in our freedom struggle. In his passing away, the nation has lost a well known public figure and a veteran Parliamentarian whose services to the State of Manipur and the nation shall always be remembered.

Please accept my heartfelt condolences and convey the same to other members of your family. May you all have the strength to bear this irreparable loss with courage and fortitude”.

                   The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind presented Colours to all five Ladakh Scouts Battalions and the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the visit to Leh, in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, was his first outside Delhi since assuming office. In his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, he dedicated the visit to the armed forces of the country.

The President said it has been 54 years since the Ladakh Scouts became part of the Indian Army. This period has been replete with tales of heroism, honour and glory. The genesis of the Regiment was in the invasion by Pakistani raiders in 1947-48 and the resolve with which Ladakhis defended their motherland. This continues to remain a matter of pride for the entire country.

 The President said that in a little over half a century, the Regiment has earned 605 Honours and Awards for conspicuous gallantry and distinguished service. This speaks for the exceptional valour and spirit of the Regiment personnel and is a model for all soldiers and officers of our armed forces. They have earned distinction in various wars and operations and excelled in sports, adventure pursuits and professional challenges.

The President said that at the Colour Presentation Ceremony, he would like to pay homage to the martyrs of the Ladakh Scouts Regiment. Their blood and sacrifice has secured our sovereignty, brought glory to our nation and protected our people from harm. He also congratulated all veterans and serving soldiers of the Regiment for their adherence to duty and professional conduct. Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were the Governor of Jammu & Kashmir Mr. N.N. Vohra, Chief Minister Ms. Mehbooba Mufti  Sayeed, Deputy C.M. Mr. Nirmal Kumar Singh, other Ministers of the Government of Jammu & Kashmir, as well as Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat.

 Later the President laid the foundation stone of the Buddha Park for World Peace at Leh’s Mahabodhi International Meditation Centre. Thereafter he flew back to Delhi.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind met the President’s Press Wing officers and staff at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 19, 2017). This is the second in a series of meetings that the President of India has called to acquaint himself with the President’s staff.  In the first batch, he had met the President’s Military Wing officers and staff at Rashtrapati Bhavan on August 5, 2017.

 

The Press Secretary to the President, Shri Ashok Malik introduced the Press Wing of Rashtrapati Bhavan to the President, comprising Deputy Press Secretary, Smt. Shamima Siddiqui, Message Section, Library, Photo Section, Multi Media Studio, Reference & Clipping Cell and the Government of India Printing Press.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said Rashtrapati Bhavan is a national institution. It belongs to all the people of our country. The Press Wing is responsible for providing information regarding Rashtrapati Bhavan to the world. Rashtrapati Bhavan should be accessible to as many people as possible. Those in Delhi can visit it by themselves, but an updated website and digital presence, in this era of digital technology and social media, can ensure that more and more people in other parts of the country can be part of the Rashtrapati Bhavan online community. He also emphasized the importance of physical health and good conduct of officers and staff of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

India condemns the attack in strongest possible terms. I offer my heartfelt condolences for the victims and wish speedy recovery for those injured. 

Terrorism poses the gravest threat to humanity today. Its perpetrators are determined to destroy peace loving communities and peoples. The global community must come together and give them a befitting response. India remains fully committed to work with Spain in defeating these evil forces. 

I once again express my solidarity with the people of Spain in this difficult hour”.

        The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind  presented the National Safety Awards (Mines) for the years 2013 and 2014 at a function held at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi today (August 17, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is endowed with an impressive mineral wealth. Today, the mineral sector contributes 2.6 per cent of our national GDP and provides direct employment to over one million people on a daily average basis, and helps the lives of their families.

The President said that in recent decades, the Indian mining industry has progressed appreciably in production and productivity through intensive mechanisation and adoption of new technology. Never before in its long history has the Indian mining industry experienced such revolutionary change, at such an accelerated pace. The balance between greater productivity and profit margins and the safety of workers is vital. Human safety and lives must always come first. They are always the priority.

The President said that he was confident that the National Safety Awards in Mines will continue to be an excellent motivator for upholding safety and welfare standards in the mines of our country. The safety practices of the award winning mines from today’s event should be case studies for students of mining engineering and management. Students should also visit such mines as part of their familiarisation programmes. Unique safety features introduced by the award winning mines should be highlighted by relevant authorities and universally adopted, as may be applicable. The President urged mining companies to design enlightened policies to give back to workers and families of workers, to the local community and to larger society.

                Dear Fellow Citizens engaged in the task of nation building



My greetings to you as we complete 70 years of our Independence

Our country will be celebrating its 71st Independence Day tomorrow. On the eve of this anniversary I extend my good wishes to all of you.

On August 15, 1947, we became a free nation. Sovereignty and the responsibility for our destiny moved from the British crown to the people of India. Some have called this process a “transfer of power”.

It was much more than that. It was the culmination of a dream for our country – a dream seen by our forefathers and freedom fighters. We were free to imagine and build our nation anew.

It is crucial to understand that this dream for a free India was rooted in our ordinary villages, in the well-being of our poor and underprivileged, and in the all-round development of our country.

For this we owe so much to the countless freedom fighters who made great sacrifices to bring us here.

Chennamma, the Rani of Kittur. Lakshmibai of Jhansi. Matangini Hazra, the heroine and martyr of the Quit India Movement. There are so many examples.

Matangini Hazra was an elderly woman, into her 70s. She was shot by the colonial police in Tamluk, in Bengal, while leading a peaceful protest march. She died with “Vande Mataram” on her lips and with the hope of a free India in her heart.

Freedom fighters like Sardar Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, Birsa Munda and thousands of others gave their lives for us. We can never forget them.

From the earliest days of our freedom struggle, we were blessed with a galaxy of revolutionary leaders who guided our country.

They spoke of not just political freedom. Mahatma Gandhi emphasised the moral character of India and of Indian society. The principles that Gandhiji spoke about are relevant even today.

Gandhiji was not alone in this nationwide struggle for freedom and reform. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose exhorted our people, saying: “Give me blood and I will give you freedom”. At his word, millions of Indians joined the freedom movement under his leadership and gave their all.

Nehruji emphasised that India’s age-old heritage and traditions – so dear to us – could co-exist with technology and a quest to modernise our society.

Sardar Patel instilled in us the importance of national unity and integrity. And of a disciplined national character.

Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar urged upon us the virtues of constitutional governance, of the rule of law – and of the vital need for education.

I have given only a few examples of illustrious leaders. I could give you many more. The generation that brought us to freedom was diverse. They were men and women who represented all parts of our country and a variety of political and social thought.

We need to draw inspiration from such brave freedom fighters, many of whom sacrificed even their lives for the country. We need to invoke the same spirit today in the task of nation building.

The stress on the moral basis of policy and action, belief in unity and discipline, faith in a synthesis of heritage and science, and promotion of the rule of law and of education – all of it was located in a partnership between citizen and government.

That is how our nation has been built – by a partnership between citizen and government, between individual and society, between a family and the wider community.

Fellow Citizens

A tradition I remember from my childhood was that when there was a wedding in any one family, the entire village shared the responsibility and contributed. Regardless of the caste or community, the bride became the daughter of not just a single family but of the entire village.

Neighbours and others living in the village looked after guests, and took charge of different arrangements. Contributions came from many families. One family would send food-grains for the wedding, another would send vegetables, a third would arrive with some other item.

There was a sense of caring and of sharing, and of interdependence. If you helped your neighbours in their times of need, they instinctively helped you in turn.

Today, in big cities we may not even know our neighbours. Whether in cities or villages, it is important to renew that sense of caring and sharing. This will make us a gentler and happier society and help us understand each other with greater empathy.

Fellow Citizens

This spirit of empathy and of social service and volunteerism is very much alive in India. There are so many people and organisations that work quietly and diligently for the poor and the disadvantaged.

They could be running schools for street children, caring for stray animals and birds, and providing water to hard-to-reach tribal communities in remote areas. Or cleaning rivers and public places. They are nation builders in action, and we need to draw inspiration from them.

We should also work with unity and purpose to ensure that the benefits of government policies reach all sections of society. For this, the partnership between citizens and government remains essential:

·         The government has started the Swachchh Bharat campaign – but it is for each of us to ensure a Swachchh Bharat

·         The government is building toilets or helping build toilets – but it is for each of us to use those toilets and make India open-defecation free

·         The government is enabling communication infrastructure – but it is for each of us to use the Internet for the right purposes: to bridge knowledge gaps, create opportunities, and enhance educational and information access

·         The government is promoting the idea of Beti Bachao–Beti Padhao – but it is for each of us to ensure that our daughters are not discriminated against and get the best education

·         The government can frame laws and strengthen law enforcement – but it is for each of us to be a law-abiding citizen. And to build a law-abiding society

·         The government is pushing transparency and eliminating corruption in public recruitment and procurement – but it is for each of us to answer to our inner conscience in everyday life

·         The government is implementing GST to eliminate multiple taxes and simplify transactions – but it is for each of us to make this an essential part of our everyday transactions and business culture

I am happy that the transition to the GST system has been smooth. It should be a matter of pride for all of us that the taxes we pay are used for nation building – to help the poor and the marginalised, to build rural and urban infrastructure, and to strengthen our border defences.

Fellow Citizens

In the year 2022, our country will complete 75 years of Independence. It is our national resolve to attain certain desired milestones for a New India by then.

When we speak of a New India, what do we mean? There are some obvious parameters – like a house for every family, power on demand, better roads and telecom, a modern railway network, rapid and sustained growth.

And yet there is more. New India must include that integral humanist component that is in our DNA, and which has defined our country and our civilisation. New India must be a society rushing towards the future, but also a compassionate society.

·         A compassionate society where the traditionally disadvantaged, whether SCs, STs or OBCs, are part of our national developmental process

·         A compassionate society where populations in our frontier areas and states, who may sometimes feel a sense of alienation, are embraced as our brothers and sisters

·         A compassionate society where the deprived child, the aged and the ailing senior citizen, and the poor and the under-privileged are always in our thought – not an afterthought. And where we take special care to ensure that our divyang brothers and sisters get equal opportunities in all walks of life

·         A compassionate and egalitarian society that does not discriminate on gender or religious background

·         A compassionate society that enriches our human capital and equips our young people by promoting accessible, affordable and world-class educational institutions. And where quality health-care and nutrition are not a challenge

It is only with all this that we will build the New India we can cherish – where every Indian is equipped to fulfil his or her potential and do so in a manner that leaves each one of us content and happy. And helps each of us contribute to society and our country.

I am confident that a strong partnership between citizens and the government will allow us to meet the goals of New India.

Your immense patience and understanding in the days following demonetisation – and your whole-hearted support in the battle against corruption and black money – reflected a responsible and enlightened society.

Demonetisation has boosted our efforts to build an honest society. We must sustain this spirit and this momentum.

Fellow Citizens

There is also need to adopt technology. We must use technology to empower our people and achieve the goal of poverty elimination in a single generation. Poverty and New India are simply not compatible.

Today, the world is looking at India with admiration. Our country is seen as a responsible global citizen, a growing economy, and a solution provider to various international challenges – such as climate change, disasters, conflicts, humanitarian crises, radicalism and terrorism.

The Tokyo Olympics of 2020 offer another opportunity for us to raise our standing in the world’s eyes. Over the coming three years, we should absorb ourselves in this national mission. Government agencies, sports bodies and business enterprises need to join hands to identify and support our talented sportspersons and provide them world-class training facilities – so that they can be even more successful in Tokyo.

As citizens and children of India – whether we live at home or abroad – we must ask ourselves how we can add to our country’s pride.

Fellow Citizens

It is natural for us to think of our families, but we must also think of society. We must heed the call for that extra degree of selflessness, that extra something beyond just duty. A mother who nurtures and brings up her child is not just doing a duty. She is displaying a unique selflessness.

·         Our soldiers who guard our borders, on a hot day in the desert or high up on a cold mountain, are not just doing their duty. They are displaying an extra degree of selflessness

·         Our police and paramilitary forces that brave death to combat terrorism or crime and keep us safe are not just doing their duty. They are displaying an extra degree of selflessness

·         Our farmers who labour under extremely tough conditions to grow food to feed fellow Indians whom they have never met, and who live in the other corner of the country, are not just doing a job. They are displaying an extra degree of selflessness

·         After natural disasters, so many motivated people, civil society groups and public agencies work day-and-night in rescue and relief operations. They display an extra degree of selflessness

Can each of us not imbibe this spirit of selflessness?

We can and we have.

On an appeal from the Prime Minister, more than one crore families voluntarily gave up their LPG fuel subsidy – so that a gas cylinder could reach the kitchen of a poorer family of fellow Indians. And so that members of that family, particularly women, were saved from smoke from chulhas that damaged their eyes and lungs.

I salute those families that gave up their subsidy. No law or government order made them do what they did. Their response came from within.

We should draw inspiration from these families. Each of us must find a way to give back to society. Each of us must choose one thing we can do to help another, less-fortunate Indian.

The single most critical factor for building our nation is to equip our coming generation. We need to ensure that not one child is left behind. As such I would urge you, as fellow nation builders, to help educate less-privileged children in our society. Help teach a child other than your own. Enrol and pay the school fees or buy the books of at least one child other than your own. Just one!

Our India is at the door of great achievements. In a few years, we will become a fully literate society. We must set the bar higher, and aim to become a fully educated society.

We are all stake-holders in this mission. If we achieve it, our country will change before our eyes. And we will become agents of this defining change.

Two thousand five hundred years ago Gautam Buddha said, “अप्पदीपोभव ... Be a lamp unto yourself …” If we follow his teachings, acting together, with the passion of our freedom movement, we can collectively be the 125 crore lamps that light up the path to a New India.

Once more, I wish all of you the very best on the eve of our 71st Independence Day.

Jai Hind

Vande Matram

“On the auspicious occasion of Janmashtami, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens.

 

The ideals of Lord Krishna’s life are of universal relevance. His message of standing up for righteousness against evil, working for universal well-being and focusing on responsibilities rather than rewards is inspiring for all.

 

Let us commit ourselves to following the path of virtue shown by Lord Krishna and strengthen our society and nation by contributing to the well-being of our people”.

This is for the first time that within just a few days of assuming office, the President of India has called a separate meeting to acquaint himself with the President’s Military staff.  Military Secretary to the President introduced the Military Wing of Rashtrapati Bhavan to the President, comprising DMSP, ADCs, Ceremonial Section, Invitation Section, Tour Section, Visitor’s Management Cell, Household Section, Sanitation Section, President’s Bodyguard and Ceremonial Guard Battalion. This is the first of such meetings scheduled to take place soon with the officers and staff of Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said the whole country looks up to Rashtrapati Bhavan with immense hope. He, therefore, urged the officers and staff to rise to these expectations by fulfilling their respective responsibilities. He said that they should focus more on duties rather than rights and develop the values of sacrifice and discipline. He said that they should all be involved in the progress of the country and work together with honesty and dedication.

                A group of 89 probationers of Indian Forest Service (2016 batch) from Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, Dehradun called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind today (August 3, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the Forest Service Officers, the President said that they have chosen a very noble profession. Forests have always been special to Indian ethos and culture. Our civilisation has derived its intellectual and spiritual strength from forests. These forests, therefore, are not merely a resource but they also cover the cultural, spiritual and intellectual heritage of the country. The onus of protecting this heritage is now on the Forest Service Officers. On them lies the responsibility of ensuring environmental security, accommodating the sustainable development needs of the country. 

The President said that in the past few decades, the world has woken up to threats to the very survival of humankind due to environmental degradation, depletion in forest cover and above all global warming leading to climate change. India has emerged as a global leader in handling complex climate change issues. Our national forest policy envisages 33 per cent of the land mass should be under forest cover. The Forest Service Officers have to find ways and means to enrich the natural forests, and facilitate bringing non-forest areas under tree cover. They have joined a public service and are the nation’s soldiers in an important area of environmental and ecological conservation. The President urged them to discharge their duties fairly, without fear, with honesty, and in such a way that their actions benefit the nation and common citizens as a whole. 

The President said that India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and we have set ourselves stiff targets. The Forest Service Officers have to strike a balance between conservation needs and development requirements. Their job is not to pose problems but to provide solutions.

                It is a great pleasure for me to be among you today. I welcome you to Rashtrapati Bhavan and congratulate you on being successful in such a tough and competitive exam. 

You have chosen a very noble profession. Forests have always been special to Indian ethos and culture. Our civilisation has derived its intellectual and spiritual strength from forests. These forests, therefore, are not merely a resource but they also cover the cultural, spiritual and intellectual heritage of the country. 

The onus of protecting this heritage is now on you. On you lies the responsibility of ensuring environmental security, accommodating the sustainable development needs of the country. 

In the past few decades, the world has woken up to threats to the very survival of humankind due to environmental degradation, depletion in forest cover and above all global warming leading to climate change. That is why the environment has become a key concern for the 21st century. And forests are an integral part of the solution. 

As you are aware, India has emerged as a global leader in handling complex climate change issues. Our national forest policy envisages 33 per cent of the land mass should be under forest cover. You have to find ways and means to enrich the natural forests, and facilitate bringing non-forest areas under tree cover. 

Forests are a potential carbon sink. They could help us reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the threat of global warming. Our country has set a target to sequester an additional 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon in our forests by 2030. 

Forests can also help fight the adverse impact of climate change. 

• Mangrove forests protect coastal areas from cyclones and tsunamis 

• Forests on the hill slopes protect the soil and prevent landslides and flash floods 

• Healthy watersheds having good forest cover insulate areas from droughts and increase agricultural productivity 

Millions of very poor people, including tribals, live in and around the forests of our country. We need to be sensitive to their basic requirements of food, fuelwood, fodder and such small needs. These are simple and hardworking people and look up to you for guidance and reassurance. Please treat them as your partners in management and not as intruders. 

Our country has adopted the joint forest management model, which is based on the “care and share” principle. It envisages a participatory approach, involving local people and communities in the management of forests. You just cannot accomplish the task entrusted to you without involving these people and communities. 

You have joined a public service and are the nation’s soldiers in an important area of environmental and ecological conservation. Discharge your duties fairly, without fear, with honesty, and in such a way that your actions benefit the nation and common citizens as a whole. 

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and we have set ourselves stiff targets. You have to strike a balance between conservation needs and development requirements. Your job is not to pose problems but to provide solutions. 

Forestry is a challenging profession. It was an exclusive domain of men till recent times but thankfully that has changed. It is heartening that more and more lady officers are opting to join the Indian Forest Service. 

I sincerely hope the lady officers will bring about a meaningful change due to their hard work and dedication. Lady forest officers will not only be able to correct the gender distortion, they will also bring a fresh outlook to the working of your department. This is a welcome development for the country. 

I wish you a long and fulfilling career. 

JAI HIND

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Sport empowers individuals, transform communities and inspire populations for positive change. He was addressing the gathering at the launch of the National Sports Talent Search Portal, an initiative of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, here today. The Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C), Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Vijay Goel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that sports play an important role in improving physical and mental health, and fostering active citizenship and social inclusion. He further said that it also inculcates leadership skills, team spirit and enables a person to develop a sense of equanimity during a win or a loss. There is evidence that sport and play enhance child development, learning and encourage better academic performance, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we need to create good infrastructure for sports in all states and nurture sporting talent from an early age. He further said that across the length and breadth of the country we need more training academies and coaching centres to turn our young men and women into sports stars and role models for succeeding generations. The platform of National Sports Talent Search Portal will be a game changer and enable the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Sports Authority of India select the best, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am happy to inaugurate National Sports Talent Search Portal, an initiative of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. This kind of initiative will not only help in identifying the best talent, but will also provide a level playing field to all the applicants and create a competitive environment.

Sport is an integral part of nation-building process, as it plays an important role in terms of individual development, community development, social inclusiveness and economic development. One of the most important factors that enable a nation to become a sporting power is the identification and development of right talent. As one-seventh of humanity, there is no dearth of talent in our country, especially with more than 450 million youth. In fact, we are overflowing with talent, but in order to harness it we have to put in place a robust system to spot and nurture talent, and develop world champions.

The platform of National Sports Talent Search Portal will be a game changer and enable the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Sports Authority of India select the best. I would like to congratulate Shri Vijay Goel for this major initiative, which will go a long way in attracting the best available sporting talent in the country. This platform will be fast, transparent and provide a mechanism for fair selection. Only meritorious and talented young sportspersons will be selected.

The portal is also available as a Mobile App, which can be downloaded on the smartphones. It gives me lot of satisfaction to know that the talent search portal and App have been developed by IRIS, a highly reputed software and data analytics company, under corporate social responsibility (CSR) support. I congratulate IRIS and the team which developed this valuable platform in close consultation with Sports Authority of India.

Sport empowers individuals, transform communities and inspire populations for positive change. It has become a tool of transformation, weaning villagers away from addiction, breaking caste barriers within the community, bringing women out of the home and empowering them, and reviving spirit and pride in individuals and the village as a whole.

The games foster friendships, unity and a healthy vibrant community. This simple but powerfully uplifting intervention renews the joy and spirit of community kinship. For women, the blossoming of their self-confidence and spirit of initiative in this space is the bedrock for societal change tomorrow.

Sport plays an important role in improving physical and mental health, and fostering active citizenship and social inclusion. It also inculcates leadership skills, team spirit and enables a person to develop a sense of equanimity during a win or a loss.

Sport is a good entry-point for the promotion of life skills-based education and healthy lifestyles, including the values of physical fitness, proper nutrition and how to make choices that positively impact health. There is evidence that sport and play enhance child development, learning and encourage better academic performance. Sport is a powerful social tool, bringing together people from different ethnic, cultural, religious, linguistic and socio-economic backgrounds.

Sports should be an integral part of our everyday life. Some people think that sports is important only for physical well-being, I feel sports is important for overall development of an individual. We are a large and diverse nation. Sports can be a great means of national integration. From sports, we learn sportsman spirit and that acts as a lubricant in our social life. More than winning, sports helps you learn to deal with defeats. Sports helps you become a fighter.

Sport increases self-esteem among adolescent girls and provides opportunities for the advancement of girls in the face of gender-related barriers. Sport can be used to promote a safe and protective environment for children and to teach young people how to solve conflict in a non-violent manner. Sport activities can be low-cost and utilize locally-available resources. Sports help children develop physical skills, get exercise, learn to play as a member of a team, learn to play fair, and improve self-esteem.

Healthy people make a healthy nation. If everybody is active and healthy, they can lead a happy life besides being more productive economically. The importance of health in our country is acknowledged over the ages through the saying ‘Aarogyame Maha Bhagyam’ which translates to ‘Health is Wealth’. That being the case, things are different today. Our country is fast emerging as the ‘diabetic capital’ of the world. It is because of modern life styles, food habits and declining physical activity. This is a serious socio-economic challenge for our country.

Our country has always been rich in culture and tradition, and games have been an important part of Indian culture from times in memorial. Gradually the time changed and so did our sports.

Traditional Games were not just games; they were designed in such a way that one can develop lot of skills like logical thinking, building strategy, concentration, basic mathematics, aiming, and lot more. During the era of the Rig - Veda, Ramayana and Mahabharata, men of a certain stature were expected to be well - versed in chariot - racing, archery, military stratagems, swimming, wrestling, horse riding and hunting. While the present-day archers are struggling to hit fixed targets, ages ago, Arjuna hit the ‘rotating Fish that is MatsyaYantra’ to defeat his fellow contenders and win over Draupadi.

We have come a long way from ancient times and have a huge population of young people whose talent needs to be harnessed. Barring cricket and hockey earlier as team sports, our success in sports events is sporadic and more on account of individual effort and excellence, rather than any State patronage and encouragement. That must change. Be it Sania Mirza, P.V.Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, P. T. Usha, Milkha Singh or Abhinav Bhindra, all of them did themselves and the nation proud through perseverance and tenacity.

As I said, we need to create good infrastructure for sports in all states and nurture sporting talent from an early age. Across the length and breadth of the country we need more training academies and coaching centres to turn our young men and women into sports stars and role models for succeeding generations. 

It is my dream, a dream I share with millions of my countrymen, to see India emerge as a major sporting nation in the world. India stands poised on the curve of a major leap in all fields and I am certain that this is true of sports as well, of a time when India will figure prominently in the list of medal-winning nations in Olympics and other sports competitions.                                    

Jai hind.”

Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, Respected Leader of the House Shri ArunJaitely, Respected Leader of the Opposition Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad, Hon'ble Deputy Chairman Sri  PJ Kurien, Hon’ble Ministers and distinguished Members of the august House!

When I first entered this august house as a Member in 1998, I never had even the faintest of the idea that one day I would have the honour of presiding over as its Chairperson. This is the beauty and majesty of our Parliamentary democracy and its strength as well. It can lift a commoner like me to such an exalted position and offer opportunities to discharge onerous responsibilities that go with this position.

I am truly humbled by the honour bestowed on me by the Honourable Members of Parliament by electing me as the Vice-President of India, by the virtue of which I have been charged with the responsibility of Chairperson of Rajya Sabha.

I am grateful to all the concerned for reposing faith and confidence in me and entrusting such responsibility to me. At the outset, I would like to assure all of you that it shall be my endeavor to live up to your expectations.

Before I elaborate on my thoughts as the Chairperson of this august House, I would like to briefly reflect on the origin and the role of this federal chamber of Parliament of India. With its roots in the Monteague-Chemlsford Report of 1918, the Council of States first came into being in 1921 further to the Government of India Act, 1919, as a second chamber of the then legislature with a restricted franchise.

Subsequently, there were extensive debates on the need for this House in the Constituent Assembly. It was considered  that a single directly elected House would be inadequate to meet the challenges before free India. Accordingly, ‘Council of States’ was created as a federal chamber i.e House elected by elected members. An element of dignity and prestige was accorded to this chamber by making the Vice-President of India the Ex-Officio Chairman of the House.

The learned members of the Constituent Assembly envisaged this chamber as a ‘House of reflective and evaluative reasoning’. Late Shri N.GopalaswamyAyyangar termed it as a ‘House which can rein in passions of the moment’. Late Shri Loknath Mishra described it as a ‘sobering House, a reviewing House, a House standing for quality and the members will exercise their right to be heard on the merit of what they say, for their sobriety and knowledge of special problems.”

This House of Elders is meant to ensure federal equilibrium and equanimity in legislation. A provision has also been made to nominate a good number of knowledgeable persons from different walks of life to further enrich the debates. This House is also expected to protect the interests of the States in the federal scheme of things.

This goes to prove that this august House has a clear mandate to perform provided the members do not desire, even if unintentionally, to reduce its role to that of a superfluous and irrelevant one, as is already being referred to in some quarters, in a muted manner. It’s a choice in the hands of the honourble members.

Honourble Members!

As the world’s largest democracy and fastest growing economy, our country needs efficient and effective legislation to administer its processes, mobilize resources, build partnerships, ensure socio-economic equality  etc.

Hon’ble Members, time is not on our side. Even after seventy years of Independence, we are grappling with basic issues of poverty, illiteracy, inequality, agrarian and rural development challenges, abuse of power etc, even as some countries similarly placed at the time of our attaining freedom, are marching ahead with a lot more focus and a sense of urgency, marshalling their energies in a much better manner.

For the success of an individual, institution or a nation, time management is crucial. We don’t have the luxury of time. We need to make up for the lost opportunities over the last seven decades, if our country were to realize its full potential, given its huge stock of human and natural resources and other advantages.

This august House meets for much less than a hundred days per year. Should the honourable members not make the best use of this available time in furtherance of the cause of our country and the people? The choice is to be made by the enlightened Members.

We take pride in our diversity and the unity that flows from it. If that be the case, can’t we be united in the pursuit of common national goals and in enabling the Young India realize its aspirations? Our democratic polity allows flourishing of different ideas and thoughts on a range of socio-economic issues. But adversarial politics should not be allowed to adversely impact the functioning of Parliament which in turn impacts the progress of our nation.

Political democracy is a sacred instrument for pursuit of national interests. But a fractious polity, finding its echo in the legislatures impedes the forward march of our country and the people. No chamber of our Parliamentary democracy can be allowed to be an extension of such fractious polity.

Every election gives the winner a mandate and the opposition, the responsibility of ensuring accountability of the executive. Parliamentary democracy is all about numbers. But it does not necessarily mean that we reduce the functioning of our legislatures to a mere numbers game. The play of numbers should stop with the formation of governments and thereafter, it should be resorted to only in the rarest of the rare cases. An emerging economy like ours should be guided more by a shared destiny in the functioning of our legislatures.

Honourable Members!

All that the people of our country desire is that the Parliament should be the voice of sanity echoing their concerns and finding solutions to their problems as the best way forward. Over the years, both the Houses of Parliament have done a reasonably good job. But somehow there is a growing concern and resentment among the people over our functioning. We need to seriously introspect over this palpable discontent with the people saying we are not doing enough still. We need to set an example for state legislatures by making suitable amendments to the way we speak and act here.

Effective functioning of the House is all about time and space management. Both the treasury and the opposition benches have defined space and time slots. We need to adjust ourselves within these set limits of time and space in the interest of better results.  All that is needed is an attitude of give and take on the part of both the sides. This is possible through strategizing for effective functioning of the House rather than for its disruption. This needs an enlightened approach on the part of all concerned.

Unfortunately, obstruction and disruption of the proceedings is increasingly being chosen as the first parliamentary option in our legislatures across the country. This has serious implications for our parliamentary democracy. This option needs to be immediately replaced by a quest for effective debates and discussion to resolve issues and finding solutions to the problems being faced by our people.

How do we do it? We don’t have to do different things to make good use of the opportunity of being members of this august House. All that we need to do is to do things differently and that is by intensely and passionately debating and discussing the issue rather than resorting to obstruction and disruption. I firmly believe in opposition having its say and the Government of the day, its way. This essentially means both the sides respecting and accommodating each other in the process.

All that I can and would like to do is to try to make you all speak and act to enable effective functioning of the House. I certainly can’t be like a headmaster herding the errant students on the path of discipline. I know for sure that it won’t work that way. It shall be my endeavor to promote an atmosphere of cordiality and trust in each other. Our nation needs a new normal in the functioning of our legislatures. It shall be my endeavor to enable this august House reach such a new normal with the cooperation of all of you.  

Nation building through all round and speedy socio-economic development is not the sole prerogative and responsibility of the Governments of the day. It is a national task requiring national effort. Opposition is an important stakeholder in this endeavor while legislatures are the effective enabling forums. The best way of enforcing accountability of the executive by the opposition is to engage the Government and corner them in an informed debate. I am of the view that executive is the gainer if Question Hour is abandoned or a discussion on a matter of immediate public concern is derailed. The executive also needs to acknowledge that it is in their interest to take opposition on board since any legislation with the constructive support of opposition enhances the public esteem and acceptability of the laws made. A new normal in the functioning of our legislatures is possible with this enlightened approach.

As a member of this august House for 19 years, and most of it as opposition member, I am aware of the sensitivities of both the sides of the House, the Rules of Business, the rights and privileges of the honourable members, the feelings and even frustrations on some occasions.

I am also conscious that eminent persons like Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Dr. Zakir Hussain, Justice Hidayatullah, Shri R. Venkataraman, Dr. Shakar Dayal Sharma, Shri K.R. Narayanan, Shri Bhairon Singh Shekawat and others had presided over the proceedings of this august House with distinction. My immediate predecessor Shri Hamid Ansari did so for ten years. It shall be my endeavor to uphold the traditions and standards set by these worthy people.

All that I would like to appeal to the honourble members on this occasion is that keep in mind the poorest and the most deprived before you say or do anything in the House. Let us be guided by the shining principles of our Constitution, the ideals of freedom struggle, the noble thoughts of great souls like Mahatma, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar and all other leaders who gave their sweat and blood for bringing our country this far. Always be reminded of the distance our nation still needs to travel before it gets due place in the comity of nations and ensure smile on the face of every citizen. Let us be guided by the right of the people for a better future.

There is a certain new sense of purpose and urgency being demonstrated by the Union and State Governments in a spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism to quicken the pace of development to offer more opportunities to the people for bettering their lives. Let us play the role of a catalyst in fulfilling this national quest.

I would like to assure all of you that it shall be my earnest endeavor to uphold the dignity of the Office of Vice-President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha and live up to the trust you have reposed in me. I am at your service and always open to your suggestions for improving the functioning of this august House as per your collective wisdom.

In the end, I would like to remind the Hon’ble Members of the Resolution adopted by this august House at the Special Session on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of our Independence in 1997. The members resolved to preserve and enhance the prestige of the Parliament by conscious and dignified conformity to the entire regime of Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the House and direction of the Presiding Officer. Let us abide by this solemn resolution.

Thank you all Honourable Members!

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that 'Why Pluralism and Secularism are essential for our Democracy' He was delivering the 25th Annual Convocation Address of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), in Bengaluru, Karnataka today. The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Vala, the Chief Justice of India, Justice Jagdish Singh Kherar, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri Siddaramaiah, the Supreme Court Judge, Justice Dipak Misra, the Minister of Higher Education, Karnataka, Shri Basavaraj Rayareddi, the Minister for Law and Justice, Karnataka, Shri T.B. Jayachandra, the former Chief Justice of India, Dr. Justice (Rtd.), Rajendra Babu, the Chairman, Bar Council of India, Shri Manan Kumar Mishra, the Vice Chancellor, NLSIU, Prof. R. Venkata Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s Convocational Address:

                                    

“It is a privilege to be invited to this most prestigious of law schools in the country, more so for someone not formally lettered in the discipline of law. I thank the Director and the faculty for this honour.

 

The nebulous universe of law and legal procedures is well known to this audience and there is precariously little that I can say of relevance to them. And, for reasons of prudence and much else, I dare not repeat here either Mr. Bumble’s remark that ‘the law is an ass’ or the suggestion of a Shakespearean character who outrageously proposed in Henry VI to ‘kill all lawyers.’ Instead, my effort today would be to explore the practical implications that some constitutional principles, legal dicta and judicial pronouncements have for the lives of citizens.

 

An interest in political philosophy has been a lifelong pursuit. I recall John Locke’s dictum that ‘wherever law ends, tyranny begins.’ Also in my mind is John Rawl’s assertion that ‘justice is the first virtue of social institutions’ and that in ‘a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled and the rights secured by justice and are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interest.’ To Rawls, the first task of political philosophy is its practical role to see, whether despite appearances on deeply disputed questions, some philosophical or moral grounds can be located to further social cooperation on a footing of mutual respect among citizens.

 

The Constitution of India and its Preamble is an embodiment of the ideals and principles that I hold dear.

 

The People of India gave themselves a Republic that is Sovereign, Socialist, Secular and Democratic and a constitutional system with its focus on Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. These have been embodied in a set of institutions and laws, conventions and practices. 

 

Our founding fathers took cognizance of an existential reality. Ours is a plural society and a culture imbued with considerable doses of syncretism. Our population of 1.3 billion comprises of over 4,635 communities, 78 percent of whom are not only linguistic and cultural but social categories. Religious minorities constitute 19.4 percent of the total. The human diversities are both hierarchical and spatial. 

 

It is this plurality that the Constitution endowed with a democratic polity and a secular state structure. Pluralism as a moral value seeks to ‘transpose social plurality to the level of politics, and to suggest arrangements which articulate plurality with a single political order in which all duly constituted groups and all individuals are actors on an equal footing, reflected in the uniformity of legal capacity. Pluralism in this modern sense presupposes citizenship.’

 

Citizenship as the basic unit is conceptualized as “national-civic rather than national-ethnic” ‘even as national identity remained a rather fragile construct, a complex and increasingly fraught ‘national-civic-plural-ethnic’ combinations.’ In the same vein, Indianness came to be defined not as a singular or exhaustive identity but as embodying the idea of layered Indianness, an accretion of identities.

 

'Modern democracy offers the prospect of the most inclusive politics of human history. By the same logic, there is a thrust for exclusion that is a byproduct of the need for cohesion in democratic societies; hence the resultant need for dealing with exclusion ‘creatively’ through sharing of identity space by ‘negotiating a commonly acceptable political identity between the different personal and group identities which want to/have to live in the polity.’ Democracy ‘has to be judged not just by the institutions that formally exist but by the extent to which different voices from diverse sections of the people can actually be heard.’ Its ‘raison d’etre is the recognition of the other.’

 

Secularism as a concept and as a political instrumentality has been debated extensively. A definitive pronouncement pertaining to it for a purpose of statecraft in India was made by the Supreme Court in the Bommai case and bears reiteration:

 

‘Secularism has both positive and negative contents. The Constitution struck a balance between temporal parts confining it to the person professing a particular religious faith or belief and allows him to practice profess and propagate his religion, subject to public order, morality and health. The positive part of secularism has been entrusted to the State to regulate by law or by an executive order. The State is prohibited to patronise any particular religion as State religion and is enjoined to observe neutrality. The State strikes a balance to ensue an atmosphere of full faith and confidence among its people to realise full growth of personality and to make him a rational being on secular lines, to improve individual excellence, regional growth, progress and national integrity… Religious tolerance and fraternity are basic features and postulates of the Constitution as a scheme for national integration and sectional or religious unity. Programmes or principles evolved by political parties based on religion amount to recognizing religion as a part of the political governance which the Constitution expressly prohibits. It violates the basic features of the Constitution. Positive secularism negates such a policy and any action in furtherance thereof would be violative of the basic features of the Constitution.’

Despite its clarity various attempts, judicial and political, have been made to dilute its import and to read new meaning into it. Credible critics have opined that the December 11, 1995 judgment of the Supreme Court Bench ‘are highly derogatory of the principle of secular democracy’ and that a larger Bench should reconsider them ‘and undo the great harm caused by them’ This remains to be done; ‘instead, a regression of consciousness (has) set in’ and ‘the slide is now sought to be accelerated and is threatening to wipe out even the gains of the national movement summed up in sarvadharma sambhav.’

It has been observed, with much justice, that ‘the relationship between identity and inequality lies at the heart of secularism and democracy in India.’ The challenge today then is to reiterate and rejuvenate secularism’s basic principles: equality, freedom of religion and tolerance, and to emphasize that equality has to be substantive, that freedom of religion be re-infused with its collectivist dimensions, and that toleration should be reflective of the realities of Indian society and lead to acceptance.

Experience of almost seven decades sheds light on the extent of our success, and of limitations, on the actualizations of these values and objectives. The optimistic narrative is of deepening; the grim narrative of decline or crisis.

 

Three questions thus come to mind:


	How has the inherent plurality of our polity reflected itself in the functioning of Indian democracy?
	How has democracy contributed to the various dimensions of Indian pluralism?
	How consistent are we in adherence to secularism?


 

Our democratic polity is pluralist because it recognizes and endorses this plurality in (a) its federal structure, (b) linguistic and religious rights to minorities, and (c) a set of individual rights. The first has sought to contain, with varying degrees of success, regional pressures, the second has ensured space for religious and linguistic minorities, and the third protects freedom of opinion and the right to dissent.

 

A question is often raised about national integration. Conceptually and practically, integration is not synonymous with assimilation or homogenization. Some years back, a political scientist had amplified the nuances: ‘In the semantics of functional politics the term national integration means, and ought to mean, cohesion and not fusion, unity and not uniformity, reconciliation and not merger, accommodation and not annihilation, synthesis and not dissolution, solidarity and not regimentation of the several discrete segments of the people constituting the larger political community… Obviously, then, Integration is not a process of conversion of diversities into a uniformity but a congruence of diversities leading to a unity in which both the varieties and similarities are maintained.’

 

How and to what extent has this worked in the case of Indian democracy with its ground reality of exclusions arising from stratification, heterogeneity and hierarchy that often ‘operate conjointly and create intersectionality’?

 

Given the pervasive inequalities and social diversities, the choice of a system committed to political inclusiveness was itself ‘a leap of faith.’ The Constitution instituted universal adult suffrage and a system of representation on the First-Past-The-Post (Westminster) model. An underlying premise was the Rule of Law that is reflective of the desire of people ‘to make power accountable, governance just, and state ethical.’ 

 

Much earlier, Gandhi ji had predicted that democracy would be safeguarded if people ‘have a keen sense of independence, self respect and their oneness and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only persons as are good and true.’ This, when read alongside Ambedkar’s apprehension that absence of equality and fraternity could bring forth ‘a life of contradictions’ if the ideal of ‘one person, one vote, one value’ was not achieved, framed the challenge posed by democracy.

 

Any assessment of the functioning of our democracy has to be both procedural and substantive. On procedural count the system has developed roots with regularity of elections, efficacy of the electoral machinery, an ever increasing percentage of voter participation in the electoral process and the formal functioning of legislatures thus elected. The record gives cause for much satisfaction.

 

The score is less emphatic on the substantive aspects. Five of these bear closer scrutiny – (a) the gap between ‘equality before the law’ and ‘equal protection of the law’, (b) representativeness of the elected representative, (c) functioning of legislatures, (d) gender and diversity imbalance and (e) secularism in practice:

 

·         Equality before the law and equal protection of the law: ‘The effort to pursue equality has been made at two levels. At one level was the constitutional effort to change the very structure of social relations: practicing caste and untouchability was made illegal, and allowing religious considerations to influence state activity was not permitted. At the second level the effort was to bring about economic equality although in this endeavour the right to property and class inequality was not seriously curbed…Thus the reference to economic equality in the Constitution, in the courts or from political platforms remained basically rhetorical.’

 


	Representativeness of the elected representative: In the 2014 general election, 61% of the elected MPs obtained less than 50% of the votes polled. This can be attributed in some measure to the First-Past-the-Post system in a fragmented polity and multiplicity of parties and contestants. The fact nevertheless remains that representation obtained on non-majority basis does impact on the overall approach in which politics of identity prevails over common interest.


 


	Functioning of legislatures, accountability and responsiveness: The primary tasks of legislators are legislation, seeking accountability of the executive, articulation of grievances and discussion of matters of public concern. The three often overlap; all require sufficient time being made available. It is the latter that is now a matter of concern. The number of sittings of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha which stood at 137 and 100 respectively in 1953 declined to 49 and 52 in 2016. The paucity of time thus created results in shrinkage of space made available to each of these with resultant impact on quality and productivity and a corresponding lessoning of executive’s accountability. According to one assessment some years back, ‘over 40 percent of the Bills were passed in Lok Sabha with less than one hour of debate. The situation is marginally better in the Rajya Sabha.’ Substantive debates on public policy issues are few and far in between. More recently, the efficacy of the Standing Committee mechanism has been dented by resort to tactics of evasion by critical witnesses. A study on ‘Indian Parliament as an Instrument of Accountability’ concluded that the institution is ‘increasingly becoming ineffective in providing surveillance of the executive branch of the government.   


 

The picture with regard to the functioning of the Sate Assemblies is generally much worse.

 

     Thus while public participation in the electoral exercise has noticeably improved, public satisfaction with the functioning of the elected bodies is breeding cynicism with the democratic process itself. It has also been argued that ‘the time has come to further commit ourselves to a deeper and more participatory and decentralized democracy - a democracy with greater congruence between people’s interests and public policy.’

 


	Gender and diversity imbalance: Women MPs constituted 12.15% of the total in 2014. This compares unfavourably globally as well as within SAARC and is reflective of pervasive neo-patriarchal attitudes.  The Women’s Reservation Bill of 2009 was passed by the Rajya Sabha, was not taken up in Lok Sabha, and lapsed when Parliament was dissolve before the 2014 general elections. It has not been resurrected. Much the same (for other reasons of perception and prejudice) holds for Minority representation. Muslims constitute 14.23 percent of the population of India. The total strength of the two Houses of Parliament is 790; the number of Muslim MPs stood at 49 in 1980, ranged between 30 and 35 in the 1999 to 2009 period, but declined to 23 in 2014.


 

An Expert Committee report to the Government some years back had urged the need for a Diversity Index to indentify ‘inequality traps’ which prevent the marginalized and work in favour of the dominant groups in society and result in unequal access to political power that in turn determines the nature and functioning of institutions and policies.

 


	Secularism in actual practice. Experience shows that secularism has become a site for political and legal contestation. The difficulty lies in delineating, for purposes of public policy and practice, the line that separates them from religion. For this religion per se, and each individual religion figuring in the discourse, has to be defined in terms of its stated tenets. The ‘way of life’ argument, used in philosophical texts and some judicial pronouncements, does not help the process of identifying common principles of equity in a multi-religious society in which religious majority is not synonymous with totality of the citizen body. Since a wall of separation is not possible under Indian conditions, the challenge is to develop and implement a formula for equidistance and minimum involvement. For this purpose, principles of faith need to be segregated from contours of culture since a conflation of the two obfuscates the boundaries of both and creates space to equivocalness. Furthermore, such an argument could be availed of by other faiths in the land since all claim a cultural sphere and a historical justification for it.


 

In life as in law, terminological inexactitude has its implications. In electoral terms, ‘majority’ is numerical majority as reflected in a particular exercise (e.g. election), does not have permanence and is generally time-specific; the same holds for ‘minority’. Both find reflection in value judgments. In socio-political terminology (e.g. demographic data) ‘majority’ and ‘minority’ are terms indicative of settled situations. These too bring forth value judgments. The question then is whether in regard to ‘citizenship’ under our Constitution with its explicit injunctions on rights and duties, any value judgments should emerge from expressions like ‘majority’ and ‘minority’ and the associated adjectives like ‘majoritarian’ and ‘majorityism’ and ‘minoritarian’ and ‘minorityism’? Record shows that these have divisive implications and detract from the Preamble’s quest for ‘Fraternity’.

Within the same ambit, but distinct from it, is the constitutional principle of equality of status and opportunity, amplified through Articles 14, 15, and 16. This equality has to be substantive rather than merely formal and has to be given shape through requisite measures of affirmative action needed in each case so that the journey on the path to development has a common starting point. This would be an effective way of giving shape to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy of Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas.      

It is here that the role of the judicial arm of the state comes into play and, as an acknowledged authority on the Constitution put it, ‘unless the Court strives in every possible way to assure that the Constitution, the law, applies fairly to all citizens, the Court cannot be said to have fulfilled its custodial responsibility.’

How then do we go about creating conditions and space for a more comprehensive realization of the twin objectives of pluralism and secularism and in weaving it into the fabric of a comprehensive actualization of the democratic objectives set forth in the Constitution?

The answer would seem to lie, firstly, in the negation of impediments to the accommodation of diversity institutionally and amongst citizens and, secondly, in the rejuvenation of the institutions and practices through which pluralism and secularism cease to be sites for politico-legal contestation in the functioning of Indian democracy. The two approaches are to be parallel, not sequential. Both necessitate avoidance of sophistry in discourse or induction of personal inclinations in State practice. A more diligent promotion of fraternity, and of our composite culture, in terms of Article 51A (e) and (f) is clearly required. It needs to be done in practice by leaders and followers.

A commonplace suggestion is advocacy of tolerance. Tolerance is a virtue. It is freedom from bigotry. It is also a pragmatic formula for the functioning of society without conflict between different religions, political ideologies, nationalities, ethnic groups, or other us-versus-them divisions.

Yet tolerance alone is not a strong enough foundation for building an inclusive and pluralistic society. It must be coupled with understanding and acceptance. We must, said Swami Vivekananda, ‘not only tolerate other religions, but positively embrace them, as truth is the basis of all religions.’

Acceptance goes a step beyond tolerance. Moving from tolerance to acceptance is a journey that starts within ourselves, within our own understanding and compassion for people who are different to us and from our recognition and acceptance of the ‘other’ that is the rairon d’etre of democracy. The challenge is to look beyond the stereotypes and preconceptions that prevent us from accepting others. This makes continuous dialogue unavoidable. It has to become an essential national virtue to promote harmony transcending sectional diversities. The urgency of giving this a practical shape at national, state and local levels through various suggestions in the public domain is highlighted by enhanced apprehensions of insecurity amongst segments of our citizen body, particularly Dalits, Muslims and Christians. 

The alternative, however unpalatable, also has to be visualized. There is evidence to suggest that we are a polity at war with itself in which the process of emotional integration has faltered and is in dire need of reinvigoration. On one plane is the question of our commitment to Rule of Law that seems to be under serious threat arising out of the noticeable decline in the efficacy of the institutions of the State, lapses into arbitrary decision-making and even ‘ochlocracy’ or mob rule, and the resultant public disillusionment; on another are questions of fragility and cohesion emanating from impulses that have shifted the political discourse from mere growth centric to vociferous demands for affirmative action and militant protest politics. ‘A culture of silence has yielded to protests’ The vocal distress in the farm sector in different States, the persistence of Naxalite insurgencies, the re-emergence of language related identity questions, seeming indifference to excesses pertaining to weaker sections of society, and the as yet unsettled claims of local nationalisms can no longer be ignored or brushed under the carpet. The political immobility in relation to Jammu and Kashmir is disconcerting. Alongside are questions about the functioning of what has been called our ‘asymmetrical federation’ and ‘the felt need for a wider, reinvigorated, perspective on the shape of the Union of India’ to overcome the crisis of ‘moral legitimacy’ in its different manifestations.

I have in the foregoing dwelt on two ‘isms’, two value systems, and the imperative need to invest them with greater commitment in word and deed so that the principles of the Constitution and the structure emanating from it are energized. Allow me now to refer to a third ‘ism’ that is foundational for the modern state, is not of recent origin, but much in vogue in an exaggerated manifestation. I refer here to Nationalism.

Scholars have dwelt on the evolution of the idea. The historical precondition of Indian identity was one element of it; so was regional and anti-colonial patriotism. By 1920s a form of pluralistic nationalism had answered the question of how to integrate within it the divergent aspirations of identities based on regional vernacular cultures and religious communities. A few years earlier, Rabindranath Tagore had expressed his views on the ‘idolatry of Nation’.

For many decades after independence a pluralist view of nationalism and Indianness reflective of the widest possible circle of inclusiveness and a ‘salad bowl’ approach, characterized our thinking. More recently an alternate viewpoint of ‘purifying exclusivism’ has tended to intrude into and take over the political and cultural landscape. One manifestation of it is ‘an increasingly fragile national ego’ that threatens to rule out any dissent however innocent. Hyper-nationalism and the closing of the mind is also ‘a manifestation of insecurity about one’s place in the world.’

While ensuring external and domestic security is an essential duty of the state, there seems to be a trend towards sanctification of military might overlooking George Washington’s caution to his countrymen over two centuries earlier about ‘overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty.’

Citizenship does imply national obligations. It necessitates adherence to and affection for the nation in all its rich diversity. This is what nationalism means, and should mean, in a global community of nations. The Israeli scholar Yael Tamir has dwelt on this at some length. Liberal nationalism, she opines, ‘requires a state of mind characterized by tolerance and respect of diversity for members of one’s own group and for others;’ hence it is ‘polycentric by definition’ and ‘celebrates the particularity of culture with the universality of human rights, the social and cultural embeddedness of individuals together with their personal autonomy.’ On the other hand, ‘the version of nationalism that places cultural commitments at its core is usually perceived as the most conservative and illiberal form of nationalism. It promotes intolerance and arrogant patriotism’.

What are, or could be, implications of the latter for pluralism and secularism? It is evident that both would be abridged since both require for their sustenance a climate of opinion and a state practice that eschews intolerance, distances itself from extremist and illiberal nationalism, subscribes in word and deed to the Constitution and its Preamble, and ensures that citizenship irrespective of caste, creed or ideological affiliation is the sole determinant of Indianness.

In our plural secular democracy, therefore, the ‘other’ is to be none other than the ‘self’. Any derogation from it would be detrimental to its core values.

Jai Hind.

                Your Excellency, Madam President and distinguished guests,

Members of the media,

I’m delighted to welcome Madame President and her delegation in India.

Excellency,

India is not new to you; you have already visited the country several times in the past. However, your India visit as a President is taking place at a time when we are celebrating the festival of completion of 70 years of India’s independence. This is also the time of completion of seven decades of Indo-Swiss Treaty of Friendship & Establishment. We hope that during this visit you would feel the same warmth and hospitality that we have felt during our visit to Switzerland in 2016.

I am delighted to see that both sides are keen to maintain deep relations at all levels.

Friends,

Today, we had a comprehensive and meaningful discussion on bilateral, regional and global issues. Our strong bilateral relations have progressed further through this visit.

The issues like disarmament and geographical expansion are extremely important for both Switzerland and India. In this context, we are extremely grateful to Switzerland for supporting India’s entry into the MTCR.

We also discussed Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement between Indian and European Free Trade Association. The discussion on the provisions of this agreement has already started. It’s a very welcome step. Both the sides have expressed their commitment to complete this agreement. Today, the issue of transparency in financial transactions is a cause of serious concern for the world. Be it black money or dirty money, or be it money laundering or be it the funds linked to arms and drugs. Our cooperation with Switzerland is ongoing to deal with this global curse.

Last year, we had signed a joint statement for automatic exchange of tax related information. Under this agreement, the information will be automatically shared with us upon completion of the internal processes of Switzerland. Foreign Direct Investment is a crucial basis for our economic relations and India particularly welcomes the Swiss investors. In this context, we have agreed to continue to discuss about the requirement of a new bilateral investment treaty. There are several opportunities for the Swiss companies to become a partner in India’s growth and development.

Today, during our discussion with the business leaders of both the countries, we felt that they have a strong desire to constantly increase the business to business collaboration for mutual benefit.

India’s traditional medicines, particularly Ayurveda, can play an important role in sustaining the health and wellness. I’m happy that Switzerland has recognized Ayurveda and it is keen to have more cooperation in this important sector.

In order to avail benefits from Switzerland in the fields of vocational education and skill, both countries took a joint initiative in the form of SkillSonics; more than five thousand Indians have taken advantage of this initiative. We are willing to extend our cooperation to expand this model.

Friends,  

Climate Change is a big challenge faced by every country. We have agreed on the need to implement the Paris agreement on the basis of principal of common but differentiated responsibilities and also to work collectively for developing the ways to implement it. India will be helped in meeting its growing requirement of clean energy by becoming a member of the nuclear supplier group. In this context, we thank you for the constant support of Switzerland to us in getting the membership of NSG.

Initiatives like International Solar Alliance and our efforts to achieve the target of generating 175 Giga Watt of renewable energy by 2022 reflect India’s commitment to clean energy and green future.

Excellency,

I’m confident that this visit of yours will be helpful in taking our relations to a new height. I thank Madame President for an extremely meaningful discussion and I’m keen to jointly work with you in the coming months.

Once again I heartily welcome you and wish you to have a meaningful visit to India.   

Thank you very much!

                I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you who have turned up here in such a large number to bless all of us. Some parts of our country faced great difficulties some time ago due to floods. Several lives were lost and farmers suffered huge losses. Rajasthan also faced this difficulty at several places. The state government has made a submission to the centre and a high level committee of the central government has already visited Rajasthan. I’d like to assure the flood affected brothers, sisters and farmers of Rajasthan that the Government of India is completely with you in this difficult time and also we will collectively make every effort so that we can progress after getting out of this difficulty.

Today, it’s an historic, a wonderful occasion for Rajasthan that in just one program the projects worth Rs 15 thousand crore are either dedicated to the public or their foundation stones are being laid. Making announcements for the schemes; making all kind of promises during the elections; getting the stories of these events published as big headlines in the news papers; and this attitude: you are good, I’m good; this attitude of praising and garlanding each other; this country is used to seeing all these tantrums and it’s been going on for several years and this is the biggest challenge before us. Such a mess is left for us that you can’t imagine what it takes to eradicate all these evils.

All the systems were left in such a broken shape, so many evils have penetrated them that if it was a faint hearted person then he would have lost his nerve but we are made of a different kind of material, we have a habit of picking up the challenges and we have a habit of challenging the challenges and we are capable of completely dedicating ourselves to take the country to its destination by accepting those challenges.

As Nitin Ji was just talking about that bridge on Chambal. The bridge with a budget of less than Rs. 300 crores, and the time of 11 years between 2006 and 2017; this is what distinguishes a government from the other one? That small incident is good enough to understand which government can be called the government who does work? A small bridge costing Rs. 300 crore, it can be constructed in a year or a year and a half, if it was to be constructed in a routine manner then it will take a year or a year and a half. Today, after more than 11 years the project is still ongoing and compare that with the projects worth 5,600 crore rupees. If the friends from media calculate this thing: a project of Rs. 300 crores and the executions of projects worth Rs. 5,600 crore. In 2014, when our government came to power in Delhi these projects were conceived, the projects were started and today within three years the public dedication of these projects worth Rs. 5600 crore is taking place.

We have decided to follow that work culture to finish the projects that have been started during our time. And even if a project has been delayed even then the advantage from it can be taken in one or two elections, a foundation stone is laid, people may get garlanded, their photos can be printed in news papers then it can help in one or two elections. But the project cost goes up by thousands of crores of rupees if the project gets stuck, the project cost swells by thousands of crores of rupees and then there are loss to the objective of the work due to that incomplete project. The entire economy of the country is being consumed by these incomplete schemes. I have to put in so much effort to restart these schemes that have been stuck in this great abyss. As you have seen that the work on this bridge was stuck, it was stuck in court cases. If the decisions are taken with courage, taken with honesty then they produce results. And today, that result is before you, in the coming days the new projects worth more than Rs. 9,000 crore will be executed in Rajasthan alone. And these are mainly related to road sector, some of them for widening of the roads, some for constructing culverts, some of them about constructing new roads and some about modernizing the existing roads. Starting the projects worth more than 9,000 crore rupees in one go; had we started the projects worth Rs. 500 crore today, then projects worth Rs. 500 core after five days and yet another projects worth Rs. 500 crore after a month then we could keep utilizing these occasions for political mileage till the next election in Rajasthan. However, we cannot accept that model. We want to do work, we want to do them within a stipulated time and that is why the foundation stone for projects worth more than Rs. 9000 crore is being laid collectively by making a scheme. And when we talk about projects with such a great responsibility then we talk about them with a commitment to finish them.

And I’d like to assure Rajasthan that we will do it in any case and in any case Rajasthan will be transformed.  Infrastructure plays very important role in the development of the country, these are time consuming and costly projects. If we look at them through the prism of politics, people lose patience that is why during the earlier times, the governments, the politicians used to run away from long term projects, long term big projects.

We are fully aware that if we want to scale new heights for our country then we will have to modernize our systems. Be it railways, be it roads or water supply systems or electricity supply or optical fiber network or waterways or coastal connectivity or any other kind of modern infrastructure, now any delay in these things will not be good for the country.

And once these modern facilities are developed it’s not like that you just see a black long line on the land. That long black belt, that road, the black colored road fills your life with the light. Just imagine that how much farmers will benefit from the roads that will be built with the cost of 9000 crore rupees. They can supply their agriculture produce, their fruits, vegetables and flowers with ease. When Atal Bihari Bajpai constructed the Golden Quadrilateral, then initially people said, wow, such a good road is being built, earlier such roads were not there. People were glad, the vehicles used to run fast. People could not talk there.

I still remember that those areas of Gujarat that are adjacent to this part of Rajasthan, be it Sabarkantha, be it the farmers of Ahmedabad district if they wanted to supply their fruits, vegetables, milk or flowers, due to good road connectivity there produce was supplied to Delhi market in a day. And there is a sea change in the income of the farmers of those districts.

Once good roads are constructed then our farmer who faces difficulties in supplying its produce to the city, if there is a delay of one-two days in supplying milk, fruits, vegetables and flowers then 20-30% produce is wasted, consumers don’t buy them.

When a network of good road is created then the economy of the country also picks the pace. Farmers located in far-flung areas get the opportunity to supply its produce to the markets of his choice when there are roads, there is infrastructure. If there is a poor pregnant lady in the village is expecting, if the clinic is at a distance, if she needs to go 25-30 kilometers and if there are good roads then the lives of both mother and child will be saved. But if there are no road then that mother loses her life, this is the importance of road. In Rajasthan, the state’s roads are capable of minting cash. In comparison with other states, perhaps, Rajasthan will get five times more benefit due to good roads as there are long distances in Rajasthan, Rajasthan has a very vast area and tourism is Rajasthan’s strength, tourists all over the world are familiar with Rajasthan. If a tourist wants to visit Pushkar fair, if they want to spend some time in the lake city Udaipur, if the tourists from all over the world want to experience a new life in the deserts of Jaisalmer, somebody wants to visit Shrinath, someone wants to visit Eklinga, there are numerous places in Rajasthan, every corner of the state has inherent power to attract tourists. This such a strong magnetic power that is capable of attracting the people from the world over not just from the people of the every corner of India. And when a tourist visits, he visits to spend his money, to give income to people of this place. And tourism is such a sector in which maximum employment can be generated by spending the least amount of money. Everybody earns, flower seller will earn, Prasad seller will earn, people selling the items required in the worship will earn, auto rickshaw driver, taxi driver, guest house owner, handicraft artisans will earn and even a tea seller will earn. This strength is in that state but if there is problem of traffic jam, roads are with potholes, if there are no proper signage, there is no arrangement for parking, no arrangement for petrol pumps at the right places then tourist may come once but he will keep thinking about going back. These projects of 15,000 crore rupees are not only just creating the roads on the ground but they opening the road of fortune for Rajasthan and I can clearly see this and that is why there is an emphasis on infrastructure projects and government of India is fully committed on spending for this purpose. Because, we want to give India’s infrastructure a modern shape. Optical Fibre Network, how to provide quality education to the children of remote villages, how to provide the same quality education to my tribal brothers of far-flung Banswada that is being imparted in the best schools of Udaipur, in the best schools of Ajmer? This massive project of providing education through digital network, through optical fiber network, through long distance education, through technology to provide new knowledge to new generation, and for that purpose optical fiber network of lakhs of kilometers is being laid. And this optical fiber network requires expenditure of billions and billions of rupees and it is not visible to anyone if it passes through a place. But, what’s in it for me? What is being done for us? These things don’t come to the notice of anyone. However, once it is installed then be it the education to the children, it will provide the facility of good treatment to the patients through telemedicine, it will pave the way for his treatment, the rural people will get the facilities like the cities. Can you imagine what a sea change it will bring in the life of India’s villages?  We have been taking the work forward by emphasizing on that infrastructure.

Just now, the chief minister was talking about the Ujjwala scheme that millions of poor mothers and sisters have got the gas stove. When a poor mother cooks food on a wood based stove then she inhales the smoke equal to smoking 400 cigarettes, who will care about those mothers, those kids who are in the playing age? And there was a time when great effort was required to get a gas connection. How difficult it was, recommendations of several politicians were required. This is a government that has been running the scheme to provide gas connections to the poor at their doorsteps and it has provided gas connections to millions of people.

Today, roads and railroads are constructed at twice the pace of earlier time, we have also increased the speed, scale and scope of the projects be it water supply project or optical fiber project, and we have also succeeded in making these things modern by improving the skills.

GST has just been launched, initially people thought, it was an unique thing for the world that such a massive country of 1.25 billion people and it can change one of its system overnight and the 1.25 billion citizen of this country adjust themselves with the new system. This reflects the strength of India. Friends, everybody will be proud of the fact that the small traders of our country who are located in villages now have a desire to become modern by using technology and I’d like, I’d especially urge the officers of Rajasthan to run a campaign for 15 days to connect every small trader of the villages if he has a turnover of less than 20 lakh rupees and even if he has a turnover of less than 10 lakh rupees, please connect those traders with GST so that even that poor trader can get the benefits of the GST, he must get the benefits of the GST. If he is not connected then the chain will break, it will stop somewhere and the benefits will not percolate down to the last person, this thing should be taken up like a campaign.

And you see, you would not have imagined that it will result in such a big increase in the revenues of Rajasthan and as a result of it the government can take up several new schemes for the welfare of the poor people of Rajasthan.

 

Due to GST alone in the transportation sector, a department that is also being looked after by our Nitin Ji, if earlier a driver used to set out on a journey from his place to supply goods at a coastal port, and if we calculate the kilometers and speed of the truck, then it can reach there in three days. However, earlier there were road check posts everywhere, all kind of check posts, and everyone knows what happens, how things are done at road check posts, that poor fellow used to reach at his destination in five days. If a truck is lying unused for just two days in a week then it causes more than 25% loss to the transportation sector of the country’s economy. After the implementation of GST all these road posts have been abolished, and the truck driver that used to be stuck, all these requirements of red pass and blue pass, this all has gone. Earlier he used to reach in five days and now he reaches in three days. And it has brought down the cost of transportation and the income of transporters has gone up. And I am asking Nitin Ji that rules of our transport sector should be updated on daily basis. Today, what’s the system in our country, if we carry goods in a truck then all the goods are stored with the truck itself. Today’s changed times demand separation of truck and trolley as is the case with tractor that the trolley can be separated. The goods should be stored in the trolley, the trolley can be left in Jaipur and truck can go ahead, it can attach another trolley and go to a new destination. A system should be created so that the drivers can reach their homes in the night and can spend time with family and kids. We are working to transform our transport sector to create such a system. And if the country is to be transformed then it can be done at a very fast pace through the transport sector and we are moving in the direction to scale new heights of development through a comprehensive scheme.

I once again express my heartfelt gratitude for the love shown by you people, for your blessings and for the welcome and respect given by you people.

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated, and laid the foundation stone, of several major highway projects at Udaipur in Rajasthan.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said he is delighted to be in the ""Veer Bhumi"" of Mewar.

The Prime Minister assured people affected by natural calamities, that the Union Government stood by them at this hour of difficulty, and expressed confidence that the people would overcome the challenges, and march forward with even greater vigour.

The Prime Minister said that projects worth over 15000 crore are either being Inaugurated, or initiated (foundation stone being laid) today, in a single function.

The Prime Minister said that infrastructure projects are crucial to the progress of the country. He said India can no longer afford delay in infrastructure projects, especially connectivity projects. He said projects such as roads, infuse new energy in the lives of the people.

The Prime Minister recalled the Golden Quadrilateral initiated by former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and said it benefited farmers by connecting them to markets. He said Rajasthan could benefit a lot from tourism, through better infrastructure connectivity, which would bring in employment.

The Prime Minister spoke about the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, under which LPG connections are being given to rural households, which will especially benefit women.

The Prime Minister said GST had hugely benefited the nation's economy, by eliminating long waiting times at inter-state borders.

The Prime Minister later visited the Pratap Gaurav Kendra, which celebrates the life, valour and achievements of Maharana Pratap, the great King of the erstwhile kingdom of Mewar.

आप सब इतनी विशाल संख्या मैं हम सबको आशीर्वाद देने के लिए आये मै इसके लिए आप सबका ह्रदय से बहुत-बहुत आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ। पिछले दिनों बाढ़ के कारण देश के कुछ भागो  में काफी मुसीबत आई।कई लोगों को अपनी जान गवाँनी पड़ी। किसानो को भी काफी नुकसान हुआ।राजस्‍थान में भी कई स्थानो पर ये संकट आया। राज्य सरकार ने अपना एक प्रतिवेदन भारत सरकार को भेजा है।भारत सरकार की तरफ से भी एक उच्च स्तरीय समिति राजस्थान का दौरा कर चुकी है। मैं  राजस्‍थान के बाढ़ पीडि़त भाइयों-बहनों को, किसानो को विश्वास दिलाता हूँ कि संकट की घड़ी में भारत सरकार पूरी तरह आपके साथ खड़ी रहेगी और इस संकट से बाहर निकल कर एक नए विश्वास के साथ हम सब आगे बढ़े, इसके लिए  मिल जुल करके भरपूर प्रयास भी करेंगे। आज एक ही कार्यकर्म में पंद्रह हज़ार करोड़ रुपयों से ज्यादा लागत वालेविकास के कामों का शिलान्यास होना या लोकार्पण होना, ये अपने आप में राजस्थान के लिए एक ऐतिहासिक अद्भुत घटना है- योजनाओं की घोषणाएं करना। चुनाव के समय भांति भांति के वादे करना,अख़बारों में बहुतबड़ी बड़ी हेडलाइन छप जाना। आप भी भले हम भी भले। माला दो तुमको ड़ालु, माला दो तुमको ड़ालु।  ये सारे खेल देश भलीभांति देखता आया है सालो से यही चला आया है हमारे सामने सबसे बड़ी चुनौती यही है इन पुरानी बुराइयों को ख़तम करने में इतनी ताकत लगती है जिसकी आप कल्पना   नहीं कर सकते ऐसे हालात छोड़ कर गए है।  सारी व्यवस्था ऐसे चरमरा गई है बुराईयां इतनी प्रवेश कर चुकी है अगर कोई ढीला ढाला इंसान होता तो शायद उसको देखते ही डर जाता लेकिन हम जरा अलग मिट्टी के बने हुए है चुनोतियो को चुनने की भी आदत है और चुनोतियो को चुनौती देने की भी आदत है और चुनोतियो को स्‍वीकार करते हुए रास्ते खोजते हुए मंजिल की ओर देश को ले जाने के लिए जी जान से जुटने का  माजा भी रखते है अभी नितिन जी वर्णन कर रहे थे चंबल के उस ब्रिज का 2006 से  2017 तक11 साल और बजट कितना 300 करोड़ से भी कम।सरकार में फर्क क्या होता है? काम करने वाली सरकार किसको कहते है?यहसमझने के लिए ये घटना काफी है। एक छोटा सा ब्रिज, 300 करोड़ रूपएकी लगत का, ब्रिज साल- डेढ़ साल में बन जाये,सामान्य पद्धति से बनाये तो साल डेढ़ साल में बन जाये।11 साल बीत गए और आज  पांच हजारछह सौ करोड़ के वो प्रोजेक्ट।जरा पत्रकार मित्र हिसाब देखेंतोदिमाग में 300 करोड़ का प्रोजेक्ट 11 साल पांच हज़ार छह सौ करोड़ के काम।2014 मेंदिल्ली में हमारी सरकार बनने के बाद विचार आया,योजना शुरू हुई, कार्यकर्म बना और आज तीन साल के भीतर-भीतर पांच हजारछह सौ करोड़ के कामों का लोकार्पण हो रहा है। हमने उस संस्कृति को लेनेका प्रयास किया है जिस काम का हम आरम्भ करेंगे उसे पूरा करने का प्रयास भी हम ही करेंगे और जब कोई योजना विलम्बित हो जाती है एकाध चुनाव में  राजनीतिक लाभ तो शायद  मिल जाता होगा। पत्थर गाड़ दिया फूल माला पहन ली फोटो निकलवा दी अखबार में छपवा दी एकाध बार चुनाव तो निकल जाएगा। लेकिन बाद में अगर वो योजना अटकी पड़ी है,हज़ारो करोड़ रुपयों की लागत बढ़ती जाती है। काम न होने के कारण जो नुकसान हुआ है, वो अलग। काम अटकने के कारण जो नुकसान हुआ है वोअलग। और देश का पूरा अर्थतंत्र एक गढ्ढे में पड़ी हुई ये योजनाए खा जाती हैं। ऐसेगढ्ढे में पड़ी इतनी योजनाओं को मुझे बाहर निकालने में इतनी ताकत लग रही है जैसे किये ब्रिज आपने देखा बंद पड़ा था काम। कोर्ट कचहरी में उलझ रहा था। हिम्मत के साथ, ईमानदारी के साथ फैसले लेते हैं, निर्णय करते हैंतो परिणाम भी मिलता है। और आज वो परिणाम आपके सामने है,आने वाले दिनों में नौ हजार करोड़ से भी ज्यादा केनए काम अकेले राजस्थान में होंगे। इनमें प्रमुखतया रोड सेक्टर के काम हैं, कहीं रोड की चौड़ाई, कहीं नई पुलिया, कहीं नया रोड, कही रोड का आधुनिकीकरण। एक साथ नौ हजार करोड़ से ज्यादा रुपयों के काम को शुरू करना।अगर यही काम 500 करोड़ के आज करते,500 करोड़ के पांच दिन बाद करते, फिर 500करोड़ के एक महीने बाद करते, तो राजस्थान के अगले चुनाव तक हम राजनीति की रोटियां सेकते रहते।लेकिन वो रास्ता हमें मंजूर नहीं है। हमें काम करना है, समय सीमा में काम करना है और इसलिए एक साथ योजना बना करके, नौ हज़ार करोड़ रूपयोंसे ज्‍यादालागत से नए कामों का आज शिलान्यास हो रहा है। और जब इतनी बड़ी जिम्‍मेदारी के साथ कार्यक्रमों की बात करते हैं, तो पूरा करने के संकल्‍पके साथ करते हैं। और मैंराजस्थान की धरती को विश्वास दिलाता हूँ कि ये करके रहेंगे और राजस्थान की काया पलट हो कर रहेगी। देश के विकास में इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर का बहुत महत्व होता है। ये ज्यादा लागत वाले होते हैं, समय लम्बा लेने वाले काम होते है।राजनीतिक दृष्टि से लोगों का धैर्य खो भी जाता है और इसलिए सरकारें, राजनेता लम्बे समय की योजनाएं,लम्बे समय के बड़े काम, इनसे भागते रहते थे, पुराने ज़माने में। यह हम भली-भांति जानते है किदेश को अगर नई ऊँचाइयों पर ले जाना है, तो हमें हमारी वयवस्थाओं को भी आधुनिक बनाना पड़ेगा। रेल हो, रोड हो, पानी की व्यवस्था हो, बिजली की व्यवस्था हो, ऑप्टिकल फाइबर नेटवर्क हो, वाटर वेज़ हो, कोस्टल कनेक्टिविटी का रास्ता हो, हर प्रकार से आधुनिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर के लिए अब विलम्ब करना भारत के लिए फायदेमंद नहीं होगा। और एक बार इस प्रकार की आधुनिक व्यवस्थाये विकसित होती हैं, तो सिर्फ जमीन पर एक बड़ी काली लम्बी लकीर दिखती है ऐसा नहीं है। वो लम्बी काली पट्टी जो रोड है, वो काले रंग वाला रोड आपके जीवन में रोशनी भरने का काम कर देता है। आप विचार कीजिए कि नौ हजार करोड़ रूपयों के लागत से बनने वाले रोड से किसान को कितना फायदा होगा। वे अपनी फसल, अपने फल फूल, सब्‍जी आसानी से ले जा सकेंगे-जब अटल बिहारी वाजपेइ जी ने गोल्‍डेन चतुस्‍क बनाया तो शुरू में लोगों को लगता था,वाह! क्‍या बढिया रोड बन गया!  पहले ऐसा रोड नहीं था।आनंद आता था, गाड़ी तेज चलती थी। बात वहॉं नहीं हो सकती थी।मुझे बराबर याद है राजस्‍थान के इसी इलाके से सटा हुआ गुजरात का हिस्‍सा चाहे साबरकाठा हो, चाहे अहमदाबाद जिले के कुछ किसान वहॉं हो फल, फूल, सब्‍जी और दूध ये अच्‍छा रोड बनने के कारण,एक दिन में दिल्‍ली के बाजार में जा करके बिकते थे।और वहॉं गाँव के किसान की आय में आमूल-चूल परिवर्तन आया है। एक बार अच्‍छे रोड बन जाते हैं तो मेरा किसान जिसको अपनी फसल शहर तक ले जाने में दिक्‍कत होती है फल-फूल, सब्‍जी दूधदो- दो दिन अगर विलंब हो जाता है तो इनका20 से 30 प्रतिशत तबाह हो जाता है। खरीददार लेने को तैयार नहीं होता है।जब अच्‍छे रोड का Network बनता है तो देश की Economy में भी गति आती है।दूर-सुदूर गॉंव में बैठे किसानों को अपने पसंदीदा बाज़ार में पहुँचन के लिए एक अवसर मिलता है जब रोड़ बन जाते हैं Infrastructure बन जाता है। गॉंव की गरीब मॉं प्रसूता से पीडि़त है, दवाखाना दूर है, 25-30 किलोमीटर दूर जाना है, अगर अच्‍छे रोड हैं तो मॉं और बच्‍चे की जिंदगी बच जाती है। लेकिन अगर रोड ठीक  नहीं है तो उस मॉं  को जिंदगी से हाथ धो देना पड़ता है- रोड से ये काम होता है। राजस्‍थान में तो राजस्‍थान  का रोड तो पैसे उगलने की ताकत रखता है-पैसे उगलने की। शायद हिंदुस्‍तान के और  भागों को रोड से जितना फायदा मिलता है उससे पॉंच गुना लाभ राजस्‍थान  को मिलता है क्‍योंकि राजस्‍थान में दूरियॉं बहुत हैं। भू-भाग बहुत बड़ा है और राजस्‍थानके जीवन में Tourism की बहुत बड़ी ताकत है विश्‍व भर का Tourist राजस्‍थान से परिचित है।दुनिया भरके Tourist को पुष्‍कर के मेले में आने का मन करता है, दुनिया के Tourist को झील की नगरी उदयपुर में आकर समय बिताने का मन करता है। दुनिया भर के Tourist को जैसलमेर के पास मरूभूमि में जाकरके एक नई जिंदगी काएहसास करने का मन करता है।किसी को श्रीनाथ जाना है, किसी को एकलिंग जाना, अनगिनत जगहें हैं राजस्‍थान  के हर कोने में Tourism को आकर्षित करने की- Inherent ताकत पड़ी है। एक ऐसी Magnetic Power है जो कि न सिर्फहिन्‍दुस्‍तान के कोने-कोने मेंदुनिया भर से यात्रियों को खींचने की ताकत रखती है। और जब Touristआता  है न, वो  जेव खाली करने के लिए आता है और यहॉं के लोगों का जेब भरने के लिए आता है। और Tourism एक ऐसा क्षेत्र है जिसमें कम  से  कम पूंजी निवेश से ज्‍यादा ज्‍यादा से लोगों को रोजगार मिलता है।हर कोई कमाता है। फूल बेचने वाला कमाएगा, प्रसाद बेचने वाला कमाएगा, पूजा का सामान बेचने वाला कमाएगा,Auto Rikshaw वाला कमाएगा,Taxi वाला कमाएगा, गेस्‍ट हाउस वाला कमाएगा, Handicraft बेचने वाला कमाएगा, चाय बेचने वाला भी कमाएगा। ये ताकत जिस  राज्‍य  में है, लेकिन अगर ट्राफिक जाम रहता है, रास्‍ते  टूटे फूटे हैं, गढ्ढे से भरे हुए हैं कोई  Proper signage नहीं है,कोई Parking की व्‍यवस्‍था नहीं है, सही से स्‍थान-स्‍थान पर पेट्रोल पंप की सुविधा नहीं है तो Tourist एकाध बार तो आएगा लेकिन जल्‍दीजल्‍दी  वापस जाने के लिए सोचता रहेगा। ये 15000 करोड़ रूपए के प्रोजेक्‍ट  सिर्फ जमीन पर रास्‍ते नहीं बना रहे हैं। वो राजस्‍थान के भाग्‍य के रास्‍ते खोल रहे हैं। ये मैं साफ देख रहा हॅूं और इसलिए ये जो Infrastructure Project पर बल दिया जा रहा है, भारत सरकार इसके पीछे पूरी तरह खर्च करने पर लगी हुई है। इसलिए कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में Infrastructure को एक आधुनिक स्‍थान पर ले जाना है। Optical Fibre Network-दूर-सुदूर गॉंव के बच्‍चों को Quality Education कैसे मिले, दूर-सुदूर गरीब के बच्‍चे को भी जैसी शिक्षा उदयपुर के अच्छे से अच्छे स्‍कूल में मिलती हो, अजमेर के अच्छे से अच्‍छे स्‍कूल में मिलती हो वैसी ही शिक्षा दूर-सुदूर बॉंसवाड़ा के जंगल में रहने वाले मेरे आदिवासी भाई को कैसे मिले। ये Digital Network के द्वारा,Optical Fibre Network के द्वारा,Long distance Education के द्वारा, नई पीढ़ी को नई शिक्षा के द्वारा, नई Technology के माध्‍यम से शिक्षा के द्वारा शिक्षा देने का एक बड़ा अभियान।और उसी के तहत लाखों किलोमीटर Optical Fibre Network लगाया जा रहा है। अब ये Optical Fibre Network लगता है तो करोड़ों रूपए की लागत लगती है, अरबो, खरबों की लागत लगती है।लेकिन वहॉं जहॉं से गुजरती है, किसी को दिखता नहीं है। लेकिन इसमें मेरा क्‍या ?हमारे लिए क्‍या हो रहा है, ध्‍यान में ही नहीं आता है। लेकिन जब वह लग जाएगी, बच्‍चों की पढ़ाई का काम होता होगा, बीमार मरीजों को टेलिमेडिसिन से दवाइयों की अच्‍छी सुविधा प्राप्‍त हो जाएगी, उसके उपचार के रास्‍ते तय हो जाएंगे,गॉव के लोगों को भी शहर की सुविधाएं उपलब्‍ध हो जाएगीं। आप कल्‍पना कर  सकते हैं कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के गॉंव में कितना बड़ा परिवर्तन आएगा? हम उस Infrastructure को बल देते हुए काम को आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं।

     

अभी मुख्‍यमंत्री जी बता रही थीं उज्‍ज्‍वला योजना के बारे में। लाखों की तादाद में गरीब मॉं-बहनों के पास आज गैस का चूल्‍हापहुँच गया।एक मॉं जब लकड़ी के चूल्‍हे से धुँए में खाना पकाती है तब 400 सिगरेट का धुँआ उसके शरीर में जाता है। उन मॉ-बहनों के उन बच्‍चों की जो खेलते हैं,उनके स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य की कौन चिंता करेगा?  और एक जमाना था] गैस का सिलेंडर लेने के लिए कितने पापड़ बेलने पड़ते थे। कितनी कठिनाइयॉं थीं, कितने नेताओं से चिट्टी चौपाई करनी पड़ती थी। ये ऐसी सरकार है जो गरीब के घर जा करके उसको गैसा का चूल्‍हादेने का अभियान चला रही है और लाखों परिवारों को दे चुकी है।

 

      पहले रोड बनते थे-उससे आज दोगुना रोड बन रहे हैं। पहले रेल बनती थी- उससे आज दोगुना रेल बन रही है। चाहे पानी पहुँचाना हो, चाहे Optical Fibre Network पहुँचाना है- हमने गति भी बढ़ा दी है, काम का स्‍केल बढ़ा दिया है,स्‍कोप भी बढ़ा दिया है और स्‍कील में भी हमने सुधार करके चीजों को आधुनिक बनाने में सफलता प्राप्‍त की है।

 

अभी जीएसटी आया-शुरू में लोगों को लग रहा था लेकिन दुनिया के लिए अजूबा है,सवा सौ करोड़़ का इतना बड़ा देश- रातों रात एक व्‍यवस्‍था बदल जाए और देश के सवा सौ करोड़ नागरिक नई व्‍यवस्‍था से अपने आप को Adjust करलें। ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की ताकत का परिचय करवाता है-दोस्‍तों।हरकिसी को गर्व होगा कि मेरे देश के अन्‍दर गॉंव में भी बैठे छोटे व्‍यापारी को भी Technology के द्वारा आधुनिक कैसे बनना उसके मन में एक इच्‍छा जगी है और मैं चाहूँगा, मैं राजस्‍थान के अफसरों से खास आग्रह करूंगा कि एक अभियान चलाइए। 15 दिन का-गॉंव-गॉव हर व्‍यापारी छोटा हो तो भी 20 लाख की सीमा से नीचे हो तब भी,10 लाख  की सीमा से  नीचे हो तब भी, उसको भी जीएसटी में जोडि़ए ताकि इस जीएसटी का लाभ उस गरीब व्‍यापारी को भी मिले और छोटे व्‍यापारी को भी मिलना चाहिए।अगर वह जुड़ेगा नहीं तो गाड़ी कहीं अटक जाएगी, वहींरूक जाएगी, नीचे तक लाभ पहुँचेगा नहीं, एक अभियान के स्‍वरूप में काम उठाना चाहिए। आप देखिए राजस्‍थान की आय में भी आप ने कल्‍पना नहीं की होगी किइतना परिवर्तन आएगा, इतना बढ़ावा होगा और उसका परिणाम ये होगा कि राजस्‍था  के गरीबों की भलाई के लिए अनेक नई योजनाएं सरकार अपने हाथ में ले सकती है। जीएसटी के कारण अकेले Transportation में,जो Department भी हमारे नितिन जी देखते हैं-पहले Driver घर से निकलता था अगर उसको समुद्री तट बंदर पर सामान पहुँचाना हो  तो  अगर हम किलोमीटर की गिनती करें, ट्रक के स्‍पीड  की गिनती करें, तो तीन दिन में पहॅुच सकता है।लेकिन पहले हर जगह पर चुँगी,हर प्रकार के चुँगी नाका।और नाकों पर क्‍या क्‍या होता थ, वो सब जानते हैं कि दुनिया कैसी चलती थी।वो बेचारा पॉंच दिन में पहुँचता था।दो दिन ट्रक एक सप्‍ताह में अगरदो दिन ट्रक पड़ी रहती है तो देश की Economy को 25 प्रतिशत से ज्‍यादा नुकसान होता हैTransportation में।ये जीएसटी के बाद सारे चॅुगी नाके गए, ट्रक के Driver को खड़े रहना जो लाल पास , नीला पास को जो चक्‍कर था सब बंद हो गय। और वो पहले पॉंच दिन लगते थे अब तीन दिन में पहॅुच रहा है। दो दिन ज्‍यादा माल ढो करके आगे बढ़ रहा है। उसके कारण माल ढोने के खर्च कम हुए।Transport वालों की आय बढ़ी और मैं तो नितिन जी  से कह रहा हॅू कि प्रतिदिन नए Transport के कानून भी बदलने चाहिए। आज हमारे देश  में  क्‍या  है एक ट्रक के अंदर माल ले कर जाते,पूरा उसी के अंदर ढो कर ले जाते हैं। अब  समय  की मॉंग है-ट्रक और ट्राली।जैसे ट्रैक्‍टर में होता है वो अलग कर दी जाए।ट्राली के अंदर सामान भरा हो, जयपुर में ट्राली छोड़ दो,ट्रक ले कर चले जाओं,दूसरी ट्राली लगा लो- आगे बढ़ जाओं। ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था होनी चाहिए कि ड्राइवर रात को अपने घर पहुँच सके। परिवार में बच्‍चो  के साथ रह सके। मैं ऐसी ट्रांसपोर्ट की व्‍यवस्‍था में Transport Transformation लाने का हमारा काम है। और Transformation देश में लाना है तो Transportपद्धति से भी बहुत तेजी से लाया जा सकता है और एक व्‍यापक योजना के साथ विकास की नई ऊँचाइयों को पार करने की दिशा में हम चल रहे हैं।

 

मैं फिर एक बार स्‍वागत सम्‍मान के लिए, आपके प्‍यार के लिए, आपके आशीर्वाद के लिए, आपका हृदय से बहुत-बहुत आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूँ।

 

      बहुत बहुत  धन्‍यवाद!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Saturday met and interacted with a group of 80 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries serving in the Government of India. This was the third of five such interactions.

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as agriculture, drinking water, citizen-centric governance, innovation and teamwork in governance, project implementation, education, manufacturing, internal security, and solar energy.

Prime Minister mentioned his PRAGATI initiative for project monitoring. On manufacturing, the Prime Minister said that the ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in India should now be focused on manufacture of medical equipment devices.

The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of maintaining a positive working environment in Government, in order to make it an ""organic entity."" He said that as new laws are made, old ones should be reviewed and weeded out if found unnecessary.

Highlighting the current positive global environment in favour of India, the Prime Minister asked officers to work with clear objectives towards creating a New India by 2022.

He asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.

                My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar. When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural to feel concerned. Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation. For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect – these are inherent to us. We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa Parmo Dharmah from our childhood. In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions. No one has the right to take the law into one’s own hands in the name of one’s beliefs. In the Constitution given to us by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person. I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression – whether it is a person or a group –neither this country nor any government will tolerate it. Each and every person will have to abide by the law; the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.

 

My dear countrymen, our country is a land of diversities – these diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire.  We observe diversity in every walk of life. Even our festivals are replete with diversity. Ours is arich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years – when we look at our cultural traditions, social customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival. You would have noticed, that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature. There is a direct connect with nature. Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen.

 

          Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam. The Jain community celebrated the Samvatsari Parva yesterday. In the month of Bhadra, Paryushan Parva is celebrated by the Jain Community. The last day of Paryushan Parva is observed as Samvatsari. This is indeed a remarkable tradition. The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood. It is also known as the Kshamavani Parva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, ‘michhamidukkadam.’ We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, “KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam”, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave. The one who forgives is valiant. And Mahatma Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men.

 

Shakespeare in his play, “The Merchant of Venice”, while explaining the importance of forgiveness, has written, “Mercy is twice blest, it blesseth him that gives and him that takes,” meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing.

 

My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country. When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival. This tradition was established by Bal Gangadhar Tilak 125 years ago, and it was 125 years ago that Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav became a symbol of India’s struggle for freedom. And after Independence, this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and educational awareness. Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival. This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty. My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.

 

The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela. Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela. This festival is known for its social and cultural significance. This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala. It gives the message of love and harmony -  awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new confidence to the people. Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism. And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions. Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors. We should think about what more can be done in this direction.

 

          In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-Zuha will be celebrated in a few days from now. Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha. Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief; in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well. In individual households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together. In fact, preparations for festivals always begin with cleaning. This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.  Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country – Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.

 

My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing. These days, a new measure to gauge a new dimension, a new parameter, has come in to being. It determines what your upbringing has been, how modern you are, how modern your thinking is. And that measure is your level of environment consciousness. Are your activities ecofriendly, environment friendly or otherwise? It is considered to be unacceptable in society today, of you are not environment friendly. And as a result of this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign. If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them. Some are using vegetable colours, while some are pasting bits and pieces of paper. All sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family. This is probably the first of its kind, the most widespread experiment in environment consciousness. Media houses too, are making a great effort in training people, inspiring them and guiding them towards ecofriendly Ganesh idols. What a massive transformation this has been; a pleasant one at that. And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains. And it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations. Someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay, to give training in making Ganesh idols. The Ganesh Visarjan or immersion is done in a small bucket of water, where the idol dissolves within no time. And he didn’t stop there. A tulsi, Holy Basil, sapling was sowed in it. The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October. And the positive results are now being seen. Toilets have increased from 39% to almost 67% of the population? More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free.

 

Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.  Many people lost their lives. When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere. That is when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner. They came together and toiled collectively. The volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind set a fine, inspiring example of unity for cleanliness. If this committed effort towards cleanliness becomes inherent to us, we will certainly take our nation to greater heights.

 

My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October – on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal Seva Yahi Prabhu Seva, Service to Water is Service to God. Let’s create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country. Whenever and wherever possible, let’s look for the opportunity. But we must all come together. We could look at this as preparations for Diwali, preparations for Navaratri, preparations for Durga Puja. Do Shramdan, Donate through labor.  Come together on Sundaysand Holidays. Go to settlements in your neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a movement. I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural and political leaders, people in the government, collectors and sarpanches, to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at least fifteen days ahead of Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October so that it turns out to be the 2nd October of Gandhi’s dreams. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped. My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, from the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition. You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit. You can make a short film even with your mobile phone. You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness. It can be in any language; it could be silent too. The best three participants – three at the district level, three at the state level will be given prizes. I invite one and all – Come, join the Cleanliness Campaign in this manner as well.

 

I would like to reiterate, let’s resolve to celebrate, 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti this year as Swachch Do Aktoobar, Clean 2nd October. And to this end beginning 15thSeptember let us take the mantra, the message, Swachchata Hi Seva, Cleanliness is Service to each and every home. Take one or another step towards cleanliness. Make your effort to be a part of it. You will see how the Gandhi Jayanti of this 2nd October shines. You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2ndof October.  

 

My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you. I want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time – I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with Mann ki Baat. The number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages, and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for me. This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all. Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness. I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share. It is an opportunity to test my endeavors on this touchstone. Even the smallest of your suggestions help me in thinking anew on a wide variety of subjects. I therefore express my heartfelt gratitude for your contributions and also my indebtedness to you. My endeavor always is to see for myself, hear, read and understand your thoughts. All sorts of things come to me. Now take this phone call for example. You will be able to correlate with it. You too would feel that, you would’ve committed the same mistake. Sometimes certain things become a part of our habits that we don’t even realize that we are doing something wrong.

 

“Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune. I want to tell you about a friend of mine. She always tries to help others, but one habit of her bothers me. I went for shopping with her at a mall. She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza. Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall. On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees. I feel very bad. We spend extravagantly in high places, without a single thought, but when it comes to our hardworking brethren, we quarrel with them over small amounts. We don’t trust them. Please speak about this on Mann ki Baat.”

 

     Now after listening to this phone call, I am certain that you would have been shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such a mistake. Don’t you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers - in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work – we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: “No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less!” And it is us, the same people, who go to dine at a fine restaurant, we don’t even bother to check the bill, we just go ahead and pay the money, without thinking twice. Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we don’t bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining. Have you ever wondered what a poor man goes through? It is not a matter of two or five rupees, it hurts him deeply, when he feels that you are questioning his honesty. Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him. Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message. I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.

 

          My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August. This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji. His contribution to hockey was unparalleled. I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports. Sports should become a part of our lives. If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well. Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement. What else does one need? Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together. The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports – and in today’s computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station. Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field. You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else. There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, “When will you come back home?” Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games. And the mother has to shout, “When will you go out?” How times have changed! There was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son would be back. And today, she demands to know when he will go out.

 

          Young friends, the Sports Ministry is launching a Sports Talent Search Portal to search for sporting talent and to groom them. Any talented child who has an achievement in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this portal. The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging players. The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow. The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.  Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home.

 

          Come, let’s welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the festival of Sports, let’s enjoy the sport, and create a conducive sporting atmosphere in the country. I speak about sports today, and just last week, a heartwarming incident took place, which I would like to share with my countrymen.  I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters, some of who, were born in the Himalayas, who had absolutely no connection with the sea. Six of these young daughters are in the Navy. Their grit and zeal, is inspiring for all of us. These six young women will embark on a voyage across the seas, in a small boat, INS Tarini. The expedition has been named, Navika Sagar Parikrama. They will circumnavigate the globe and return home, after many months. Sometimes they will spend 40 days on the seas in one go; at times, thirty. Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world. Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters. I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country. I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp to ensure that you can read it. For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters. My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.

 

          My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teacher’s Day. It is the birthday of our former President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji. He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher. He preferred to live a teacher’s life. He was committed to being a teacher. He was a scholar, a diplomat, the President of India and yet, quintessentially a teacher. I salute him.

 

          The great scientist Albert Einstein said, “It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.” The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning. As we celebrate Teacher’s Day this year can we come together and take a resolve? Can we run a campaign in mission mode? Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead.  Can we move ahead with this resolve?  Get someone committed to a five-year resolve. Show him the path of attainment, which he can achieve in five years - so that he can experience the joy of success in life. Such an atmosphere can be created by our schools, our colleges, our teachers, our educational institutions. When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers. The teacher plays a vital role in transformation. In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebody’s life. We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort. Come, let’s move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.

 

          “Pranam Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Dr. Ananya Awasthi. I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.  As a researcher, I have been especially interested in Financial Inclusion. With reference to the social schemes related to Financial Inclusion, my question to you is: In the backdrop of the Jan Dhan Yojna launched in 2014, can you say that, do the statistics show that today, three years later, India is financially more secure and stronger, and whether this empowerment and benefits have percolated down to our women, farmers and workers, in villages and small towns. Thank you.”

         

       My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion, had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in India, but all over the world. On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts. Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna will complete three years. Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened. This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world. And today I feel a great sense of fulfilment, that within three years, the last man on the fringes of society has become a part of the mainstream economy of the country. His ways have changed, he has now started going to the bank. He has started saving his money. He feels financially secure. When there is cash in the hand, or in the pocket or at home, one is tempted to indulge in wasteful expenditure. There is now an air of prudence. He is now beginning to understand that the money can be of use for his children. The money can be used productively in the days to come. Not just this, when a poor person sees a RuPay Card, in his pocket, he finds himself to be equal to the privileged – that if they have a credit card in their pockets, I too have a RuPay Card in mind. He feels a sense of dignity.

 

      In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren. In a way, this is a saving for the poor, this is his empowerment for the future. And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna, have received the benefit of insurance as well. Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor. For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupee insurance, they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, Start Up Yojna, Stand Up Yojna – for Dalits, Adivasis, women, educated youth, youth who want to stand on their own feet - for millions and millions through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, they have been able to get loans from banks without any guarantee. They have been able to stand on their own feet and have succeeded in giving employment to one or two other people as well. Banks have conducted surveys about how the common man has benefitted from Jan Dhan Yojna, from Insurance Schemes, from RuPay Card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna. I recently met a few bankers, who shared inspiring stories from their survey. There isn’t enough time today, but I would certainly like request the bankers to upload these inspiring stories, on MyGov.in, so that people can read them and be inspired by how a scheme can bring about transformation in the life of a person, how it can bring a new energy, a new confidence – hundreds of examples have come before me. I will try my best to bring these to you; and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories.  They too, can interview such people, and inspire the young generation.

 

          My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you “michchamidukkadm.” Thank you very much.

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, सादर नमस्कार। एक तरफ देश उत्सवों में डूबा हुआ है  और दूसरी तरफ से हिन्दुस्तान के किसी कोने से जब हिंसा की खबरें आती हैं तो देश को चिंता होना स्वाभाविक है। ये हमारा देश बुद्ध और गांधी का देश  है,  देश की एकता के लिए जी-जान लगा देने वाले सरदार पटेल का देश है। सदियों से हमारे पूर्वजों  ने  सार्वजनिक जीवन-मूल्यों को, अहिंसा को, समादर को स्वीकार किया हुआ है,  हमारी ज़हन में भरा हुआ है।  अहिंसा परमो धर्म:, ये हम बचपन से सुनते आये हैं, कहते आये हैं।  मैंने लाल किले से भी कहा था कि आस्था के नाम पर हिंसा बर्दाश्त नहीं होगी, चाहे वो सांप्रदायिक आस्था हो, चाहे वो राजनैतिक विचार धाराओं के प्रति आस्था हो, चाहे वो व्यक्ति के प्रति आस्था हो, चाहे वो परम्पराओं के प्रति आस्था हो, आस्था के नाम पर, कानून हाथ में लेने का किसी को अधिकार नहीं है। डॉ बाबा साहब आंबेडकर ने हमें जो संविधान दिया है उसमे हर व्यक्ति को न्याय पाने की हर प्रकार की व्यवस्था है। मैं देशवासियों को विश्वास दिलाना चाहता हूँ, कानून हाथ में लेने वाले, हिंसा के राह पर दमन करने वाले किसी को भी, चाहे वो व्यक्ति हो या समूह हो, न ये देश कभी बर्दाश्त करेगा और न ही कोई सरकार बर्दाश्त करेगी। हर किसी को कानून के सामने झुकना होगा, कानून ज़बाबदेही तय करेगा और दोषियों को सज़ा दे के रहेगा।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, हमारा देश विविधताओं से भरा हुआ है और ये विविधताएँ खान-पान, रहन-सहन, पहनाव वहाँ तक सीमित नहीं है। जीवन के हर व्यवहार में हमें विविधताएँ नजर आती हैं। यहाँ तक कि हमारे त्योहार भी विविधताओं से भरे हुए हैं और हज़ारों साल पुरानी हमारी सांस्कृतिक विरासत होने के कारण सांस्कृतिक  परम्पराएँ देखें, सामाजिक परम्पराएँ देखें, ऐतिहासिक घटनायें देखें तो शायद ही 365 दिन में कोई दिन बचता होगा जबकि हमारे यहाँ कोई त्योहार से न जुड़ा हुआ हो। अब ये भी आपने देखा होगा कि हमारे सारे त्योहार, प्रकृति के समय पत्रक के अनुसार चलते हैं। प्रकृति के साथ सीधा-सीधा संबंध आता है। हमारे बहुत सारे त्योहार तो सीधे-सीधे किसान से जुड़े हुए होते हैं, मछुआरों से जुड़े हुए होते हैं।

आज मैं त्योहारों की बात कर रहा हूँ तो सबसे पहले मैं आप सबको मिच्छामि दुक्कड़म कहना चाहूँगा। जैन समाज में कल संवत्सरी का पर्व मनाया गया। जैन समाज में भाद्र मास में पर्युषण पर्व मनाया जाता है। पर्युषण पर्व के आख़िरी दिन संवत्सरी का दिन होता है। ये सचमुच में अपने आप में एक अद्भुत परम्परा है। संवत्सरी का पर्व क्षमा, अहिंसा और मैत्री का प्रतीक है। इसे एक प्रकार से क्षमा-वाणी पर्व भी कहा जाता है और इस दिन एक दूसरे को मिच्छामि दुक्कड़म कहने की परंपरा है। वैसे भी हमारे शास्त्रों में ‘क्षमा वीरस्य भूषणम्’ यानि क्षमा वीरों का भूषण है। क्षमा करने वाला वीर होता है। ये चर्चा तो हम सुनते ही आए हैं और महात्मा गाँधी तो हमेशा कहते थे - क्षमा करना तो ताकतवर व्यक्ति की विशेषता होती है।

शेक्सपियर ने अपने नाटक ‘The Merchant of Venice’ में क्षमा भाव के महत्त्व को बताते हुए लिखा था – “Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes” अर्थात् क्षमा करने वाला और जिसे क्षमा किया गया,दोनों को भगवान का आशीर्वाद प्राप्त होता है।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, इन दिनों हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में गणेश चतुर्थी की धूम मची हुई है और जब गणेश चतुर्थी की बात आती है तो सार्वजनिक-गणेशोत्सव की बात स्वाभाविक है। बालगंगाधर लोकमान्य तिलक ने 125 साल पूर्व इस परंपरा को जन्म दिया और पिछले 125 साल आज़ादी के पहले वो आज़ादी के आन्दोलन का प्रतीक बन गए थे। और आज़ादी के बाद वे समाज-शिक्षा, सामाजिक-चेतना जगाने के प्रतीक बन गये हैं। गणेश चतुर्थी का पर्व 10 दिनों तक चलता है। इस महापर्व को एकता, समता और शुचिता का प्रतीक कहा जाता है। सभी देशवासियों को गणेशोत्सव की बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएँ।

अभी केरल में ‘ओणम’ का त्योहार मनाया जा रहा है। भारत के रंग-बिरंगे त्योहारों में से एक ‘ओणम’ केरल का एक प्रमुख त्योहार है। यह पर्व अपने सामाजिक और सांस्कृतिक महत्त्व के लिए जाना जाता है। ओणम का पर्व, केरल की समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक धरोहर को प्रदर्शित करता है। यह पर्व समाज में प्रेम और सौहार्द का सन्देश देने के साथ-साथ लोगों के मन में एक नयी उमंग, नयी आशा, नया विश्वास जागृत करता है। और अब तो हमारे ये त्योहार भी, tourism के आकर्षण का भी कारण बनते जा रहे हैं। और मैं तो देशवासियों से कहूँगा कि जैसे गुजरात में नवरात्रि का उत्सव या बंगाल में दुर्गा उत्सव - एक प्रकार से tourism का आकर्षण बन चुके हैं। हमारे और त्योहार भी, विदेशियों को आकर्षित करने के लिये एक अवसर हैं। उस दिशा में हम क्या कर सकते हैं, सोचना चाहिये।

इन त्योहारों की श्रृंखला में कुछ ही दिन बाद देश भर में ‘ईद-उल-जुहा’ का पर्व भी मनाया जाएगा। सभी देशवासियों को ‘ईद-उल-जुहा’ की बहुत-बहुत बधाइयाँ, बहुत शुभकामनाएँ। त्योहार हमारे लिए आस्था और विश्वास के प्रतीक तो हैं ही, हमें नये भारत में त्योहारों को स्वच्छता का भी प्रतीक बनाना है। पारिवारिक जीवन में तो त्योहार और स्वच्छता जुड़े हुए हैं। त्योहार की तैयारी का मतलब है - साफ़-सफाई। ये हमारे लिए कोई नयी चीज़ नहीं है लेकिन ये सामाजिक स्वभाव बनाना भी ज़रूरी है। सार्वजनिक रूप से स्वच्छता का आग्रह सिर्फ़ घर में नहीं, हमारे पूरे गाँव में, पूरे नगर में, पूरे शहर में, हमारे राज्य में, हमारे देश में – स्वच्छता, ये त्योहारों के साथ एक अटूट हिस्सा बनना ही चाहिये।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आधुनिक होने की परिभाषाएँ बदलती चली जा रही हैं। इन दिनों एक नया dimension, एक नया parameter, आप कितने संस्कारी हो, कितने आधुनिक हो, आपकी thought-process कितनी modern है, ये सब जानने में एक तराजू भी काम में आने लगा है और वो है environment के प्रति आप कितने सजग हैं। आपके अपनी गतिविधियों में eco-friendly, environment-friendly व्यवहार है कि उसके खिलाफ़ है। समाज में अगर उसके ख़िलाफ़ है तो आज बुरा माना जाता है। और उसी का परिणाम आज मैं देख रहा हूँ कि इन दिनों ये गणेशोत्सव में भी eco-friendly गणपति, मानो एक बड़ा अभियान खड़ा हो गया है। अगर आप You Tube पर जा करके देखेंगे, हर घर में बच्चे गणेश जी बना रहे हैं, मिट्टी ला करके गणेश जी बना रहे हैं। उसमें रंग पुताई कर रहे हैं। कोई vegetable के colour लगा रहा है, कोई कागज़ के टुकड़े चिपका रहा है। भांति-भांति के प्रयोग हर परिवार में हो रहे हैं। एक प्रकार से environment consciousness का इतना बड़ा व्यापक प्रशिक्षण इस गणेशोत्सव में देखने को मिला है, शायद ही पहले कभी मिला हो। Media house भी बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में eco friendly गणेश की मूर्तियों के लिए लोगों को प्रशिक्षित कर रहे हैं, प्रेरित कर रहे हैं, guide कर रहे हैं। देखिए कितना बड़ा बदलाव आया है और ये सुखद बदलाव है। और जैसा मैंने कहा हमारा देश, करोड़ों - करोड़ों तेजस्वी दिमागों से भी भरा हुआ है। और बड़ा अच्छा लगता है जब कोई नये-नये innovation जानते हैं। मुझे किसी ने बताया कि कोई एक सज्जन हैं जो स्वयं engineer हैं, उन्होंने एक विशिष्ट प्रकार से मिट्टी इकट्ठी करके, उसका combination करके, गणेश जी बनाने की training लोगों की और वो एक छोटी से बाल्टी में, पानी में गणेश विसर्जन होता है तो उसी में रखते हैं तो पानी में तुरंत dilute हो जाती है। और उन्होंने यहाँ पर रुके नहीं हैं उसमें एक तुलसी का पौधा बो दिया और पौधे बो दिए। तीन वर्ष पूर्व जब स्वच्छता का अभियान प्रारंभ किया था, 2 अक्टूबर को उसको तीन साल हो जायेंगे। और, उसके सकारात्मक परिणाम नज़र आ रहे हैं। शौचालयों की coverage 39% से करीब-करीब 67% पहुँची हैं। 2 लाख 30 हज़ार से भी ज्यादा गाँव, खुले में शौच से अपने आपको मुक्त घोषित कर चुके हैं।

पिछले दिनों गुजरात में भयंकर बाढ़ आई। काफ़ी लोग अपनी जान गंवा बैठे लेकिन बाढ़ के बाद जब पानी कम हुआ तो हर जगह इतनी गन्दगी फ़ैलगई थी। ऐसे समय में गुजरात के बनासकांठा ज़िले के धानेरा में, जमीयत उलेमा–ए–हिन्द के कार्यकर्ताओं ने बाढ़ - प्रभावित 22 मंदिरों एवं 3 मस्जिदों की चरणबद्धतरीक़े से साफ़-सफ़ाई की। ख़ुद का पसीना बहाया, सब लोग निकल पड़े। स्वच्छताके लिए एकता का उत्तम उदाहरण, हर किसी को प्रेरणा देने वाला ऐसा उदाहरण, जमीयत उलेमा–ए–हिन्द के सभी कार्यकर्ताओं ने दिया। स्वच्छता के लिए समर्पणभाव से किया गया प्रयास, ये अगर हमारा स्थायी स्वभाव बन जाए तो हमारा देशकहाँ से कहाँ पहुँच सकता है।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं आप सभी से एक आह्वान करता हूँ कि एक बार फिर 2 अक्टूबर गाँधी जयंती से 15-20 दिन पहले से ही ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ - जैसे पहले कहते थे ‘जल सेवा यही प्रभु सेवा’, ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ की एक मुहिम चलायें। पूरे देश में स्वच्छता के लिए माहौल बनाएं। जैसा अवसर मिले, जहाँ भी अवसर मिले, हम अवसर ढूंढें। लेकिन हम सभी जुड़ें। इसे एक प्रकार से दिवाली की तैयारी मान लें, इसे एक प्रकार से नवरात्र की तैयारी मान लें, दुर्गा पूजा की तैयारी मान लें। श्रमदान करें। छुट्टी के दिन या रविवार को इकठ्ठा हो कर एक-साथ काम करें। आस-पड़ोस की बस्ती में जायें, नज़दीक के गाँव में जायें, लेकिन एक आन्दोलन के रूप में करें। मैं सभी NGOs को, स्कूलों को, colleges को, सामाजिक, सांस्कृतिक, राजनीतिक नेतृत्व को, सरकार के अफसरों को, कलेक्टरों को, सरपंचों को हर किसी से आग्रह करता हूँ कि 2 अक्टूबर महात्मा गाँधी की जन्म-जयंती के पहले ही, 15 दिन, हम एक ऐसी स्वच्छता का वातावरण बनाएं, ऐसा स्वच्छता खड़ी कर दें कि 2 अक्टूबर सचमुच में गाँधी के सपनों वाली 2 अक्टूबर हो जाए। पेयजल एवं स्वच्छता मंत्रालय, MyGov.in पर एक section बनाया है जहाँ शौचालय निर्माण के बाद आप अपना नाम और उस परिवार का नाम प्रविष्ट कर सकते हैं, जिसकी आपने मदद की है। मेरे social media के मित्र कुछ रचनात्मक अभियान चला सकते हैं और virtual world का   धरातल पर काम हो, उसकी प्रेरणा बना सकते हैं। स्वच्छ-संकल्प से स्वच्छ-सिद्धि प्रतियोगिता, पेयजल एवं स्वच्छता मंत्रालय द्वारा ये अभियान जिसमें आप निबंध की स्पर्धा है, लघु-फिल्म बनाने की स्पर्धा है, चित्रकला-प्रतियोगिता आयोजित की जा रही है। इसमें आप विभिन्न भाषाओँ में निबंध लिख सकते हैं और उसमें कोई उम्र की मर्यादा नहीं है, कोई age limit नहीं है। आप short film बना सकते हैं, अपने mobile से बना सकते हैं। 2-3 मिनट की फिल्म बना सकते हैं जो स्वच्छता के लिए प्रेरणा दे। वो किसी भी languageमें हो सकती है, वो silent भी हो सकती है। ये जो प्रतियोगिता में हिस्सा लेंगे उसमें से जो best तीन लोग चुने जायेंगे, district level पर तीन होंगे, state level पर तीन होंगे उनको पुरस्कार दिया जाएगा। तो मैं हर किसी को निमंत्रण देता हूँ कि आइये, स्वच्छता के इस अभियान के इस रूप में भी आप जुड़ें।

    मैं फिर एक बार कहना चाहता हूँ कि इस बार 2 अक्टूबर गाँधी जयंती को ‘स्वच्छ 2 अक्टूबर’ मनाने का संकल्प करें और इसके लिए 15 सितम्बर से ही ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ इस मंत्र को घर-घर पहुंचायें। स्वच्छता के लिए कोई-न-कोई कदम उठाएँ। स्वयं परिश्रम करके इसमें हिस्सेदार बनें। आप देखिए, गाँधी जयंती की ये 2 अक्टूबर कैसी चमकेगी। आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं 15 दिन के सफ़ाई के इस अभियान के बाद, ‘स्वच्छता ही सेवा’ के बाद, 2 अक्टूबर को जब हम गाँधी जयंती मनाएगें तो पूज्य बापू को श्रद्धांजलि देने का हमारे भीतर कितना एक पवित्र आनंद होगा। 

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं आज एक विशेष रूप से आप सब का ऋण स्वीकार करना चाहता हूँ। ह्रदय की गहराई से मैं आप का आभार व्यक्त करना चाहता हूँ, इसलिए नहीं कि इतने लम्बे अरसे तक आप ‘मन की बात’ से जुड़े रहे। मैं इसलिए आभार व्यक्त करना चाहता हूँ, ऋण स्वीकार करना चाहता हूँ क्योंकि ‘मन की बात’ के इस कार्यक्रम के साथ देश के हर कोने से लाखों लोग जुड़ जाते हैं। सुनने वालों की संख्या तो करोड़ों में है, लेकिन लाखों लोग मुझे कभी पत्र लिखते हैं, कभी message देते हैं, कभी फ़ोन पे सन्देश आ जाता है, मेरे लिए एक बहुत बड़ा खज़ाना है। देश के जन-जन के मन को जानने के लिए ये मेरे लिए एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर बन गया है। आप जितना ‘मन की बात’ का इंतज़ार करते हैं उससे ज़्यादा मैं आपके संदेशों का इंतज़ार करता हूँ। मैं लालायित रहता हूँ क्योंकि आप की हर बात से मुझे कुछ सीखने को मिलता है। मैं जो कर रहा हूँ उसको कसौटी पर कसने का अवसर मिल जाता है। बहुत-सी बातों को नये तरीक़े से सोचने के लिए आपकी छोटी-छोटी बातें भी मुझे काम आती हैं और इसलिए मैं आपके इस योगदान के लिए आपका आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ, आपका ऋण स्वीकार करता हूँ और मेरे प्रयास रहता है कि ज़्यादा-से-ज़्यादा आपकी बातों को मैं स्वयं देखूँ, सुनूँ, पढूँ, समझूँ और ऐसी-ऐसी बातें आती हैं। अब देखिये, अब इस phone call से आप भी अपने आपको co-relate करते होंगे। आपको भी लगता होगा हाँ यार, आपने कभी ऐसी गलती की है। कभी-कभी तो कुछ चीज़ें हमारी आदत का ऐसा हिस्सा बन जाती हैं कि हमें लगता ही नहीं है कि हम ग़लत करते हैं।

‘‘प्रधानमंत्री जी, मैं पूना से अपर्णा बोल रही हूँ। मैं अपनी एक सहेली के बारे में बताना चाहती हूँ। वो हमेशा लोगों की मदद करने की कोशिश करती है लेकिन उसकी एक आदत देखकर मैं हैरान हो जाती हूँ। मैं एक बार उसके साथ शॉपिंग करने मॉल गयी थी। एक साड़ी पर उसने दो हज़ार रूपये बड़े आराम से खर्च कर दिए और पीज़ा पर 450/- रूपये, जबकि मॉल तक जाने के लिए जो ऑटो लिया था, उस ऑटो वाले से बहुत देर तक पाँच रूपये के लिए मोल-भाव करती रही। वापस लौटते हुए रास्ते में सब्जी खरीदी और हर सब्जी पर फिर से मोल-भाव करके 4-5 रूपये बचाये। मुझे बहुत बुरा लगता है। हम बड़ी-बड़ी जगह एक बार भी बिना पूछे बड़े-बड़े भुगतान कर देते हैं और हमारे मेहनतकश भाई-बहनों से थोड़े से रुपयों के लिए झगड़ा करते हैं। उन पर अविश्वास करते हैं। आप अपनी ‘मन की बात’ में इस बारे में ज़रूर बताएँ।”’’

अब ये phone call सुनने के बाद, मुझे पक्का विश्वास है कि आप चौंक भी गये होंगे, चौकन्ने भी हो गये होंगे और हो सकता है आगे से ऐसी गलती न करने का मन में तय भी कर लिये होंगे। क्या आपको नहीं लगता है कि जब हम, हमारे घर के आस-पास कोई सामान बेचने के लिए आता है, कोई फेरी लगाने वाला आता है, किसी छोटे दुकानदार से, सब्ज़ी बेचने वालों से हमारा संबंध आ जाता है, कभी ऑटो-रिक्शा वाले से संबंध आता है - जब भी हमारा किसी मेहनतकश व्यक्ति के साथ संबंध आता है तो हम उससे भाव का तोल-मोल करने लग जाते हैं, मोल-भाव करने लग जाते हैं - नहीं इतना नहीं, दो रूपया कम करो, पाँच रुपया कम करो। और हम ही लोग किसी बड़े restaurant में खाना खाने जाते हैं तो बिल में क्या लिखा है देखते भी नहीं हैं, धड़ाम से पैसे दे देते हैं। इतना ही नहीं showroom में साड़ी ख़रीदने जायें, कोई मोल-भाव नहीं करते हैं लेकिन किसी ग़रीब से अपना नाता आ जाये तो मोल-भाव किये बिना रहते नहीं हैं। ग़रीब के मन को क्या होता होगा, ये कभी आपने सोचा है ? उसके लिए सवाल दो रूपये - पांच रूपये का नहीं है। उसके ह्रदय को चोट पहुँचती है कि आपने वो ग़रीब है इसलिए उसकी ईमानदारी पर शक किया है। दो रूपया - पांच रूपया आपके जीवन में कोई फ़र्क नहीं पड़ता है लेकिन आपकी ये छोटी-सी आदत उसके मन को कितना गहरा धक्का लगाती होगी कभी ये सोचा है ? मैडम, मैं आप का आभारी हूँ आपने इतना ह्रदय को छूने वाला phone call करके एक message मुझे दिया। मुझे विश्वास है कि मेरे देशवासी भी ग़रीब के साथ ऐसा व्यवहार करने की आदत होगी तो ज़रुर छोड़ देंगे।

मेरे प्यारे नौजवान साथियो, 29 अगस्त को पूरा देश राष्ट्रीय खेल-दिवस के रूप में मनाता है। ये महान hockey player और हॉकी के जादूगर मेजर ध्यानचंद जी का जन्मदिवस है। हॉकी के लिए उनका योगदान अतुलनीय था। मैं इस बात का स्मरण इसलिए करा रहा हूँ कि मैं चाहता हूँ कि हमारे देश की नई पीढ़ी, खेल से जुड़े। खेल हमारे जीवन का हिस्सा बने। अगर हम दुनिया के युवा देश हैं तो हमारी ये तरुणाई खेल के मैदान में भी नज़र आनी चाहिए। Sports यानि physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement मैं समझता हूँ कि इससे ज्यादा क्या चाहिए? खेल एक प्रकार से दिलों के मेल की एक बहुत बड़ी जड़ी-बूटी है। हमारी देश की युवा पीढ़ी खेल जगत में आगे आए और आज computer के युग में तो मैं आगाह भी करना चाहूँगा कि playing field, play-station से ज्यादा महत्वपूर्ण है। computer पर FIFA खेलिये लेकिन बाहर मैदान में भी तो कभी football के साथ करतब करके दिखाइये। computer पर cricketखेलते होंगे लेकिन खुले मैदान में आसमान के नीचे cricket खेलने का आनंद कुछ और होता है। एक समय था जब परिवार के बच्चे बाहर जाते थे तो माँ पहले पूछती थी कि तुम कब वापिस आओगे। आज हालत ये हो गई है कि बच्चे घर में आते ही एक कोने में या तो cartoon film देखने में लग जाते हैं या तो mobile game पर चिपक जाते हैं और तब माँ को चिल्ला करके कहना पड़ता है - तू कब बाहर जाएगा। वक़्त-वक़्त की बात है, वो भी एक ज़माना था जब माँ बेटे को कहती थी कि तुम कब आओगे और आज ये हाल है कि माँ को कहना पड़ता है बेटा तुम बाहर कब जाओगे?

   नौजवान दोस्तो, खेल मंत्रालय ने खेल प्रतिभा की खोज और उन्हें निखारने के लिए एक Sports Talent Search Portal तैयार किया है, जहाँ पूरे देश से कोई भी बच्चा जिसने खेल के क्षेत्र में कुछ उपलब्द्धि हासिल की है, उनमें Talent हो - वो इस portal पर अपना Bio-Data या video upload कर सकता है। Selected emerging players को खेल मंत्रालय training देगा और मंत्रालय कल ही इस portal को launch करने वाला है। हमारे नौजवानों के लिए तो खुशी की खबर है कि भारत में 6 से 28 अक्टूबर तक FIFA Under 17 World Cup का आयोजन होने जा रहा है। दुनिया भर से 24 टीमें भारत को अपना घर बनाने जा रही हैं।

    आइये, विश्व से आने वाले हमारे नौजवान मेहमानों का, खेल के उत्सव के साथ स्वागत करें, खेल को enjoy करें, देश में एक माहौल बनाएं। जब मैं आज खेल की बात कर रहा हूँ तो मैं पिछले हफ्ते एक मेरे मन को बड़ी ही छू जाने वाली घटना घटी। देशवासियों के साथ share करना चाहता हूँ। मुझे बहुत ही छोटी आयु की कुछ बेटियों से मिलने का मौका मिला और उसमें से कुछ बेटियां तो हिमालय में पैदा हुई थी। समंदर से जिनका कभी नाता भी नहीं था। ऐसी हमारी देश की छ: बेटियां जो Navy  में काम करती हैं - उनका जज़्बा, उनका हौसला हम सब को प्रेरणा देने वाला है। ये छ: बेटियां, एक छोटी-सी boat लेकर करके INS Tarini(तारिणी) उसको लेकर कर के समुन्द्र पार करने के लिए निकल पड़ेगी। इस अभियान का नाम दिया गया है ‘नाविका सागर परिक्रमा’ और वे पूरे विश्व का भ्रमण करके महीनों के बाद, कई महीनों के बाद भारत लौटेगी। कभी एक साथ 40-40 दिन पानी में बिताएगी। कभी-कभी 30-30 दिन पानी में बिताएगी। समुन्द्र की लहरों के बीच साहस के साथ हमारी ये छ: बेटियां और ये विश्व में पहली घटना हो रही है। कौन हिंदुस्तानी होगा जिन्हें हमारी इन बेटियों पर नाज़ न हो! मैं इन बेटियों के जज़्बे को सलाम करता हूँ और मैंने उनसे कहा है कि वो पूरे देश के साथ अपने अनुभवों को साझा करें। मैं भी NarendraModi App पर उनके अनुभवों के लिए एक अलग व्यवस्था करूँगा ताकि आप ज़रूर उसे पढ़ पाएं क्योंकि ये एक प्रकार से ये साहस कथा है, स्वानुभव की कथा होगी और मुझे खुशी होगी इन बेटियों की बातों को आप तक पहुंचाने में। मेरी इन बेटियों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामना है, बहुत-बहुत आशीर्वाद है।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, 5 सितम्बर को हम सब शिक्षक दिवस मनाते हैं। हमारे देश के भूतपूर्व राष्ट्रपति डॉ. राधाकृष्णन जी का जन्मदिवस है। वे राष्ट्रपति थे लेकिन जीवन भर अपने आप को एक शिक्षक के रूप में ही वो प्रस्तुत करते थे। वो हमेशा शिक्षक के रूप में ही जीना पसंद करते थे। वे शिक्षा के प्रति समर्पित थे। एक अध्येता, एक राजनयिक, भारत के राष्ट्रपति लेकिन हर पल एक जीते-जागते शिक्षक। मैं उनको नमन करता हूँ।

महान वैज्ञानिक अल्बर्ट आइंस्टीन ने कहा था It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. अपने छात्रों में सृजनात्मक भाव और ज्ञान का आनंद जगाना ही एक शिक्षक का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण गुण है। इस बार जब हम शिक्षक दिवस मनाएँ। क्या हम सब मिलकर के एक संकल्प कर सकते हैं? एक mission mode में एक अभियान चला सकते हैं? Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead इस संकल्प के साथ इस बात को आगे बढ़ा सकते हैं क्या? हर किसी को 5 साल के लिए, किसी संकल्प से बांधिए, उसे सिद्ध करने का रास्ता दिखाइये और 5 साल में वो पाकर के रहे, जीवन में सफ़ल होने का आनंद पाये - ऐसा माहौल हमारे स्कूल, हमारे कॉलेज, हमारे शिक्षक, हमारे शिक्षा संस्थान ये कर सकते हैं और हमारे देश में जब हम transformation की बात करते हैं तो जैसे परिवार में माँ की याद आती है वैसे ही समाज में शिक्षक की याद आती है। transformation में शिक्षक की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका रहती है। हर शिक्षक के जीवन में कहीं-न-कहीं ऐसी घटनाएँ हैं कि जिसके सहज़ प्रयासों से किसी की ज़िन्दगी के transformation में सफ़लता मिली होगी। अगर हम सामूहिक प्रयास करेंगे तो राष्ट्र के transformation में हम बहुत बड़ी भूमिका अदा करेंगे। आइये teach to transform इस मंत्र को लेकर के चल पड़ें।

    ‘‘प्रणाम प्र”धानमंत्री जी। मेरा नाम है डॉक्टर अनन्या अवस्थी। मैं मुम्बई शहर की निवासी हूँ और Howard University के India Research Centre के लिये काम करती हूँ। एक researcher के तौर पर मेरी विशेष रूचि रही है वित्तीय समावेश में, जिसको हम financial inclusion इनसे related social schemes को लेकर और मेरा आपसे प्रश्न ये है कि 2014 में जो जनधन योजना launch हुईक्या आप कह सकते हैं, क्या आँकड़े ये दिखाते हैं कि आज तीन साल बाद भारतवर्ष financially  ज्यादा secure है या ज्यादा सशक्त है और क्या ये सशक्तिकरण और सुविधायें हमारी महिलाओं को, किसानों को, मजदूरों को गाँव और कस्बों तक भी प्राप्त हो पायी हैं। धन्यवाद।’’  

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, ‘प्रधानमंत्री जन-धन योजना’ financial inclusion, ये भारत में ही नहीं पूरे विश्व में आर्थिक जगत के पंडितों की चर्चा का विषय रहा है। 28 अगस्त, 2014 को मन में एक सपना ले करके इस अभियान को प्रारंभ किया था। कल 28 अगस्त को इस ‘प्रधानमंत्री जन-धन योजना’ के अभियान को तीन साल हो रहे हैं। 30 करोड़ नये परिवारों को इसके साथ जोड़ा है, bank account खोला है। दुनिया के कई देशों की आबादी से भी ज़्यादा ये नंबर है। आज मुझे एक बहुत बड़ा समाधान है कि तीन साल के भीतर-भीतर समाज के उस आख़िरी छोर पर बैठा हुआ मेरा ग़रीब भाई, देश की अर्थव्यवस्था के मूल-धारा का हिस्सा बना है, उसकी आदत बदली है, वो bank में आने-जाने लगा है, वो पैसों की बचत करने लगा है, वो पैसों की सुरक्षा महसूस कर रहा है। कभी पैसे हाथ में रहते हैं, ज़ेब में रहते हैं, घर में हैं तो फ़ालतू ख़र्च करने का मन कर जाता है। अब एक संयम का माहौल बना है और धीरे-धीरे उसको भी लगने लगा है कि पैसे कहीं बच्चों के काम आ जायेंगे। आने वाले दिनों में कोई अच्छा काम करना है तो पैसे काम आयेगें। इतना ही नहीं, जो ग़रीब अपने ज़ेब में RuPay Card देखता है तो अमीरों की बराबरी में अपने आपको पाता है कि उनके ज़ेब में भी credit card है, मेरी ज़ेब में भी RuPay Card है - वो एक सम्मान का भाव महसूस करता है। प्रधानमंत्री जन-धन योजना में हमारे ग़रीबों के द्वारा क़रीब 65 हज़ार करोड़ रूपया बैंकों में जमा हुआ है। एक प्रकार से ग़रीब की ये बचत है, ये आने वाले दिनों में उसकी ताक़त है। और प्रधानमंत्री जन-धन योजना के साथ जिसका account खुला, उसको insurance का भी लाभ मिला है। ‘प्रधानमंत्री जीवन ज्योति बीमा योजना’, ‘प्रधानमंत्री सुरक्षा बीमा योजना’ - एक रुपया, तीस रूपया बहुत मामूली सा premium आज वो ग़रीबों की ज़िन्दगी में एक नया विश्वास पैदा करता है। कई परिवारों में, एक रूपये के बीमे के कारण जब ग़रीब आदमी पर संकट आया, परिवार के मुखिया का जीवन अंत हो गया, कुछ ही दिनों में उसे 2 लाख रूपये मिल गए। ‘प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना’, ‘Start Up योजना’, ‘Stand Up योजना’ - दलित हो, आदिवासी हो, महिला हो, पढ़-लिख करके निकला हुआ नौज़वान हो, अपने पैरों पर खड़े होकर कुछ करने का इरादा वाले नौज़वान हो, करोड़ों-करोड़ों नौज़वानों को ‘प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना’ से, बैंकों से बिना कोई गारन्टी पैसे मिले और वो स्वयं अपने पैरों पर खड़े हुए इतना ही नहीं, हर किसी ने एक-आध, एक-आध दो को रोज़गार देने का सफ़ल प्रयास भी किया है। पिछले दिनों बैंक के लोग मुझे मिले थे, जन-धन योजना के कारण, insurance के कारण, RuPay Card के कारण, प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना के कारण, सामान्य लोगों को कैसा लाभ हुआ है उसका उन्होंने सर्वे करवाया और बड़ी प्रेरक घटनायें मिली। आज इतना समय नहीं है लेकिन मैं ज़रूर ऐसी घटनाओं को bank के लोगों से कहूँगा कि वो MyGov.in पर उसको upload करें, लोग पढ़ें, लोगों को उससे प्रेरणा मिलेगी कि कोई योजना, व्यक्ति के जीवन में कैसे transformation लाता है, कैसे नयी ऊर्जा भरता है, कैसे नया विश्वास भरता है, इसके सैकड़ों उदाहरण मेरे सामने आये हैं। आप तक पहुँचाने का मैं पूरा प्रयास करूँगा और ऐसी प्रेरक घटना है कि media के लोग भी इसका पूरा लाभ उठा सकते हैं। वे भी ऐसे लोगों से interview करके नई पीढ़ी को नई प्रेरणा दे सकते हैं।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, फिर एक बार आपको मिच्छामी दुक्कड़म। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Thursday met and interacted with a group of over 80 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries serving in the Government of India. This was the second of five such interactions. 

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as performance based administration, innovation in governance, waste management, river and environment pollution, forestry, sanitation, climate change, value addition in agriculture, education and skill development. 

Responding to observations made by the officers, the Prime Minister emphasized that officers must not restrict themselves to files, but go to the field, to understand the true impact of decision-making. In this context, he recalled the experience of officers in post-earthquake reconstruction in Gujarat, in 2001. 

The Prime Minister said that officers should not look on their work as just a duty, but an opportunity to make a positive transformation for governance in the country. He urged them to use technology interventions to simplify governance processes. He asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.

                Today, the 24th August, you people celebrate your institution’s founding day as a day of pride.

I congratulate you people for the role played by BAIF in nation building.

Today, if I had been able to join you in your happiness in person then it would have been a great personal pleasure. I’d have heard your personal experiences, and I’d have learnt something new from you people.

I still remember that when the Wadi program was initiated then I had closely observed your work in Navsari and Valsad. So at an emotional level I feel very closely associated with BAIF. And, it’s a matter of great satisfaction for any institution with the kind of mission your institution is working in several states.

Today, several awards have been given in this program. Some self help groups are among those who have been awarded and some of the winners have been awarded due to their personal endeavors. Somebody is from Karnataka, somebody is from Gujarat, somebody is from Maharashtra and from Jharkhand.  I congratulate them as well and I hope that they will continue to work in the interest of the society in the same manner.

Friends, this year is also centenary year for the establishment of Sabarmati Ashram and also for the Champaran Satyagrah. This is also the 125th year of public celebration of Ganeshotsav. In the history of our country, all these three milestones have been known for giving a new direction to the freedom movement. These are the symbols of the realisation of a solemn pledge through people’s participation.

This vision of people’s welfare through people’s participation has been the basis of Bhartiya Agro Industries Foundation. It may be completing fifty years today but its foundation was laid the same day when Mani Bhai had reached Uruli Kanchan village with Gandhi Ji in 1946. Mani Bhai had taken a pledge to transform the entire region due to an inspiration from Gandhi Ji and started this thing by bringing some cows here from Gir in Gujarat.

 

Your institution has successfully demonstrated this thing that how farmer’s income can be supplemented by combining the modern science with the traditional knowledge available in our villages.

Friends, empowerment of our country’s farmers living in villages is extremely important for the balanced development of the country. The dream of a New India cannot be realized without an empowered farmer and that is why the government has been working to achieve the target of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022.  That is why the approach of agriculture schemes have been changed from being production centric to income centric. Today, the government is with farmers from the seed to the market. Emphasis has been placed on the proper use of every single drop of water. Organic agriculture and crop diversification have been encouraged. More than 9 crore soil health cards have been issued to the farmers for giving them information about their land’s health.

More than 500 agriculture bazaars of the country are in the process of being linked under the e-NAM scheme. Recently Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada scheme has been launched. The aim of this scheme is to solve the problem of lack of storage in the country and to encourage the food processing.

It is being ensured with the help of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) that farmers’ lives are not devastated if their crops are destroyed due to some reason. The loans to the farmers are being provided at the lowest interest rate in order to set them free from the clutches of usurious money lenders. You would notice that these efforts of the government are directed to reduce the farmers’ expenditure, boost their income and to bring them out of the worries related to agriculture. The country will attain new heights of development when those who feed the country are free from tension.

BAIF has been working in this direction for several years with a sense of service but today I would like sow the seeds of some new ideas in you. It’s not like giving advice or knowledge to an expert but it’s like asking the expert for something.

I’m aware that how BAIF has been empowering millions of women through women self-help groups. However, can it be made more focused?

As per a report, nearly 70% women of the country have been collectively taking care of the animal husbandry sector of the country. Be it arranging fodder or water for cattle or be it the work related with milk production or treatment of cattle, these things have been primarily done by women.

So in way the country’s animal husbandry sector is totally dependent on the skills of women. So today it is extremely essential to impart the special training to women self-help groups about the veterinary education, research and service delivery system. The more women are trained in this field the more it will strengthen the animal husbandry sector of the country and it will also benefit the women themselves.

An institution like BAIF can inspire the maximum number of women for this purpose.Itcan start programmes to impart training to them.

Friends, every year we incur the loss of nearly Rs. 40 thousand crores in our country due to the diseases of cattle. In some states, cattle health care fairs have been organised to deal with this problem. Things like, from the cataract operation of animals to the cleaning of their teeth are being performed in these fairs. However, there is a need to increase the number of such cattle health care fairs. Organizations like BAIF can play an extremely important role in organising cattle health fairs in cooperation with state governments.

I’m especially urging you as your organization has already been working in the 15 states and you have the capacity to expand in the entire country. The north-eastern states of the country have been waiting for the establishment of BAIF’s footprint in them. The north-eastern states of the country, I call them Ashta-Lakshmi, there is plenty of scope for organic farming. Your experience can immensely benefit them.

Similarly, it is necessary to increase the awareness about the farming of medicinal and aromatic plants among the farmers. Our country has thousands of species of medicinal and aromatic plants, and they are in demand across the globe. However, there is a huge gap between the demand and supply. The government, the progressive farmers and the organizations like BAIF can very well provide the knowledge about the farming and about entire supply chain of these plants.

Friends, the country is very well familiar with the green revolution and white revolution. Time has come to bring about the changes in the lives of our fishermen brothers through blue revolution and to supplement the income of our farmers through honey-bee keeping and honey production.

We have been working to bring blue revolution, sweet revolution and water revolution along with green revolution and white revolution.

Farming is not all about only producing wheat, rice and mustards. The more attention is given to all the sub sectors of agriculture along with traditional farming, the more it will help to supplement the farmer’s income. For example, take the case of honey bee keeping. According to a research, a farmer engaged in the traditional farming can earn extra Rs. 2 lakh per annum by having a small unit of 50 bee colonies. Honey bees play an important role in pollination along with honey production.

 

Be it honey-bee keeping, fisheries or be it production of ethanol through the residue of sugarcanes and crops, the demands of the modern society is being met through these things, and that is why BAIF can very well do the job of making the traditional farmers aware about these sub-sectors and help them.

Friends, be it Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, or be it some areas of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana-Andhra Pradesh or be it Bundelkhand region in Uttar Pradesh, these are some of the areas where the farmers continue to face the problem of water shortage.

The government is continuously trying to tackle the shortage of water. Under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) 99 such projects are being completed that were stuck from a long time. Out of these, twenty one projects have been completed this year. Emphasis has been placed on the better use of every single drop of water along with this thing. Drip irrigation, micro irrigation and crop diversification is also a means for this thing. Government is spending more than 60% budget of MNREGA on water conservation and water management.

However, brothers and sisters, we cannot make this thing a success unless all the farmers join in this initiative. I have been told that Shri Popatrao Pawar from Hivare Bazaar is also present in this function. Hivare Bazaar is good example of how we can properly utilize water by working collectively while taking care of each other’s interest so that the efficiency of our water usage goes up and our ground water resources are being used in a sustainable manner. I have hopes from BAIF that they will set examples of ‘people’s movement’ and ‘water movement’ in those village where they are active.

In addition to this you can also help in making the farmers’ lives easier by encouraging them to borrow money only from banks and about Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).

Brothers and sisters, national saint Tukodji Maharaj has written this thing in Gram Gita:

‘Gram Sudharnecha Mool Mantra, Sajjnani Whave Ekatra!

Sanghthan Hechi Shaktiche, Gram Rajya Nirman Kari”!!

It means that the basic formula for reform of the villages is that everyone collectively works through an organisation only then the village-state will be created. This was the same formula given by Mahatma Gandhi and the same thing was followed by Mani Bhai Desai. Today, the collective power of your organisation can open a new door of development for the villages. Today, it is necessary that we take pride in our villages, the villagers should celebrate the founding day, they should have a vision and they should move forward as per that vision. The leadership of those 80 thousand villages where you are active should move forward with a vision. This will be a medium in making a New India.

Friends, the government has continuously been working to bring down the input cost of farming. Today, farmer’s expenditure on farming has come down due to soil health management, due to Neem coating of Urea and due to thrust given to the drip irrigation.

Farmers have been saving the money spent of diesel by increasing the use of solar pumps. Crop production has increased due to use of these modern technologies. The BAIF has long experience in this field that is why your suggestions about what should be done to bring down the cost of farming are always welcome. The more farmers you associate with this movement, the more it will help them save and increase their profits.

Friends, waste to wealth is such a topic which is relevant to the contemporary needs and the challenges of future.

Be it the recycling of agricultural waste or be it use of compost, these things can supplement farmers’ income and benefit the entire village.

Today, nothing is a waste in agricultural farms, everything can be used and it can be converted into wealth.

Similarly, entire village can be made self-dependent in terms of electricity by encouraging the solar power.

There is enough space on the sides of farms and farmers can be encouraged to produce electricity by installing solar panels there. As there are milk-cooperatives across the country, similarly electricity can be produced and sold by having solar-cooperatives.

Friends, now days, you would have seen a small dish installed on almost every house in the villages. This is digital technology that has made things so easy. Earlier there used to be one or two channels, now days, there are hundred or two-hundred channels. Remote is no longer a difficult instrument for them. Even a two-three year old kid changes the channels by using remote.

This kind of likings for the technology will realize the dream of a digital village. It should be a village where most of the transactions take place digitally, all the forms from the loan to scholarship should be filled online, education in schools should be imparted through digital technology and the health services should be connected to digital technology.

In order to realize this dream of a digital village the government is connecting every village body in the country through optical fibre. However, just providing resources and tools will not be enough. Only organizations like yours can make the people capable of using those tools. So can your organization develop at least 500 villages every year into the villages of ‘less cash’? You will see that if you convert 500 villages into ‘less-cash villages’ then a thousand or two thousand nearby villages will automatically start to adopt this system. It will spread from one village to another like a chain reaction.

Friends,

Gandhi Ji’s formula of empowering the country was based on achieving this thing through the empowerment of villages. The BAIF’s desire to serve has brought about the changes in the lives of millions of farmers by following the same formula, it has taught them self-employment. Your organization is a living example of how to get things done by making a solemn pledge.

I’d like to urge you to make some new pledges from the ideas that I’ve placed before you. When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022 then the realization of your solemn pledges will lead to the success of millions and millions of farmers.

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Wednesday, met and interacted with a group of over 70 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries serving in the Government of India. This was the first of five such interactions. 

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as a digital and smart governance, administrative procedures and accountability, transparency, doubling of farmers' income, skill development, Swachh Bharat, consumer rights, environment protection, and building of New India by 2022. 

The Prime Minister said the combination of development and good governance is essential for the welfare and satisfaction of citizens. He said good governance should be a priority for the officers. He emphasized the need for all wings of Government to work in harmony, and synchronisation, to achieve the best possible results. He said all officers must keep the poor and the ordinary citizens in their minds while taking decisions. 

The Prime Minister said the world is looking to India with positive expectations. He said the entire world feels that a successful India is vital for a global balance. He said there is also a strong undercurrent for excellence from the common citizens of India. Youth from humble backgrounds, with very limited resources are achieving best positions in competitive exams and sports. He asked the officers to work to promote this spontaneous upsurge of talent, recalling the spirit and energy that they themselves would have possessed in the first three years of their service. 

The Prime Minister said this was a unique opportunity for officers to deliver their utmost for the benefit of the nation. He emphasized the importance of breaking silos, and efficient internal communication between various departments of the Government. He also underlined the necessity of speed and efficiency in decision making. He said that honest decision making with good intention would always be encouraged by the Union Government. He asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.

                Since yesterday, you all were putting your precious time on the question of what should be there in the country and how. Based on your experiences in your field, you were viewing different aspects of the country from a different perspective.

You must have seen that the government's decision making team or the policymakers are present among us. And I have tried to understand the nuances of the things that you have told me. And I believe that these efforts will be successful. One can understand the way of thinking of the government by being a part of the government structure. We get a 360 Degree View of every subject, problem or any suggestion due to this interaction. And when policies are made, a road map is created to execute these policies, where these things are very useful. Obviously all the things that come to the mind of the Prime Minister cannot be implemented. If this happens then the governance machinery of the country will go haywire. The prime minister also has to do away with some of the ideas. You also know very well, that some of the things that you have suggested shall be used while the rest may not be used. But whatever shall be used will definitely help to transform the earlier mechanisms, policies and laws. You have a different way of presenting your views. You are different in your development. Your activities emphasise upon ‘result oriented outcomes’. The government by and large focuses upon human welfare and public interest. You focus upon what the target was and how much was achieved and how far the progress was made. This is quite natural. But for the government it’s not the progress of the government which matters but of the country. It is the government’s responsibility to see where the poorest of the poor of the country has reached.

We fully understand what everyone thinks. They say – “the Government does not understand what we are seeing every day”; but they are the very people who are not contributing anything. It is in the mind of every citizen. But if you take the person along to solve their problems then you may have noticed that even the way of providing suggestions change. If the government was your client, your way of dealing would have been different. But when the government becomes your partner in business then you would have thought of ways to accomplish tasks in a more serious manner. I only wish that every citizen of this country should feel that this country is his. This country has to move forward with my contribution. There are problems. May be God has not given the people in the Government as much intellect as has been given to me. So he should feel, ‘wherever I am, I should do something about it and contribute to it’.

During our struggle for independence, there wasn’t a single year when a voice of protest was not raised. Constant efforts were made in every era whenever there was an attempt to suppress the people. In those thousand years, there were thousands of people who were ready to die for the country’s freedom. If one was hanged that day, another would be ready to face the gallows the very next day and so on. An environment was being created through these ceaseless efforts for the freedom of the country. And everyone thought that by sacrificing his life he was serving the country and how Mahatma Gandhi had transformed everything. If we understand these things then we can easily understand the way to utilise the years from 2017 to 2022 in the right earnest. And so what did Gandhi ji do? There were lakhs of people who had died for the country. There were thousands who had spent their youth in the Andaman & Nicobar prisons. But Gandhi instilled the desperate feeling to get freedom in every Indian. For example, even if the teacher was teaching, he had to teach with the purpose of attaining freedom. Similarly, if you are engaged in the sanitation job, you should have this feeling that you are doing it for the country's independence; if you are a farmer, you should think that this work is for the country.

Throughout India, this sentiment was aroused in everyone's heart by Gandhi ji that whatever he was doing was for the country. It was difficult for the British to understand this thing. It was easy for the British rulers to shoot a person who took to roads; it was easy to put a person in the prison. But it was difficult to stop a person who was working at his home with this feeling of freedom in his heart. Gandhiji converted this into a mass movement in this manner. And you all know the great results that we got out of it. Every government has tried to carry our country forward. Each government has tried in its own way. But after independence, development could not be transformed into a mass movement. We have to take the country there. We will continue to do this. If every doctor works with the spirit to work hard to solve the problem of malnutrition, to improve child health care, to reduce the Maternal Mortality Rate, Infant Mortality Rate to global standards then no one can stop the country from transforming. Who needs the government then? The government works only as a catalytic agent. The country can progress on its own. Today we are in the year 2017.Seventyfive years have passed since Quit India Movement and 70 years since independence. In 2022 we shall celebrate 75 years of independence.

The country can be elevated to new heights. I want to create such an environment. You can also become a soldier of a modern and prosperous India. You can become a powerful soldier whose name will shine in the world. But we have to do it together by touching upon every issue one after another.

We should have the conviction that we can find a solution to the problems. I was watching your presentations on how to double farmers’ incomes. You have presented very well.

I consider you as my team. I want to take my country forward and I need your help in the process. Let us work together. Your ideas should become a part of my plan and my ideas should help you. In this way, we can bring about a great change.

Now look at a small issue in the Agriculture Sector. Now, we are the people who are always engaged in the discussion of Export and Import. So tell me, our country where agriculture is the mainstay of the economy; whose soul is the rural India; why we are still importing timber? Can the law be changed by the government to double the income of the farmers by encouraging them to plant timbers along the borders of his farm land? He should have the right to cut and sell it. Will my country's timber imports stop or not? Unfortunately we waste so much of land between the two fields by planting useless thorny plants as fences. But if we replace those with timbers then tell me whether the country's timber imports will reduce or not? The land will be utilised to its maximum potential. We can bring about a great change.

We want to double farmers’ income. But we will not be able to do that if we don’t consider Animal husbandry, Poultry farming, fisheries, ornamental fishing in the process. We need to have value addition and need to think of how our agricultural products can capture the world market. The population in the Gulf countries is growing. They have oil but scanty water. No matter how much oil is there, water is essential for survival. And so they have no choice but to import agricultural products. Can’t we study their needs for agro-products? The people associated with agro-economics can provide guidance for value addition of agricultural products and make that product available in those countries in the way they want. If we can give assurance to the Gulf countries of their agricultural requirements, they will give us assurance for our energy requirements. In a way, a win-win situation will be created. I have such a team in front of me which can come out with such new things. The Indian government is organising a global event in November in which food processing will be the focus. We have opened up food processing industry to 100% FDI. Doubling Farmers' income is not just a slogan; we are trying to develop the infrastructure in farm sector keeping that in mind. Annually about one lakh crore rupees worth of agro products like fruit, vegetables or grains, is getting wasted because we do not have proper infrastructure. Now the infrastructure development in itself is a great opportunity to open up employment opportunities. Please tell me whether there will be multiple benefits or not if financial Institutions, private players, people in the real estate and everyone come together for this purpose? So with this approach we are trying to address the requirements of the country. We should expand our business and bring about a change in the country's Quality of Life.

If these things are taken into consideration in the journey of our development, I believe that the desired results will definitely follow. You must have been listening to the discussions since yesterday; this government has taken many important decisions and revolutionary changes have been made.

You must be aware that our farmers had faced a lot of trouble because of delays in getting Urea and if the farmer does not get urea on time then it is useless for him. I remember when I was the Chief Minister I used to write to the Prime Minister about the delays in getting Urea, the quantity required and so on. When I became the Prime Minister, even I received several such letters from the Chief Ministers in the initial 3 months. The police used to even Lathi Charge for urea. Farmers had to queue up for three days for obtaining urea. You must have seen in your televisions long queues outside the banks for 3 days after demonetization but unfortunately our farmers standing in similar queues for getting urea were not shown on televisions. This is where the difference lies in looking at the problems. This government has taken some initiatives. One of the biggest initiatives is rationalizing the price of obtaining gas for production of Urea. Earlier the prices were diverse. Someone used to get the gas at one price and someone else would get it at different terms and conditions. We made similar batches so that everyone could get the benefit through competitiveness.

Secondly, you will be surprised to know how things used to be. If the production capacity was 10 million metric tons and five per cent more was produced, the government used to provide a certain sum of money. So depending on the production the government used to give the money. We came to power and changed all the rules. As a result, today, not only is the government's money saved but the productivity has also increased just because of policy intervention. We later started the concept of Neem-coated urea. There was never any shortage of Urea but it hardly reached the fields. Most of the Urea used to go to the chemical industry because it was subsidized and the industry used to sell the product after value addition around the world. We added Neem coating to Urea. Neem coated Urea will be of no use to the chemical industry, except its use for the soil. Thus, the diversion of Urea for other purposes has stopped. Thus we brought an end to end solution for this problem. I don’t view things in isolation but as a whole. Today if I say something, people won’t have the slightest inkling as to what exactly I intend to do.

When I say that if you have unaccounted money with you, the government has started a scheme, kindly declare your wealth, but even after repeated requests when the declarations are not made, the event like that of 8th November 2016 happens (demonetization). And so we do not do anything in bits and pieces. It is clear in my mind that after one step what the next step should be. Everything is well planned. Therefore, I say that the government has taken many initiatives.

Now tell me whether you want to move towards Digital India or not? We are working on the Optical Fibre Network under Digital India. You will be surprised to know that when I came to power only about 360 villages were connected to the optical fibre network. Now this has reached close to lakhs of villages within 3 years. The changed approach has brought results. Now we want to move towards a less-cash society. It’s not that you make e-payment to your employees and the employees are clueless about going cashless with that money. They need to be taught about the BHIM app. There will be small businessmen who should also be taught. Help them to download BHIM app and there will not be anybody who will still be using cash for transactions. Tell me whether the country will be served or not? Thus, I want your partnership in this work.

Now, there is a culture of exchanging gifts among companies during Diwali. Can we change this approach? Can we make it a habit of giving that gift, which will help illuminating the house of the poor during Diwali? You provide coupons to people for purchasing various products like offering a package of Rs 2000 for buying your products. Why not give coupons for purchasing khadi clothes? I am not saying that the person who receives khadi should wear only khadi clothes. But if you have fifty types of fabric, then let one of the fabrics also be khadi. I am addressing the poverty of the country in a way. I am positively addressing the poor of the country. You will be able to see the change in yourself by doing this. This does not mean that you have to compromise on the quality or your happiness. I will not make any such request to you. But let us create an environment where we also think about the poor people. Now you will be happy to know about our new scheme. Now, if the government wants to make a purchase then there is a long procedure – it is taken on paper; the tenders will be floated, the terms and conditions of the tenders will come out, and then it is to be seen whether the minister's nephew's tender has come or not. The country has experienced several malpractices. Transparency is the need of the hour. Now, any person shall have the ability to supply his product to the government. The government has created a small platform called GeM. I request you to go to that portal and see how all the government departments have put their requirements on the site - 25 napkins, two dustbins, Waste paper baskets, 25 brooms, 100 chairs etc. The full details of the goods along with the standards are put up on the portal and the supplier can be anybody.

The rule of the government is that for any product the departments should go for the cheapest product without compromising the quality. Now we have done away with tenders and everything is available online. You will be surprised to know that only four to six months have passed since the launch of this experiment. Despite this, the government has already made a purchase of about 1000 crore rupees through this GeM portal. And you will be surprised to know that the number of suppliers are 28,000 who have given things worth one thousand crore rupees. Meaning, even small time suppliers were able to supply their goods. By the old system, probably the payment would have been Rs. 1700 crore and the quality of products we would have got, could be anybody’s guess! What I mean to say is that things are changing.

How can we use technology to bring in transparency? Now you might know some people. Suppose the son of your employee is producing some item. You can ask him to get registered in the GeM portal where he could sell his product to the government. This is how we can promote entrepreneurship. How can we change the tourism sector? I have seen that most of your presentations contained this topic on tourism. What is the biggest challenge to the tourism sector? The question is a bit shocking to me. Did we ever think that our psyche is doing so much harm to us? I am not holding you responsible for anything. I am just expressing my thoughts. Last year in my programme ‘Mann ki Baat’, I asked the children going on vacations to upload photos of the places they were visiting with this Hash tag. I was surprised to see millions of photographs on my website. Whenever I get time I go through those photographs. There are so many places in our country which people are getting aware of because of the Hash tag. What is the psyche of the people? Whenever they go to a good place, the first sentence that comes to their minds is that – this place doesn’t seem like India! Now tell me how the tourism will grow? If you do not love your children, then how can you expect the neighbours to love them? Similarly, if we do not take pride in the things we have then what do you expect the others to do? Businessmen come to our country; you might be dealing with the Global Community. How many of you have asked them to stay for 3 more days to savour the beauty of our country? Tourism cannot grow just with the advertisement by the Government. If someone says that he had been to a place and you should also visit it, you would definitely go. There is usually an inbuilt ‘Fear of the Unknown’ in the minds of the tourists. When someone tells him about his experience then that person visits that place fearlessly. We Indians do not have this nature. Now the pharmaceutical companies here offer special tours to Doctors. Is there anyone here linked to a Pharmaceutical company? Well, these companies take them to Singapore or Dubai and other places abroad. They never feel that tours can be made to say a place called Hampi in our country in Karnataka or to Rajasthan. We do not promote our things. Unless we realize that instead of providing artificial enjoyment we should present before the world our heritage. I remember clearly when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat; I had my interests in touring. Sometimes I used to wander in jungles and sometimes in the desert. About 40-45 years ago, when I saw the White Rann of Kutch, it had a great impact on my mind. When I became Chief Minister, I decided that I would make this desert a Tourist Destination. I urge you to visit the Rannotsav website sometime. This festival starts after Diwali and continues for three months. A tent city is formed. You cannot even imagine how the deserts of my country can adorn with such beauty. There is so much rush in this season to visit the White Desert and these days there is a lot of trouble in bookings. Many people plan the board meetings of the company to coincide with Rannotsav. Could anyone ever think that the White Desert could also become a Tourist Destination? As a result the handicraft of Kutch, and a lot of things found a huge market. People started preparing themselves professionally, learning packaging, serving food etc. Tourism is like the riddle - whether the chicken came first or the egg. If tourists come then tourism develops and if the Tourist Destination Develops, it will draw tourists. I used to work in Himachal many years ago. There is a place in Himachal, near Manali. I went to see the place of a very great artist, I am forgetting the name; he was a foreigner –yes it’s Roderick. He was a foreigner but had participated in the movement for freedom. No one visited that place. At that time it was the government of my Party in Himachal Pradesh, so I requested them. I asked them to make it mandatory for the schools to visit this place during their tour programmes. So school buses started coming. Gradually, the tea seller, the water seller, the snack seller started showing up in that place and infrastructure started developing. Later this spot found a place in the Tourist Maps as well. I believe that as the government is taking steps to develop tourism, we all should develop a temperament for the growth of tourism sector. We should insist upon promoting it. And trips to India are not new. Today we have developed the concept of Tourist Circuits which has become very popular. It has been there for a long time now. We had ‘Char-dham’, ‘12 mahadev Jyotirling’, ‘9 Ganesh’ – all similar to the Circuit concept. Our ancestors were well aware of the circuit concept. The infrastructure was also available. We can move ahead with these things. And hence, I believe that tourism has a great potential in job creation. But if we add to these things, our contribution will definitely bring results. I have received several ideas from you and those ideas will definitely be used. But I urge you to not confine the ideas within this room but try these things in your individual capacities, within your industrial circle, within your seller-buyer circle. You can also organise an event there. Together we will do something for the country. Even if I am running this Swachh Bharat campaign, your cooperation is indispensible. The chamber you sit in is excellent, but we don’t feel like stepping inside the industrial area due to unhygienic conditions. Yet we are reluctant to take collective responsibility. That is why it is not cleaned. Wealth from Waste has a great potential for developing it into a full-fledged industry. How can we encourage new entrepreneurs in developing this sector? This will also be a solution to our environmental problem. You must have seen how the farmers in Haryana and Punjab that burn the crop waste after the cultivation of crops. This impacts the quality of air in Delhi. Thus, the farmers of Punjab and Haryana are blamed for Delhi’s pollution problem. Now a young man from Nagpur bought the same Waste, cow dung and made small blocks out of it and sold those blocks for using in the funeral. 20% less wood is now needed to burn the body. The Waste was thus put to best use. The time required for burning the body was reduced. So, how to encourage such things?

The second problem in our country for which we need a solution is that we are only focused upon the Global requirements and ignore the domestic needs. Then we say that a particular product is available for Rs5000; but mine costs only Rs4000; so you should buy my product. We really need to change this approach. Rather can’t we think of providing a product that fulfils the needs of our country? The day we come up with that product you will see the huge market here and later we can also entertain the same in the global market.

Have we ever thought of how many things our country has to import? Can I save my country’s revenue by stopping imports of at least five things by 2022? I will not allow the import of these five things to my country. This is my devotion to country that I will make these five things within my country so that the money does not go out. Why not? You can definitely do this. You tell me, you were discussing about electronic imports etc. We have to make health care in India cheaper. Can’t we make equipment required for health care for say kidney patients, the dialysis machine indigenously? Can’t our entrepreneurs come up with these things? If we try to develop things keeping in view the present day problems, the market will automatically develop. And we should think in this direction. And I believe that the suggestions given by you will be helpful for the government. Gradually, we want to institutionalize these thoughts and ideas. You can add even more people to it. We can think of more outcome oriented suggestions. But this is just the beginning. By sitting with this group I would like to add the people interested in any particular field to the concerned department of the government so that the permanent interaction continues. Let's get together for the country. I am happy that in your presentations there was no such suggestion that contained the interest of the industry or the trader. All suggestions were in the interest of the country. This fulfils my dream of 2022. Therefore, we want to emphasize on these things.

There are many new attempts to bring change and with your greater involvement, I think the results will come sooner. I want to congratulate Mr. Arvind Panagaria, Vice Chairman of the Niti Aayog. Now see, how things work in mission mode. He lived in the United States for 45 years and had never thought of coming to India. The family was also settled there. He is a great friend of mine so I requested him to come here and at once he agreed to head the NITI Aayog. He has developed the NITI Aayog over the three years and today has changed the earlier Planning Commission. His contribution was huge. And although he is leaving the country next week but still he is doing this work diligently. He is present among us. This is not a small thing. Otherwise when one has to leave, one needs to start packing one month before. So even though he has to leave for America, he is still engaged in this work with his heart and mind into it. I think there is no shortage of such people in our country. And trusting such people, we are moving ahead with the dream of 2022. Now Arvind ji is leaving so I want to convey my best wishes to him. He has done an excellent work. This country will always remember him and his service. Arvind ji was the core of this programme. He has been with you for two days. He has an introvert nature so he doesn’t give his introduction to anyone so early. This is also a quality. He doesn’t keep himself in the forefront. But I think that a good effort gives a good result and you will always be associated with it. You must have a direct connection to the government. Your suggestions should come. You might have seen the presentation yesterday. I can connect with anyone anywhere with technology. I always use technology. Once again I express my gratitude to you for your contribution.

Thanks a lot.

                आप लोग, कल से अपना बहुमूल्य समय, देश में क्‍या हो, कैसे हो, क्‍यों हो, उस पर मंथन कर रहे थे। अपने-अपने क्षेत्र के अनुभवों के आधार पर आप देश को अलग-अलग नजरिए से देख रहे थे।  अलग अलग पहलुओं को देख रहे हैं।  

आपने देखा होगा यहां एक प्रकार से सरकार की जो Decision making Team होती है जो नीति निर्धारक लोग होते हैं वे सब यहां बैठे हैं। और आपकी हर बात को मैं बारीकी से मैंने सुनने समझने का प्रयास किया है। और मुझे विश्वास है कि ये प्रयास रंग लायेगा। सरकार में जो सोचने का तरीका होता है। सरकार में रहते हुए एक चीज का एक पहलू नजर आता है दूसरा पहलू तो कभी रह जाता है। इस Interaction के कारण इस बातचीत के कारण एक प्रकार से 360 Degree View हर विषय के सम्बन्ध में, हर समस्या के संबंध में, या हर सुझाव के संबंध में उभरकर के आता है। और इसलिये जब नीतियां बनती हैं तब या तो नीतियों को execute करने के लिये रोड मैप बनता है तब ये चीजें बहुत काम आती है। ऐसा तो नहीं हो सकता है कि प्रधानमंत्री के मन में जितने विचार आयें , वो सारे के सारे विचार सरकार में लागू हो जाएं। वरना तो देश चल ही नहीं सकता। प्रधानमंत्री को भी अपने विचारों को छोड़ना पड़ता है। आपको भी ये बात भलि-भांति पता है कि आपने जितना बताया है हो सकता है उसमें से कुछ चीज काम आए, कुछ चीज काम न आए। लेकिन जो काम आएगी उससे अवश्‍य पहले की स्थितियों में, पहले की नीतियों में, पहले के Approach में बहुत बड़ा बदलाव आएगा। चीजों को प्रस्‍तुत करने का आपका अपना एक अलग तरीका होता है। आप अलग प्रकार से आपका Development हुआ रहता है। आप जिस जिम्मेवारी को लेकर काम कर रहे हैं उसमें Result Oriented outcome oriented आपकी सारी गतिविधि रहती है। सरकार की By and large कल्याण राज की कल्पना से काम चलता है। जनहित सर्वोपरि  होता है। जनसूखा कार्य सर्वोपरि होती है। आपकी सोच के दायरे में होता है कि मेरी कंपनी ने क्या Target set किया था और क्या पाया। मेरी कंपनी कितनी आगे बढ़ी। और कितने पीछ रह गये इससे आपको कोई लेना देना नहीं होता है आपको अपनी कंपनी कितनी आगे बढ़ी वो होता है। और बहुत स्वाभाविक है। लेकिन जो सरकार में है उसके लिये सरकार कहां रही उसके बजाय ज्यादा देश कहां पहुंचा उसकी जिम्मेवारी रहती है। देश के आखिरी तबके का व्यक्ति कहां पहुंचा ये उसका दायित्व बनता है।

हम पूरी तरह समझते हैं कि हर किसी के मन में विचार होता है कि यार सरकार को इतना समझ नहीं आता है हम रोज देख रहे हैं ऐसा होता है लेकिन ये बस ऐसे ही लोग हैं कुछ काम नहीं कर रहे। ये हर देशवासी के मन में है। लेकिन अगर आप उसको साथ लेकर चलो उसको भी समस्या से जोड़ो। आपने देखा होगा कि उसका सुझाव देने का तरीका भी बदल जाता है। अगर आप सरकार के साथ एक क्लाइंट के रूप में बैठे होते तो आपके बात करने के तौर तरीके अलग होते। लेकिन जब आप सरकार में पार्टनर के रूप में बैठे हैं तो आपको लगता है नहीं यार हम वो बाते बताएं जो कर सकते हैं। इस सारी प्रक्रिया का मेरा यही उद्देश्य है कि इस देश के हर नागरिक को लगना चाहिए ये देश मेरा है। इस देश को मुझे आगे बढ़ाना है। समस्याएं है। कठिनाइयां हैं। ईश्वर ने जितनी बुद्धि हमें दी है उतनी शायद सरकार में बैठे हुए लोगों को नहीं दी है। लेकिन फिर भी मैं जहां हूं वहां से मुझे उसमें कुछ जोड़ना है।

हमारे देश में आप लोग देखिये आजादी का आंदोलन वैसे अगर हमारे सैकड़ों साल की गुलामी देखें इन सैकड़ों साल में एक वर्ष ऐसा नहीं गया है कि हिन्दुस्तान किसी न किसी कोने में से आजादी के लिये आवाज़ न उठी हो। जो भी आतताई होंगे उनके खिलाफ सर ऊंचा करने का प्रयास हर कालखंड में हुआ है। अगर कोई हजार साल की गुलामी मानें तो हजार साल हजारों उस पूरे Thousand year के अंदर हुआ है। लेकिन आजादी के लिये मरने मिटने वालों की कमी नहीं थी। आज एक को फांसी मिली तो कल दूसरा मैदान में आता था। दूसरे को फांसी मिली तो परसो तीसरा आता था। एक श्रृंखला चल रही थी देश को आजादी दिलाने के लिये। और आजादी के वातावरण को बनाने का एक निरंतर प्रयास चल रहा था। और हर किसी को लगता था कि मैं अपना बलिदान देकर के मैं देश की सेवा कर रहा हूं। महात्मा गांधी ने क्या बदल दिया और मैं समझता हूं अगल इस बात को हम समझ लें तो 2017 To 2022 हमें कहां जाना है कैसे जाना है क्यों जाना है किसके भरोसे जाना है किसके लिये जाना है इसके सारे सवालों का जवाब अपने आप मिल जाएगा। और इसलिये गांधी ने क्या किया। व्यक्तिगत रूप से देश के लिये मर मिटने वालों की कोई कमी नहीं थी लोगों को फांसी के तख्त पर चढ़ा रहे थे। अंडमान निकोबार की जेलों में अपनी जवानी खपा रहे थे। लेकिन गांधी ने हर इंसान को आजादी का शरीक बनाया। हर नागरिक को। एक ऐसा माहौल बनाया कि टीचर हो पढ़ा रहे हो मन में भाव लो कि मैं आजादी के लिये देश के इन बच्चों को पढ़ा रहा हूं। तुम सफाई का काम पहले भी करते थे आज भी करते हो। लेकिन तुम सफाई का काम कर रहे हो देश की आजादी के लिये तुम किसान हो खेत जोतते हो। खेत में काम करते हो पहले भी करते थे। अब भी करते हो लेकिन मन में भाव भरो कि मैं देश के लिये किसानी कर रहा हूं।

 

पूरे हिन्दुस्तान में हर किसी के मन में ये भाव पैदा किया गांधी ने कि वो जो काम कर रहा है वो देश के लिये कर रहा है.. देश की आजादी के लिये कर रहा है। और अंग्रेजों के लिये इस बात को समझना बड़ा मुश्किल था। कोई रोड पर निकल कर के सामने खड़ा हो जाए फिर गोली चलाना अंग्रेज के लिये सरल था। कोई सामने खड़ा हो जाए पकड़ के जेल में डाल देना सरल था। लेकिन वो अपने घर में ही काम कर रहा है लेकिन वो कह रहा मैं तो आजादी के लिये कर रहा हूं। उसको कैसे करें। गांधी ने आजादी को मास मूवमेंट में Convert कर दिया। और मास मूवमेंट में Convert किया तो आपने देखा कि इतना बड़ा परिणाम मिला। आज हमारे देश में आगे बढ़ने के लिये हर सरकार ने प्रयास किया है। जिसकी जहां जिम्मेवारी रही होगी उसने प्रयास किया है। लेकिन आजादी के बाद development ...यह मास मूवमेंट नहीं बना पाया।  हमें देश को यहां ले जाना है। हम ये करके रहेंगे। अगर मेरे देश में इतने डॉक्टर हों अगर डॉक्टर के मन में spirit हो कि अब न्यूट्रीशन की समस्या के समाधान के लिये हम मेहनत करेंगे। चाइल्ड हैल्थ केयर के लिये हमारा ये कॉन्ट्रीब्यूशन होगा। नई पीढ़ी को हम ऐसे ले जाएं। माता मृत्यु दर ..शिशु मृत्यु दर इसको हम ग्लोबल स्टैंडर्ड के बराबर में लेकर आएंगे। अगर ये भाव पैदा हो तो कौन कहता है कि देश में बदलाव नहीं आ सकता। कौन कहता है कि सरकारों की जरूरत है। सरकार सिर्फ एक कैटलिक एजेंट के रूप में काम करती रहे। देश अपने आप चल पड़ सकता है। और इसलिये आज हम 2017 में है जबकि, Quit India के 75 साल हुए हैं और आजादी के 70 साल हुए हैं। 2022 आजादी के जब 75 साल करेंगे।

देश को यहां से यहां ले जाएंगे। ये मुझे माहौल बनाना है। इस मंथन से मुझे आप लोगों की बहुत जरूरत है कि आप जहां हैं वहां जिन लोगों के बीच में हैं। आप भी एक आधुनिक भारत के सैनिक बन सकते हैं। एक समृद्ध भारत के सैनिक बन सकते हैं। एक विश्व के अंदर अपना नाम ऊंचा कर सके सामर्थवान बनें ऐसा भारत के सैनिक बन सकते हैं। लेकिन इस प्रकार से मिल बैठकर के हम एक एक चीजों को हाथ लगाएंगे हमें रास्ते मिलते जाएंगे।

हमें लगेगा हां मैं ये कर सकता हूं। इस समस्या का समाधान...। मैं यहां देख रहा था कि किसान की आय डबल कैसे हो कई विषयों में आपने चर्चा की और बहुत अच्छे अच्छे प्रेजेंटेशन भी आपने दिये हैं बड़े अच्छे तरीके से प्रस्तुत किये। प्रजेंटटेशन का क्वालिटी तो अच्छा था ही था ।

लेकिन मैं इसलिए नहीं कह रहा हूं, लेकिन मैं कह इसलिए  रहा हूं कि मुझे इस टीम को ..मेरे लिये आप मेरी टीम हैं। मेरे देश को आगे ले जाने के लिये मुझे आपका साथ चाहिए। मैं और आप कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर काम करें और ये तब होगा, जब हमारा मीटींगे होंगी। आपकी सोच मेरी योजना का हिस्सा बनें मेरी सोच आपके पुरुषार्थ का एक आधार बन जाए आप देखिये कैसा बड़ा बदलाव आ सकता है|

अब देखिये Agriculture Sector में एक छोटा सा विषय है। हम अर्थजगत के लोग हैं Export import की भारी चर्चा कर रहे हैं। मुझे बताइए जो देश कृषि प्रधान हो जिस देश की आत्मा गांव हो जिस देश की पूरी चर्चा गांधी जी के जीवन में गांव से जुड़ी हुई हो। और वो देश टिम्बर Import करता है। मुझे बताइए कहां से कहां पहुंच गए। क्या कारण है कि हम टिम्बर Import करते हैं। क्या हमारी इस फार्मर की इनकम डबल करने में क्या सरकार में कानून बदले जा सकते हैं कि उसके खेत के अगर जहां पर बॉडर होती है। वहां टिम्बर की खेती करेंगे। और उस टिम्बर को उसको काटने का बेचने का उसको हक मिले। क्या मेरे देश का टिम्बर Import करना बंद होगा कि नहीं होगा। मेरे देश का किसान हमारे देश का एक दुर्भाग्य है कि दो खेत के बीच में हम इतनी जमीन बर्बाद करते हैं बादा लगा करके ...fencing लगाकर के यानि ऐसे पौधे लगा देते हैं, कांटे लगा देते हैं। एक इसकी बर्बाद होती है एक उसकी बर्बाद होती है। लेकिन अगर वहीं पर टिम्बर लगा दें तो आप मुझे बताइए देश का टिम्बर Import कम होगा उसकी जमीन का maximum उपयोग होगा और सरकार के कानून बदलने से कितना कितना बड़ा बदलाव लाया जा सकता है। सरकार में चर्चा चल रही है।

कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि हम फार्मर की इनकम डबल करना चाहते हैं। लेकिन हम Animal husbandry पर सोचेंगे ही नहीं पौल्ट्री फॉर्म पर सोचेंगे ही नहीं। हम फीशिरीज़ पर नहीं सोचेंगे। हम ornamental fishing पर नहीं सोचेंगे, तो हम एक टोटल जो एक डिजाइन बनानी है वो नहीं बना पाएंगे। हमारे लिये आवश्‍यक है वैल्‍यूलेशन एडिशन कैसे हो, हम दुनिया के मार्केट में हमारा कौन सा एग्रीकल्‍चर प्रोडक्‍ट है जो टारगेटेट मार्केट को पकड़ सकता है। पूरी गल्‍फ कंट्रीस, वहां पॉप्‍यूलेशन बढ़ रही है, ऑइल है पानी नहीं है। ऑइल कितना ही क्‍यों न हो, जिंदगी जीने के लिए पानी जरूरी है। और इसलिए उनके लिए एग्रो प्रोडक्‍ट इंपोर्ट किये बिना कोई चारा नहीं है। क्‍या उनकी रिक्‍वायरमेंट का सर्वे करके हम हमारे किसान को उस एग्रो प्रोडक्‍ट के लिए जाए और हमारे एग्रो इकॉनोमिक्‍स के साथ जुड़े हुए लोग ही या तो एग्रो वैल्यू एडिशन  के साथ जुड़े लोग मिल करके उस प्रोडक्‍ट को वहां पर पहुंचाए उस रूप में बना सकते हैं क्या। ये अगर हम चेंज करें, गल्‍फ कंट्रीस को हम एक प्रकार से उसकी जो एग्रीकल्‍चर रिक्‍वायरमेंट उसका एसोरेंस दे दे वो हमें हमारी एनर्जी रिक्‍वायरमेंट का एसोरेंस दे दे एक प्रकार से win win  सिचुएशन के दिशा में आगे बढ़ सकते हैं कि नहीं बढ़ सकते। और इसलिये यहां एक ऐसी टीम है मेरे सामने जो इस प्रकार की नई चीजों को लेकर के आ सकते है। अभी भारत सरकार नवम्बर में एक ग्लोबल लेवल का बहुत बड़ा इवेन्ट कर रही है जिसमें mainly फूड प्रोसेसिंग पर हम बल दे रहे हैं। दुनिया की बहुत बड़े मात्र हैं। आपने देखा होगा फूड प्रोसेसिंग में एफडीआई को हमनें 100 प्रसेंट ओपन अप कर दिया है। फार्मर की इनकम डबल हो ये सिर्फ नारा नहीं है। उसी प्रकार से फार्म सैक्टर में इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर आज हमारे यहां सालाना करीब करीब एक लाख करोड़ रुपया ...यह छोटी अमाउन्ट नहीं है भारत जैसे देश के लिये। एक लाख करोड़ रुपया का हमारा एग्रो प्रोडक्ट फल हो फूल हो सब्जी हो, अनाज हो, वो बर्बाद होता है। क्योंकि हमारे पास sufficient इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर नहीं है। अब वो इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर भी अपने आप में रोजगार देने के लिये बहुत बड़ा अवसर है। अगर फाइनेन्सियल इन्स्टिट्युशन्स, प्राइवेट प्लेयर्स जो रियल इस्टेट के दुनिया के लोग हों। अगर वो इस प्रकार की चीजें बनाएंगे। आप मुझे बताइए कि मल्टिपल बेनिफिट होगा कि नहीं होगा। और इसलिये हमारा एप्रोच ... हमारा एप्रोच क्या हो। हम देश के रिक्वायरमेंट को एड्रेस करें। हम अपने बिजनेस को expand करें और हम देश की क्वालिटी ऑफ लाइफ में बदलाव लाने के लिये मूलभूत चीजों को निर्माण करते चलें।

अगर इन चीजों को लेकर के हम अपनी विकास की यात्रा को ले जाते हैं, तो मुझे विश्वास है कि हम जो चाहते हैं वो परिणाम प्राप्त कर सकते हैं। और सरकार में आपने बारीकी से देखा होगा। कल से आप यहां जब तक बैठें हैं कई विषयों पर आपको चर्चा भी आई होगी। इस सरकार ने कई महत्वपूर्ण निर्णय लिये। जिन महत्वपूर्ण निर्णयों ने मूलभूत बातों में बड़ा परिवर्तन लाया है।

 

अब आपको पता होगा पहले हमारे देश में किसान यूरिया के लिये उसको बड़ा टेंशन रहता था। समय पर यूरिया मिलेगा या नहीं मिलेगा। और किसान को समय पर यूरिया नहीं मिलता है तो यूरिया मिलना बेकार होता है। और इसलिये मुझे याद है जब मैं मुख्यमंत्री था मैं प्रधानमंत्री को चिट्ठी लिखता रहता था कि मेरे यहां इतना समय यूरिया मिले ..कितना मिले... फलाना मिले ...और जब मैं प्रधानमंत्री बना तो शुरू के तीन महीने में मुझे जो सबसे ज्यादा चिट्ठियां आईं मुख्यमंत्रियों की वो यूरिया की आई। हमारे देश में यूरिया के लिये पुलिस का लाठी चार्ज होता था। यूरिया के लिये किसानों को तीन तीन दिन कतार में खड़ा रहना पड़ता था। तीन तीन दिन डी मोनाटाइजेशन के बाद बैंको के बाहर खड़ी कतार को तो टीवी पर आपने बहुत देखा। मेरा देश का दुर्भाग्य है कि यूरिया के लिये खड़े रहे हमारे किसान को टीवी पर नहीं दिखाया। ये फर्क है। समस्याओं को देखने समझने का। इस सरकार ने कुछ initiative लिये। एक सबसे बड़ा initiative.. यूरिया के फैक्टरी को गैस चाहिए। हमारे यहां गैस की वैराइटी की policies थी। किसी को एक दाम पे गैस मिलता था किसी को एक ..टर्म्स एंड कंडिशन से मिलता था। हमने सबको rationalize कर दिया। एक ही प्रकार का बैच बना दिया ताकि सबके कॉम्पीटिशन के लिये सुविधा हो।

दूसरा हमारे देश में बड़ा.. गहरे जाओगे तो बड़ा आश्चर्य होगा की ये कैसे चलाया होगा। अगर आपका कैपासिटी है 10 लाख मेट्रिक टन की और आप पांच परसेंट ज्यादा प्रोडक्ट करते हैं, तो आपको सरकार इतना पैसा देती थी। आप इतना प्रोडक्ट करते। और इसका परिणाम ये आया था कि एक प्रकार से ये बड़ा ही क्या हो गया होगा आप जानते हो। हमनें आकर के उसके सारे नियम बदल दिये। आज परिणाम यह है कि सरकार के पैसे तो बचे लेकिन बीस लाख टन यूरिया उसी कारखाने में से उसी व्यवस्था से एक्स्ट्रा पैदा होने लगा। प्रोडक्टिविटी बढ़ गई। Just policy intervention के कारण। बाद में हमनें यूरिया नीमकोटिंग किया अब आप में से कोई कैमिलकल वाले यहां नहीं होंगे। ऐसा मैं मानकर के कहता हूं दानी तो हैं यहां। लेकिन यूरिया खेत में कम जाता था, कैमिकल इंडस्ट्री में ज्यादा जाता था। क्योंकि उसको subsidised यूरिया मिल जाता था। और वैल्यू एडिशन कर के प्रोडक्ट बना कर के दुनिया को बेचता था। हमनें यूरिया का नीम कोटिंग कर दिया। नीम कोटिंग करने के बाद एक ग्राम भी यूरिया किसी और काम में आ ही नहीं सकता, सिवाय कि  जमीन में डालो। और इसका परिणाम ये आया कि जो सारा साइफन होता था। चोरी होती थी किसी और काम में चला जाता था। वो सारा खत्म हो गया। आज देश में कहीं यूरिया की मांग नहीं है। कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि हम किस प्रकार से एक एक चीज को एंड टू एंड सोल्युशन के नेचर के हैं। मैं स्वभाव से चीजों को टुकड़ों में नहीं करता हूं। एक बार उसको हां चीजें Progressive Unfoldment होता है। आज मैं एक चीज कहूंगा तो सामने वाले को जल्दी पता नहीं चलेगा कि मोदी यहां से कहां उठा कर ले जाएगा।

 

मैं जब कहता हूं कि भई आपके पास पैसे जमा हैं सरकार स्कीम लाई है डिक्लेयर करिए, डिक्लेयर करिये, डिक्लेयर करिये नहीं करिये फिर 8 नवम्बर आ जाती है। और इसलिये कोई भी बात हम टुकड़ों में नहीं करते। मेरे मन में साफ होता है कि हां इस बात के बाद ये आएगा। लेकिन किस को कितना बताना है वो तो और इसलिये मैं कहता हूं कि सरकार ने कई initiative लिये हैं।

अब मुझे बताइये कि डिजिटल इंडिया की तरफ जाना चाहते हैं कि नहीं। डिजिटल इंडिया के अँदर हमारा ऑप्टिकल फाइबर नेटवर्क का काम चल रहा है। आप हैरान होंगे जब मैं आया था तब तीन सौ साठ गांव थे शायद। जहां पर ऑप्टिकल फाइबर नेटवर्क पहुंचा था। अब हम करीब लाखों में पहुंच चुके हैं। तीन साल के भीतर भीतर तो एप्रोच बदला परिणाम लाए। अब हम कम कैश सोसाइटी की ओर जाना चाहते हैं। आप मुझे बताइए आपकी कंपनियां 2022 देश को यहां ले जाने के लिये एक काम ...हमारा पूरा कारोबार हमारे employee का भी पूरा कारोबार यानि ऐसा नहीं कि उसको हम ई-पेमेंट दे देंगे और बाद में लोग कैस निकाल कर के कारोबार करेगा। ऐसा नहीं। उसको भी हम सिखाएंगे तुम BHIM एप डाउनलोड करो और तुम अपने मोबाइल फोन से और वहां पर छोटे मोटे व्यापारी होंगे उनको भी सिखाएंगे। तुम भीम एप डाउनलोड करो और हमारे यहां कोई ऐसा नहीं होगा, जो cash ट्रांजेक्शन करेगा। मुझे बताइए देश की सेवा होगी कि नहीं होगी। और इसलिये मुझे ये भागीदारी चाहिए। हम कैसे करें।

अब कभी कभी देख रहा हूं इन दिनों देखिये आप, आप लोग ये दीवाली के दिनों में ये आपकी कंपनियां गिफ्ट देती है .. वो देनी पड़ती हैं। भले थोड़ा देर  से ही सही लेकिन। क्या हम बदल सकते हैं approach कि भई हम वो गिफ्ट देने की आदत बनाएंगे, जिसके कारण दिवाली में गरीब के घर में दिया जले। आप लोगों को Purchasing के कूपन देते हैं। जाइए 2000 रुपये का माल ले सकते हैं हमारा। आप खादी का क्यों नहीं दे सकते। आप गिफ्ट पैकेट खादी का क्यों नहीं दे सकते ? मैं ये नहीं कहता हूं जिसके घर में गिफ्ट पैकेट जाएगा तो वो खादीधारी बन जाएगा। जरूरी नहीं खादी धारी बनने की। लेकिन आपके पास पचास प्रकार के फैब्रिक है, तो एक खादी भी हो सकता है। कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि हमारे सारे कारोबार में ...मैं कोई ऐसी चीज जोड़ रहा हूं, मेरे सारे employee मिलकर के कि जिसके कारण मैं देश की गरीबी को किस प्रकार से एड्रेस कर रहा हूं। मैं देश के गरीब को पॉजिटिवली एड्रेस कर रहा हूं क्या। आप देखिये अपने आप में बदलाव शुरू हो जाएगा। इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि मैं क्वालीटी compromise करूंगा। मेरे सुख में कम करूं मैं आपसे ऐसा कोई आग्रह नहीं करूंगा। हम एक वातावरण बनाएं कि हम हमारे गरीब से गरीब लोगों को साथ लेकर चलें। अब आपको जानकर के खुशी होगी। सरकार में अगर कुछ खरीद करना है, तो कागज पर कितनी प्रकार की कार्रवाई होती है। टेंडर निकलेगा ..टेंडर के टर्म्स एंड कंडिशन निकलेंगे फिर टेंडर भरने वाले आएंगे फिर देखना पड़ेगा कि मंत्री जी के भतीजे का टेंडर आया की नहीं आया। भांति भांति की चीजों से देश अनुभवी है। टेंडर खोलना की नहीं खोलना अब स्थिति ठीक नहीं है तो reject कर दो। ये सारी बातें आप भली भांति परिचित हो, देश परिचित है। कोई चीज हमारे देश में.. ट्रांस्प्रेंसी है जी। बेईमानी भी सबको पता है। अब क्या इतनी बड़ी सरकार में कोई छोटा इंसान भी अपना प्रोडक्ट सप्लाई कर सकता है कि नहीं कर सकता। कोई बहुत बड़ा टेंडरिंग सिस्टम से वो गुजरेगा तब करेगा क्या। सरकार ने एक छोटा सा प्लेटफॉर्म बनाया जेम (जीईएम) (GeM).. आपसे मेरा सबसे आग्रह है कि आप उस पोर्टल पर जाइए चैक कीजिए और सरकार के सभी डिपार्टमेंट अपनी रिक्वायरमेंट उस पर लिखते हैं कि हमें ये चीज चाहिए। हमें 25 नेपकीन चाहिए, हमें दो dustbin चाहिए, वेस्ट पेपर बास्केट चाहिए, हमें 25 झाड़ू चाहिए, जो भी 100 चेयर चाहिए। अपना लिखते हैं। सप्लायर कोई भी अपने पास किस प्रकार का माल है उसका स्टेंडर्ड क्या है क्वालिटी क्या है उसकी पूरी डिटेल रखता है।

सरकार का नियम बना है कि उसमें जो क्वालीटी compromise किये बिना सस्ता जो है उसको लेना है कोई टेंडर वेंडर कुछ नहीं सबको ऑनलाइन एवेलेबल कोई भी देख सकता है इसको। आप हैरान होंगे अभी तो इस प्रयोग को चार- छह महीने हुए हैं। और सरकार में भी जितना spread होना चाहिए उतना नहीं हुआ है। उसके बावजूद भी एक हजार करोड़ रुपयों का सरकार का परचेज इस जेम के द्वारा हुआ है। वन थाउजेंड करोड़ रुपीज़। और सप्लायर कितने आप चौंक जाएंगे। 28,000 सप्लायर ने मिलकर के एक हजार करोड़ का दिया है ये। मतलब हर एक के नसीब में कितने छोटे लोग होंगे ये। छोटे छोटे लोगों ने अपनी चीजें पहुंचाई है। और परिणाम ये आया है कि यही हजार करोड़ का माल अगर पुरानी सरकार की टेंडरिंग से हुआ होता तो शायद पेमेंट 1700 करोड़ का हुआ होता। और हजार करोड़ में से क्या आया होता वो तो भगवान जानें। मेरा कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि चीजें किस प्रकार से बदल रही हैं।

टैक्नॉलॉजी का किस प्रकार से उपयोग करके transparency लाई जा रही है। अब आपके भी ध्यान में कुछ लोग होंगे। इवन आपका कोई एम्पलोई होगा उसका बेटा कोई छोटी सी चीज प्रोडक्ट करता होगा। उसको कहो भई तुम जरा जेम में रजिस्ट्री करवा दो। देखो सरकार में तुम लिखो तुम्हारा कोई माल चला जाएगा वहां। हम entrepreneurship को कैसे बढ़ावा दे सकते हैं। हम कैसे बदल सकते हैं। अब हमारे यहां टूरिजम, आपके हर प्रेजेंटेशन में tourism की बात आ रही है। tourism के सामने सबसे बड़ी समस्या कौन है। सवाल मेरा बड़ा चौंकाने वाला है। कभी हमने सोचा हमारा psyche हमारा कितना नुकसान कर रही है। मैं ये आपको नहीं सुना रहा हूं हम सब मंथन कर रहे हैं, मैं भी आप ही के साथ मेरे विचारों को एक मंथन के रूप में प्रगट कर रहा हूं। मैंने पिछले साल एक कार्यक्रम किया था मेरी मन की बात में जो करता हूं। उसमें मैंने वेकेशन में बच्चों को कहा था कि आपलोग जाते हैं इस हैशटैग से आप जो भी प्लेस में गये हैं देखने के लिये उसकी फोटो भेजिये। मिलियन्स ऑफ मिलियन्स फोटोग्राफ मेरी वेबसाइट पर है। मिलियन्स ऑफ मिलियन्स और मैं हैरान था मैं कुछ देखता था कभी कभी जब समय मिले, हमारे देश में ऐसी ऐसी जगह है, ऐसा प्राकृतिक दृश्य है, जो गए हैं उसने फोटो भेजी तो पता चलता है कि भई वो तो हैश टैग के कारण कइयों ने उसको देखा भी होगा। हम लोगों की psyche क्या है, किसी अच्छी जगह पर जाएं और मन को भा जाए। तो हमारा पहला वाक्य क्या निकलता है, यार लगता नहीं है हम हिन्दुस्तान में हैं। अब मुझे बताइये tourism कहां से बढ़ेगा। अगर आप अपने बच्चों को घर में प्यार नहीं करते हो, तवज्जो नहीं देते हो मोहल्ले वाले कैसे देंगे मुझे बताओ। अगर हम हमारी चीजों का गर्व न करें, आपके पास buyer आते होंगे सेलर आते होंगे। ग्लोबल community से आपका नाता होगा। आप में से कितने होंगे जिन्होंने उनको कहा होगा आप आए हैं लेकिन तीन ज्यादा निकाल कर आइए। इस विकेंड में तो ये जगह देख कर आइए। Tourism तो हम, देखिये Tourism सरकार के एडवरटाइजिंग से नहीं होता है। कोई एक कहे यार मैं गया था तुम हो आओ। आप जरूर जाते हैं। क्योंकि Tourism में एक फीयर  ऑफ unknown इनबिल्ट होता है। फीयर  ऑफ unknown इनबिल्ट होता है टूरिस्ट के दिमाग में। लेकिन जिस दिन उसको कोई कहे कि मैं गया था। फिर वो पूछता नहीं कि वहां क्या करना है वो अपने आप चल पड़ता है। हम हिन्दुस्तानियों का ये स्वभाव नहीं है। हमारे यहां कोई फार्मेसी वाली कंपनी... कोई है क्या फार्मेसी वाले। चलिये अच्छा है मैं बोल पाऊंगा...। फार्मेसी वाले डॉक्टरों को विशेष टूर कराते हैं। आपको भी मालूम है क्यों कराते हैं। लेकिन कहां ले जाएंगे सिंगापुर ले जाएंगे, दुबई ले जाएंगे। उनको नहीं लगता कि चलो भई हमारे देश में हम्पी करके एक जगह है चलिये हम चलते हैं कर्नाटक जाते हैं छह चीज देख कर आएँगे, राजस्थान जाते हैं पांच चीज देखकर आएंगे मैं लेकर जाऊंगा। हम अपनी चीजों को बढ़ावा नहीं देते हैं। जब तक हम और हम ये न सोचें कि हम दुनिया को वो टैक्नॉलॉजी वाला tourism कराएँ। Artificial   एंजॉयमेंट का एनवारमेंट उसके बजाए हमारी जो विरासत है जी अगर उस विरासत को दुनिया को हम परिचित करवाएं। तो दुनिया इसे देखने के लिये पागल है जी। मुझे बराबर याद है मैं गुजरात में जब मुख्यमंत्री था तो गुजरात में मेरे अपने शौक तब में राजनीति में भी नहीं था मैं ऐसे जंगलों में भटकता रहता था। तो तभी में रेगिस्तान में रहने के लिये चला गया था। तो मैंने कच्छ का जब White Rann देखा और मेरे मन को एक बड़ा ही एक अलग सा इम्पैक्ट हुआ। मैं ये चालीस पैंतालिस साल पहले की बात कर रहा हूं। जब मैं मुख्यमंत्री बना तो मैंने तय किया कि मैं इस रेगिस्तान को टूरिस्ट डेस्टिनेशन बनाऊंगा। आप से मेरा आग्रह है कि कभी रणोत्सव वेबसाइट पर जाइए। दिवाली के बाद वो शुरू होता है। तीन महीने चलता है। पूरा टैंट सिटी बनता है। आप कल्पना नहीं कर सकते हैं कि ऐसा सौंदर्य मेरे देश के रेगिस्तान में होता है। पूरा White Desert और इन दिनों काफी मात्रा में बुकिंग में परेशानी होती है इतना rush रहता है। एक नया experience होता है। कई लोग अपनी बोर्ड मीटिंग कंपनी की रणोत्सव के साथ जोड़ देते हैं। कोई किसी ने सोचा था कि एक रेगिस्तान व्हाइट डेजर्ट हैं वो भी कभी टूरिस्ट डेस्टिनेशन बन सकता है। उसके कारण कच्छ का हैंडिक्राफ्ट, कच्छ की और चीजें एक प्रकार से एक बहुत बड़ा मार्केट खड़ा हो गया वहां। फिर लोग भी अपने आप में प्रोफेशनली तैयार होने लगे। पैकेजिंग सीखने लगे। कैसे उनको खाना खिलाना परोसना वो सब आ गया उनको। ये टूरिजम ऐसा है कि पहले मुर्गी कि पहले अंडा। टूरिस्ट आएंगे तो tourism डेवलेप होगा, अगर टूरिस्ट डेस्टिनेशन डेवलेप होगा टूरिस्ट आएंगे। इसी का झगड़ा चलता रहता है। मैं बहुत साल पहले हिमाचल में काम करता था। हिमाचल में एक स्थान है मनाली के पास ...एक बहुत बड़े आर्टिस्ट थे विदेश के मैं नाम भूल गया उनका रॉड्रिक तो मैं उनका स्थान देखने गया। किसी जगह बैलगाड़ी में वहां पहुंचे थे आजादी के आंदोलन में भी भाग लिया था विदेशी थे। जगह है लेकिन कोई टूरिस्ट नहीं आता था। मैं वहां हिमाचल में मैंने कहा सरकार हमारी पार्टी के लोग थे सरकार में तो मैंने उनको रिक्वेस्ट किया मैंने कहा आप नियम बनाइए। स्कूल जो टूर प्रोग्राम बनाती है। उसमें यहां आना कम्पलसरी कर दीजिए। तो स्कूल की बसें आने लगीं। आने लगीं तो चना-चबेना बेचने वाला आने लगा, पानी बेचने वाला आने लगा, चाय बेचने वाला आने लगा, धीरे – धीरे करके इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर डेवलेप होने लगा। रिक्वायरमेंट को डेवलेप करने वाले हो गए। बाद में लोगों का भी टूरिस्ट डेस्टिनेशन मैप में वो जगह बन गई। हमें कोशिश करनी पड़ती है जी। और मैं मानता हूं कि सरकार के द्वारा जितना tourism डेवलेप हो सकता है उससे ज्यादा tourism एक टेम्परामेंट हम बनाएं। हम इसको बढ़ावा देने के लिये बल दें। और भारत में यात्राएं नई चीज नहीं थी। आज Circuit टूर हैं टूरिजम में Circuit Concept  बहुत पोपुलर है। हमारे देश में सदियों पहले था चारधाम क्या था Circuit ही तो था। 12 महादेव ज्योतिरलिंग क्या था Circuit ही तो था। नौ गणेश क्या था Circuit ही तो था। हमारे पूर्वजों को Circuit पहले से मालूम था । और इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर भी available था। हम इन चीजों को लेकर के आगे बढ़ सकते हैं। और इसलिये जॉब क्रियेशन से लेकर के मैं इस बात से सहमत हूं कि tourism में बहुत बड़ी ताकत है। लेकिन अगर हम इन चीजों को जोड़ें, तो अपने आप में हमारा कॉन्ट्रिब्यूशन होगा तो परिणाम भी बहुत बड़ा मिलेगा। कई विचार आपकी तरफ से आए हैं उन विचारों का जरूर उपयोग होगा। लेकिन मेरी कोशिश ये है कि विचार सिर्फ इस कमरे तक ही सीमित न रहे, आप भी अपने अपने यूनिट में अपने अपने सेलर बायर के बीच में अपने इंडस्ट्रियल सर्कल में इन चीजों को आगे बढ़ा सकते हैं क्या। आप भी वहां कोई इवेंट कर सकते हैं क्या। आप मिलकर देश के लिये हम भी कुछ करेंगे। हम आपके देखा है जो आपके इंडस्ट्रियल स्टेट हैं, मैं कितना ही स्वच्छता का अभियान चलाऊं। आप जिस चैम्बर में बैठते हैं वो तो बढ़िया होती है, लेकिन वो इंडस्ट्रियल एरिया में पैर रखना पसंद न करें ऐसा हाल होता है जी। लेकिन हम सामूहिक जिम्मेवारी नहीं लेते हैं। इसलिये वो सफाई नहीं होती है। वेस्ट में से वेल्थ एक बहुत बड़ा entrepreneur का विकास है जी। हमारे देश में नये entrepreneurs वेस्ट में से वेल्थ हम कैसे तैयार करें। उनको कैसे हम प्रोत्साहित करें। और बहुत कुछ हो सकता है हमारे पर्यावरण की समस्या का समाधान हो सकता है। अब नागपुर में एक नौजवान उसने छोटा सा काम किया। उसने हमारे यहां आपने देखा होगा हरियाणा, पंजाब के अंदर खेती के बाद जो फसल बाद में जो वेस्ट रहता है उसको जलाते हैं। तो दिल्ली के अंदर जो पर्यावरण का जो प्रोबलम होता है तो गालियां Punjab  और हरियाणा के किसानों को पड़ती है। नागपुर के अंदर एक नौजवान ने उसी वेस्ट को खरीद लिया, गोबर खरीद लिया, उसमें से छोटे – छोटे ब्लॉक बना दिये और फ्यूनरल के अंदर जलाने के लिये वो ब्लॉक बेचता है। 20% लकड़ी की जरूरत, बॉडी उसी से जल सकता है। और टोटल जो रिक्वायरमेंट होती है उससे 20% कम रिक्वायरमेंट होती है। वेस्ट का बेस्ट हो गया फ्यूनरल में जो टाइम खराब होता था बंद हो गया। पहले दो घंटे में बॉडी जलता था अब एक घंटे में जल जाती है परिवार वाले जल्दी फ्री हो जाते हैं। एक स्टार्टअप भला क्या कर सकता है, कहने का मेरा मतलब है कि हम ऐसी चीजों को बढ़ावा कैसे दें।

हमारे देश में दूसरा हमारा problem जो है, जिसका हमें समाधान चाहिए। हम ग्लोबल जो रिक्वायरमेंट है हम ग्लोबल जो दुनिया देखते हैं , हम उस प्रोडक्ट की ओर जाना चाहते हैं। फिर हमारा संतोष ये होता है कि देखिये उनकी पांच हजार में मिलती मेरी चार हजार में मिलती है तुम मेरा खरीदो। सचमुच में हमारे एक approach बदलने की आवश्यकता है। हमारे देश की जो तकलीफें हैं, इसका सोल्युशन वाला कोई प्रोडक्ट में दे सकता हूं क्या। जिस दिन हम वो प्रोडक्ट देंगे। आप देखिये हमारे यहां बहुत बड़ा मार्केट है। जिसको हम कैप्चर कर सकते हैं। और हम उसी ताकत को ग्लोबल मार्केट में भी एंटरटेन कर सकते हैं।

क्या हमने कभी ये सोचा है कि हमारे देश को कितनी चीजें इम्पोर्ट करनी पड़ती है। क्या मैं 2022 तक मेरे देश को कम से कम इन पांच चीजें इम्पोर्ट करने से मेरे देश को बचाऊंगा। मेरे देश में पांच चीजें इम्पोर्ट नहीं होने दूंगा। मेरी ये देश भक्ति है, पांच चीज ऐसी बनाऊंगा मेरे देश का बाहर पैसा नहीं जाएगा। क्यों नहीं कर सकते। कर सकते हैं। आप मुझे बताइए अभी आप कहते थे इलैक्ट्रोनिक वगैरह इम्पोर्ट कीजिये उसकी चर्चा कर रहे थे। हेल्थ केयर की इलैक्ट्रोनिक इक्विप्मेंट भारत में हैल्थ केयर को सस्ता करना है, तो हमारे ग्रास रूट  लेवल पर उपयोगी चीजें अब किडनी के पेशेंट के लिये जो रिक्वारयमेंट है क्या वो मशीन हम नहीं बना सकते क्या। डायलिसिस हम नहीं बना सकते। क्या हमारे entrepreneur इस प्रकार से बाह नहीं आ सकते क्या। हमारे देश की समस्याओं को एडजस्ट करने का टेम्प्रामेंट ये हमारी नई जनरेशन में अगर बनता है, तो मार्केट अपने आप खड़ा हो जाएगा। और मुझे लगता है कि हम इस दिशा में सोचें। और मुझे विश्वास है आप लोगों ने जो सुझाव दिये हैं वो सुझाव सरकार में काम आएँगे। धीरे धीरे मेरे मन में विचार जो चल रहा है ये कोई वन टाइम इवेन्ट नहीं है। हम इसको इन्स्टिट्युशनलाइज करना चाहते हैं। आप हैं आप में और भी नये लोग जुड़ सकते हैं। इसका और अधिक आउटकम ऑरियेन्टेड उसकी रचना भी की जा सकती है कई सुझाव आ सकते हैं। लेकिन एक शुरुआत है। अलग – अलग ग्रुप के साथ इस प्रकार से बैठना और धीरे धीरे जिसमें इसकी रुचि होगी मैं सरकार के उस डिपार्टमेंट के साथ भी उसको जोड़ना चाहूंगा। ताकि परमानेंट इंटरेक्शन होता रहे। और हम मिल कर के देश के लिये करें। और मुझे पूरा भरोसा है, कि आप व्यापार जगत में आप मुझे खुशी हुई कि आप के किसी प्रेजेंटेशन में उद्योग या व्यापारी के हित के कोई सुझाव नहीं थे। सारे सुझाव देश हित के थे। यही मेरा 2022 का सपना पूरा कर देता है....इसलिये हम इन चीजों को बल देना चाहते हैं।

कई नये परिवर्तन लाने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं क्योंकि जितना आप जुड़ोगे उतना मैं समझता हूं कि परिणाम मिलेगा। मैं आज विशेष रूप से हमारे नीति आयोग के वाइस चेयरमेन श्रीमान अरविंद पनगरिया का बधाई करना चाहता हूं। देखिये अभी वो, देखिये मिशन मोड में काम कैसे होता है। वे 45 साल अमेरिका में रहे। कभी हिन्दुस्तान आने के लिये सोचा नहीं था। परिवार भी वहां सेट हो गया। मेरी उनसे दोस्ती थी। मैंने कहा ठीक है भई बहुत कमा लिया कुछ समय हमें दे दीजिये। मेरे एक शब्द पर वो आए। तीन साल इस नीति आयोग को उन्होंने चलाया बढ़ाया और आज एक प्रकार से पहले के प्लानिंग कमिशन से आमूलचूल बदल दिया इस नीति आयोग में। बहुत बड़ा उनका कॉन्ट्रिब्यूशन था। और मजा है कि इस हफ्ते के बाद वो वापस अमेरिका जा रहे हैं छोड़ छाड़ के लेकिन आज भी इसी काम को लगन से कर रहे हैं। हमारे बीच में बैठे हैं। ये छोटी बात नहीं है जी। वरना अब जाना है तो एक महीना तो पैकिंग में लगता है। अमेरिका वापस जाना है तो कुछ नहीं बड़े मन से इस काम में लगे हुए हैं। मैं समझता हूं हमारे देश में ऐसे लोगों की कमी नहीं है। और इन्हीं के भरोसे 2022 का एक सपना लेकर के हम चले हैं। मैं अरविंद जी, अब जाने वाले हैं उनको मेरी तरफ से बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। उत्तम काम किया है उन्होंने। ये देश हमेशा हमेशा याद रखेगा। उनकी सेवाओं को याद रखेगा और इस कार्यक्रम के मूल में अरविंद जी ही रहे हैं। आपके साथ मिलकर के दो दिन से बैठे हुए हैं। बड़े साइलेंट नेचर के हैं जल्दी परिचय भी नहीं होता है किसी से कि अरविंद जी है कौन। ये भी एक क्वालिटी है। वो अपने आपको बहुत पीछे रखते हैं। लेकिन मैं समझता हूं कि एक अच्छा प्रयास अच्छा परिणाम और आप लोग हमेशा के लिये जुड़े रहेंगे। सरकार के साथ आपका सीधा संबंध आना चाहिए। आपके सुझाव आने चाहिए। मैं खुद तो अब easy available हूं कल शायद आपको प्रजेंटटेशन दिया होगा। मैं टैक्नॉलॉजी के साथ किसी से भी कहीं पर भी जुड़ सकता हूं। मैं इसके साथ लगा रहता हूं। मैं फिर एक बार आप लोगों का इस कॉन्ट्रिब्यूशन के लिये आपका आभार व्यक्त करता हूं। बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद।

                The Prime Minister today interacted with Young CEOs at the ""Champions of Change - Transforming India through G2B partnership"" initiative organised by NITI Aayog at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra. Today was the Prime Minister's second address in this series, following his interaction with young entrepreneurs last week. 

Six groups of young CEOs made presentations before the PM on themes such as Make in India; Doubling Farmers' Income; World Class Infrastructure; Cities of Tomorrow; Reforming the Financial Sector; and New India by 2022. 

Appreciating the new ideas and innovations envisaged in the presentations made by the CEOs, the Prime Minister thanked them for the valuable inputs and time devoted to ideation for the benefit of the country. 

He said the key decision making team of the Government has listened carefully to the presentations, and will surely benefit in their policy-making, from the 360 degree view of issues that have been presented. 

The Prime Minister said people's participation is an important element of governance. Similarly, he said, this attempt at CEOs partnership with Government is aimed at enhancing their participation towards welfare of the people, and the nation. 

Recalling India's freedom struggle, he said Mahatma Gandhi made all Indians, soldiers for freedom, even as they continued to do their own work. Hence, he helped the freedom struggle become a mass movement. 

The Prime Minister said that today, development too, must become a mass movement. He said that a spirit should be created, whereby we all set targets for our contribution to India, by 2022. You are my team, and we need to work together to take India forward, the Prime Minister told the CEOs. 

Giving the example of value addition in agriculture, the Prime Minister said a multi-pronged approach is essential for achieving desired objectives such as doubling of agriculture incomes. Emphasizing the importance of food processing, the Prime Minister said lack of infrastructure is leading to huge losses in the agriculture sector. 

The Prime Minister said the Union Government has taken a number of decisions that have brought about fundamental transformation. He gave the illustration of decisions taken for urea availability and production - such as gas price pooling; remuneration for excess production etc. This led to additional production of 20 lakh tonnes of urea. He said Neem-coating of urea ended its large scale diversion. 

He said that the Government wants to move towards making India a less-cash society. He asked CEOs to partner with Government to build momentum in this regard. 

Similarly, he said that on occasions such as festivals, Khadi could be promoted through gifting etc - and this would greatly help the poor. He said an atmosphere must be created to take the poor along in every sphere of life. 

The Prime Minister gave the example of Government e-Marketplace (GeM) to show how small traders are competing successfully in provision of supplies to the Government. He said 1000 crore rupees have been transacted through GeM so far and 28,000 suppliers have contributed to this platform. 

The Prime Minister said Indians must take pride in their own country. He said each one should develop a temperament to promote tourist destinations within India, spontaneously among their contacts. 

Giving the example of ""waste to wealth"" entrepreneurs, the Prime Minister said that this can help achieve the objectives of Swachh Bharat and clean environment. He said the aim of entrepreneurs and business should be to provide products which solve simple problems faced by people in the country. 

Several Union Ministers and senior Government officials were present on the occasion.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress of two key schemes related to the agriculture sector - Soil Health Cards; and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. 

The Prime Minister was informed that 16 States/UTs have completed the first cycle of Soil Health Cards distribution, and the remaining States are likely to complete the same within weeks. 

Reviewing the progress, the Prime Minister said that appropriate checks should be undertaken for variation, both within a sampling grid, and across different soil testing labs. This would help ensure quality in the reports, he added. 

The Prime Minister also emphasized that soil health cards should be printed in the local dialect of the area, so that the farmers are able to read and understand them easily. 

Encouraging the rapid adoption of latest technology, the Prime Minister said that soil testing should eventually be possible through hand-held devices. He urged officials to explore the possibility of involving start-ups and entrepreneurs in this exercise. 

On Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the Prime Minister was informed that in the Kharif season of 2016, and Rabi season of 2016-17, claims of over Rs. 7700 crore have already been paid, and over 90 lakh farmers have been benefited. 

Officials also said that latest technology including smartphones, remote sensing, satellite data and drones are being used for speedy data collection with regard to crop insurance claims. 

Senior officials from Ministry of Agriculture, NITI Aayog and PMO were present during the review meeting.

                Friends, today my job was to listen, to understand you people. Listening to you, understanding to you is necessary for this reason also, and I used to say it publicly and it is my conviction also, because it’s such a large country and if the government is in the illusion that it is running this country then it’s difficult to say what will be the fate of the country. There was a poet – Shail Chaturvedi in the earlier generation. He had written a very good satire, he wrote: once a politician was travelling in a car, he told his driver that he would drive the car that day. The driver replied that he would get off the car. The politician asked him why? The driver responded that sir: this is a car not the government that anyone can run. That is why this is not a new concept in our country. If we go back a little, not much, just 50 years then we will realize that the government’s role, it’s presence was minimal. The social structure was such that it could be used to place emphasis on the facilities for the society. Can anyone tell me that these libraries built at several places, were these built by the governments? Several leaders of the society, as per their interest, used to build these facilities. Even education, education in our country was completely changed when money, business and commercial interests were associated with it. However, there was a time when the entire education system was developed by the people engaged in the social charity activities and it was mostly done with a sense of dedication. Even water was supplied to the areas facing water shortage under a social structure. If we travel towards Rajasthan or Gujarat then the water ponds that we see were not built by the governments. Common public used to run these projects and those who were the leaders of the society they used to do these things. And that is why that the governments may be creating the system but the development was always done through the various organs of the society, it was done due to their strength, their power and their dedication. Time has changed and we will have to adjust our systems in the changed times. This is an effort in that direction that there will be someone in the society with money power, someone with knowledge power, someone with experience and someone will have the dedication to selfless service. These powers that are scattered, if they are arranged in one thread then it can create such a garland that can bring more glory to mother India. So this is that effort to figure out how to connect such powers of the society? 

If you keep a keen eye on the functioning of the government then there are many things that are not reported in media because there are several things that may not be newsworthy, but there are several others that are newsworthy. You must have seen how these Padma awards – Padma Shri, Padma Vibhush – were decided by the government. If you had made an attempt, then you would know the way. If a politician recommends a name, if a government functionary, that too is a politician, recommends a name, so most of the time those doctors who treat politicians, they are considered eligible for Padma awards. 

We carried out a small reform, we said nobody’s recommendation is needed for this. Anyone can send details online for himself or for someone else. If somebody has read something in newspaper, then he can send its clipping saying that look: I came to know about such a person. And plenty of such information was received by us. This young team was not publicly aware about someone like this, there were not aware about those faces but they started looking into the available material, they shortlisted them. Then the committee that was formed which did this work and you must have seen that such people are getting Padma Shri these days that were unknown heroes. You must have seen that Padma Shri was given to a Muslim Boy from Bengal this time. What the matter was? His own mother had died and what was the reason? Medical treatment was not available. His mother’s death shook his conscience and he started carrying patients to doctors on his motor cycle. He worked very hard, he incurred the expenditure of petrol himself. And he became famous in the entire area as Ambulance Uncle. He was doing this selfless service in those areas of Assam and Bengal. It came to the notice of the government and such people were given Padma Shri. I mean to say that in every corner of the country everyone has something useful and the government’s effort is to connect that. We want to connect the government with common people by bringing it out of the files. Our effort is to have this two-way approach and as a result we have created a system. 

It’s possible that each one of them might feel that had he been named it would have been better, it would have been better had he been invited. There may be several suggestions but this was the first attempt. It was completely a government effort and therefore it can have several shortcomings. There could be shortcomings in our way of thinking as well but I’d like to institutionalize this. How to institutionalize this? How to convert into a yearly event? And that can be taken as an extension of the government, as you people have created 6 groups, and each group focused on 5 different topics, focused on separate topics. Now this idea is coming to my mind whether these groups can be permanently attached to the concerned ministry. Those who worked on digital, if they offer their time then I can create a group of those people with the concerned ministry, with the concerned officers looking after the work of Digital India in the government. They should get together every month to discuss new things because as the list here informed the people, see this feeling that I don’t know this, I don’t know what is digital, this is not confined only to the common man, this thinking is present in the government as well. In government digital means: procurement of hardware. In government, digital means replacing the flowerpot with a modern laptop so that we look modern if a visitor comes. So this is the thinking in the government, people in the age group of 50-55 come to the central government, your brain is like that of a person below the age of thirty, I wanted to link the two. This is its beginning. And it’s a matter of satisfaction for me that the team that is with me today, a team of secretaries, ministers, suppose if it is a team of 200 people that constantly interacts with me but not as a Prime Minister but I spend my team with them as a colleague. And after the experience of the last three years I can this thing that as a farmer ploughs his field he doesn’t know about the rain, doesn’t know when it will come, doesn’t know about what kind of crop or about its output, if crop is harvested then whether he will get the correct price in the market or not; but he keeps ploughing his field, similarly I have thoroughly ploughed the minds of my 200 people. And I can say this thing with experience that today they are eager, they are enthusiastic to accept any seed idea and they are totally ready to associate themselves with that. And I think this in itself is a big change. My senior team in the government is trying to look for opportunities instead of becoming an obstacle in looking for, in understanding and accepting every new thing. And it has encouraged me to associate you people with me. If that obstacle was there then I wouldn’t do it, I wouldn’t even think about it. Because you people yourself would have become the biggest reason for negativity six months after leaving the place. Then I’d say myself that: just leave it, they all are like this only, they all only just talk. But I am able to muster this courage as I am aware that my main team is very enthusiastic about accepting new things. All the things that you have said, you had discussion with them yesterday, even today these people are present here, some of them are present here. So we have to take forward this things, we have to prolong this effort. 

And I will urge you people that there is a large number of people among you who have met face to face for the first time. You might have heard of each other, must have read, and should have known through social media that there is someone who is working in this direction. Now you got familiar with each other, and a team is being created. It’s possible that the team will not have all the 212 members, but those groups of 30-35 people must have become familiar with each other that what is the way of thinking of the other person, what’s his/her contribution, you would have evaluated all these things. 

You would know all these things if somebody wasted other’s time and also if someone was doing networking for his business. You would have come to about all these things and that is why you know all the pros and cons. And I am confident that you will focus on these topics in your own way; don’t change the topic; if something new happens anywhere in the world then don’t divert because of that. Will you continue to add new things, keep adding new things to your area of work? You will modify that, sharpen that and make it more focussed, and these are the ideas. But can you prepare a road map with the ideas? What resources are required for the achievement? What will be the institutional arrangement? The government functions under some rules, if the rules are required to be changed then how the rules will be amended, what are the rules that are required? Government works on the basis of paper work. Nothing can succeed in the government that is not based on papers, what you can do in this regard? How you can connect these things? Could anyone of you take the lead that lets sit together somewhere after a month? See, you can make a very big contribution; you can create a digital platform in your own way. Someone from your team only should lead this thing and invite new people through that platform in your own way. May be you conduct a debate, arrange a conference through Google Hangout once in a month, you may try to meet once or twice in a year. And if you do all these things and continue to deliberate then you will have the strength to give things on time to the government. And when things are done on time then they lead to very big changes. 

Sometimes, the government set up has its own difficulties and it has its own merits as well. You can provide support despite those difficulties. And in our country, it’s not like that we require some extra-ordinary things. Small things can lead to very big changes. And you will have to try this, if you look at the functioning of the government then you will see that so many small things have been done that have changed the complete systems. In case of such a simple thing, you tell me whether the citizens of this country should trust his government or not? The straight answer is yes: you should trust your government. 

But the government trusts elected corporator, it trusts elected MLA, it trusts a gazetted officer. It was a law that if you have a certificate and you want to apply somewhere then you will have to visit his house to get it certified and he will just stamp it without even looking at it. A boy sits outside and he keeps stamping on everyone’s documents by taking money. And after getting it certified you send it to the government. After coming to the power I asked what is the use of this thing? Let them self-certify it, let them self-attest it, we removed that requirement. It’s a small thing but it conveys a very big message that I have faith in people of my country and no intermediary is needed. But when your final interview is conducted or a decision is to be taken then you show the original documents that day. And you will find thousands of such things in the three years of this government that have changed things. See, the issue of corruption was discussed here and Kuleen was saying that if we correct the judiciary then everything will be corrected. Kuleen can do this thing. 

See, we keep jewellery or cash in the family, we put a lock to protect it. Is that lock is meant to protect from the thief, protect from the robber? They have the power to take away the entire locker; he has the power to break open your lock. It is not to deter him. That lock is meant to prevent our kids from going on the wrong path. You create such systems so that your kids don’t develop the wrong habit of taking something out of the locker and use it for immoral things outside the home. We develop these systems for self-discipline. Unfortunately, corruption has been institutionalised. You are not able stop it till the time you develop a counter institutional arrangement. 

See, there are so many middlemen in our country, they also need livelihood. That is also an occupation and those who have been left without that occupation they are making so much noise these days: we don’t have any work, don’t have any work. Several such people visit the house of poor people and ask them: just pay 50 thousand rupees, we will arrange the job of a peon for your son; pay just 20 thousand rupees and we will arrange a temporary job, this kind of middlemen keep roaming around. 

After coming to power we decided that in class III and class IV, can anyone tell me that what is the logic of interview? And what kind of psychology has been developed in the world to assess people, someone just enters the room from this side and there is a panel of 3 people and he passes from there in 30 seconds, they just see someone, if they have time then ask question saying: okay, good and the interview is finished. 

I have not heard of this kind of scandal anywhere so far. It means that some irregularity was there. After coming to power, this government has decided this thing; more than 65% of government employment was in these categories. I have abolished all the interviews, the computer will decide on the basis of your merit list and those who will top the list will get the job. It’s possible that between 2 to 5% undeserving people can get the job but in the previous interview based system the number of such persons was 80%. 

I mean to say this is a government that is working on institutional arrangement so that even if a person is of slightly dubious character then the system will take care of it. Sometimes it is possible that people may do something wrong but procedures become useful in saving the situation. In a way today’s world is like providing an App for where there is a gap. Apps have become ubiquitous and in a way interface is getting eliminated and dubious people for whom cheating others is a natural thing are getting into this field. They will do all sort of things in one App and next month they will develop another App for their survival. But despite these apprehensions, this technological revolution is leaving a lasting and acceptable impact on human life. Today, there is no resistance technology. And those who say that they are not able to figure out this technology most of them are men not women. See, the most modern technological equipment will be immediately launched in the market; it reaches in the kitchen as a favourable item of the women. All the women, including illiterate women, even the domestic helps, they know how to operate the oven, how to operate other things, they become familiar with all the technology. 

User friendly technology has transformed the lives. Can the use of technology in the governance change the way the government functions? You people are from diverse fields but one thing is certain: innovation is life. If there is no innovation, then it’s stagnation and there is filth where there is the stagnation. Changes can be brought about through innovation alone. You are in that field, are you promoting the innovation, if somebody is doing the marketing of handicraft products, but has he taught that handicraft artisan to modify his work as per the global requirement with the help of new technology? But if he keeps training them, then we can say, those common people, poor people, those who work in the field of handicraft, in a way you can call it their vocational training, their skill training or technological training, be it understanding of the market, if you train them a bit then they give better results. Even if we inspire a Bamboo furniture maker to manufacture furniture as per the market requirement, as per the requirements of the changed time and as per the comfort of the user then he will automatically get that opportunity. 

We should not equate our rural economy, the entire rural economy only with the farming, there is lot more in rural economy other than farming. How we can strengthen this decentralised system? There was a time in our country when the ironsmith of the village was able to meet the needs of the entire village; there was no need to look for things outside the village. A cobbler of the village was able to requirement was able to meet the requirement of entire village and there was no need to look outside the village. But the economy gradually changed in such a way that the Tatas became the biggest ironsmith and Bata became the biggest cobbler and the village was in the loss. So the change that has come about, the change is not a bad thing but how we integrate the decentralised system with it? If we are able to integrate this then we will create a power, we will develop a system that will be used in sustaining the country’s economy. Have you....the start-up, this start-up is not a fashionable thing. You must have seen that that there is a different kind of start-up world for digital software but the other start-ups that have emerged, they have found the solutions for daily problems and they have targeted the rural base. 

Around a year ago, I had visited Sikkim. Sikkim is the first organic state in India. Very few people would be aware about this. The entire state is organic. They have developed the entire state as organic one by continuously working for 13-14 years. And all our Himalaya states have the potential to develop organic state capitals. When I visited Sikkim, I visited Sikkim for their organic festival. It was an event to dedicate Sikkim to the country as an organic state. 

I got to meet two youth there – one guy and one girl. They had gone there straight away after passing out from IIM Ahmadabad. When we were introduced then I thought that they would have come there as tourists. When I enquired them they responded in negative, they told me that they had been staying there for the last six months. When I asked them what they were doing there, they said: we are working in the direction of global marketing of local organic products and our business is growing rapidly in short span of time. 

See, this is the new world. I mean our start -ups have tapped these things. How we can empower them, strengthen them, how to add new things in them? Waste to wealth. You cannot imagine that how big this waste to wealth sector is of Indian economy. There is technology in it, innovation is in it, it has recycling, it has all the things and it is necessary for the country. And if we strengthen it, recycling is not new to India; we were accustomed with these things since ages. But due to changes the intermediate link snapped. Now we will have to all these things in an organized manner and if we do all these things then we can bring about the change. 

Education, this is true that in the field of education campus placements take place from IIMs. One crore, two crores or three crores, employers hire students by giving this much money. Can’t we dream that the teachers should also get campus placement and they also fetch one crore, two crores, three crore or five crores. It’s possible, it’s very much possible. You meet any India, the richest or the poorest, the most educated or the illiterate and just ask them one question: what is the goal of their life? You will get a common answer: good education to their children. You ask anyone, ask your driver what does he think, he would say: sir, somehow I want to give good education to my kids, I have spent my life time as driver but I want to make him successful. 

Sahib, I ask to many people, he may be a driver or a liftman, I mean I ask them whether they are under debt or not? They say: sir, we have taken loan. I asked them why they took the loan. He borrowed the money to send his kids to good schools. It means that if there is a great demand for something in our country then it is for the best teachers. We should develop these best teachers and common man should feel that becoming a teacher is very respectable thing and he can make big contribution through this. Some new models are emerging, plenty of new models, practical and very good models are emerging for this and technology can play a very big role in this thing. 

We launch so many satellites and take pride in it. But there were several such transponders that were hanging unutilized in the air. After coming to power we broke those silos, we brought together, space, education and technology sector. Recently, I have dedicated 32 transponders to the education sector alone. And they can deliver education to you, to your homes free of charge for kids. It means technology can help us in providing quality education without dilution, without diversion to common man, to the poorest of the poor. 

How we can use technology to bring about changes in the quality of education? If change comes to the quality of education from the bottom then such pressure will become applicable on teachers that they will have to change, this situation is going to be created soon. And that is why this is government’s effort to engage people like you, those who have a different world view, who have a sixth sense, who have excitement, enthusiasm, innovations, thinking and ideas. This is my effort how to connect these things with the government and this is a part of that effort. 

Similarly, you people and countrymen like you, many people, you see this neither my thinking nor the government’s thinking that we can create a New India through government schemes. Unless more than 1.25 billion citizens resolve about New India, unless they decided their role in New India and they don’t fulfill that on the basis of self-initiative till that time this will work not finish. 

And that is why it should be our endeavor and it is my expectation from you people that wherever you are, will you tell these things to your people? You may have 20 employees, 50, 100 or thousand employees will you ever ask about these things by sitting with them that look, by 2022, we want to take our country to that place, what responsibility can you take? What can you do? We can create this environment that everyone can do a lot. 

Sometimes I remember that when I was not in politics there was a big industrialist, he mostly used to lead Gandhian life, used to be in the selfless service mode, one of his family member was associated with Ram Krishna Mission and I also relations with that family because of my association with Ram Krishna Mission. So he once purchased an old decrepit closed mill. Why was that closed? It was closed due to strikes and the issues created by unions. So once I asked him: why did you take this risk? And what is the result, what happened? He gave me a simple answer, he said: “We just bought it and I started visiting that place from the day one and I had decided that for the six months I would go there regularly. And I used to have my lunch in the labor canteen there. I used to sit there and have my meal there. This small decision of mine changes the thinking of the workers towards me. They did not look at me as the owner and I didn’t look at them as workers. I used to eat the same thing on their table whatever they used to eat and this brought about a psychological change that they became my family members and they worked so hard that within six months that the failed factory turned profitable.” 

I mean to say that whether you ever, please also ask your colleagues that whether they have ever gathered the 12, 15 or 18-year-old children of your workers, the children of small time workers? Have you told inspirational things to kids of your workers? You see, as soon as you connect with their kids, you will see that they will be dedicated to you for the rest of their lives whether they get increment or not whether they get the bonus or not. I want to bring about these changes. I want to bring about these changes. You tell me that the insurance schemes launched by the government of India on a premium of one rupee per day, there is an insurance scheme that is one rupee per day, Government of India has given such a good package for your employees, it’s such a good product, if you deposit 500 rupees in their bank account, in their fix deposit then it will pay their yearly insurance premium. And if some mis-happening takes place in his life then both these are insurance products, two and two, four lakhs rupees will automatically reach to that poor person’s family. 

These government schemes that are directly related to your workers, can you encourage these schemes? You must have seen that our Gaurav, he would have told you about the digital platform of the government. Many of you would be from the digital field but have not entered in this particular area. Can you push the government by entering into this area in large scale? Can you become a partner in driving the government? I think as we want to move into the direction of change, I think we can move with that much more power in that direction as much more we connect. And whatever we are, we are the citizens of India. In whatever office we are, in whatever system we are, whichever shop we are sitting in, whichever industry we are running, but collectively all of us are one India. It is my effort to fill one 1.25 billion Indians with these feelings and I need your support in this thing. 

It’s correct that whatever things I think of I can do all of them because I am the Prime Minister, it’s not true. I myself will have to navigate through the system. Therefore, it is possible that 40 ideas out of total 59 ideas given by you may not click but even if 10 of your ideas are taken forward then it will be your invaluable contribution to the country. And our efforts should continue with this feeling and despair should not be there. 

Friends, one may think that a lot of discussion takes place, we think a lot but what I said, what you said, none of it was acted upon, but a lot of things that have been acted upon are said by you, said by many others and due to these things these changes are taking place and we have to work like this. It’s possible that despite very good ideas and suggestions the system may not have the capacity to accept them but gradually its capacity to digest, to accept will increase then good schemes will come forward and they will be accepted, if you associate yourself with us with this feeling. 

And I want to develop this thing into institutional mechanism, yearly thing so you are going to give us feedback for its further improvement. Later, you can give your suggestions and ideas through email. You can also give suggestion regarding the people, you can also give suggestion on this program but I’m confident because I came here yesterday evening as well, I got to meet with all of you and even today I got the opportunity to know the ideas of all of you that in how many new ways you can think of things and present them. 

Whatever things are there in the government, like I conducted a small experiment. I conducted an experiment of organizing Hackathon. It was done with college students and we invited students from all the IITs. More than 40 thousand students participated in the first round. I asked the government departments to prepare a list of those difficulties, those problems faced by them for whom they did not have a solution. Initially there was resistance. The resistance was like this that I’m a secretary, I’m a joint secretary, I’m a director, how can I tell these are the problems for which I don’t have solution, it will be embarrassing for us. So initially it was difficult to tell about these things. However, my office and I relentlessly pursued the issue, finally they shortlisted 400 such issues the solutions for which was yet to be found. Earlier they had the feeling that there was no problem. Then I gave those issues to the students and asked them to organize a Hackathon and find solutions for them. And they worked non-stop for 40 hours in their university campus, 40 thousand Indian students, purely in the age group of sixteen to eighteen and they applied their mind. You will be happy to know that they gave us wonderful solutions. Railway people next day called them for the meeting the next day and implemented some of the things in the railways by adopting them. All the departments have tried to incorporate that solution in their functioning. 

If you ask the father of the 16-18-year-old youth of our country about what does his ward do, the father will give 10 minus mark, but the same youth can be so useful for the country. And it is my effort in the work of these 40 thousand students. You also have that capability. And I don’t think that there is any difference between me and you in terms of patriotism. We all have equal amount of patriotism, in each one of us, in our thoughts, we all have this feeling that the country should progress. And there are plenty of opportunities for work. 

And it is my belief that if we work collectively then the results will be outstanding. And once again to you people, because people say the time is priceless, this may not be the case for others but it is certainly for the rich people. And despite that you spared your time, spared your precious time for that I express my heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the government and I hope that you will remain associated with us. We would keep taking forward our stories. We can meet again as per the topic, as per the region, we can meet in different ways. But we can take things forward. My best wishes to all of you. Thank you.

                Friends, आज मेरा काम आप लोगों को सुनने का था, आप लोगों को समझने का था। आप को सुनना और आपका समझना इसलिए जरूरी है कि मैं सार्वजनिक रूप से भी ये कहता रहता हूं और ये मेरा conviction भी है। कितना बड़ा देश, अगर सरकार इस भ्रम में है कि वो चला रही है, तो ये कहां जाएगा; ये कहना कठिन है। एक शैल चतुर्वेदी करके, बीती हुई पीढ़ी के कवि थे। उन्‍होंने एक बड़ा मजेदार हास्‍य-व्‍यंग्‍य लिखा था- और वो कहते थे कि एक नेताजी कार में जा रहे थे, और नेताजी ने ड्राइवर से कहा, आज कार मैं चलाऊंगा। तो ड्राइवर ने कहा साहब, मैं उतर जाऊंगा। नेताजी ने पूछा, क्‍यों? तो ड्राइवर ने कहा सर, ये कार है सरकार नहीं, जो कोई भी चला ले। और इसलिए और हमारे देश में ये कोई नई कल्‍पना नहीं है। थोड़ा सा पीछे चले जाएं हम, ज्‍यादा नहीं, 50 साल करीब। तो हमें ध्‍यान में आएगा कि सरकार की presence बहुत ही कम स्‍थान पर थी। सामाजिक रचना ही ऐसी थी कि जो समाज व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को बल देती थी। अब कोई मुझे बताए कि ये स्‍थान-स्‍थान पर जो ग्रंथालय बने हुए हम देखते हैं, वो क्‍या सरकारों ने बनाए थे क्‍या? समाज के कुछ मुखिया, जिसमें जिनकी रुचि थी, उस काम को वे खड़़ा करते थे। Even education, हमारे देश में जब education और उसके साथ रुपया-पैसा और  व्‍यापार और व्‍यवसाय जुड़ गया, तब उसका रंग-रूप बदल गया। लेकिन एक जमाना था जब समाज में charity activity करने वाले लोगों ने पूरी education व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को विकसित किया था। और करीब-करीब dedicated भाव से किया था। Even जिस इलाके में पानी नहीं होगा तो पानी पहुंचाने का प्रबंध भी सामाजिक व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत होता था। हम राजस्‍थान, गुजरात की तरफ जाएंगे तो बावड़ी देखते हैं, वह कोई सरकारी प्रकल्‍प नहीं था। जन-सामान्‍य इन आंदोलनों को चलाता था। और समाज के जो मुखिया होते थे, वो इन चीजों को करते थे। और इसीलिए हमारे देश में सरकारों के द्वारा व्‍यवस्‍थाएं बनती होंगी, लेकिन विकास को वह हमेशा समाज की भिन्‍न-भिन्‍न रचनाओं के द्वारा, उनकी शक्ति के द्वारा, उनके सामर्थ्‍य के द्वारा, उनके समर्पण के द्वारा प्राप्‍त होता रहा है।

अब वक्‍त बदल चुका है, और इसलिए बदले हुए वक्‍त में हमने व्‍यवस्‍थाएं भी बदलनी होंगी। ये उस दिशा के प्रयास है कि समाज में इस प्रकार की शक्ति रखने वाले कोई धन-सम्‍पन्‍न होगा तो कोई ज्ञान सम्‍पन्‍न होगा, तो कोई अनुभव सम्‍पन्‍न होगा, तो कोई सेवा सम्‍पन्‍न होगा। ये, ये जो शक्तियां हैं, बिखरी पड़़ी हैं। अगर एक बार उनको एक धागे में पिरो दिया जाए तो एक ऐसी फूलमाला बन सकती है, जो फूलमाला मां भारती को और अधिक सुशोभित कर सकती है। तो ये एक वो ही प्रयास है कि समाज में ऐसी जितनी भी शक्तियां हैं, उनको कैसे जोड़ा जाए?

अगर आप बारीकी से सरकार के कामों को देखते होंगे, जो मीडिया में आता नहीं है; क्‍योंकि बहुत सी चीजें होती हैं जो मीडिया के लायक नहीं होतीं हैं, लेकिन बहुत लायक होती हैं। आपने देखा होगा कि सरकार में पदम‍श्री और पदम-विभूषण, ये पदम अवॉर्ड; हमारे देश में पदम अवॉर्ड कैसे मिलते थे? आपने अगर कोशिश की होगी तो आपको रास्‍ता मालूम होगा। कोई नेता recommend कर दें, सरकार recommend करे मतलब कि वो भी politician होता है, वो recommend कर दे, और ज्‍यादातर जो politicians के doctor होते हैं, वो ही पदम के लिए लायक होते हैं।

हमने छोटा सा reform किया, हमने recommendation करने के लिए किसी की जरूरत नहीं है। Online कोई भी व्‍यक्ति खुद के लिए, किसी के लिए detail भेज सकता है। किसी ने कहीं अखबार में पढ़ा हो, कतरन भेज सकता है। भई देखिए ऐसे किसी भी इंसान के बारे में मैंने जाना था। और हजारों की तादाद में ऐसे लोगों की जानकारियां आईं। ये young team, proper से किसी को जानती नहीं थी, चेहरा नहीं जानती थी। जो पड़ा हुआ है उसमें से उसने खोजना शुरू किया है और shortlist किया है। फिर जो कमेटी बनी थी उसने काम किया और आपने देखा होगा, ऐसे-ऐसे लोगों को पदमश्री मिल रहा है इन दिनों, कि जो unknown heroes हैं। अब आपने देखा होगा कि बंगाल का एक मुस्लिम लड़का, जिसको इस बार पदमश्री दिया। क्‍या था?  तो उसकी अपनी मां मर गई, और कारण क्‍या था तो medical treatment संभव नहीं थी। और उस मां की मृत्‍यु से उसका मन हिल गया और उसने एक मोटरसा‍इकिल पर लोगों को patient कहीं है तो उठा करके डॉक्‍टर तक ले जाने के लिए अपना काम शुरू किया। खुद भी petrol खर्चा करता था, काफी कुछ मेहनत करता था। और  उस पूरे इलाके में Ambulance Uncle के नाम से वो जाना जाने लगा। अब ये अपने-आप सेवा कर रहा था, आसाम के, बंगाल के उन इलाकों में। सरकार की  ध्‍यान में आया, ऐसे लोगों को पदमश्री दिया गया। कहने का तात्‍पर्य ये है कि सरकार की कोशिश है कि देश के हर कोने में, हर व्‍यक्ति के पास कुछ न कुछ है देने के लिए।  हम इसे जोड़ना चाहते हैं। और सरकार को फाइल से बाहर निकाल करके जनजीवन के साथ जोड़ना चाहते हैं, ये Two-way हमारा प्रयास है। और उसी के फलस्‍वरूप एक व्‍यवसथा हमने बनाई,

ये ठीक है इसमें हर एक को लगता होगा कि भई नहीं वो आया होता तो अच्‍छा होता, उसको बुलाया होता तो अच्‍छा होता। कई सुझाव होंगे। लेकिन ये पहला प्रयास था। पूरी तरह सरकारी प्रकार का प्रयास था और इसलिए इसमें कमियां भी बहुत हो सकती हैं। हमारे सोचने के तरीके में भी कमियां हो सकती हैं। लेकिन मैं चाहता हूं कि ये जो प्रयोग है, इसको हम Institutionalize कैसे करें? इसको Yearly-event कैसे बनाएं? और उसको एक प्रकार से Government के extension के रूप में, जैसे आप लोगों ने 6 group बनाए, 6 group में भी एक group में पांच-पांच अलग विषयों पर आपने focus  किया, अलग-अलग बातों पर focus किया।

अब मेरे मन में विचार आ रहा है कि क्‍या यही group उस concerned Ministry के साथ permanent जुड़ सकते हैं? जिन्‍होंने digital पर काम किया, वो ही अगर अपना समय offer करते हैं तो मैं सरकार में जो Digital India का काम देख रहे हैं, उन अफसरों के साथ, उस मंत्री के साथ एक टोली बना दूं। हर महीने वो बैठें, नई-नई बातों पर चर्चा करें, क्‍योंकि जैसा यहां पर सूची बता रही थी कि लोगों को, भई मुझे तो मालूम नहीं है, मैं तो नहीं जानता digital क्‍या होता है। ये सिर्फ सामान्‍य मानव का नहीं है, सरकार में भी है जी। सरकार में digital का मतलब है hardware खरीदना। सरकार में digital का मतलब है कि पहले जैसे flowerpot रखते थ अब एक बढ़िया सा Laptop रखना। ताकि कोई भी visitor आए तो लगे कि भई हम modern हैं। तो इस सोच वाली सरकार होती है कि, अब 50-55 के बाद वो भारत सरकार में लोग आते हैं, अब आप 30 के नीचे का दिमाग रखते हो, मैं इन दोनों को मिलाना चाहता था। ये इसकी शुरूआत है। और मेरे लिए खुशी की बात ये है कि आज सरकार में मेरे साथ जो team है, सचिवों की, मंत्रियों की, अगर मान लीजिए एक 200 लोगों की team मैं मान लूं, मेरा उनसे लगातार interaction होता है और प्रधानमंत्री के रूप में नहीं होता है। मैं colleague की तरह उनके साथ अपना समय गुजारता हूं। अब पिछले तीन साल के अनुभव के बाद मैं कह सकता हूं कि जैसे वो किसान खेत जोतता है ना, बारिश आएगी, कब आएगी पता नहीं, फसल कौन सी कैसी होगी, पता नहीं, फसल होगी तो बाजार में मूल्‍य मिलेगा; लेकिन फिर भी वो खेत जोतता रहता है। मैंने भी मेरे 200 लोगों के दिमाग में जोतने का काम बहुत किया है। और मैं अनुभव से कह सकता हूं, कि आज वो किसी भी विचार-बीज को accept करने के लिए लालायित है, उत्‍साहित है, और पूरी तरह उसके साथ जुड़ने को तैयार है। ये अपने-आप में मैं समझता हूं बहुत बड़ा बदलाव है। सरकार की मेरी senior team हर नई चीज को खोजने के लिए, समझने के लिए, स्‍वीकारने के लिए obstacle बनने के बजाय उसमें opportunity ढूंढ रही है, और प्रयास कर रही है।  इसी एक कारण से मेरी हिम्‍मत बढ़ी है, आप लोगों को मेरे साथ जोड़ने की। अगर वही obstacle  होता, मैं नहीं करता, सोचता भी नहीं। क्‍योंकि आज आप ही लोग यहां से 6 महीने के बाद जा करके negativity के सबसे बड़े reason बन जाते। अब मैं आप कहता, छोड़ो यार, सब बात तो बहुत करते हैं, सब ऐसे ही हैं। लेकिन ये मैं हिम्‍मत इसलिए कर रहा हूं कि मुझे मालूम है कि मेरी main team है, वो नई चीजों को स्‍वीकारने के लिए बहुत उत्‍साहित है। आपने जितनी बातें बताई हैं, आपने कल भी उनके साथ चर्चा की है आज भी वो लोग यहां बैठे हैं, कुछ लोग उसमें से। तो ये प्रयास हमें लंबा चलाना है, हमें आगे बढ़ाना है।

आप लोगों से भी मेरा आग्रह है कि आप में से बहुत लोग हैं जो एक-दूसरे को पहली बार रूबरू में मिले होंगे। शायद सुना होगा, पढ़ा होगा, social media में जाना होगा कि कोई एक सज्‍जन है जो इस दिशा में ऐसा कुछ कर रहे हैं। अब आपका एक परिचय हुआ है, आपकी एक team बन रही है। हो सकता है सभी 212 लोगों की नहीं बनी होगी, लेकिन जो 30-35 का group बना होगा, उनको जो जरूर परिचय आया होगा; सोचने का तरीका क्‍या है सामने वाले का, contribution क्‍या है, सब आपने evaluate किया होगा।

किसी ने ज्‍यादा समय खा लिया वो भी आपको पता रहा होगा। कौन यहां अपना व्‍यवसाय के लिए networking में टाइम लगा रहा है तो वो भी आपको पता चला होगा। सब कुछ आपको ध्‍यान आ गया होगा। और इसलिए आपको पूरा Plus-Minus Point मालूम है। मुझे विश्‍वास है कि आप इसके द्वारा अपने तरीके से इन्‍हीं विषयों; विषय मत छोड़िए; और नया दुनियाभर में अचानक कोई भी  घटना आ जाए उस में मत पड़िए। ये जिन चीजों पर आपने काम किया है, जैसा चीजें बदलती जाएं उसमें जोड़ते जाएंगे क्‍या? और उसको आप modify करेंगे, और sharpen करेंगे, काफी focus, अब ये ideas हैं। क्‍या आप  ideas के साथ roadmap भी बना सकते हैं क्‍या? Achievement के लिए आप इसी चीज के resource क्‍या होंगे। Institutional arrangement क्‍या होगा, सरकार है तो नियमों से चलती है तो नियम बदलने हैं, तो नियम कैसे बदलेंगे, कौन से नियम होने चाहिए। सरकार कागज पर चलती है। जब तक चीज कागज पर नहीं उतरती है, सरकार में कोई चीज नीचे नहीं उतर सकती, इसके लिए आप क्‍या कर सकते हैं? कैसे जोड़ सकते हैं? क्‍या आपमें से कोई lead करके, भई चलो एक महीने के बाद दोबारा कहीं बैठेंगे। आप देखिए, आप बहुत बड़ा contribution कर सकते हैं। आप एक अपने तरीके से एक digital platform तैयार कर सकते हैं। आप ही की team का कोई lead करे, और उस digital platform से आप अपने तरीके से नए-नए लोगों को invite कीजिए। हो सकता है आप महीने में एक बार Google hangout से conference भी करें, debate करें, कभी साल में एक-दो बार मिलने का करें। अगर ये चीजें आपने की, और ये मंथन चलता रहा, तो आपको सरकार में समय पर चीजें देने की  एक ताकत आएगी। और समय पर जब चीज आती है तो बहुत बड़ा बदलाव आता है जी।

कभी-कभार सरकारी तंत्र की अपनी कठिनाइयां भी हैं, अपनी खूबियां भी हैं। उन कठिनाइयों के बीच आप कभी मददगार हो सकते हैं। और हमारा देश ऐसा नहीं कि कोई बहुत बड़ा extra-ordinary चीजों की जरूरत है। छोटी-छोटी चीजें बहुत बड़े परिवर्तन लाती हैं जी। और कोशिश ये आपने, आप अपना थोड़ा सा ही सरकार काम को देखेंगे, छोटे-छोटे इतने परिवर्तन हुए हैं और जो सारी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को बदल देते हैं। अब जैसे एक simple सा व्‍यवहार, आप मुझे बताइए मेरे देश का सामान्‍य नागरिक सरकार ने उस पर भरोसा करना चाहिए कि नहीं करना चाहिए? सच्‍चा-सीधा जवाब है जी, करना चाहिए। 

लेकिन सरकार elected corporator पर भरोसा करती है, elected MLA पर भरोसा करती है, सरकार Gazetted Officer पर भरोसा करती है। और ये कानून क्‍या था कि अगर आपका कोई certificate है और आप आपको कहीं apply करना है, तो उसको certify कराने के लिए उसके घर जाना पड़़ेगा, वो एक ठप्‍पा मार देगा और वो तो देखता भी नहीं है। बाहर एक लड़का बैठा होता है, जो भी आए उसको सिक्का लेकर ठप्‍पा मारता रहता है, और आप certify ले करके फिर सरकार को भेजते हैं। मैंने आकर कहा भई क्‍या जरूरत है? Self certificate करने दो ना, self attest करने दो ना, निकाल दिया। चीज छोटी है लेकिन इसमें message बहुत बड़ा है कि मुझे मेरे देश के लोगों पर भरोसा है। बीच में, बीच में कोई व्‍यवस्‍था की जरूरत नहीं, हां, जब final आपका interview call होगा, या जब निर्णय करना होगा, तो आपके original document दिखा दीजिए उस दिन। ऐसे आपको शायद इस सरकार में तीन साल में हजारों चीज लगेंगी, जिसने चीजों को, अब देखिए, हम corruption की यहां चर्चा हो रही थी, और कुलीन बता रहा था कि हम judicially को ठीक करेंगे तो सब हो जाएगा। कुलीन कर सकता है।

दरअसल, देखिए हम परिवार में या cash रखते हैं या jewellery रखते हैं, ताला लगाते हैं। क्‍या ये ताला चोर के लिए होता है क्‍या?   डाकू के लिए होता है क्‍या?  वो तो पूरी तिजोरी उठाके ले जाने की ताकत रखता है, आपके उस ताले तोड़ने की ताकत रखता है। ये उसके लिए नहीं है, ये इसलिए है कि घर में बच्‍चों की आदत खराब न हो। ये व्‍यवस्‍था आप इसलिए बनाते हैं, कि घर में बच्‍चों को आदत न लग जाए, अपने-आप खोल करके कुछ लेने की आदत लग जाए और जेब में डाल करके बाहर फालतु की आदतों में पड़ न जाएं। हम अपनी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को अपने स्‍वयं को discipline के लिए व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित करते है।Corruption भी दुर्भाग्‍य से institutionalized हो गया है। जब तक आप counter-institutional arrangement नहीं करते हैं, आप उसको रोक नहीं पाते हैं।

अब जैसे हमारे देश में इतने दलाल हैं जी, क्‍योंकि उनको भी तो रोजी-रोटी चाहिए। वो भी एक रोजगार का क्षेत्र है और ऐसे लोग जो बेकार हो गए, वो बहुत चिल्‍ला रहे हैं इन दिनों; रोजगार नहीं है, रोजगार नहीं है। गरीब घर में ऐसे कई लोग जाते हैं कि बस 50 हजार रुपया दीजिए, बेटे को peon का नौकरी दिलवा दूंगा, बस 20 हजार रुपया दीजिए, इस vacation में temporary job दिलवा दूंगा, ऐसे दलाल घूमते रहते हैं। हमने आ करके तय किया कि Class-III और IV में. कोई मूझे बताए क्‍या logic है interview का? और ऐसा कौन सा विश्‍व में मनोविज्ञान तैयार हुआ है, कि जो कोई कमरे में एक व्‍यक्ति इधर से घुसता है, तीन लोगों कीpanel बैठी है, वो 30 सेकेंड में वहां से गुजरता है, वो देखते हैं किसी को फुरसत है तो पूछते हैं। अच्‍छा–अच्‍छा, interview हो गया। 

 


मैंने साहब अभी ऐसा तो scanner कहीं पढ़ा नहीं, सुना नहीं। इसका मतलब ये गड़बड़बाजी की है। इस सरकार ने आ करके निर्णय कर दिया, सरकार ने 65% से ज्‍यादा रोजगार इन लोगों का होता है। मैंने सारे interview खत्‍म कर दिए, आपकी merit list पर कम्‍पयूटर तय करेगा, जो top merit में होंगे उसको jobमिल जाएगा, हो सकता है 2%, 5% ऐसे भी लोग आ जाएंगे जो deserve नहीं करते, लेकिन वो interview में तो 80% ऐसे आते हैं।

कहने का मेरा तात्‍पर्य ये है कि ये एक ऐसी सरकार है, जो ऐसी institutional arrangement में लगी हुई है कि जिसके कारण व्‍यक्ति अगर थोड़ा सा भी गड़बड़ हो, व्‍यवस्‍था चीजों को संभाल लेगी। और कभी-कभी व्‍यक्ति का फिसलना संभव होता है, व्‍यवस्‍थाएं स्थितियों को बचाए रखने के बहुत काम आती हैं। आज की दुनिया, एक प्रकार से जहां Gap वहां App. सारी जगह App भर रही है। एक प्रकार से interface खत्‍म होता जा रहा है। और उसमें अब ऐसे लोग भी घुस रहे हैं जो, जिनके लिए cheating करना बड़ा स्‍वाभाविक है। एक App पर दुनिया भर का काम करके दूसरे महीने में दूसरी App में डाल देंगे और अपना गाड़ी चला लेंगे, लेकिन ये संभावना होने के बावजूद technology revolution जो है, इसका मानवीय जीवन पर बड़ा प्रभाव और एक स्‍वीकृत प्रभाव पैदा हुआ है। आज technology के लिए कोई resistance नहीं है। और जो लोग कहते हैं, कि ये technology समझ नहीं आती है, उसमें ज्‍यादातर पुरुष होते हैं, महिलाएं नहीं होती हैं। आप देखिए, most modern technology equipment जो वो होगा, वो सबसे ज्‍यादा कहीं तुरंत market में चला जाता है, पहुंच जाता है किचन में महिलाओं की पसंद की तरह। सारी महिलाएं यानी एक अनपढ़ महिला में, जो काम करने वाली, किचन में काम करने वाली महिला होगी, उसको भी oven कैसे चलाना है, ढिकना कैसे चलाना है, सब technology मालूम हो जाती है।  

 

User friendly technology ने जीवन बदल दिया है। क्‍या governance में technology सरकार के तौर-तरीकों को बदल सकती है? क्‍या? आप लोग अलग-अलग field में हैं, एक बात निश्चित है कि innovation ही जीवन है। अगर innovation नहीं है तो एक ठहराव है। और जहां भी ठहराव है, वहां गंदगी है। innovation से ही बदलाव आता है। आप उस field में हैं क्‍या आप innovation को promote कर रहे हैं अगर कोई handicraft  के क्षेत्र में marketing का काम करता है, लेकिन क्‍या उसने handicraft बनाने वाले को नई technology के साथ, global requirement के अनुसार उस handicraft को आधुनिक समय में modify करने के लिए उसको सिखाया है क्‍या? अगर वो training भी साथ-साथ करता है तो हम हमारे सामान्‍य गरीब व्‍यक्ति जो handicraft के क्षेत्र में काम करता है, उसका एक प्रकार से vocational training कहो, skill training कहो, Technological training कहो, उसको मार्केट की समझ कैसी है, उसको समझाया तो वो थोड़ा बढाकर देता है। Bamboo का फर्नीचर बनाने वाला व्‍यक्ति भी, अगर हम मार्केट को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए, बदले हुए युग को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए, और comfort को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए चीजें बनाने के लिए हम उसको प्रेरित करेंगे, तो अपने-आप वो अवसर मिल जाएगा।

हमारे यहां जो rural economy है, हमारी पूरी rural economy को सिर्फ हम खेती से न जोड़ें, खेती के सिवाए भी rural economy के साथ बहुत कुछ है। हम इस decentralize व्‍यवस्‍था को कैसे बल दें? अब एक समय था हमारे देश में, जब गांव का लोहार गांव की सारी बातें को निपट लेता था कही बाहर, गांव के बाहर जाना नहीं पड़ता था। गांव का एक मोची गांव की सारी requirement पूरी कर देता था, गांव को बाहर नहीं जाना पड़़ता था। Economy ऐसी बदलती गई कि सबसे बड़ा लोहार बन गया TATA, सबसे बड़ा मोची बन गया BATA और गांव रह गया घाटा। तो ये, ये जो बदलाव आया है, बदलाव बुरी चीज नहीं है, हमने उसमें decentralize  व्‍यवस्‍था को कैसे जोड़ेंगे? अगर ये हम जोड़ दें तो हम एक ऐसी ताकत बना देंगे, ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित करते हैं, जो देश में एक economy को sustain  करने के लिए काम आती है। क्‍या आप start-up, ये start-up से कोई fashionable चीज है ही नहीं जी। आपने देखा होगा, एक digital software की दुनिया का जो start-up world है, एक है। लेकिन दूसरे जो start-ups बने हैं, उसने सामान्‍य-सामान्‍य समस्‍याओं का समाधान खोजा है, और rural base को पकड़ा है।

 

मैं अभी सिक्किम गया था, एकाध साल पहले की बात है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में सिक्किम पहला organic state है। बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा। पूरा state organic है जी। और 13-14 साल लगातार मेहनत करके उन्‍होंने organic state बनाया है। और हमारे देश के सभी Himalayan states में organic state capital बनने की संभावनाएं पड़ी हुई हैं। मैं एक बार सिक्किम गया तो उनके उस organic festival के लिए गया था। उसी दिन देश में, देश को सिक्किम को organic state के रूप में समर्पित करने का कार्यक्रम था।

 

वहां मुझे दो नौजवान मिले, एक लड़का, एक लड़की। वे IIM अहमदाबाद से सीधे pass out हो करके वहां पहुंचे थे। हमारा परिचय हुआ तो मुझे लगा tourist के नाते आए होंगे। तो मैंने पूछा, बोले नहीं, नहीं, हम तो यहीं रहते हैं पिछले छह महीने से। बोला- क्‍या कर रहे हो?  बोले हम लोग यहां की जो organic चीजें हैं, इसका global marketing  की दिशा में काम कर रहे हैं और हमारा बहुत ही कम समय में हमारा business बढ़ रहा है। 

 

अब ये देखिए, नई दुनिया है। यानी हमारे जो startups हैं, उसने इन चीजों को पकड़ा है। हम इसको कैसे बल दें?  हम इसको कैसे ताकत दें?  उसमें हम नई चीजें कैसे लाएं? Waste to Wealth. भारत में आप कल्‍पना नहीं कर सकते कि इतना बड़ा एक economy का क्षेत्र है Waste to Wealth. इसमें technology है, इसमें innovation है, इसमें recycling है, इसमें सब चीजें हैं; और भारत के लिए आवश्‍यक भी है। अगर हम इसको बल दें, भारत में recycling नई चीज नहीं है, हमारे देश के पुरातन जमाने में इन चीजों से लोगों को आदत थी। लेकिन बदलाव आया, बीच की कड़ी टूट गई। अब उसको हमें organized way में करना होगा। अगर ये चीजें हम करते हैं, हम परिवर्तन ला सकते हैं। 

शिक्षा, अब ये बात सही है कि शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में अब IIM में से campus placement होता है। एक करोड़, दो करोड़, तीन करोड़, ऐसे बोली बोल करके उठा लेते हैं लोग। क्‍या हम वो dream नहीं देख सकते हैं कि जो टीचर है, उसका भी campus placement हो, और वो भी एक करोड़, दो करोड़ तीन करोड़, पांच करोड़ में बदल जाए। ये संभव है जी, ये संभव है। आप हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के किसी भी व्‍यक्ति को मिलिए, अमीर से अमीर व्‍यक्ति को मिलिए, गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति से मिलिए, सबसे ज्‍यादा पढ़े-लिखे को मिलिए, सबसे अनपढ़ को मिलिए और एक प्रश्‍न पूछिए, एक जवाब common आएगा, उसके जीवन का मकसद क्‍या है? बच्‍चों को अच्‍छी शिक्षा। किसी को भी पूछिए, अपने ड्राइवर को पूछिए, भई क्‍या सोचते हो? नहीं साहब, बस बच्‍चों को अच्‍छी शिक्षा मिल जाए, मेरी तो जिंदगी ड्राइवरी में पूरी हो गई, उसको मैं कुछ बनाना चाहता हूं। 

साहब मैं कईयों को पूछता हूं, गरीब व्‍यक्ति ड्राइवर होगा, liftman होगा, मतलब मैं पूछता हूं भई, कर्ज-वर्ज तो नहीं है ना? तो बोले, नहीं साहब कर्ज है। कर्ज किस बात का है? बच्‍चों को अच्‍छे स्‍कूल में पढ़ने के लिए कर्ज लिया उसने। इसका मतलब हुआ कि देश में सबसे ज्‍यादा मांग अगर किसी की है, तो best teachers की है। हम इस best teacher निर्माण करने को और सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति को लगे कि भई टीचर बनना एक बहुत बड़ा गौरवपूर्ण काम है, और मैं बहुत कुछ contribute कर सकता हूं। और अब कई नए model  आ रहे हैं, बहुत नए model आ रहे हैं, practical model आ रहे हैं और काफी अच्‍छे। अब उसमें बहुत बड़ा रोल कर सकती है technology. गरीब से गरीब बच्‍चे, आपको मालूम होगा। सरकार जब साइलों में चलती है तब किया करती है।

हम इतने satellite छोड़ते हैं, बड़ा गर्व करते हैं। लेकिन कई transponder ऐसे थे, जो unutilized ऐसे ही हवा में लटके पड़े थे। हमने आ करके इन silo को तोड़ा,  space को, education को, technology को, सबको इकट्ठा किया। अभी मैंने thirty two transponders dedicated to the education only, और वो आपको घर में, घर में education की एक प्रकार से free of charge delivery दे सकते हैं बच्‍चों के लिए। यानी quality education without dilution, without diversion, सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति तक पहुंचाने के लिए technology गरीब से गरीब तक हमें पहुंचा सकती है। 

हम technology के द्वारा quality of education में बदलाव कैसे लाएं? अगर quality of education में नीचे से बदलाव आया तो टीचर पर अपने-आप ऐसा pressure आने वाला है कि टीचर को बदलना ही होगा ये स्थिति बनने वाली है। और इसलिए इस सरकार की कोशिश ये है कि इन चीजों में आप जैसे लोग, जिसके पास दुनिया को अलग तरीके से देखने का एक अवसर है, एक sixth sense भी है, उमंग है, उत्‍साह है, innovations हैं, सोच, ideas हैं। इन चीजों के साथ सरकार को कैसे जोड़ना है, ये मेरी कोशिश है, और उस कोशिश का ये भाग है। 

उसी प्रकार से आप भी और आप जैसे अब देशवासी, कई लोग, देखिए सरकार की योजनाओं से हम New India बना लेंगे, ये सोच न मेरी है न सरकार की है। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी जब तक New India का संकल्‍प नहीं लेते हैं, New India के लिए अपने लिए काम नहीं खोजते हैं, उस काम को खुद प्रयत्‍न करके पूरा नहीं करते हैं, तो वो काम अधूरा रहता है। और इसलिए हमारी कोशिश ये होनी चाहिए और आपसे भी मेरी ये अपेक्षा है, कि आप जहां हैं वहां इस बदलाव में आप एक बात, जैसे आपके, आपके जितने भी, आपके यहां कोई 20 employee होंगे, 50 होंगे, 100 होंगे या हजार होंगे। क्‍या कभी उनको बैठ करके बात कहोगे? कि बताओ भाई 2022..Twenty Twenty Two, हमने देश को यहां ले जाना है, तुम क्‍या जिम्‍मा ले सकते हो? तुम क्‍या कर सकते हो? और हर व्‍यक्ति बहुत कुछ कर सकता है। ये वातावरण हम पैदा कर सकते हैं। 

कभी-कभी मुझे याद है, मैं जब राजनीति में नहीं था, तो एक बहुत बड़े उद्योगकार, अब वो ज्‍यादातर Gandhian life जीते थे, सेवाभाव में रहते थे, उनके परिवार के एक व्‍यक्ति रामकृष्‍ण मिशन से जुड़े हुए थे, तो मेरा रामकृष्‍ण मिशन से नाता होने के कारण मेरा उस परिवार से नाता रहता था। तो उन्‍होंने एक बंद पड़ी हुई, खस्‍ता हालत की एक industry purchase की। अब वो बंद क्‍यों हो गई थी, हड़ताल और यूनियनबाजी इन सबसे हो गई। तो मैंने ऐसे ही उनको पूछा, मैंने कहा ऐसा risk कैसे लिया आपने? और ये क्‍या हुआ, क्‍या परिणाम आया? तो उन्‍होंने मुझे simple सा बताया। बोले कुछ नहीं, हमने ले लिया, और मैंने पहले दिन से वहां जाना शुरू किया, और तय किया था छह महीने मैं regular वहां जाऊंगा। और मैं जो labour canteen थी, वहां जा करके खाना शुरू किया। बस बैठता था, वहीं खाता था। मेरे इतने छोटे से निर्णय ने सभी मजदूरों की मेरे प्रति सोच बदल गई, उनको मैं मालिक नहीं लगता था, मुझे वो मजदूर नहीं लगते थे। वो जो खाते थे मैं खुद उनके टेबल पर वही खाता था, और psychological  परिवर्तन ये आया कि वो मेरे परिवार के सदस्‍य बन गए और उन्‍होंने मेहनत ऐसी की, छह महीने के अंदर डूबी हुई फैक्‍टरी जो मैंने ली थी, वो कमाऊ बच्‍चा हो गई। कहने का तात्‍पर्य ये है, कि क्‍या कभी आपने भी अपने साथियों को भी कहिए कि आपके यहां जो काम करने वाले लोग हैं छोटे-छोटे लोग हैं, उनके घर में 12 साल का, 15 साल का, 18 साल का बच्‍चा होगा। क्‍या साल में एक-दो बार उनको इकट्ठा किया? उनको इकट्ठा कर-करके उनको motivational कोई अच्‍छी बातें की क्‍या? देश में बुराईयां न करना ऐसा कुछ समझाया क्‍या?

अब देखिए, जैसे ही आप उनके बच्‍चों से अपना नाता जोड़ोगे, उसको increment मिले या न मिले, bonus मिले या न मिले, वो आपके लिए जीवन भर समर्पित हो जाएगा, आप देखते रहिए। मुझे ये बदलाव लाना है। मुझे ये बदलाव लाना है। आप मुझे बताइए सरकार की insurance की जो व्‍यवस्‍थाएं हैं, एक दिन का एक रुपया। एक insurance ऐसा है जिसमें महीने का एक रुपया। क्‍या आपके अपने employee का भारत सरकार ने इतना बड़ा अच्‍छा package दिया हुआ है, इतनी बढ़िया product है, क्‍या आपने उनको, 500 रुपया अगर उनके बैंक में जमा कर दिया आपने fix deposit में, उसकी yearly insurance की फीस चली जाएगी। और उसके जीवन में कुछ हुआ तो दो लाख रुपया और दोनों ही insurance हैं तो चार लाख रुपया अपने आप उस गरीब के घर पहुंच जाएंगे। 

सरकार की योजनाएं, जो सीधी-सीधी आपके साथ काम करने वाले लोगों से जुड़ी हुई हैं, क्‍या आप उसको बढ़ावा दे सकते हैं क्‍या? आप आपने देखा होगा, सुबह हमारे गौरव ने आपको digital platform जो सरकार के, उसके विषय में बताया होगा। आप में से बहुत लोग digital दुनिया में होंगे लेकिन इस particular area में enter नहीं किए होंगे। क्‍या इसको large scale में enter हो करके आप स्‍वयं सरकार को push कर सकते हैं क्‍या? आप सरकार को drive करने में भागीदार बन सकते हैं क्‍या? ये जो हमारा नाता जितना जुड़ेगा, उतना मैं समझता हूं कि हम परिवर्तन की दिशा में जो जाना चाहते है, हम बहुत ताकत के साथ जा सकते हैं। और हम कुछ भी हैं, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के नागरिक हैं। किस पद पर है, किस व्‍यवस्‍था में हैं, किस दुकान पर बैठे हैं, किस industry को चला रहे हैं, लेकिन हम सब मिल करके एक हिन्‍दुस्‍तान हैं। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों में भाव भरना ये मेरा एक कोशिश है, और मुझे, मुझे आप लोगों का साथ चाहिए। 

ये ठीक है मैं भी जितनी चीजें सोचता हूं, सारी कर पाऊंगा, प्रधानमंत्री हो तो हो जाती हैं, ऐसा नहीं है जी। मुझे भी अपने-आपको व्‍यवस्‍थाओं के बीच से जाना होता है। इसलिए हो सकता है आपके 50 सुझाव में से 40 सुझाव शायद आगे न भी चलें, लेकिन 10 सुझाव भी अगर आगे चलते हैं, तो देश को बहुत बड़ा मूल्‍यवान आपका योगदान होता है। इस भाव से हमारा प्रयत्‍न जारी रहना चाहिए, ऐसा कभी निराशा नहीं आनी चाहिए, यार बातें तो बहुत होती हैं, सोचते तो बहुत होते हैं, लेकिन मैंने जो कहा था नहीं हुआ, तुमने जो कहा नहीं हुआ, लेकिन तुम में से कहा हुआ, बहुतों ने कही हुई, बहुत सी चीजें हुई हैं, जिसके कारण परिवर्तन आ रहा है, ये हमने करना है। हो सकता है कभी-कभी व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को अच्‍छी चीजें बहुत उम्‍दा होने के बाद भी, accept करने के‍ लिए capacity न हो, लेकिन धीरे-धीरे उसकी पाचन शक्ति बढ़ेगी तो अच्‍छी-अच्‍छी नई योजनाएं भी आएंगी, नई योजनाओं का स्‍वीकार होगा। इस मूड में अगर आप हमारे साथ लगते हैं।

और मैं चाहता हूं कि yearly इसको institutional mechanism बनाना है तो इसको और अच्‍छा कैसे बनाया जाए, आप feedback देने वाले हैं। आप बाद में email पर भी काफी चीजें, सुझाव दे सकते हैं। आप व्‍यक्तियों के समझ में भी सुझाव दे सकते हैं, आप इस कार्यक्रम के तरीके के संबंध में भी सुझाव दे सकते हैं। लेकिन मुझे विश्‍वास है, क्‍योंकि कल भी मैं शाम को आया था, सबसे आपसे मेरा मिलना हुआ था। आज भी मुझे आप सबके विचारों को जानने का अवसर‍ मिला, कितने नए तरीके से आप चीजों को सोच सकते हैं, कितने नए तरीकों से चीजें प्रस्‍तुत कर सकते हैं। 

सरकार में जो चीजें, अब जैसे मैंने एक छोटा सा प्रयोग किया। एक हमने प्रयोग किया Hackathon  का। College students के साथ किया और सभी IITs वगैरह students को हमने invite किया था। First round में करीब 40 हजार students ने हिस्‍सा लिया। मैंने सरकार में कहा कि भाई तुम्‍हारे यहां जो काम करते-करते कठिनाई महसूस होती थी, problem लगती हैं, उसका solution तुम्‍हारे पास नहीं है, ऐसी चीजों की list बनाओ। तो शुरू में resistance था। Resistance ये था कि मैं secretary हूं, मैं joint secretary हूं, मैं director हूं, मैं कैसे बताऊं मेरे यहां प्रश्‍न हैं, मैं कैसे बताऊं मेरे यहां problem का solution नहीं है। फिर तो मेरी बेइज्‍जती होगी। तो शुरू में बड़ी मुश्किल था बताना भी। तो हम, हमारे ऑफिस के लोग लगे रहे, आखिरकार उन्‍होंने करीब 400 ऐसे issue छांटे, कि इसका कोई solution खोजना चाहिए। पहले उनको लगता ही नहीं था कोई problem है। अब मैंने उन 400 issues को इन बच्‍चों को दे दिया, students को, कि भई आप लोग Hackathon  कीजिए, इसके solution लाइए। और उन्‍होंने 40-40 घंटे non-stop university campus में काम किए, 40 हजार हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की purely around for sixteen to eighteen age group, इन्‍होंने दिमाग खपाया, और आपको जान करके आनंद होगा, इतने बढ़िया-बढ़िया उन्‍होंने solution दिए हैं। रेलवे वालों ने दूसरे ही दिन उन लोगों को मीटिंग की और बुला करके उसमें से कुछ चीजें adopt कर दीं और रेलवे के सिस्‍टम में लागू कर दीं। सारे department ने उस solution को अपने यहां incorporate करने का प्रयास किया है। 

अगर मेरे देश के 16 से 18 साल की उम्र के नौजवान, जिसके पिताजी को पूछो, बेटा क्‍या करता है, तो 10 minus mark दे देगा, लेकिन वो ही नौजवान मेरे देश के लिए इतना काम आ सकता है। ये मेरी कोशिश है, 40 हजार इन नौजवानों के काम में। आप में भी, आप में भी वो सामर्थ्‍य है। और मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि देशभक्ति मेरे में और आप में कोई अन्‍तर है। हम सबमें समान देशभक्ति है, हम सबमें, मन में, हमारा देश आगे बढ़े, हम सबकी इच्‍छा है। और काम के लिए अवसर बहुत हैं। 

हम मिल करके काम करेंगे तो बहुत ही उत्‍तम परिणाम मिलेगा, ये मेरा विश्‍वास है। मैं फिर एक बार आप लोगों ने क्‍योंकि कहते हैं भई समय बड़ा मूल्‍यवान होता है। औरों को हो न हो, रुपये-पैसे की दुनिया वालों का तो जरूरत होता है। और उसके बाद भी आपने समय दिया, मूल्‍यवान समय दिया, इसके लिए मैं सरकार की तरफ से आपका हृदय से बहुत-बहुत आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं, लेकिन मैं आशा करता हूं कि आप लोग जुड़े रहेंगे। हमारी स्‍टोरियों को बढ़ाते चलेंगे हम। फिर कभी    topic wise हम मिल सकते हैं, कभी reason wise मिल सकते हैं, हम अलग-अलग तरीके से मिल सकते हैं। लेकिन हम चीजों को बढ़ा सकते हैं। मेरी आप सबको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं। धन्‍यवाद।

                The Prime Minister today interacted with Young Entrepreneurs at the ""Champions of Change"" initiative organised by NITI Aayog at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra.

Six groups of Young Entrepreneurs made presentations before the PM on themes such as - Soft Power: Incredible India 2.0; Education and Skill Development; Health and Nutrition; Energizing a sustainable tomorrow; and Digital India; New India by 2022.

Appreciating the new ideas and innovations envisaged in the presentations made by the entrepreneurs, the Prime Minister said, that in times past, social initiatives had catered to the requirements of people at large, and these movements were spearheaded by eminent people in society.

The Prime Minister described the ""Champions of Change"" initiative as one effort to bring together diverse strengths for the benefit of the nation and society.

The Prime Minister said this initiative would be taken forward and institutionalised in the best possible way. One possibility could be to associate the groups that made presentations today, with the respective departments and Ministries in the Union Government.

He gave the example of Padma Awards to say how processes can be transformed to recognise hitherto unknown heroes of society.

The Prime Minister said the team of senior officers in Union Government are keen to explore new avenues and ways for the betterment of people. He encouraged the entrepreneurs to continue their ideation in their respective groups.  He said that if they did so, they could go a long way in furthering the cause of governance.

The Prime Minister said a lot of small changes have been brought in by the Union Government, which have brought significant results. He said trusting the common man, through self attestation of documents is one such initiative. He also mentioned the abolition of interviews for Group C and D positions in the Union Government.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today there is an ""app"" for filling every gap. He said technology and innovation should be harnessed to transform governance. He said decentralised structures are important to nurture the rural economy. In this context, he mentioned the role of startups in catalysing transformation.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of good teachers in society. He said technology can provide a big boost to the quality of education.

The Prime Minister encouraged the entrepreneurs to work towards promoting the social welfare schemes of the Government among their employees.

He emphasized that New India could only be built through the efforts of crores of ordinary citizens. He invited the entrepreneurs to join in this effort.

Several Union Ministers, Vice Chairman NITI Aayog Shri Arvind Panagariya, and senior Union Government officers were present on the occasion. The event was coordinated by CEO NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant.

                Six women officers of the Indian Navy, who are due to circumnavigate the globe on the sailing vessel, INSV Tarini, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. 

This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. They will begin their voyage later this month from Goa, and expect to return to Goa in March 2018, after completing the circumnavigation. The expedition has been titled Navika Sagar Parikrama. The Parikrama will be covered in five legs, with stop-overs at 4 ports: Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), and Cape Town (South Africa). 

INSV Tarini is a 55-foot sailing vessel, which has been built indigenously, and was inducted in the Indian Navy earlier this year. 

During the interaction, the crew explained details of their upcoming voyage to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister wished the women crew well, and said he would keep track of their progress around the world. He exhorted them to project India’s capabilities and strengths across the world. He also encouraged them to write and share their experiences, after the successful completion of the voyage. 

The vessel will be skippered by Lt. Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprises Lt. Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta.

                My dear fellow citizens,    

Greetings from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the auspicious occasion of Independence Day. 

Nation is celebrating the Independence Day with the festival of Janamashtmi today . I can see a number of Bal Kanahiyas here. We are fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan. 

From the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I bow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed their lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices for the independence, glory and pride of the country. 

Sometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us. A good monsoon contributes immensely to the prosperity of the country. However, due to climate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity.  Several parts of the country faced natural calamities recently. Besides our innocent children lost their lives in a hospital. Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief. I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the wellbeing of all. 

My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India. We commemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week. This year we are also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the Sabarmati Ashram. The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call   “Swaraj is my birth right” falls this year as well. The year marks the 125th Anniversary of the Ganesh Utsav which led to the rise of community awakening through the celebrations. It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the country.  A collective resolve of the citizens was visible during 1942 to 1947 across the country which forced the British to Quit India within a span of five years. We will have to exhibit the same resolve from now  on in the 70th year of independence to 2022, the 75th year of independence. 

We now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our independence. Our united resolve, strength and determination to work hard remembering the memory of our great patriots will help us to build an India of their dreams by 2022. Therefore, we have to take the country forward with a pledge to build a New India. 

We are aware of the power of the collective resolve, hard work, sacrifice and devotion of our 125 crore citizens. Lord Krishna was immensely powerful, but it is only when the milkmen came out with sticks in his support that they could lift the Govardhan parvat. When Lord Rama had to go to Lanka, the monkeys of vanar sena came to his help, Ramsetu was built and Lord Rama could reach Lanka. Then there was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric of independence with cotton and spinning wheel.  

The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our country. No one is small or big. We have in our memory the story of squirrel which became an agent of change. That’s why we must remember that no one among the 125 billion people is either small or big – everyone is equal.  

If each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new resolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the country with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in 2022. It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation. A New India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science and technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the global arena.  

Our freedom movement is linked to our sentiments. We know it well that at the time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in teaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working – all of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was contributing towards the independence of the country. This idea is a great source of strength. In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes ‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity. 

We are working, but if we do so in the spirit of working for the glory of mother India, for the divinity of mother India, if we do it to rid our countrymen of poverty, if we do it to properly weave our social fabric, if we discharge our duties with feelings towards the country, if we do it with a sense of devotion to country, if we do our work by dedicating it to the country, then the achievements will be much more. That is why we should move forward with this spirit.  

January 1, 2018 will not be an ordinary day – those born in this century will start turning 18. For these people, this is a decisive year of their lives. They are going to be the creator of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our nation in the 21st century. I heartily welcome all these youth, honour them and offer my respects to them. You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our country. A proud nation invites you to become a part of its developmental journey. 

My dear countrymen,  

When Arjuna was posing a lot of queries to Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, then Krishna told Arjuna that you achieve goals as per your thinking and beliefs. We have a strong determination, we are committed for a brighter India. We, who have grown up with a state of hopelessness, have to reject the feeling of despair and must now march ahead with confidence. 

We have to leave this 'Chalta Hai' attitude. We have to think of 'Badal Sakta Hai'- this attitude will help us as a nation. We should have this confidence that with sacrifice and hard work and a resolve to do something, we will get necessary resources and the ability to do it and then a big transformation will happen, and our resolve will convert into accomplishment.  

Brothers and sisters,           

It is natural for our countrymen to think of our safety and security. Our country, our military, our brave-hearts, our uniformed forces, be it any force, not just the army, air force or navy, all the uniformed forces, whenever they were called upon to do so, they showed their valour, their strength; our brave-hearts never turned their back in making the supreme sacrifice. Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of our country have made extreme sacrifices. And when the surgical strike was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and strength.  

My dear countrymen,  

India's security is our priority. Be it our coast line or our borders, the space or the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong enough to ward off any threats against the country.

My beloved countrymen, 

Those who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep peacefully today. Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest person is increasing. An honest man now feels that his honesty matters. Today, we are celebrating a festival of honesty and there is no place for dishonesty. This gives us new hope. 

The law against Benami property was lying in limbo for years. Now, we have come up with a law against Benami Property. In such a short time, the government has confiscated Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores. When these things happen, the common man develops faith that the country is for the honest persons. 

The 'One Rank - One Pension' policy for our defence forces was stuck up for 30-40 years. Our government implemented it. When we fulfill the aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to protect the nation grows manifold. 

The country has many states and a Central Government. GST has shown the spirit of cooperative federalism and has given competitive cooperative federalism a new strength. The success of GST can be attributed to the hard work that has been put in to make it a success. Technology has made it look like a miracle. The global community is surprised how we were able to roll out GST in such a short time. It is a reflection of our capability and helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations. 

New systems are emerging. Today roads are being built at twice the speed. The railway tracks are being laid at double the speed. More than 14 thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after Independence, have been provided with electricity. Bank accounts of 29 crore people have been opened, more than 9 crore farmers have got Soil Health Card. More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer using the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW. The poor tribals have gained faith in the system. The person at the last mile of development now joins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead. 

Loans worth more than 8 crore have been sanctioned without guarantee to the youth for self-employment. The interest on bank loans have been lowered. Inflation is under control. If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest. In this way, the country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.

The times have changed. The government is determined to do all it says, like doing away with the interview process. 

In the labour sector alone, even a small businessman had to fill up to 50-60 forms, but we have now made it more convenient by reducing it to just 5-6 forms. I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying the process of Governance. By reiterating this we have enforced faster decision making. And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to repose faith in our governance.  

Dear Countrymen, 

India today has gained in stature across the globe. You will be happy to know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism. Many nations are proactively supporting us. 

Be it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is supporting us with critical information. We have joined hands with other nations in the combined fight against terrorism. I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and acknowledge our prowess. 

For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government, but we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility. We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again. 

On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people. The problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets - it will be solved by embracing all Kashmiris. Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians. Hence, neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all. And we are moving forward with this resolve.   

We shall take strict steps against terrorism. There is no question of being soft on terrorism or terrorists. We have been asking the extremists to join the mainstream. Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be heard for all. The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream. 

I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing extremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender and joined the mainstream.

Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders. I am delighted to announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners.  A portal is also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these brave hearts who have brought pride to the nation. The story of sacrifices made will certainly inspire the younger generations. 

With the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and transparency in the country.  Our fight against black money will continue; our fight against corruption will continue. With the intervention of technology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system.  We have been successful in infusing transparency in the system. People from around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.

A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his products to the Government. He doesn’t need any middle man. We have launched a portal called “GEM”. The Government is making procurement through this portal. We have been successful in bringing transparency at various levels.  

Brothers and Sisters, 

Implementation of Government schemes are gaining momentum. When a work is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed. It is not a matter of expenditure of money. When a work is stalled, the poor families are the ones who suffer the most.  

We can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of achieving that.  

I review Government Projects every month. A specific project came to my notice. It was a 42-year old project. 70-72 kilometres of Railway lines were to be laid, but the project was lying in limbo for the last 42 years.   

My brothers and sisters,  

When a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it possible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long years. It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor. We have taken care of all these things. We have been striving to bring in the changes through technology. Whether it is Geo-Technology or Space-Technology, we have tried to link all these technologies to bring in transformation. 

You must have seen that there was a time when tension prevailed between the Centre and the States for Urea and Kerosene. The Centre was like an elder brother while the State was treated like a younger brother. I have been a Chief Minister for a long time and I know the importance of states in the development of the country. I know the importance of the Chief Ministers and the State Governments. Hence , we laid emphasis on Co-operative Federalism. Now we are moving towards a Competitive Co-operative Federalism. You must have seen that we are taking all the decisions together.  

You may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the ramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power supply companies of the country. He expressed his concerns over the issue. Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve the issues with these power companies. It is a concrete example of federalism in its real sense. 

Whether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are being accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the States.  

My dear fellow countrymen,  

In the New India, the biggest strength is democracy. But we have reduced our democracy to mere ballot boxes. However, democracy cannot be confined only to ballot boxes.  Hence our resolve is to see to it that we have a democracy in New India, where people are not driven by the system, rather the system is driven by the people. Such a democracy should become the identity of New India and we want to move towards that direction.  

Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”.  In Independent India our Mantra should be “Good Governance is my birthright”. ‘Suraja’ or Good Governance should be our collective responsibility.  The citizens should fulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its responsibilities.  

When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind. For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy, the nation responded as a whole. I have spoken about cleanliness. Now people are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this cleanliness drive forward.  

When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised. People thought that this was the end of Modi. But the way our 125 crore countrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after another step in our drive against corruption. 

With this new practice of people’s participation, our effort to take the country forward with people’s involvement will help us to reach our goal. 

My dear fellow countrymen,  

Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.”  Our farmers have not looked back since then. They are now producing record harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities. There has been a record production of pulses this year.  

My dear brothers and sisters,  

India never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare occasions, it was only a few thousand tons. This year when they produced 16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took the historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce. 

Pradhan Mantri  Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our farmers. Three years back, this scheme which was running under a different name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers. Now over a short span of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit. The number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark. 

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of the farmers. If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from their fields. That is why I had made some announcements from the ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day. Out of those, we have completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon. I have resolved to complete 99 big projects. By completing those 99 big projects before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment. We cannot change the lot of our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his produce reaches the market. For this we need infrastructure and supply chain. Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of rupees are wasted. In order to change the situation, the government has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector. Government of India has launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna’ to encourage infrastructure building. Due to this, systems shall be put in place that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to marketing his produce. Such arrangements will usher in a new change in the lives of crores of our farmers. 

With the changes in demand and technology, the nature of jobs in our country has been changing. The Government has launched several new initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in which the training is imparted for the development of human resource according to the needs of the 21st century. We have launched a massive program to provide collateral free loans to the youth. Our youth should become independent, he should get the employment, he should become the provider of employment. Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri Mudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming self-dependent. It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one, two or three more people.  

In the education sector, we have taken an important step to grant the universities freedom from restrictions to make them the world class universities. We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny. The government will not interfere in their functioning. Besides, the government is willing to provide funds up to Rs. 1,000 crores.  We have appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our country will certainly come forward and make it a success.  

Over the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new IIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with job opportunities.  

My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in large numbers.  And therefore we have taken a very important step to reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the night also.  

Our mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families. Their contribution in making our future is extremely important. And that is why we have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks. 

In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’. There is no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a massive movement in the country.  They shook the conscience of the intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them and a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the  country. I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help them in this struggle. The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right. India will fully support them and they will ultimately achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women empowerment; I am fully confident about this. 

My dear countrymen,  

Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end up destroying the social fabric. The country is governed by peace, harmony and unity. The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the country. This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward taking everyone along. This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition. We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of faith, violence cannot be allowed.

If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free India?  It is the property of 125 crore Indians. Whose cultural legacy is this? This is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people. Whose faith is this? This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path of violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country. The country will never accept this. And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’. We have to take everyone and every section of the society along to take the country forward.  

In order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced development and next generation infrastructure. Only then, we  can realise the India of our dreams. 

Brothers and sisters,  

We have taken innumerable decisions over the past three years. Some have been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed. But one thing is important - when you move towards big changes, you will face hurdles. But look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a railway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from 60 to 30. The speed of the train decreases while changing the track. We are trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the speed. We have maintained the speed.  

We may have brought a number of new laws and systems such as the GST, but we have successfully accomplished the task and the work goes on. 

We have laid emphasis on infrastructure.  We have invested lot of funds for building the infrastructure – from modernization of the railway station in a small town, to build an Airport, to expand water-ways or roadways, to form a gas-grid or a water-grid or to lay down an optical fibre network. We are emphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.

My dear countrymen, 

The prosperity of Eastern India is required for India’s forward movement into the 21st century. It has tremendous potential, rich human resources, immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives. We are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, and the Northeast. These parts have to grow further. These are abundant in natural resources and are striving hard to take the country to new heights. 

Brothers and sisters,  

Making India corruption-free is an important task and we are trying to provide impetus to it. After forming the government, our first task was to constitute an SIT. Today, after three years, I want to tell the countrymen proudly that we have confiscated black money worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crores, the culprits would be brought to book and forced to surrender.  

Demonetization followed this move. We have achieved several milestones through demonetization. The hidden black money has been brought into the formal economy. You must have seen that we used to extend the days from 7 days to 10 days to 15 days; sometimes we allowed the old notes at the petrol pump, at the chemist shops, and sometimes at the railway stations, because our intention was to bring all money into the formal banking system and we achieved success in completing the task. According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after the demonetization. 

More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the scanner. Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the banks and this system has forced them to be accountable. It   has also stopped the flow of black money. The number of new taxpayers filing income tax returns from April 01 to August 05 is 56 lakhs while in the same period last year only 22 lakh filed the returns.. In a way it has more than doubled. This is the result of our fight against black money. 

Over 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is much higher than what their declared income and therefore they have to clarify this. Around 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the right path after accepting their mistakes. One lakh people, who had neither heard of Income Tax nor paid Income Tax, have now been forced to do so. 

Brothers and sisters,  

In our country, we tend to indulge in endless debates and discussions following the shutdown of companies.  People start speculating about economic meltdown and what not.  

You will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell companies. Post demonetization, the reports from data mining astonishingly revealed that there are 3 lakh shell companies dealing in Hawala transactions. Can anyone imagine? Out of these 3 lakh shell companies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.   

Even if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry. And here, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies. The looters of nation’s wealth will have to answer.  We have accomplished this task. 

You will be surprised to know that there are some shell companies operating from a single address. As many as 400 companies have been found to be operating from one address.  There was no one to question them. There was a total collusion.  

Therefore, Brothers and sisters, I have waged a big war against corruption and black money. We are fighting corruption - for the bright future of India and the wellbeing of our people.  

Brothers and sisters, 

We have taken several steps and I am sure that post GST, it will increase further and bring in transparency. Today a truck driver on an average is able to save 30% of his travel time from one point to another after GST was introduced. Hundreds of crores of rupees have been saved due to removal of check posts. This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency. Can you imagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian transportation sector? GST has brought this revolutionary change.  

My dear countrymen,  

Today due to demonetization, banks have enough liquidity. Banks are reducing their interest rates. Even a common man is able to access inflow of funds through Mudra. He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet. The middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own homes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates. Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.  

My dear countrymen,  

Time has changed. We are in the 21st Century. Our country boasts of the world’s largest youth population. 

India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World. Should we still remain in the old mind-set? There was a time when leather coins were in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist. Today we have paper-currency. Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital currency. We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital transactions. We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a part of our economic activities. We should also work through prepaid systems. I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital transactions. It has increased by 34% compared to last year while the prepaid transactions have gone up by  44%. We should move towards a less-cash economy.  

My Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for ensuring savings for the common man. If you use LED bulbs, you can save Rs.2000 to Rs. 5000 per year. If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will be able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have spent. Curbing inflation has helped people in saving money in a way.  

Cheap medicines through Jan Aushadhi Kendras are a boon to the poor. There used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents. We are striving to make it possible for knee operations as well. We are striving to minimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.  

Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals. Now we have decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level. We have already opened this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available for the poor.  

We can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to showcase to the world. We have been able to develop the ‘NAVIC Navigation System’ through GPS. We have helped the neighbouring countries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.  

We asserted our supremacy in the world by introducing Tejas aircraft. BHIM Aadhaar App for digital transaction has come as a surprise to the world. Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country. When all the cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the world.  

My dear countrymen, I shall urge you to take up the New India Pledge and move ahead.  Our scriptures say, “अनियत काल:, अनियत कालः प्रभुत्यो विपलवन्ते, प्रभुत्यो विपलवन्ते”.  It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work within the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired results. So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to take the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.  

We will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.   

So we will together build such an India where the poor will have Pucca House with electricity and water.  

Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry. They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today. 

Together we will build such an India where the youth, the women will have enough opportunities to fulfil their dreams. 

Together we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism. 

Together we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with corruption and nepotism.

Together we will build such an India which will be clean and healthy, and where the dream of Su-Raj will be fulfilled. 

And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move ahead in this march towards development.  

Let all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of grandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after completing 70 years of Independence in the next five years.  

With this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of our freedom movement. I bow my head before the new confidence and passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march on with this new pledge.  

With this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you. 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Matram, Jai Hind

Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind

Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai,

Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram,

Thanking you all.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 71st Independence Day. 

The Prime Minister recalled the great women and men who worked hard for India's freedom. He said the people of India stand shoulder to shoulder with those affected due to natural disasters, and the tragedy in Gorakhpur. 

The Prime Minister noted that the current year is special, because it marks the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement; the 100th anniversary of Champaran Satyagraha; and the 125th anniversary of the celebration of ‘Saarvjanik Ganesh Utsav’ – inspired by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. 


The Prime Minister said that the nation had shown its collective strength between 1942 and 1947, culminating in India’s independence. He said that we must show the same collective determination and resolve to create a New India by 2022. He emphasized that everyone is equal in our nation, and together we can bring about a qualitative transformation. 

The Prime Minister called for an end to the “chalta hai” attitude of complacency, and its replacement with an attitude of “badal sakta hai” for positive change. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that India’s security is our priority, and the surgical strike had underscored this. He added that India’s stature in the world is rising, and several countries are cooperating with India in fighting the menace of terrorism. On demonetization, he said that those who have looted the nation, and the poor, are not able to sleep peacefully, and honesty is being celebrated today. He asserted that the fight against black money will continue, and technology will help bring about transparency. He encouraged people to further promote digital transactions. 

The Prime Minister described the implementation of GST as a key illustration of cooperative federalism. He said the poor are joining the mainstream through initiatives of financial inclusion. He emphasized that good governance is about speed and simplification of processes. On Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister emphasized that neither abuses, nor bullets, but only embracing, can solve the problems in the State. (Na gaali se, na goli se, parivartan hoga gale lagaane se). 

Describing his vision for New India, the Prime Minister said that people would be the driving force behind the establishment, rather than the other way around – Tantra se Lok nahin, Lok se tantra chalega. 

The Prime Minister appreciated the farmers and the agriculture scientists for record crop production this year. He said the Government had procured 16 lakh tonnes of pulses this year, far in excess of the procurement of previous years. 

The Prime Minister said the changing nature of technology is resulting in the requirement of different skill-sets for employment. He also added that the youth is being nurtured to become job-creators, and not job-seekers.

Mentioning women who have to suffer due to Triple Talaq, the Prime Minister said that he admires the courage of those who have stood up against this practice, and added that the nation stands with them in their struggle. 

The Prime Minister said India stands for peace, unity, and harmony. He said casteism and communalism will not help us. He strongly condemned the use of violence in the name of faith, and said this will not be accepted in India. He said the call of the Quit India Movement was “Bharat Chhodo,” but the call today is “Bharat Jodo.”

The Prime Minister said significant attention is being paid to the development of eastern and north-eastern India. He said the Government has taken India on new tracks of development, without slackening pace. 

Quoting from scriptures, the Prime Minister said that if we do not take the right step at the right time, we do not achieve desired results. He said this is the right time for ‘Team India’ to resolve for ‘New India.’ 

He called for a New India where the poor would have houses, and access to water and electricity; where farmers would be free from worry, and would earn twice of what they earn today; youth and women would get ample opportunities to fulfil their dreams; an India free from terrorism, communalism, casteism, corruption and nepotism; and an India which is clean and healthy.

The Prime Minister announced the launch of a website to honour gallantry award winners.

                मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, आजादी के पावन पर्व पर देशवासियों को कोटि-कोटि शुभकामनाएं। 

आज पूरा देश स्वतंत्रता पर्व के साथ-साथ जन्‍माष्‍टमी का पर्व भी मना रहा है। मैं मेरे सामने देख रहा हूं, बहुत बड़ी संख्या में बाल-कन्‍हैया भी यहां उपस्थित हैं। सुदर्शन-चक्रधारी मोहन से ले करके चरखाधारी मोहन तक, हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक, ऐतिहासिक विरासत के हम सब धनी हैं। देश की आजादी के लिए, देश की आन-बान-शान के लिए, देश के गौरव के लिए जिन-जिन लोगों ने अपना योगदान दिया है, यातनाएं झेली हैं, बलिदान दिया है, त्‍याग और तपस्‍या की पराकाष्‍ठा की है, ऐसे सभी महानुभावों को, माता-बहनों को मैं लालकिले की प्राचीर से सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की तरफ से शत-शत नमन करता हूं, उनका आदर करता हूं। 

कभी-कभार प्राकृतिक आपदाएं हम लोगों के लिए बहुत बड़ी चुनौती बन जाती हैं। अच्‍छी वर्षा देश को फलने-फूलने में बहुत ही योगदान देती है, लेकिन जलवायु परिवर्तन का नतीजा है कि कभी-कभी यह प्राकृतिक आपदा संकट का रूप ले लेती है। पिछले दिनों देश के कई भू-भागों में इस प्राकृतिक आपदा का संकट आया। पिछले दिनों अस्‍पताल में हमारे मासूम बच्‍चों की मौत हुई। इस संकट की घड़ी में, दुख की घड़ी में सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की संवेदनाएं, इस आपत्ति में सबके साथ हैं। और मैं देशवासियों को विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं कि ऐसे संकट के समय पूर्ण संवेदनशीलता के साथ जन सामान्‍य की भलाई के लिए, सुरक्षा के लिए हम कुछ भी करने में कमी नहीं रहने देंगे। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों यह वर्ष आजाद भारत के लिए एक विशेष वर्ष है। अभी पिछले सप्‍ताह ही Quit India Movement का 75 साल हमने स्‍मरण किया। यह वर्ष है, जब चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह की शताब्‍दी मना रहे हैं। यह वर्ष है जब साबरमती आश्रम की शताब्‍दी का भी वर्ष है। यह वर्ष है, जब लोकमान्‍य तिलक जी, जिन्‍होंने कहा था स्‍वराज मेरा जन्‍मसिद्ध अधिकार है। 

उन्होंने जनचेतना जगाने के लिए सार्वजनिक गणेश उत्‍सव की परंपरा को प्रारंभ किया था, उसको भी 125वां वर्ष, एक प्रकार से इतिहास की ऐसी तारीख है जिसका स्‍मरण, जिसका बौध-पाठ हमें देश के लिए कुछ न कुछ करने की प्रेरणा देता है। हम आज आजादी के 70 वर्ष और 2022 में आजादी के 75 साल मनाएंगे, ये वैसा ही है जिस तरह 1942 से 1947 देश ने सामूहिक शक्ति का प्रदर्शन किया था। अंग्रेजों की नाक में दम कर दिया और पांच साल के भीतर-भीतर अंग्रेजों को हिन्‍दुस्‍तान छोड़कर के जाना पड़ा। हमें..आजादी के 75 साल के पांच साल अभी हमारे पास हैं। हमारी सामूहिक संकल्‍प शक्ति, हमारा सामूहिक पुरूषार्थ, हमारी सामूहिक प्रतिबद्धता उन महान देशभक्‍तों को याद करते हुए परिश्रम की पराकाष्‍ठा, 2022 में आजादी के दीवानों के सपनों के अनुरूप भारत बनाने के लिए काम आ सकती है और इसलिए New India का एक संकल्‍प लेकर के हमें देश को आगे बढ़ाना है। 

सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के संकल्‍प से, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के पुरूषार्थ से, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के त्‍याग और तपस्‍या से और हम जानते हैं सामूहिकता की शक्ति क्‍या होती है। भगवान कृष्‍ण कितने ही सार्मथ्‍यवान थे लेकिन जब ग्‍वाले अपनी लकड़ी लेकर के खड़े हो गए, एक सामूहिक शक्ति थी गौवर्धन पर्वत उठा लिया था। प्रभु रामचंद्र जी को लंका जाना था वानर सेना के छोटे-छोटे लोग लग गए, रामसेतु बन गया, रामजी लंका पहुंच गए। एक मोहनदास कर्मचंद गांधी थे देश के कोटि-कोटि लोग हाथ में तकली लेकर के, रूई लेकर के आजादी के ताने-बाने बुनते थे। एक सामूहिक शक्ति की ताकत थी कि देश आजाद हो गया। कोई छोटा नहीं होता, कोई बड़ा नहीं होता, अरे एक गिलहरी का उदाहरण हमें मालूम है, एक गिलहरी भी परिवर्तन की प्रक्रिया की हिस्‍सेदार बनती है, वो कथा हम सब जानते हैं और इसलिए सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों में ने कोई छोटा है न कोई बड़ा है। हर कोई अपनी जगह से 2022 के आजादी के बाद के 75 साल एक नया संकल्‍प, एक नया इंडिया, नई ऊर्जा, नया पुरूषार्थ सामूहिक शक्ति के द्वारा हम देश में परिवर्तन ला सकते हैं। ‘New India’ जो सुरक्षित हो, समृद्ध हो, शक्तिशाली हो, ‘New India’ जहां भी हर किसी को समान अवसर उपलब्‍ध हो, ‘New India’ जहां आधुनिक विज्ञान और तकनीकी क्षेत्र में भारत का विश्‍व में दबदबा हो। 

स्‍वतंत्रता संग्राम हम लोगों की भावना से अधिक जुड़ा हुआ है। हम भली-भांति जानते हैं कि आजादी का जब आंदोलन चल रहा था तब एक शिक्षक भी स्कूल में पढ़ाई कराता था। एक किसान खेत में काम करता था, एक मजदूर मजदूरी करता था, लेकिन जो भी जो करता था उसके हृदय के मन मंदिर में उसके भाव-जगत में ये भाव था कि मैं जो काम कर रहा हूं देश की आजादी के लिए कर रहा हूं। ये भाव ये बहुत बड़ी महत्‍वपूर्ण ताकत होता है। परिवार में भी खाना रोज पकता है। व्‍यंजन सब प्रकार के बनते हैं लेकिन जो वो व्‍यंजन भगवान के सामने भोग के रूप में चढ़ा दिये जाते हैं, तो व्‍यंजन प्रसाद बन जाते हैं । हम परिश्रम करते हैं लेकिन मां भारती की भव्‍यता के लिए, दिव्यता के लिए, देशवासियों को गरीबी से मुक्‍त कराने के लिए, सामाजिक ताने-बाने को सही ढंग से बुनने के लिए हमारे हर कर्तव्‍य को राष्‍ट्रभाव से, राष्‍ट्र-भक्ति से, राष्‍ट्र को समर्पित करते हुए करते हैं तो परिणाम की ताकत अनेक गुना बढ़ जाती है। और इसलिए हम सब उस बात को ले करके आगे चलें। 

ये वर्ष 2018 का, आने वाला 18, 1 जनवरी, मैं इसे सामान्‍य 1 जनवरी नहीं मानता। जिन लोगों ने 21वीं शताब्‍दी में जन्‍म लिया है, उनके लिए यह महत्‍वपूर्ण वर्ष है। 21वीं शताब्‍दी में जन्‍मे हुए नौजवानों के लिए, ये वर्ष उनके जीवन का लिए निर्णायक वर्ष है। वो 18 साल के जब-जब होंगे, वो 21वीं सदी के भाग्‍य-विधाता होने वाले हैं। 21वीं सदी का भाग्‍य ये नौजवान बनाएंगे जिनका जन्‍म 21वीं सदी में हुआ है, और अब 18 साल होने पर है। मैं इन सभी नौजवानों का हृदय से बहुत-बहुत स्‍वागत करता हूं, सम्‍मान करता हूं और उनका अभिनंदन करता हूं कि आइए, आप अब 18 साल की दहलीज पर आ करके खड़े हैं। देश का भाग्‍य निर्माण करने का आपको अवसर मिल रहा है। आप देश की विकास यात्रा में बहुत तेजी से भागीदार बनिए, देश आपको निमंत्रण देता है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, जब कुरूक्षेत्र के युद्ध में, मैदान में अर्जुन ने श्रीकृष्‍ण से ढेर सारे सवाल पूछे, तब कृष्‍ण ने अर्जुन से कहा था, जैसा मन का भाव होता है वैसा ही कार्य परिणाम होता है। और उन्‍होंने कहा है, मनुष्‍य जिस बात पर विश्‍वास करता है, वो ही उसको परिणाम भी नजर आता है, वही दिशा उसको नजर आती है। हमारे लिए भी, अगर मन का विश्‍वास पक्‍का होगा, उज्‍ज्‍वल भारत के लिए हम संकल्‍पबद्ध होंगे, तो मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि जो पहले से हम बार-बार निराशा से पले-बढ़े हैं, अब हमें आत्‍मविश्‍वास से आगे बढ़ना है; हमें निराशा को छोड़ना है। चलता है! ये तो ठीक है! अरे चलने दो! मैं समझता हूं, चलता है का जमाना चला गया, अब तो आवाज यही उठी कि बदला है, बदल रहा है, बदल सकता है; यही विश्‍वास हमारे भीतर होगा, तो हम भी उस विश्‍वास के अनुसार….साधक हो, साधन हो, सामर्थ्‍य हो, संसाधन हो, लेकिन जब ये त्‍याग और तपस्‍या से जुड़ जाते हैं, कुछ करने के इरादे से बन जाते हैं; तो अपने-आप बहुत बड़ा परिवर्तन आता है और संकल्‍प सिद्धि में परिवर्तित हो जाता है। 

भाइयो, बहनों आजाद भारत में, हर देशवासी के दिल में देश की रक्षा-सुरक्षा एक बहुत स्‍वाभाविक बात है। हमारा देश, हमारी सेनाएं, हमारे वीर पुरुष, हर Uniformed Forces, कोई भी हो, सिर्फ Army, Air Force, Navy नहीं, सारे Uniformed Forces, उन्‍होंने जब-जब मौका आया है; अपना करतब दिखाया है, अपना सामर्थ्‍य दिखाया है, बलिदान की पराकाष्‍ठा करने में ये हमारे वीर कभी पीछे नहीं रहे हैं। चाहे Left-Wing Extremism हो, चाहे आतंकवाद हो, चाहे infiltrators हो, चाहे हमारे भीतर कठिनाइयां पैदा करने वाले तत्‍व हों, हमारे देश के इन Uniform में रहने वाले लोगों ने बलिदान की पराकाष्ठा की है। और जब Surgical Strike हुई, दुनिया को हमारा लोहा मानना पड़ा, हमारे लोगों की ताकत को मानना पड़ा। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, यह साफ है कि देश की सुरक्षा हमारी प्राथमिकता है, आंतरिक सुरक्षा हमारी प्राथमिकता है। समुद्र हो या सीमा हो, Cyber हो या Space हो, हर प्रकार की सुरक्षा भारत अपने आप में सामर्थ्यवान है और देश के खिलाफ कुछ भी करने वालों के हौसले पस्त होने के लिए हम ताकतवर है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशावासियों, गरीबों को लूटकर के तिजोरी भरने वाले लोग आज भी चैन की नींद नहीं सो पा रहे हैं और उससे मेहनतकश और ईमानदार व्यक्ति का भरोसा बढ़ता है। ईमानदार को लगता है कि हां, अब मैं ईमानदारी के रास्ते पर चलूंगा तो मेरी ईमानदारी का भी कोई मूल्य है। आज माहौल बना है कि ईमानदारी का महोत्सव मनाया जा रहा है, ईमानदारी का उत्सव मनाया जा रहा है और बेईमानी के लिए सिर छुपाने की जगह नहीं बच रही है। ये काम एक नया भरोसा देता है। 

बेनामी संपत्ति रखने वाले, कितने सालों तक कानून लटके पड़े थे। अभी-अभी तो हमने कानून की विधिवत रूप से व्यवस्था आगे बढ़ाई। इतने कम समय में 800 करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा बेनामी संपत्ति सरकार ने जब्त कर ली है। जब ये चीज होती है तब सामान्य मानव के मन में एक विश्वास पैदा होता है कि ये देश ईमानदार लोगों के लिए है। 

30-40 वर्ष से हमारी सेना के लिए ‘वन रैंक - वन पेंशन’ मामला अटका हुआ था। जब ‘वन रैंक - वन पेंशन’ का अटका हुआ मामला, सरकार उसको पूर्ण करती है। हमारे फौजियों की आशा-आकांक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने की दिशा में सही कदम उठाती है, तो देश के लिए मर-मिटने की ताकत उनकी और बढ़ जाती है। 

देश में अनेक राज्य हैं, केन्द्र सरकार है। हमने देखा है कि GST के द्वारा देश में Cooperative Federalism, Competitive Cooperative Federalism को एक नई ताकत दी है, एक नया परिणाम नज़र आया है। और GST जिस प्रकार से सफल हुआ है, कोटि-कोटि मानव working hours उसके पीछे लगे हैं। Technology में एक miracle है, विश्व के लोगों को अजूबा लगता है कि इतने कम समय में इतने बड़े देश में GST का इस प्रकार से roll-out होना, ये अपने आप में, हिन्दुस्तान में कितना सामर्थ्य है, देश की हर पीढ़ी को एक विश्वास जगाने के लिए काम आता है। 

नई व्यवस्थाएं जन्म लेती हैं। आज दुगुनी रफ्तार से सड़के बन रही हैं, आज दुगुनी रफ्तार से रेलवे की पटरियां बिछाई जा रही हैं, आज 14 हजार से ज्यादा गांव, जो आजादी के बाद भी अंधेरे में पड़े हुए थे, वहां तक बिजली पहुंचाई जा चुकी है और देश उजाले की तरफ बढ़ रहा है वो हम साफ देख रहे हैं। 29 करोड़ गरीबों के जब Bank Accounts खुलते हैं, किसानों के नौ करोड़ से ज्यादा Soil Health Card निकलते हैं, ढ़ाई करोड़ से ज्यादा गरीब माताओं-बहनों को लकड़ी के चूल्हे से मुक्ति मिलकर के, गैस का चूल्हा मिलता है। गरीब आदिवासी का एक हौसला बुलंद हो जाता है। गरीब व्यक्ति मुख्यधारा में जुड़ता है और देश प्रगति की ओर आगे बढ़ रहा है। 

युवाओं को बिना गारंटी स्वरोजगार के लिए आठ करोड़ से ज्यादा loan की स्वीकृति मिलती है। बैंक से मिलने वाले कर्ज में ब्याज दरों में कमी होती है। महंगाई पर नियंत्रण होता है। मध्यम वर्ग का मानवय अगर अपना घर बनाना चाहता है तो उसको घर बनाने के लिए कम ब्याज दर से पैसे मुहैया कराए जाते है। तब जाकर के देश के लिए कुछ करने के लिए, देश आगे बढ़ेगा, इस विश्वास के साथ देश का जनसामान्य मानव जुड़ता रहता है। 

वक्त बदल चुका है। आज सरकार जो कहती है वो करने के लिए संकल्पबद्ध नजर आती है। चाहे हमने इंटरव्यू खत्म करने की बात की हो, चाहे हमने process को खत्म करने की बात की हो। अकेले labour field में, सामान्य छोटे से कारोबारी को भी 50-60 form भरने पड़ते थे, उसको हम कम करके सिर्फ पांच फॉर्म में ले आए हैं। कहने का तात्पर्य यह है, मैं ढेर सारे उदाहरण दे सकता हूं, कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि Good Governance, Governance की process को simplify करना, उस दिशा में बल देने का परिणाम है कि आज तेज़ गति आई है, निर्णयों में तेज़ गति आई है। और इसलिये सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी इस विश्वास को लेकर आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, आज भारत की साख विश्व में बढ़ रही है। आतंकवाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई, मेरे देशवासियों आपको जानकर के खुशी होगी आतंकवाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई में आज हम अकेले नहीं हैं। दुनिया के कई देश हमें सक्रिय रूप से मदद कर रहे हैं। हवाला का कारोबार हो, तो दुनिया हमें जानकारी दे रही है। आतंकवादियों की गतिविधियों के संबंध में, विश्व हमें जानकारियां दे रहा है। हम विश्व के साथ कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर के आतंकवादियों के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ रहे हैं। मैं विश्व के जो-जो देश, हमें इस काम में भली -भांति मदद कर रहे हैं, भारत की साख का गौरव बढ़ा रहे हैं, मैं उनका हृदय से अभिनन्दन करना चाहता हूं और यही वैश्विक हमारे संबंध भारत की शांति एवं सुरक्षा में भी एक नया आयाम जोड़ रहे हैं, एक नया बल दे रहे हैं। 

जम्मू-कश्मीर का विकास, जम्मू-कश्मीर की उन्नति, जम्मू-कश्मीर के सामान्य नागरिक के सपनों को पूरा करने का प्रयास, ये जम्मू-कश्मीर की सरकार के साथ-साथ, हम देशवासियों का भी संकल्प है। फिर से एक बार इस स्वर्ग को हम अनुभव करें, उस स्थिति में लाने के लिये हम प्रतिबद्ध हैं, हम कटिबद्ध हैं। और इसलिये मैं कहना चाहता हूं, कश्मीर के अंदर जो कुछ भी होता है, बयानबाजी भी बहुत होती हैं, आक्षेप प्रतिआक्षेप भी बहुत होते हैं, हर कोई एक दूसरे को गाली देने में लगा रहता है। लेकिन भाइयों बहनों, मैं साफ मानता हूं कि कश्मीर में जो कुछ भी घटनाएं घटती हैं, अलगाववादी, मुट्ठीभर अलगाववादी, ये अलगाववादी जिस प्रकार के नये-नये पैंतरे रचते रहते हैं, लेकिन उस लड़ाई को जीतने के लिये मेरे दिमाग में विषय साफ है। ‘न गाली से समस्या सुलझने वाली है, न गोली से समस्या सुलझने वाली है, समस्या सुलझेगी हर कश्मीरी को गले लगा कर के सुलझने वाली है’ और सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी यही परम्परा से पला बड़ा है। और इसलीये ‘न गाली से न गोली से, परिवर्तन होगा गले लगाकर के’ और उस संकल्प को लेकर के हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। 

आतंकवाद के खिलाफ किसी भी प्रकार की नरमी नहीं बरती जाएगी। आतंकवादियों को बार - बार हमने कहा है कि आप मुख्यधारा में आइये भारत के लोकतंत्र में आपको बात करने के लिये पूरा अधिकार है, पूरी व्यवस्था है। और मुख्यधारा ही है जो हर किसी के जीवन में नई ऊर्जा भर सकती है। 

और इसलिये मुझे खुशी है कि हमारे सुरक्षाबलों के प्रयासों से कर के Left-Wing Extremism के इलाके में बहुत बड़ी संख्या में नौजवान वापस आए surrender किये मुख्यधारा में आने की दिशा में उन्होंने प्रयास किया। 

सीमा की रक्षा के लिये हमारे जवान तैनात हैं। मुझे खुशी है कि आज भारत सरकार एक ऐसी website launch कर रही है, जो Gallantry Award विजेता है, हमारे देश को गौरव दिलाने वाले लोग हैं, उनकी पूरी जानकारियों के साथ आज एक Gallantry Award प्राप्त करने वालों पर आधारित एक Portal भी प्रारंभ किया जा रहा है, जिससे देश की नई पीढ़ी को हमारे इन वीर बलिदानियों के बारे में बहुत सारी जानकारियां प्राप्त हो सकती हैं। 

Technology की मदद से, देश में ईमानदारी को बल देने का हम लोगों का भरपूर प्रयास है। कालेधन के खिलाफ हमारी लड़ाई जारी रहेगी। भ्रष्टचार के खिलाफ हमारी लड़ाई जारी रहेगी। और हमने धीरे-धीरे Technology को intervene करते हुए AADHAR की व्‍यवस्‍था को जोड़ते हुए, transparency लाने की दिशा में अनेक विद्द-सफल प्रयास किए हैं और दुनिया के अनेक लोग भारत के इस मॉडल की चर्चा भी करते हैं और उसका अध्‍ययन भी करते हैं। 

सरकार में भी खरीदी करने में अब छोटा-सा व्‍यक्ति भी हजारों किलोमीटर दूर बैठा गांव का व्‍यक्ति भी सरकार को अपना माल supply कर सकता है, अपने product supply कर सकता है। उसको बड़े की जरूरत नहीं है, बिचौलिए की जरूरत नहीं है। GEM नाम का एक पोर्टल बनाया है, GEM उसके द्वारा government procure कर रही है। बहुत सारी मात्रा में transparency लाने में सफलता मिली है। 

भाईयों-बहनों, सरकारी की योजनाओं में रफ्तार बढ़ी है। जब सरकार, किसी काम में विलंब हो जाता है, तो सिर्फ वो प्रोजेक्‍ट विलंब नहीं होता। वो सिर्फ धन के खर्चें से जुड़ा हुआ विषय नहीं होता है। जब कोई भी काम अटक जाता है, रूक जाता है तो सबसे ज्‍यादा नुकसान मेरे गरीब परिवारों को होता है। मेरे भाईयो-बहनों को होता है। हम नौ महीने के भीतर-भीतर मंगलयान पहुंच सकते हैं। यह हमारा सामर्थ्‍य है। नौ महीने के भीतर-भीतर यहां से मंगलयान पहुंच सकते हैं। लेकिन मैंने एक बार सरकार के काम का लेखा-जोखा हर महीने लेता रहता हूं। एक बार ऐसी बात मेरे ध्‍यान में आई, 42 साल पुराना एक प्रोजेक्‍ट, 70-72 किलोमीटर का प्रोजेक्‍ट, रेल का 42 साल से अटका पड़ा, लटका पड़ा था। भाईयों-बहनों नौ महीने में मंगलयान पहुंचने का सामर्थ्‍य रखने वाला मेरा देश 42 साल तक 70-72 किलोमीटर एक रेल की पटरी न बिछा सके, तब गरीब के मन में सवाल उठता है कि मेरे देश का क्‍या होगा? और ऐसी चीजों पर हमने ध्‍यान दिया है। इन चीजों में बदलाव लाने के लिए हमने नई-नई टैक्‍नोलोजी Geo-Technology का विषय हो, Space-Technology का विषय हो इन सारी चीजों को जोड़ करके हमने उसमें परिवर्तन लाने का प्रयास किया है। 

आपने देखा होगा एक समय था जब यूरिया के लिए राज्‍य और केंद्र में तनाव चलता था। केरोसीन के लिए राज्‍य और केंद्र के लिए तनाव चलता था। एक ऐसा माहौल था, जैसे केंद्र बड़ा भाई, राज्‍य छोटा भाई है। हमने पहले दिन से जिस दिशा में काम किया, क्‍योंकि लम्‍बे अरसे से मुख्‍यमंत्री रहा हूं, इसलिए मुझे पता है कि देश के विकास में राज्‍यों की कितनी अहमियत है। मुख्‍यमंत्रियों का कितना महत्‍व है, राज्‍यों की सरकारों का कितना महत्‍व है, इसको मैं भली-भांति समझता हूं और इसलिए Co-operative Federalism और अब Competitive Co-operative Federalism उस पर हमने बल दिया है और आपने देखा होगा कि आज मिल करके सारे निर्णय, हम मिल करके कर रहे हैं। 

आपको याद होगा इसी लालकिले की प्राचीर से एक बार देश के राज्‍यो की बिजली कंपनियों की दुर्दशा की चर्चा एक प्रधानमंत्री ने की थी। लाल किले पर से चिंता व्‍यक्‍त करनी पड़ी थी। आज हमने राज्‍यों को साथ ले कर के ‘उदय योजना’ के द्वारा राज्यों को ताकत दे करके उस बिजली के कारखानों के कारोबार में यह समस्‍याएं थी, उसका समाधान का काम मिल करके किया, यह Federalism का एक बहुत बड़ा सबूत है। 

GST के साथ-साथ चाहे Smart City के निर्माण की बात हो, चाहे स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान हो, चाहे टॉयलेट की चर्चा हो, Ease of doing Business की बात हो, यह सारे विषय ऐसे हैं कि हमारे देश के सभी राज्‍य कंधे से कंधा मिला करके आज भारत के साथ भारत की सरकार, कंधे से कंधा मिला करके राज्‍य के साथ चलने में बहुत सफल हो रही है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों ‘New India’ हमारी सबसे बड़ी ताकत है, लोकतंत्र है। लेकिन हम जानते हैं कि हमने लोकतंत्र को मत-पत्र तक सीमित कर दिया है। लोकतंत्र मत-पत्र तक सीमित नहीं हो सकता। और इसलिए हम ‘New India’ में उस लोकतंत्र पर बल देना चाहते हैं जिसमें तंत्र से लोक नहीं, लेकिन लोगों से तंत्र चले, ऐसा लोकतंत्र ‘New India’ की पहचान बने, उस दिशा में हम जाना चाहते हैं। 

लोकमान्‍य तिलक जी ने कहा था, ‘स्‍वराज्‍य मेरा जन्‍मसिद्ध अधिकार है’। आजाद भारत मे हम सबका मंत्र होना चाहिए, ‘सुराज्‍य मेरा जन्‍मसिद्ध अधिकार है’। ‘सुराज्‍य’ हम सबका दायित्‍व होना चाहिए। नागरिक को अपनी जिम्‍मेदारियां निभानी चाहिए, सरकारों ने अपनी जिम्‍मेदारियां निभानी चाहिए। 

‘स्वराज्य से सुराज्‍य’ की ओर जब चलना है, तो देशवासी पीछे नहीं रहते। जब मैंने गैस सब्सिडी छोड़ने के लिए कहा, देश आगे आया। स्वच्छता की बात कही, आज भी हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में कोई न कोई स्वच्छता के अभियान को आगे बढ़ा रहा है। जब नोटबंदी की बात आई, दुनिया को आश्‍चर्य हुआ था, यहां तक लोग कह रहे थे, अब मोदी गया। लेकिन नोटबंदी में सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों ने जिस धैर्य को दिखाया, जिस विश्‍वास को बताया और उसी का परिणाम है कि आज भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ नकेल लगाने में हम एक के बाद कदम उठाने में सफल हो रहे हैं। हमारे देश के लिए इस नई लोकभागीदारी की परंपरा...जनभागीदारी से ही देश को आगे बढ़ाने में हमारा प्रयास है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री ने जय जवान जय किसान का मंत्र दिया था। हमारे देश के किसान ने पीछे मुड़ के कभी देखा नहीं, रिकॉर्ड फसल उत्‍पादन आज हमारा किसान करके दे रहा है। प्राकृतिक आपदाओं के बीच में नई–नई सिद्धियां वो हासिल कर रहा है। दाल का रिकॉर्ड उत्‍पादन हुआ है और मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयो बहनों, मेरे किसान भाईयो बहनों, हिंदुस्तान में कभी भी सरकार में दाल खरीदने की परंपरा ही नहीं रही है और कभी एक-आध बार किया हो तो हजारों में ही हजारों टन के हिसाब के हिसाब से होता था, इस बार जब मेरे देश के किसानों ने दाल उत्‍पादन करके गरीब को पौष्टिक आहार देने का काम किया, तो 16 लाख टन दाल, सरकार ने खरीदने का ऐतिहासिक काम करके इस काम को बढ़ावा दिया। 

प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना, एक सुरक्षा कवच मेरे किसान भाईयों को मिला है। तीन साल पहले सिर्फ सवा तीन करोड़ किसान इस प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना, जो पहले दूसरे नाम से चलती थी उसका लाभ लेते थे। आज प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना में इतने कम समय में कई नये किसान इसके साथ जुड़ गए हैं और करीब-करीब ये संख्‍या आगे चलकर के पौने छह करोड़ पर पहुंची है। 

प्रधानमंत्री कृषि सिंचाई योजना, किसान को अगर पानी मिले तो मिट्टी में से सोना पैदा करने की ताकत रखता है और इसलिए किसान को पानी पहुंचाने के लिए मैंने पिछली बार लालकिले से कहा था, उन योजानाओं में से 21 योजना हम पूर्ण कर चुके हैं और बाकी 50 योजनाएं आने वाले कुछ समय में पूर्ण हो जाएंगी। और total 99 योजनाओं का मैंने संकल्‍प लिया है। 2019 के पहले उन 99 बड़ी-बडी योजनाएं को परिपूर्ण करके, किसान के खेत तक पानी पहुंचाने का काम हम पूर्ण कर देंगे। और किसान को बीज से बाजार तक, जब तक हम व्‍यस्‍था नहीं देते हैं, हमारे किसान के भाग्‍य को हम नहीं बदल सकते हैं। और इसलिए उसके लिए infrastructure चाहिए, उसके लिए supply-chain चाहिए। हर साल लाखों-करोड़ों रुपयों की हमारी सब्‍जी, हमारे फल, हमारी फसल बर्बाद हो जाती है और इसलिए उसको बदलने के लिए एक तो Foreign Direct Investment को बढ़ावा दिया ताकि food processing के अंदर दुनिया हमारे साथ जुड़े। 

Infrastructure बनाने के लिए बढ़ावा दिया और भारत सरकार ने ‘प्रधानमंत्री किसान संपदा योजना’ लागू की है। जिसके कारण उन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का निर्माण किया जाएगा जो बीज से बाजार तक किसान को hand-holding करेंगे, व्‍यवस्‍थाएं विकसित करेंगे और हमारे करोड़ों किसानों की जिंदगी में एक नया बदलाव लाने में हम सफल होंगे। 

Demand और Technology के कारण, हमारे देश में nature of job में भी बहुत बड़ा बदलाव आ रहा है। रोजगार से जुड़ी योजनाओं में, training के तरीके में 21वीं सदी की आवश्‍यकताओं के अनुसार, मानव संसाधन के विकास के लिए भारत सरकार ने अनेक नई योजनाएं हाथ में ली हैं। नौजवानों को बिना गारंटी बैंकों से पैसा मिले इसके लिए बहुत बड़ा अभियान चलाया है। हमारा नौजवान अपने पैरों पर खड़ा हो, वो रोजगार पाने वाला रहे, रोजगार देने वाला बने, और पिछले तीन साल में देखा है कि ‘प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना’ के कारण करोड़ों नौजवान अपने पैरों पर खड़े हुए हैं। इतना ही नहीं, एक नौजवान एक या दो तीन और लोगों को भी रोजगार दे रहा है। 

शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में World Class Universities बनाने के लिए हमने बंधनों से मुक्‍ति देने का एक बड़ा अहम कदम उठाया है। 20 यूनिवर्सिटियों का आह्वान किया है कि आप अपने भाग्‍य का फैसला कीजिए, सरकार कहीं बीच में नहीं आएगी। ऊपर से सरकार 1000 करोड़ रुपये तक की मदद करने के लिए भी तैयार है। आह्वान किया है, मुझे विश्‍वास है मेरे देश की शिक्षा संस्‍थाओं में जरूर आगे आएंगे, इसको सफल करेंगे। 

पिछले तीन वर्ष में 6 IIT, 7 नए IIM, 8 नए IIIT, इसका निर्माण किया है और शिक्षा को नौकरी के अवसरों के साथ जोड़ने का भी इस को काम हमने किया है। 

मेरी माताएं, बहनें आज बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में, परिवार में महिलाएं भी रोजगार के लिए जाती हैं। और इसलिए रात्रि को भी उनको रोजगार का अवसर मिले, फैक्‍टरियों में काम करने का अवसर मिले, इसलिए Labour Laws में परिवर्तन करने का बहुत बड़ा अहम कदम उठाया है। 

हमारी माताएं, बहनें परिवार की भी एक अहम इकाई हैं। हमारा भविष्‍य निर्माण करने के लिए हमारी माताओं, बहनों का योगदान बहुत बड़ा होता है, और इसलिए Maternity Leave जो 12 सप्‍ताह की थी, वो 26 सप्‍ताह, उसमें आय चालू रहेगी, इस प्रकार से देने का काम किया है। 

मैं आज हमारी महिलाओं के सशक्तिकरण के काम के संबंध में, मैं खास करके, मैं उन बहनों का अभिनंदन करना चाहता हूं जो तीन तलाक के कारण बहुत ही दुर्दव्‍य जिंदगी जीने के लिए मजबूर हुई हैं। कोई आश्रय नहीं बचा है, और ऐसी पीड़ित, तीन-तलाक से पीड़ित बहनों ने पूरे देश में एक आंदोलन खड़ा किया है। देश के बुद्धिजीवी वर्ग को हिला दिया, देश के मीडिया ने भी उनकी मदद की, पूरे देश में तीन-तलाक के खिलाफ एक माहौल निर्माण हुआ। इस आंदोलन को चलाने वाली उन मेरी बहनों को, जो तीन-तलाक के खिलाफ लडाई लड़ रही हैं, मैं हृदय से उनका अभिनदंन करता हूं और मुझे विश्‍वास है, कि माताओं-बहनों को अधिकार दिलाने में, उनकी इस लड़ाई में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान उनकी पूरी मदद करेगा। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान पूरी मदद करेगा और Women Empowerment के इस महत्‍वपूर्ण कदम में वो सफल होके रहेगी; ऐसा मुझे पूरा भरोसा है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियो, कभी-कभी आस्‍था के नाम पर धैर्य के अभाव में कुछ लोग ऐसी चीजें कर बैठते हैं, जो समाज के ताने-बाने को बिखेर देती हैं। देश शांति, सद्भावना और एकता से चलता है। जातिवाद का जहर, सम्‍प्रदायवाद का जहर, देश का कभी भला नहीं कर सकता है। ये तो गांधी की भूमि है, बुद्ध की भूमि है, सबको साथ ले करके चलना; ये इस देश की संस्‍कृति और परम्‍परा का हिस्‍सा है। हमें इसको सफलता से आगे बढ़ाना है, और इसलिए आस्‍था के नाम पर हिंसा को बल नहीं दिया जा सकता है। 

अस्‍पताल में तो patient के साथ कुछ हो जाए, अस्‍पताल जला दिया जाए; अकस्‍मात् हो जाए, गाड़ियां जला दिया जाएं; आंदोलन करें, सरकारी संपत्ति को जला दिया जाए; आजाद हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के लिए ये किसका है? हमारे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की संपत्‍ति‍ है। ये सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत किसकी है? ये हम सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत है। ये आस्‍था किसकी है? हम सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की आस्‍था है; और इसलिए आस्‍था के नाम पर हिंसा का रास्‍ता, इस देश में कभी भी चल नहीं सकता, यह देश कभी स्‍वीकार नहीं कर सकता है। और इसलिए मैं देशवासियों से आग्रह करूंगा, उस समय ‘भारत छोड़ो’ का नारा था, आज नारा है ‘भारत जोड़ो’। व्‍यक्‍ति-व्‍यक्‍ति को हमने साथ लेना है, जन-जन को साथ लेना है, समाज के हर तबके को साथ लेना है, और उसी को ले करके हमें देश को आगे बढ़ाना है। 

समृद्ध भारत बनाने के लिए हमारी मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था चाहिए। संतुलित विकास चाहिए, next generation infrastructure चाहिए, तब जा कर के हमारे सपनों के भारत को हम अपनी आंखों के सामने देख सकते हैं। 

भाइयो-बहनों, अनगिनत निर्णय हमने तीन साल में लिए। कुछ चीजों को नोटिस किया गया है और कुछ चीजें शायद नोटिस में नहीं आई। लेकिन एक बात महत्वपूर्ण है। जब आप इतना बड़ा बदलाव करते है तो रुकवाटें आती हैं, गति रुक जाती है। लेकिन इस सरकार की कार्यशैली देखिए, अगर ट्रेन भी किसी रेलवे स्टेशन के पास से गुजरती है, जब ट्रैक बदलती है तो 60 से चलने वाली speed को उसको 30 की speed में लाना पड़ता है। ट्रैक बदलने पर ट्रेन की speed कम हो जाती है। हम पूरे देश को एक नए ट्रैक पर ले जाने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं, लेकिन हमने उसकी speed कम नहीं होने दी है, हमने उसकी गति को बरकरार रखा है। चाहे GST लाएं हो, कोई भी कानून लाएं हो, कोई भी नई व्यवस्था लाए हो, हम उसको करने में सफल हुए है और आगे भी इसको हम करेंगे। 

हमने infrastructure पर बल दिया है। अभूतपूर्व खर्च infrastructure पर दिए जा रहे हैं। रेलवे स्टेशन का आधुनिकीकरण हो, छोटे शहर में, चाहे एयरपोर्ट बनाना हो, चाहे water-way की व्यवस्था करनी हो, चाहे roadways की व्यवस्था करनी हो, चाहे गैस grid बनानी हो, चाहे पानी की grid करानी हो, चाहे optical fibre network करना हो, हर प्रकार के आधुनिक infrastructure पर हम पूर्ण बल दे रहे हैं। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, 21वीं सदी में भारत को आगे बढ़ाने का सबसे ऊर्जावान क्षेत्र है, हमारा पूर्वी हिन्दुस्तान। इतना potential है, सामर्थ्यवान मानव संसाधन है, अपार प्राकृतिक संपदा है, परिश्रम के धनी हैं, संकल्प करके जिन्दगी बदलने का सामर्थ्य रखते हैं। हमारा पूरा ध्यान पूर्वी उत्तर प्रदेश, बिहार, बंगाल, असम, नॉर्थ ईस्ट, ओडिशा, ये हमारे ऐसे सामर्थ्यवान राज्य हैं, जहां प्राकृतिक संपदा भरपूर है, उसको आगे बढ़ाकर के देश को एक नई ऊंचाई पर ले जाने की दिशा में हम प्रयत्नरत है। 

भाइयो-बहनों, भ्रष्टाचार मुक्त भारत एक बड़ा अहम काम है, उसको हम बल देने का प्रयास कर रहे है। सरकार बनने के बाद पहला काम किया था SIT बनाने का। आज तीन साल के बाद मैं देशवासियों को बताना चाहता हूं, गर्व से बताना चाहता हूं कि तीन साल के भीतर-भीतर, करीब-करीब सवा लाख करोड़ रुपए से भी ज्यादा कालाधन को हमने खोज दिया है, उसको पकड़ा है और उसको surrender करने के लिए मजबूर किया है। 

उसके बाद हमने नोटबंदी का फैसला किया। नोटबंदी के द्वारा हमने अनेक महत्वपूर्ण सफलताएं प्राप्त की हैं। जो कालाधन छिपा हुआ था, उसको मुख्यधारा में आना पड़ा। आपने देखा होगा कि हम कभी 07 दिन-10 दिन-15 दिन बढ़ाते जाते थे, कभी पेट्रोल पंप पर, कभी दवाई की दुकान पर, कभी रेलवे स्टेशन पर पुराने नोट लेने का सिलसिला जारी रखते थे, क्योंकि हमारा प्रयास था कि एक बार जो भी धन आए वो बैंकों में formal economy का हिस्सा बन जाए और उस काम को हमने सफलतापूर्वक पार किया है। और इसका कारण यह हुआ है कि अभी जो research हुआ है, करीब तीन लाख करोड़ रुपए... ये सरकार ने research नहीं की है, बाहर के expert ने की है। नोटबंदी के बाद तीन लाख करोड़ रुपए, जो अतिरिक्त, जो कभी banking system में वापस नहीं आता था वो आया है। 

बैंकों में जमा की गई राशि में पौने दो लाख करोड़ से अधिक राशि शक के घेरे में है। कम से कम दो लाख करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा कालाधन उसको बैंको तक पहुंचना पड़ा है और अब व्यवस्था के साथ उनको अपना जवाब देने के लिए मजबूर हुए हैं। नए कालेधन पर भी बहुत बड़ी रुकावट आ गई है। इस वर्ष, इसका परिणाम देखिए, 01 अप्रैल से 05 अगस्त तक income tax return दाखिल करने वाले नए व्यक्तिगत करदाताओं की संख्या 56 लाख। पिछले साल उसी अवधि में ये संख्या सिर्फ 22 लाख थी। Double से भी ज्यादा! ये कारण कालेधन के खिलाफ हमारी लड़ाई का परिणाम है। 

18 लाख से ज्यादा ऐसे लोगों को पहचान लिया गया है, जिनकी आय उनके हिसाब किताब से कुछ ज्यादा है, बेशुमार ज्यादा है और इसलिये इस अंतर का उनको जवाब देना पड़ रहा है। साढ़े चार लाख लोग इसमें से अब मैदान में आये हैं, अपनी गलती स्वीकार करके रास्ते में आने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं। एक लाख लोग ऐसे सामने आए हैं, जिन्होंने कभी जिन्दगी में Income Tax का नाम भी नहीं सुना था, न Income Tax कभी दिया था, न कभी उन्होंने उस पर सोचा था, लेकिन आज उनको वो करना पड़ रहा है। 

भाइयों बहनों, हमारे देश में अगर दो चार कंपनियां भी कहीं बंद हो जाए, तो चौबिसों घंटे उस पर चर्चाएं होती हैं उस पर Debates होती हैं। अर्थनीति खत्म हो गई… ये हो गया, न जाने क्या क्या होता है! आपको जानकर के हैरानी होगी, काले धन के कारोबारी, Shell कंपनियां चलाते थे और नोटबंदी के बाद जब data-mining किया गया। तब तीन लाख ऐसी कंपनियां पाई गईं हैं, जो सिर्फ और सिर्फ shell कंपनियां हैं। हवाला का कारोबार करती हैं। तीन लाख, कोई कल्पना कर सकता है। और उसमें से पौने दो लाख का रजिस्ट्रेशन हमनें Cancel कर दिया है। पांच कंपनियां बंद हो जाए तो हिन्दुस्तान में तूफान मच जाता है। पौने दो लाख कंपनियों को ताले लगा दिये। देश का माल लूटने वालों को जवाब देना पड़ेगा, ये काम हमने कर के दिखाया। 

आपको हैरानी होगी! कुछ तो shell कंपनियां ऐसी हैं, जो एक ही Address पर चार सौ चार सौ कंपनियां चल रही थीं, भाइयों बहनों। चार सौ चार सौ कंपनियां चल रही थीं। कोई देखने वाला नहीं था, कोई पूछने वाला नहीं था। सारी मिलीभगत चल रही थी। और इसलिये मेरे भाइयों बहनों, मैंने भ्रष्टाचार काले धन के खिलाफ एक बहुत बड़ी लड़ाई छेड़ी है। देश की भलाई के लिए देश के गरीबों के कल्याण के लिये, देश के नौजवानों के भविष्य को बनाने के लिए। 

भाइयों बहनों, एक के बाद एक कदम और मुझे विश्वास है GST के बाद उसमें और बढ़ोतरी होने वाली है। और Transparency आने वाली है। अकेले Transportation हमारा ट्रक वाला एक स्थान से दूसरे स्थान पर जाता था। ये GST के बाद तीस प्रतिशत उसका समय बच गया है। check-post खत्म होने के कारण हजारों करोड़ रुपयों की तो बचत हुई है। सबसे बड़ी बचत समय की हुई है। एक प्रकार से उसकी तीस प्रतिशत Efficiency बढ़ रही है। आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं हिन्दुस्तान के Transport जगत में तीस प्रतिशत Efficiency बढ़ने का मतलब क्या होता है। एक GST के कारण इतना बड़ा परिवर्तन आया है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, आज नोटबंदी के कारण बैंको के पास धन आया है। बैंक अपनी ब्याज दर कम कर रहे हैं। मुद्रा के द्वारा सामान्य मानव को बैंक से पैसा मिल रहा है। सामान्य मानव को अपने पैरों पर खड़े होने के लिये अवसर मिल रहा है। गरीब हो, मध्यवर्ग का व्यक्ति हो घर बनाना चाहता है, तो बैंक उसको मदद करने के लिये आगे आ रहे हैं, कम ब्याज की दर से आगे आ रहे हैं। ये सारा देश के अर्थतंत्र को गति देने की दिशा में काम कर रहा है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, अब ये वक्त बदल चुका है। हम 21वीं सदी में हैं। विश्व का सबसे बड़ा युवा वर्ग हमारे देश में है। दुनिया में हमारी पहचान IT के द्वारा है, Digital World के द्वारा है। क्या अब भी हम उसी पूरानी सोच में रहेंगे। अरे! एक जमाने में चमड़े के सिक्के चलते थे, धीरे-धीरे लुप्त हो गए, कोई पूछने वाला नहीं रहा। आज जो कागज के नोट हैं, समय आते रहते वो सारा का सारा Digital Currency में Convert होने वाला है। हम नेतृत्व करें, हम जिम्मेवारी लें, हम Digital Transaction की ओर जाएं। हम BHIM APP को अपनाएं, आर्थिक कारोबार का हिस्सा बनाएं। हम Prepaid के द्वारा भी काम करें। और मुझे खुशी है कि Digital लेनदेन बढ़ी है। पिछले साल के मुकाबले उसमें 34 प्रतिशत का इजाफा हुआ है और Prepaid भुगतान में करीब 44 प्रतिशत का। और इसलिये कम cash वाली अर्थव्यवस्था, उसको लेकर के हमें आगे बढ़ना चाहिए। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, सरकार की कुछ योजनाएं ऐसी हैं, जो हिन्दुस्तान के सामान्य मानव की जेब में पैसे बचा सकें। अगर आप LED Bulb लगाते हैं, तो साल भर का हजार दो हजार पांच हजार रुपया आपका बचने वाला है। अगर आप स्वच्छ भारत में सफल होते हैं, तो गरीब का सात हजार का रुपया दवाई का बंद होता है। महंगाई पर नियंत्रण, आपके बढ़ते हुए खर्च को रोकने में सफल हुआ है, एक प्रकार से आपकी बचत है। 

‘जन औषधि केन्द्रों’ के द्वारा सस्ती दवाई की दुकान गरीब के लिये एक बहुत बड़ा आशीर्वाद बनी है। हमारे यहां Operation के पीछे, stent के पीछे जो खर्च होते थे वो कम हुए हैं। आने वाले दिनों में Knee के Operation के लिए भी सारी सुविधाएं मिलेंगी। हमारी कोशिश है कि गरीब और मध्यमवर्ग के मानव के लिये ये खर्च कम हो और उसके लिये हम एक के बाद एक कदम उठा रहे हैं। 

पहले हमारे देश में राज्यों के मुख्यालय में Dialysis हुआ करता था। हमने तय किया हिन्दुस्तान के जिला केन्द्रों तक Dialysis पहुंचाएंगे। करीब साढ़े तीन सौ, चार सौ जिलों तक पहुंचा दिया और मुफ्त में Dialysis करके गरीब की जिन्दगी बचाने का काम हम कर रहे हैं। 

आज देश गर्व कर सकता है कि हमने विश्व के सामने अपनी व्यवस्थाओं को विकसित किया है। GPS System के द्वारा NAVIC Navigation की व्यवस्था आज करने में हम सफल हुए हैं। हमने SAARC Satellite के द्वारा हमने पड़ोसी देशों के साथ मदद करने का सफल अभियान किया है। 

हम ‘तेजस’ हवाई जहाज के द्वारा आज दुनिया के अंदर अपनी अहमियत पहुंचा रहे हैं। ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ दुनिया के अंदर Digital Transaction के लिये एक अजूबा बना हुआ है। RuPay Card ...हिन्दुस्तान में RuPay Card करोड़ों की तादाद में है। और अगर वो operational हो जाएगा, वो अगर गरीबों के जेब में है, तो दुनिया का, ये सबसे बड़ा हो जाएगा। 

और इसलिये मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, मेरा आपसे यही आग्रह है कि हम ‘New India’ का संकल्प ले कर के आगे बढ़ें, समय रहते हुए करें। हमारे यहां शास्त्रों में कहा गया हैः अनियत काल:, अनियत कालः प्रभुतयो विप्लवन्ते, प्रभुतयो विप्लवन्ते। सही समय पर अगर कोई कार्य पूरा नहीं किया गया, तो फिर इच्छित परिणाम कभी नहीं मिलते हैं। और इसलिये ‘Team India’ के लिए, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की टीम India के लिए, आज हमें संकल्प लेना होगा 2022 तक ‘New India’ बनाने का और ये काम हम खुद करेंगे, कोई करेगा ऐसा नहीं, हम खुद करेंगे। देश के लिये करेंगे, पहले से अच्छा करेंगे, पहले से ज्यादा करेंगे, समर्पण भाव से करेंगे, 2022 में ‘भव्य-दिव्य’ हिन्दुस्तान देखने के लिये करेंगे। 

और इसलिये हम सब मिलकर के एक ऐसा भारत बनाएंगे जहां गरीब के पास पक्का घर हो, बिजली हो, पानी हो। 

हम सब मिलकर एक ऐसा भारत बनाएंगे, जहां देश का किसान चिंता में नहीं चैन से सोएगा। आज वो जितना कमा रहा है, उससे 2022 तक दोगुना कमाएगा। 

हम सब मिलकर के एक ऐसा हिन्दुस्तान बनाएंगे, जहां युवाओं, महिलाओं को अपने सपने पूरे करने के लिये भरपूर अवसर उपलब्ध होंगे। 

हम सब मिलकर के एक ऐसा भारत बनाएंगे, जो आतंकवाद संप्रदायवाद और जातिवाद से मुक्त होगा। 

हम सब मिलकर के एक ऐसा भारत बनाएंगे, जहां भ्रष्टाचार और भाई-भतीजावाद से कोई समझौता नहीं होगा।

हम सब मिलकर के एक ऐसा भारत बनाएंगे, जो स्वच्छ होगा, स्वस्थ होगा और स्वराज के सपने को पूरा करेगा। 

और इसलिये मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, हम सब मिलकर के विकास की इस दौड़ में आगे चलने का प्रयास करेंगे। 

आज आजादी के 70 साल के बाद, आजादी के 75 साल की प्रतीक्षा के बीच पांच साल के महत्वपूर्ण कार्यकाल में एक ‘दिव्य-भव्य भारत’ के सपने को लेकर के हम सभी देशवासी चलें, इसी एक भाव के साथ मैं फिर एक बार आजादी के दीवानों को प्रणाम करता हूं। 

सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के नए विश्वास, नई उमंग को नमन करता हूं। और नए संकल्प के साथ आगे चलने के लिये ‘Team India’ को आह्वान करता हूं। 

इसी भावना के साथ आप सबको हृदय से मेरी बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं। 

भारत माता की जय, वन्दे मातरम जय हिंद। 

जय हिंद, जय हिंद, जय हिंद, जय हिंद। 

भारत माता की जय, भारत माता की जय, भारत माता की जय। 

वन्दे मातरम, वन्दे मातरम, वन्दे मातरम, वन्दे मातरम। 

सभी का बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद।

                Hon’ble Chairman, heartiest congratulations and good wishes on behalf of the House and on behalf of the countrymen! 

Today, the 11th August, reminds us of a significant event in history. On this day, a youngster aged 18 years, Khudiram Bose, was sent to the gallows. It tells us about the struggle for independence and the sacrifices and reminds us of our responsibility towards the nation. 

Respectable Shri Venkaiah Naidu has become the first Vice President of the country, who was born in independent India. I think maybe he is the only Vice President who has been associated with this environment for so many years and knows the nuances of the House. The Country has got a Vice President who is familiar with everybody and everything - from the members to the committees, to the proceedings of the House. 

His public life started with the JP movement. During his student days, Jayaprakash Narayan led a nationwide agitation for good governance; and he proved himself as a student leader in Andhra Pradesh. Since then he started developing his personality, be it in the Vidhan Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, and had also expanded his field of work. And today we all have elected him and handed him over the responsibility for this position. 

Venkaiah ji is the son of a farmer. I have had the privilege of working with him for many years. Be it for a village, for the poor, or for the farmers, he had been providing his inputs all the time while studying these topics very closely. He was the Urban Development Minister in the Cabinet too. But I always felt that during the discussions in the cabinet he used to talk more about farmers and the problems of rural areas than the subjects related to urban areas. This topic was close to his heart probably because of his family background and childhood which was associated with villages. 

As Venkaiah ji has taken over the office of the Vice President, it is our responsibility to familiarize the whole world with it. There are also responsibilities which should be viewed in isolation from the politics. India's democracy is very mature. Indian constitution is very powerful. The significance of the constitution that our great men had bequeathed to us is such that the people who have the constitutional posts in India today are those who were born in rural areas or had poverty stricken family background; they have not come from any rich family. The presence of people from humble background in the highest posts of the country for the first time itself demonstrates the dignity of the constitution of India and the maturity of India's democracy and this pride is the pride of the 1.25 Crore people of India. Thus, I can clearly see the inheritance that our forefathers have given us. Once again I would like to bow down those constitution makers. 

Venkaiah ji is a great personality with austerity and great oratory skills. He possesses these rich endowments in his personality and we are familiar with his debating skills. And sometimes when he makes speeches in Telugu, it seems that he is running super-fast. But for that there should be clarity in thought and the ability to connect with the audience. It is not about playing with words; those who are associated with the world of oratory are well aware that just playing with words can never touch anybody's heart. But when one expresses his ideas with conviction which are based on a vision and beliefs, then the person touches the heart of the people. And Venkaiah ji has always been successful in this regard. 

It is also true that there is no such MP today, who doesn’t appeal to the government for the development of rural areas day in and day out - be it the Government of Dr. Manmohan Singh ji or mine. One such demand is for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in their respective areas. It is a matter of pride for all the MPs that the idea of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana was envisaged by our very Vice-President, the Venerable Venkaiah Ji. This can only happen when one can empathise with the poor, the farmer, and the oppressed and is determined to take them out of their problems. 

Today, while Vankaiah ji is amongst us as the Vice President, we might face a little problem in adjusting in this House for some time because just like the lawyers in the Court feel strange when a lawyer from the Bar becomes a judge; a similar feeling may develop that he used to argue and debate with us in the House till recently, but now he is there as the Vice President! So some of us, especially for the Members of this House, who have worked with him as a friend and a colleague for so many years, may feel odd but it is the uniqueness of our democratic system that we develop our style of working within the system. 

I believe that a person like him who has come from within the system and has been in the Rajya Sabha for so many years shall show us the path and guide us in the House as the Chairman of the House. I have full faith and I believe that a positive change is to come. And today as Venkaiah ji is accepting this dignified post, I would quote a few lines: 

’अमल करो ऐसा अमन में, 

अमल करो ऐसा अमन में, 

जहां से गुजरे तुम्‍हारी नज़रें, 

उधर से तुम्‍हें सलाम आए।’’

And I would like to add -

‘‘अमल करो ऐसा सदन में, 

जहां से गुजरे तुम्‍हारी नज़रें, 

उधर से तुम्‍हें सलाम आए।’’

Heartiest congratulations and thanks a lot!

                आदरणीय सभापति जी, सदन की तरफ से, देशवासियों की तरफ से आपको बहुत-बहुत बधाई और बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं!

आज 11 अगस्त‍ इतिहास के लिए एक महत्‍वपूर्ण तारीख से जुड़ा हुआ है। आज ही के दिन 18 साल की एक छोटी उम्र वाले खुदीराम बोस को फाँसी के तख्‍त पर चढ़ा दिया गया था। देश की आज़ादी के लिए संघर्ष कैसा हुआ, बलिदान कितने हुए और उसके परिप्रेक्ष्‍य में हम सबका दायित्व‍ कितना बड़ा है, इसका यह घटना स्‍मरण कराती है।

हम सबका इस बात की ओर ध्‍यान जरूर जाएगा कि आदरणीय श्री वेंकैया नायडू जी देश के पहले ऐसे उपराष्‍ट्रपति बने हैं, जो स्‍वतंत्र भारत में जन्‍म लिया है। श्रीमान वेंकैया जी यह ऐसे पहले उपराष्‍ट्रपति बने हैं, मैं समझता हूं शायद वो अकेले ऐसे हैं, जो इतने सालों तक इसी परिसर में, इन्‍ही सबके बीच में पले हैं, बढ़े हैं शायद इस देश को पहले ऐसे उपराष्‍ट्रपति मिले हैं, जो इस सदन की हर बारीकी से परिचित हैं। सदस्‍यों से ले करके समितियों से, समितियों से ले करके सदन तक की कार्रवाई से, स्‍वयं उस प्रक्रिया से निकले हुए यह पहले उपराष्‍ट्रपति देश को प्राप्‍त हो रहे हैं।

सार्वजनिक जीवन में जे. पी. आंदोलन की वो पैदाइश है। विद्यार्थी काल में जयप्रकाश नारायण के आह्वान को ले करके, शुचिता को ले करके, सुशासन के लिए जो राष्‍ट्रव्‍यापी आंदोलन चला, आंध्रप्रदेश में एक विद्यार्थी नेता के रूप में उन्‍होंने अपने आप को झोंक दिया था। और तब से ले करके विधानसभा या राज्‍यसभा हो, उन्‍होंने अपने व्‍यक्तित्‍व का भी विकास किया और कार्यक्षेत्र का भी विस्‍तार किया। और आज उसकी बदौलत हम सबने उनको पसंद किया और इस पद के लिए एक गौरवपूर्ण जिम्‍मेदारी उनको दी।  

वेंकैया जी किसान के बेटे हैं। कई वर्षों तक मुझे उनके साथ कार्य करने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है। गांव हो, गरीब हो, किसान हो इन विषयों पर वो बहुत ही बारीकी से अध्‍ययन करते हुए, हर समय अपने Input देते रहे हैं। कैबिनेट में भी वो Urban Development Minister थे। लेकिन मुझे हमेशा ऐसा लगता था कैबिनेट के अंदर चर्चाओं में वो जितना समय Urban विषयों पर कैबिनेट में बात करते थे, उससे ज्‍यादा रूचि से वो rural और किसान के विषयों पर चर्चा करते थे। यह उनके dear to heart यह उनका रहा, और शायद उनके बचपन का उनके पारिवारिक background के कारण है।

वेंकैया जी उपराष्‍ट्रपति पद पर बैठे हैं तब, पूरी दुनिया को इस बात पर हमें परिचित करना होगा और मैं मानता हूं हम सबका दायित्‍व है, राजनीतिक दीवारों से परे भी यह दायित्‍व है। और वो दायित्‍व यह है कि भारत का लोकतंत्र कितना mature है। भारत के संविधान की बारिकियों की कितनी बड़ी ताकत है। हमारे उन महापुरूषों ने जो संविधान दिया उस संविधान का साम्‍थर्य क्‍या है कि आज हिंदुस्‍तान के संविधान पदों पर वो लोग बैठे हैं, जिनकी पार्श्‍वभूमि गरीबी की है, गांव की है, सामान्‍य परिवार से है, वो किसी रहीसी खानदान से नहीं आए।  पहली बार देश के सभी सर्वोच्‍च पदों पर इस पार्श्‍व भूमि के व्‍यक्तियों का होना यह अपने आप में भारत के संविधान की गरिमा और भारत के लोकतंत्र की maturity को प्रदर्शित करता है और जिसका गर्व हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का गर्व है। हमारे पूर्वजों ने हमें जो विरासत दी है, उन पूर्वजों का सम्‍मान इस घटना के साथ मैं देख रहा हूं। मैं फिर से एक बार उन संविधान निर्माताओं का भी नमन करना चाहूंगा।

वेंकैया जी, उनका व्‍यक्तित्‍व भी है, कृतित्‍व भी है, वक्तुत्व भी है। इन सबके वो धनी हैं और उनकी तुकबंदी तो भलीभांति परिचित है। और कभी-कभी वो जब भाषण करते हैं तो और वो जब तेलगू में करते हैं तो ऐसा लगता है कि Super-fast चला रहे हैं। लेकिन उसके लिए यह तब संभव होता है, जब विचारों के अंदर स्‍पष्‍टता हो, Audience के साथ connect हो वो शब्‍दों का खेल नहीं होता है, जो वक्तुत्व की दुनिया के साथ जुड़े हैं उनका पता है शब्‍दों के खेल किसी के मन मंदिर को नहीं छू सकते हैं। लेकिन श्रद्धाभाव से पनपी हुई विचारधाराओं के आधार पर अपने conviction और vision के साथ चीजें निकलती है तो जन हृदय को अपने आप स्‍पर्श कर देती है और वो वेंकैया के जीवन में यह देखा गया है, पाया गया है।

यह भी सही है, ग्रामीण विकास के अंदर आज कोई भी ऐसा सांसद नहीं है, जो एक विषय पर सरकार से बार-बार आग्रह न करता हो। चाहे सरकार डॉक्‍टर मनमोहन सिंह जी के नेतृत्‍व की हो, चाहे वो सरकार मेरे नेतृत्‍व की हो। सांसदों की एक एक मांग लगातार रहती है और वो अपने क्षेत्र में प्रधानमंत्री ग्राम सड़क के लिए कार्य के लिए है। हम सभी सांसदों के लिए गर्व की बात है देश को प्रधानमंत्री ग्राम सड़क योजना की कल्‍पना, उसकी योजना यह तोहफा अगर किसी ने दिया तो यह हमारे उपराष्‍ट्रपति जी ने दिया, आदरणीय वेंकैया जी ने दिया। जो आज...और यह चीजें तब निकलती है कि गांव के प्रति, गरीब के प्रति, किसान के प्रति, दलित के प्रति, पीडि़त शोषित के प्रति अपनत्व होता है, उनको कठिनाईयों से बाहर निकालने का संकल्‍प होता है, तब यह होता है।

आज जब उपराष्‍ट्रपति पद के रूप में वेंकैया जी हमारे बीच में हैं, इस सदन में हम सबकी एक कठिनाई रहेगी, कुछ पल, क्‍योंकि Bar में से कोई वकील अगर जज बन जाता है तो शुरू-शुरू में Court में उसके साथ ही नीचे Bar के Members जब बात करते हैं, तो जरा अटपटा लगता है कि कल तो यह मेरे साथ खड़ा रहता था, मेरे साथ बहस करता था, और आज यहां मैं इसको कैसे! तो कुछ पल हम सबके लिए भी, खासकर इस सदन के सदस्‍यों के लिए जिन्‍होंने इतने साल उनके साथ एक दोस्‍ताना रूप में काम किया है और जब इस पद पर बैठे हैं तो हमने भी... और हमारे लोकतंत्र की विशेषता है कि व्‍यवस्‍था के अनुकूल हम अपनी कार्यशैली को भी बनाते हैं।

और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि भले ही हमारे बीच से इतने लम्‍बे समय से राज्‍यसभा के सदस्‍य रह करके, हर बारीकी से निकले हुए, एक पके-पकाए व्‍यक्ति, उपराष्‍ट्रपति और इस सभा गृह के सभापति के रूप में जब हम लोगों का मार्गदर्शन करेंगे, हमें दिशा देंगे, इसकी गरिमा को और ऊपर उठाने में उनका योगदान बहुत बड़ा होगा, मुझे पूरा विश्‍वास है एक बहुत बड़े बदलाव के संकेत में देख रहा हूं। और वो अच्‍छे के लिए होंगे, अच्‍छाई के लिए होंगे। और आज जब वेंकैया जी इस गरिमापूर्ण पद को ग्रहण कर रहे हैं तब, मैं उसी बात को स्‍मरण करना चाहूंगा

‘’अमल करो ऐसा अमन में,

अमल करो ऐसा अमन में,

जहां से गुजरे तुम्‍हारी नज़रें,

उधर से तुम्‍हें सलाम आए।’’

और उसी को जोड़ते हुए मैं कहना चाहूंगा –

‘‘अमल करो ऐसा सदन में,

जहां से गुजरे तुम्‍हारी नज़रें,

उधर से तुम्‍हें सलाम आए।’’

बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं! बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today joined the members of the Rajya Sabha, in welcoming Vice President Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, as Chairman of the House. 

The Prime Minister began his welcome remarks by recalling that today, 11thAugust, was the day when a young revolutionary of the freedom struggle, Shri Khudiram Bose, was hanged by the British. He said that the event reminds us of the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom, and the responsibility that this places on all of us. The Prime Minister said that Shri Venkaiah Naidu is the first Vice President born in Independent India. He added that Shri Naidu has long experience, and is well-versed in the intricacies of Parliamentary procedures. 

Recalling his long association with Shri Venkaiah Naidu, the Prime Minister said Shri Naidu is always sensitive to the requirements of the rural areas, the poor and the farmers, and his inputs on these issues have been of immense value. 

The Prime Minister said that the fact that people from humble, rural background, today occupy the highest positions in India, shows the maturity of Indian democracy, and the strength of India’s Constitution.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today appreciated Vice President Shri Hamid Ansari, saying that it reflects his skill, patience and intellect, to be able to function as Chairman of the Rajya Sabha for 10 years, where one has to be calm in all situations. 

Speaking at the farewell function in Parliament for Shri Hamid Ansari, the Prime Minister said that the long public life of Shri Ansari has been without any controversy. 

The Prime Minister said that Shri Ansari's family has been in public life for generations. He particularly recalled Brigadier Usman, who had embraced martyrdom defending the nation in 1948. 

The Prime Minister suggested that Shri Ansari, with his long experience of running the Rajya Sabha, should pen down his thoughts on how the functioning of the Upper House can be made more effective.

                Respected Chairman,

After your long term in public service, I am confident that today you will enter the new field of work, because physically you have kept yourself quite fit. You have a family background which has a long history of political association; whose grandfather had been the President of the national party; was in the Constituent Assembly; in a way you come from a family whose ancestors had a great role in public life in general and in the Congress in particular and was also associated with the Khilafat Movement.

You yourself had been a Career Diplomat. Now who is a Career Diplomat? I understood this only after becoming the Prime Minister, because what does it mean when one laughs or what is the meaning of shaking hands; one cannot understand this easily! It is because this is what they are trained to do. But that skill would have been applied here for the past 10 years and this skill definitely would have benefitted the House.

Your career as a Diplomat has been deeply associated to West Asia. You have spent several years of your public life in the same sphere and in the same environment with the same thought and debate and you were associated with such people. Even after retiring, most of your work was still in that sphere, whether in Minority Commission or Aligarh University. But the responsibility for these 10 years had been completely different; like working within the framework of the Constitution; and you have worked very hard to do it well.

Perhaps who felt a bit uneasy, but today you will not have that issue and you will also enjoy this liberation and you will get this opportunity to work with your independent thought process.

Although we could not interact much, but whenever we met, there was a lot to learn from you. Before going to any foreign tour and after returning, whenever I got the opportunity to talk to you, I definitely felt the insight you had, and this helped me to broaden my understanding and therefore I am very grateful to you. I express my gratitude to you from the core of my heart.

As the Vice President of the Nation, for the sake of your services, I express my gratitude on behalf of both the Houses and the people of this country. Your achievements, experience and the post-retirement status hold a great significance. I hope that by following the Constitution, your time and energy shall help in guiding the country. Best wishes!

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed district collectors across the country via video-conference, on the theme of “New India – Manthan.” The first-of-its-kind interaction with district collectors marked the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement, and is aimed at catalysing “New India – Manthan” at the grassroots level. 

The Prime Minister explained that the date of August 9th, is intrinsically linked with the mantra of “Sankalp se Siddhi” – “Achievement through Resolve.” He said the date symbolizes the willpower and ambition of the youth. 

Shri Narendra Modi recalled how the senior leaders of the freedom movement were arrested at the beginning of the Quit India Movement, and youth across the country successfully carried the movement forward. 

The Prime Minister said that when youth assumes a leadership role, goals are sure to be achieved. He described the collectors, as not just representatives of their districts, but also of the youth of that region. He said collectors are fortunate, because they have been given the opportunity to dedicate themselves to the nation. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is asking each individual, each family, each organization to aim for certain goals which they should accomplish by 2022. He said that as representatives of their districts, collectors now have to decide where they want to see their districts in 2022, what deficiencies must be overcome, and what services must be ensured. 

The Prime Minister noted that some districts have always lagged in basic services such as electricity, water, education and health. He said that when the socio-economic conditions improve in the 100 most backward districts, it would give a big boost to the overall development parameters of the country. This puts an onus on the collectors of these districts to work in a mission mode. 

The Prime Minister encouraged replication, and scaling up of best practices from districts where good results are being achieved in a particular field or scheme. 

The Prime Minister asked the collectors to seek help from colleagues, intellectuals of the district, and students of schools and colleges, to prepare a vision document, or resolution document for their district before the 15th of August. This Resolution Document, should include those 10 or 15 objectives which they feel should be achieved by 2022. 

The Prime Minister informed the collectors of the website www.newindia.in - which contains information and activities related to the ‘Sankalp Se Sidhhi’ movement. He said that just as he is doing this Manthan with the collectors, they can do the same in the districts. 

The Prime Minister mentioned the important features about the New India website, such as an online quiz on the freedom struggle, and a comprehensive calendar on various events being held as a part of the Sankalp Se Sidhhi’ movement. 

The Prime Minister compared the development work in a district to a relay race. He said that just as the baton is passed on from one athlete to the next in a relay race, with the ultimate objective of winning the race, similarly, the development baton passes on successively from one collector to the next. 

The Prime Minister said that many times, schemes fail to have the desired impact, just because people are not aware about them. He said collectors must make people aware about the benefit of initiatives such as LED bulbs, BHIM App etc. Similarly, the Prime Minister said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is dependent upon a responsive administration, and awareness among people. He said real change in this regard can only come through public participation. 

The Prime Minister urged collectors to move beyond files, and go to the field, to understand ground realities, such as the condition of health services in remote parts of the district. He said that the more a collector visits the field, the more active he will be on file. On GST, the Prime Minister asked collectors to explain to traders in their district, how it is a “Good and Simple Tax.” He asked them to ensure that each trader is registered under GST. He also asked them to avail of Government e-marketplace for all procurement in their district. The Prime Minister recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s message that the ultimate goal of governance should be to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. He urged the collectors to ask themselves every day whether they had done something to bring change in the lives of the poor. He asked collectors to listen carefully to the poor, who approach them with their grievances. 

In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that the district collectors, are young and capable and could make resolutions for New India of 2022, in respect of their district. He expressed confidence that their resolutions would be achieved, and in the process, the country too, would reach new heights of achievement.

                The Hon’ble Speaker mam, my gratitude to you and all the respected members of the House on this occasion. We all feel proud to be a part of this august gathering in Parliament to commemorate the august kranti. Many of us remember the events unfolding of august 9 i.e. the august kranti. However even after years, such major events the memory of such major events are source of inspiration for the people. Remembering such important events gives a new boost to the life and strength to the nation. In the same way it is our duty to ensure that this message reaches out to our new generations. Every generation is responsible for bequeathing the legacy and the glorious history of their times generations, the atmospherics at that time, the sacrifices of our great men, the duty, the power, to the future generations. 

When the August Kranti was commemorated in its 25th year and 50th year, it was celebrated by the people across the country. As we commemorate the 75th year of this event today, it indeed a matter of pride for us. There for I am grateful to the speaker mam for having provided this opportunity. 

In the history of our freedom movement, the 9th August movement has been such an important, extensive and intense movement which even the Britishers could not imagine. 

Mahatma Gandhi and all senior leaders were put behind the bars. This was the time when many new leaders came to the forefront - Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan while many youngsters joined the movement to give it the desired momentum. Such movement in the history of our nation should be seen as a new inspiration, new energy, new resolve and the spirit of innovation among the people. 

India became a free country in 1947. The period between 1857 to 1957 was a witness to different stages in our freedom movement as many people laid down their lives for the nation and there were several ups and downs. However, the movement in 1942 was in a way the final mass struggle that the fellow citizens were waiting for. The 1942 movement prepared the ground work for our independence. We may recall the freedom struggle movement in 1857 when every corner of the country was reverberating with the call for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi return from abroad, Lok Manya Tilak call for Poorna Swarajya (Total Self Governance) and “Swarajya is my birth right” represent the sentiments at that time. It was followed by Mahatma Gandhi Dandi march in 1930. Netaji Subhash Bose creating INA inspired the people while many youngsters like Veer Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad, Chapekar Bandhu, laid down their lives for the motherland. All these events provided the momentum for the freedom and it was a situation of ‘now or never’. If it’s not for today, it will never happen again; such was the mood of the people of the country. Thus, every person of this country was involved in this movement. It seemed that Rajaji's movement was being carried out through the elite class. However in 1942, the movement had spread to every region and every social class in the country. The guiding forces were the words of Gandhi ji. This was the movements where the slogan of ‘Quit India’ was on everyone’s lips. One of the most striking features of this movement was that the sentiments which appeared in the minds of the people were altogether different from Gandhi ji’s thoughts, contemplation and ethics. The key words of this great man were, ‘We shall do or die’. These words from Gandhi ji were unique for the nation. Gandhi had said, ""From today onwards, everyone should consider himself as an independent woman or a man and should act accordingly. I'm not going to be content with anything less than complete independence. We will do or die"". These were Bapu's words and Bapu also clarified that he had not left the path of non-violence. However the situation and the pressure was such that even Bapu, had to adapt to the people's emotions while assuming the leadership. 

All sections of the society; the villages, the farmers, the labourers, the teachers, the students joined this movement with the slogan ‘Do or die’. Bapu even used to say that – ‘whosoever becomes martyr because of the violence perpetrated by the British, one should write this slogan on his body that he was a martyr of this freedom movement’. Bapu tried to take this movement to such a height and the result of that was that India was liberated from the slavery of the British. The country was desperate for that freedom, be it a leader or an ordinary Indian, there was no difference in the intensity of this feeling. I believe that when the country stands united and when there is a power of unity, when the goal is set, the target is set then the people can walk towards that direction. Within five-years i.e. between 1942 and 1947 Mother India became free. At that time Rambriksh Benipuri had written a book titled “Zanjire Aur Diware” and inthat book he wrote, ""There is a wonderful atmosphere throughout the country. Every person became a leader and every crossroad became the office of ‘the Do or Die’ movement. The country put itself inside the oven of revolution. The flame of revolution was engulfing the country. Bombay showed the way. All means of transport were stopped. The Court proceedings were stalled. The news of the bravery of the people of India and the brutality of British government was reaching every corner. The public had well placed the Gandhian mantra of ‘Do or Die’. 

This book provides the description of that time and shows the kind of atmosphere at that time. It is true that British colonialism began in India and also ended in India. It was not only the freedom of India; after 1942 the way this flame erupted against the colonial rule across the world, India’s freedom became a source of inspiration for colonies in Africa and Asia. The way this inspiration had spread to various parts of the world had become a cause of tribute to the masses of India. Any Indian can be proud of this and after that we saw that once India got its independence, gradually all these countries became free. This tells us that this was a good evidence of the determination of India. The lesson for us is that when we are determined to do something we gradually move towards the desired goal. Then it becomes the strength of the country and we take the country out of the crisis and the country can be prepared for the new goals. The history is the evidence of this fact. At that time, the poetry of the national poet, Sohan Lal Dwivedi, vividly described the power of Bapu and the time and movement . In his poem he had said- 
 

चल पड़े जिधर दो डग, मग में
चल पड़े कोटि पग उसी ओर
गड़ गई जिधर भी एक दृष्टि
गड़ गए कोटि दृग उसी ओर
 



This means that the path walked by Mahatma Gandhi was followed by millions of people and where Gandhiji's eyes were fixed, the eyes of millions were set upon the same thing. But today when we are in 2017 we cannot deny the fact that we do not have a Gandhi today. Today, the level of leadership that we had at that time does not exist but we have the strength of 1.25 Crore Indians. If we all try together it will not be a difficult task to fulfil the dreams of Gandhi and dreams of those freedom fighters. Today we have the opportunity in 2017 an enabling situation like that of 1942. The world is undergoing a crisis today. Just like in the year 1942 we became the source of inspiration for the world, similarly we can set an example for the world today as well and can be the source of inspiration. Today we are standing at this juncture, where we can avail the opportunity and how we should take upon this responsibility? I believe that we should take inspiration from these episodes of history. We should place the country above the party. Politics should be separated from this. If there are 1.25 crore people in the country, then we can easily progress by bringing the solutions to these problems successfully. How can anyone deny the fact that corruption can destroy the country like a termite - be it a political corruption, social corruption, or personal corruption. Let us not get into the controversy on who were involved and when. But today is a holy occasion and we should celebrate it with honesty and lead the country with honesty. This is the demand of the common man of the country. Poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy are the challenges in front of us. These challenges are not considered as challenges of the government but that of the country. There are grave questions in front of the poor and therefore we all have the responsibility of fulfilling this commitment for the country and to die for the country. For some of the issues we also had different sections of people in 1942. The people who believed in the violence were different. The ideals of Subhas Babu were different, but in 1942 everyone had said in a single voice: Quit India! This is our path under Gandhi's leadership. 

Our upbringing and ideologies might be different. But today’s time demands that we take the opportunity to free the country from some issues, whether it is poverty, hunger or illiteracy. Why is that Mahatma Gandhi's dream of village Swaraj has been left behind? What is the reason that the people have left the villages and are staying in the cities? What was the issue concerning Gandhi ji regarding the village? Can we revive that dream? Can we do anything for the poor farmers, dalits, and the deprived class? These questions concern not a single individual or a group but all of us and the 1.25 crore people of the country. This is the time when the inspiration gives us the power to do something for the people and this inspiration should be utilised. We know that sometimes duties are neglected, authority is misused. This happens in both the political and social life. Unfortunately, some of these vices have entered into some of our lives and has turned it into a ‘way of life’. We don’t feel guilty if we jump the red light; this feeling of ‘I am breaking the law’ is never realised. If I spit somewhere, I do not feel that I am doing something wrong. Breaking rules has become our way of life. Even the smallest incidents are taking us towards violence. Whether it’s the mistake of the doctor or not, of the hospital or not, the relatives go and set the hospital on fire. They beat the doctor. If an accident takes place, we burn the car and kill the driver. As a law abiding citizen, we must be dutiful. Some vices have entered in our way of life, and we do not think that we are breaking the law and that is why it is the responsibility of the leadership and of the society to get rid of these faults that have crept into the society. Wake up to the duty of the society! 

Toilets and cleanliness are not a matter of mockery. Those mother and sisters have to spend so much time waiting for the darkness to relieve. Thus, the mind-set of the society needs to be changed. It is necessary to educate the public to use the toilets. We have to be alive to this matter and these values can be instilled not by the law. We have to understand our duty. We should think of the mothers and sisters of our country who are under this burden. 

The country should bear the burden of at least a class of people which includes women and sisters of this country. Their strengths can give us strength. In the freedom movements of Mahatma Gandhi many of these mothers and sisters used to lead and had made equal contribution during the freedom struggle. Even today, they have as much contribution to the nation. In order to take them forward, we should move forward with this duty. 

It is true that from 1857 to 1942, we saw that the freedom movement had passed through different stages; there were ups and downs; different turning points, new leadership; sometimes it was violent, then non-violence. Sometimes there was an atmosphere of confrontation between the two streams, sometimes both the streams complemented each other. But we have witnessed this whole period from 1857 to 1942 which was incremental in a way. Gradually growing, slowly spreading, people were slowly connecting. But from Nineteen Forty Two to Nineteen Forty Seven, it was not an incremental change. There was an environment of disruption which forced the British to finish all the equations and give us freedom; to force them to go. From 1857 to 1942, everything was proceeding slowly, but between 1942 and 1947 this was not so. 

If we look at the history of the society of the last 100, 200 years, the journey of development was incremental. Slowly the world was moving; gradually the world was changing itself. But in the last 30-40 years, there was a sudden change in the world. There was a sudden change in life. And technology played a greater role. No one can imagine what has changed in the world in these 30-40 years; 30-40 years ago we did not even notice this. We can feel a positive change with this disruption. 

Just as we saw a quantum jump, I think 2017 and 2022, 75 years of Quit India and 75 years of independence respectively; within these five years, the same mood that existed between 1942 and 1947 shall prevail. In 2022, we will celebrate 75 years of independence, by that time we should fulfil the dreams of the heroes of the freedom struggle. We will carry forward our resolve and move forward. I believe that not only will our country progress, but due to the success of Forty two to Forty seven, many countries of the world have benefited, the ardour of freedom arose, the strength was re-gained. If in the span of 5 years from two thousand Seventeen to Two thousand Twenty Two we take this responsibility to carry India to that height in front of the world then this only is the quest for leadership. It will be a great service to the nation if the country comes together in this endeavour. I am confident that we can do a lot of work with consensus on certain issues. 

We just saw the GST, and I repeatedly say that this is not my political statement, but my conviction. The success of GST is not the success of any government; the success of GST is not the success of any party. The success of GST is the result of the willpower of the people sitting in this House. Whether sitting here or anywhere, it goes to all the states; goes to the general merchant of the country; And because of that, it was possible. The country's political leadership has done such a great job because of its commitment. It is something unique to the world. GST is a big wonder for the world, if this was possible then more decisions can be easily taken in the future by sitting here. And as a representative of the 1.25 Crore people, with the resolution of 2022, I believe that we shall continue to bring those results. 

Mahatma Gandhi had given the slogan of ‘do or die’; that was the formula of that time. Today, in 2017, if we take this resolution that how will India become in 2022, then we will get rid of corruption from the country. We will all get together the poor and give them their rights. Together we will give young people more opportunities of self-employment. Together we will end the problem of malnutrition from the country. We will all end and eliminate the hindrances that stop women from moving ahead. Together we will eradicate illiteracy from the country and will continue to do it. And there may be many issues, but we should keep the mantra ‘do or die’ in our minds. These resolutions are not of any party or of any government but of 1.25 crore people of the country. In these five years, from 2017 to 2022, on 75 th year of independence, we should fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters. Today, on August Revolution Day, remembering those great men, remembering their sacrifices, penance, and seeking their blessings, let us all get together lead the country by agreeing on a few things – making the country free from all the problems for fulfilment of dreams, power, strength and goal. With this expectation, I once again express my gratitude to you Madam and pay my obeisant to the freedom fighters.

                आदरणीय अध्‍यक्ष महोदया, मैं आपका और सदन के सभी आदरणीय सदस्‍यों का आभार भी व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं और हम सब आज गौरव भी महसूस कर रहे हैं कि अगस्‍त क्रांति का, उन्‍हें स्‍मरण करने का, इस सदन के पवित्र स्‍थान पर हम लोगों को सौभाग्‍य मिला है। हम में से बहुत लोग हैं जिन्‍हें शायद अगस्‍त क्रांति, 9 अगस्‍त, उन घटनाओं का स्‍मरण होगा। लेकिन उसके बाद भी हम लोगों के लिए भी पुन: स्‍मरण प्रेरणा का कारण बनता है और तमाम जीवन में ऐसी महत्‍वपूर्ण घटनाओं का बार-बार स्‍मरण, जीवन की भी अच्‍छी घटनाओं का बार-बार स्‍मरण जीवन को एक नई ताकत देता है; राष्‍ट्र-जीवन को भी नई ताकत देता है। उसी प्रकार से हमारी जो नई पीढ़ी है, उन तक भी ये बात पहुंचाना हम लोगों का कर्तव्‍य रहता है। पीढ़ी-दर-पीढ़ी इतिहास के एक स्‍वर्णिम पृष्‍ठों को, उस समय के माहौल को, उस समय के हमारे महापुरुषों के बलिदान को, कर्तव्‍य को, सामर्थ्‍य को, आने वाली पीढ़ियों तक पहुंचाने का भी हर पीढ़ी का दायित्‍व रहता है।

जब अगस्‍त क्रांति के 25 साल हुए, 50 साल हुए, देश के सभी लोगों ने उन घटनाओं का स्‍मरण किया था। आज 75 साल हो रहे हैं, और मैं इसे बड़ा महत्‍वपूर्ण मानता हूं। और इसलिए मैं अध्‍यक्ष महोदया जी का आभारी हूं कि आज हमें ये अवसर मिला है।

देश के स्‍वतंत्रता आंदोलन में 9 अगस्‍त एक ऐसी अवस्‍था में है, इतना व्‍यापक, इतना तीव्र आंदोलन, अंग्रेजों ने भी कल्‍पना नहीं की थी।

महात्‍मा गांधी, वरिष्‍ठ नेता, सब जेल चले गए। और वही पल था कि अनेक नए नेतृत्‍व ने जन्‍म लिया। लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री, राम मनोहर लोहिया, जयप्रकाश नारायण, कई अनेक youth युवा उस समय उस जो खाली जगह थी उसको भरा और आंदोलन को आगे बढ़ाया। इतिहास की ये घटनाएं हम लोगों के लिए एक नई प्रेरणा, नया सामर्थ्‍य, नया संकल्‍प, नया कृतत्‍व जगाने के लिए किस प्रकार से अवसर बने, ये हम लोगों का निरंतर प्रयास रहना चाहिए।

1947 में देश आजाद हुआ। एक प्रकार से 1857 से ले करके 1947 तक, आजादी के आंदोलन के अलग-अलग पड़ाव आए, अलग-अलग पराक्रम हुए, अलग-अलग बलिदान हुए; उतार-चढ़ाव भी आए। अलग-अलग मोड़ पर से ये आंदोलन गुजरा, लेकिन सैं‍तालिस की आजादी के पहले बयालिस की घटना एक प्रकार से अंतिम व्‍यापक आंदोलन था, अंतिम व्‍यापक जन-संघर्ष था और उस जन-संघर्ष ने आजादी के लिए देशवासियों को सिर्फ समय का ही इंतजार था, वो स्थिति पैदा कर दी थी। और जब हम आजादी के इस आंदोलन की ओर देखते हैं, तो nineteen forty two (1942) एक ऐसी पीठिका तैयार हुई थी, 1857 का स्‍वतंत्रता संग्राम, एक साथ देश के हर कोने में आजादी का बिगुल बजा था। और उसके बाद महात्‍मा गांधी का विदेश से लौटना, लोकमान्‍य तिलक का पूर्ण स्‍वराज्‍य और ‘’स्‍वराज्‍य मेरा जन्‍म सिद्ध अधिकार है’’ उस भाव को प्रकट करना, 1930 में महात्‍मा गांधी की डांडी मार्च, नेताजी सुभाष बोस द्वारा आजाद हिंद फौज की स्‍थापना, अनेक youth वीर भगत सिंह, सुखदेव, राजगुरू, चंद्रशेखर आजाद, चाफेकर बंधु, अनगिनत अपने-अपने समय पर बलिदान देते रहे। ये सारा ने एक पीठिका तैयार की और उस पीठिका का परिणाम था कि बयालिस में देश को एक उस छोर पर लाकर रख दिया कि अब नहीं तो कभी नहीं। आज नहीं होगा तो फिर कभी नहीं होगा, ये मिजाज देशवासियों का बन गया था। और इसके कारण उस आंदोलन में इस देश का छोटा-मोटा हर व्‍यक्ति जुड़ गया था। कभी लगता था राजाजी का आंदोलन elite class के द्वारा चल रहा है, लेकिन बयालिस की घटना, देश का कोई कोना ऐसा नहीं था, देश का कोई वर्ग ऐसा नहीं था, देश की कोई सामाजिक अवस्‍था ऐसी नहीं थी, कि जिसे इसे अपना न माना हो। और गांधी के शब्‍दों को ले करके वो चल पड़े थे। यही तो आंदोलन था, जब अंतिम स्‍वर में बात आई भारत छोड़ो। और सबसे बड़ी बात है महात्‍मा गांधी के पूरे आंदोलन में जो भाव कभी प्रकट नहीं हो सकता था, पूरे गांधी के चिंतन-मनन और विचार और आचार को देखें, उससे हट करके घटना घटी। इस महापुरुष ने कहा, करेंगे या मरेंगे। गांधी के मुंह से करेंगे या मरेंगे, शब्‍द देश के लिए अजूबा था। और इसलिए गांधी को भी उस समय कहना पड़ा था, और उन्‍होंने शब्‍द कहा था, ‘’आज से आप में हर एक को स्‍वयं को एक स्‍वतंत्र महिला या पुरुष समझना चाहिए और इस प्रकार काम करना चाहिए, मानों आप स्‍वतंत्र हैं। मैं पूर्ण स्‍वतंत्रता से कम किसी भी चीज पर संतुष्‍ट होने वाला नहीं हूं। ‘हम करेंगे या मरेंगे।’ ये बापू के शब्‍द थे और बापू ने स्‍पष्‍ट भी किया था कि मैंने मेरे अहिंसा के मार्ग को छोड़ा नहीं है। लेकिन आज स्थिति ऐसी और वो समय जन- सामान्‍य का दबाव ऐसा था कि बापू के लिए भी उसका नेतृत्‍व संभालते हुए उन जन-भावनाओं के अनुकूल इन शब्‍द प्रयोगों को करना हुआ था।

मैं समझता हूं कि उस समय समाज के जब सभी वर्ग जुड़ गए, गांव हो, किसान हो, मजदूर हो, टीचर हो, स्‍टूडेंट हो हर कोई इस आंदोलन के साथ जुड़ गए और करेंगे या मरेंगे और बापू तो यहां तक कहते थे कि अंग्रेजों की हिंसा के कारण कोई भी शहीद होता है तो उसके शरीर पर एक पट्टी लिखनी चाहिए करेंगे या मरेंगे और वो इस आजादी का आंदोलन का शहीद है। इस प्रकार की ऊंचाई तक इस आंदोलन को बापू ने ले जाने का प्रयास किया था और उसी का परिणाम था कि भारत गुलामी की जंजीरो से मुक्‍त हुआ। देश उस मुक्ति के लिए छटपटा रहा था नेता हो या नागरिक किसी की इस भावना की तीव्रता में कसु भर भी अंतर नहीं था और मैं समझता हूं देश जब उठ खड़ा होता है सामूहिकता की जब शक्ति पैदा होती है, लक्ष्‍य निर्धारित होता है और निर्धारित लक्ष्‍य  पर चलने के लिए लोग कृतसंगत होकर के चल पड़ते हैं तो 42 से 47 पांच साल के भीतर-भीतर बेडि़या चुर-चुर हो जाती हैं और मां भारती आजाद हो जाती है और इसलिए और उस समय रामवृक्ष बेनीपुरी उन्‍होंने एक किताब लिखी है जंजीरें और दीवारें और उस प्रस्‍तुति का वर्णन करते हुए उन्‍होंने लिखा है “एक अद्भुत वातावरण पूरे देश में बन गया। हर व्यक्ति नेता बन गया और देश का प्रत्येक चौराहा करो या मरो आंदोलन का दफ्तर बन गया। देश ने स्वयं को क्रांति के हवन कुंड में झोंक दिया। क्रांति की ज्वाला देश भर में धू-धू कर जल रही थी। बम्बई ने रास्ता दिखा दिया। आवागमन के सारे साधन ठप हो चुके थे। कचहरियां विरान हो चली थीं। भारत के लोगों की वीरता और ब्रिटिश सरकार की नृशंसता की खबरें पहुंच रही थी। जनता ने करो या मरो के गांधीवादी मंत्र को अच्छी तरह से दिल में बैठा लिया था”।

 

उस समय का ये वर्णन उस किताब जब ये पढ़ते है तो चलता है कि किस प्रकार का माहौल होगा और एक वो समय था कि ये घटना ने ये बात सही है कि ब्रिटिश उपनिवेशवाद जो था इसका आरंभ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में हुआ और इस घटना के बाद उसका अंत भी हिन्‍दुस्‍तान से हुआ था।  भारत आजाद होना सिर्फ भारत की आजादी नहीं थी 1942 के बाद विश्‍व के जिन-जिन भू-भाग में अफ्रीका में एशिया में इस उपनिवेशवाद के खिलाफ एक ज्‍वाला भड़की उसकी प्रेरणा केंद्र भारत बन गया था। और इसलिए भारत सिर्फ भारत की आजादी नहीं एक आजादी की ललक विश्‍व के कई भागों में फैलाने में भारत के जनसामान्‍य का संकल्‍प और कतृत्‍वय कारण बन गया था और कोई भी भारतीय इस बात के लिए गर्व कर सकता है और उसको हमने देखा कि एक बार भारत आजाद हुआ उसके बाद एक के बाद एक उपनिवेशवाद के सारे लोगों के झंडे ढ़हते गए और आजादी सब युग तक पहुंचने लगी। कुछ ही वर्षों में दुनिया के सारे देशों में आजादी प्राप्‍त हो गर्इ और ये काम बताता है कि ये भारत की इच्‍छाशक्ति का प्रबल इच्‍छाशक्ति का एक उत्‍तमोत्‍तम परिणाम था, हमारे लिए सबक यही है कि जब हम एक मन करके संकल्‍प लेकर के पूरे सामर्थ्‍य के साथ निर्धारित लक्ष्‍य को प्राप्‍त करने के लिए जुड़ जाते हैं तो ये देश की ताकत है कि हम देश को संकटों से बाहर निकाल देते हैं, देश को गुलामी की जंजीरों से बाहर निकाल सकते हैं, देश को नए लक्ष्‍य की प्राप्ति के लिए तैयार कर सकते हैं, ये इतिहास ने बताया है और इसलिए उस समय इस पूरे आंदोलन को और पूज्‍य बापू के व्‍यक्तित्‍व को लगते हुए राष्‍ट्र कवि सोहन लाल द्विवेदी की जो कविता है बापू का सामर्थ्‍य क्‍या है उसको प्रकट करती है। कविता में उन्‍होंने कहा था

 

चल पड़े जिधर दो डग, मग में

चल पड़े कोटि पग उसी ओर
गड़ गई जिधर भी एक दृष्टि
गड़ गए कोटि दृग उसी ओर

जिस तरफ गांधी के दो कदम चले थे उस तरफ अपने-आप करोड़ो लोग चल पड़ते थे, जिधर गांधी जी की दृष्टि टिक जाती थी उधर करोड़ो करोड़ आंखें देखने लग जाती थी और इसलिए इस महान व्‍यक्तित्‍व ने लेकिन आज जब हम 2017 में हैं हम इस बात से इंकार नहीं कर सकते कि आज हमारे पास गांधी नहीं है आज हमारे पास उस समय जो ऊंचाई वाला नेतृत्‍व था वो आज हमारे पास नहीं है लेकिन सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के विश्‍वास के साथ बैठे हुए हम सब लोग मिलकर के उन सपनों को पूरा करने का प्रयास करें तो मैं मानता हूं कि गांधी के सपनों को उन स्‍वतंत्रता सेनानियों के सपनों को पूरा करना मुश्किल काम नहीं है और आज आज का ये अवसर किसी बात के लिए हमें उस समय भी जो वैश्विक हालात थे 1942 में भारत की आजादी के लिए बहुत अनुकूल माहौल थे जो भी इतिहास से परिचित है उसे मालूम है मैं समझता हूं आज फिर से एक बार 2017 में जबकि Quit India Movement हम 75 साल मना रहे है उस समय विश्‍व में वो अनुकूलता है जो भारत के लिए बहुत सहानुकूल है और अनुकूल व्‍यवस्‍था का फायदा हम जितना जल्‍दी उठा दें जैसे उस समय विश्व के कई देशों के लिए हम प्रेरणा का कारण बने थे अगर आज हम मौका ले लें तो आज फिर से एक बार हम विश्व के कई देशों के लिए उपयोगी हो सकते हैं प्रेरणा का कारण बन सकते हैं, ऐसे मोड़ पर आज हम खड़े हैं 1942 & 2017 इस दोनों में वैश्विक परिवेश में भारत का महात्‍मय, भारत के लिए अवसर समान रूप से खड़ें हैं और उस समय हम इस बात को कैसे लें, हम उसकी जिम्‍मेवारी कैसे लें मैं मानता हूं इतिहास के इन प्रकरणों से सामर्थ्‍य से प्रेरणा लेकर के हमारे लिए दल से बड़ा देश होता है राजनीति से ऊपर राष्‍ट्नीति होती है मेरे अपने ऊपर सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी होते हैं अगर उस भाव को लेकर के हम उड़ चले हम सब मिलकर के आगे बढ़ें तो हम इन समस्‍याओं के खिलाफ सफलतापूर्वक आगे बढ़ सकते हैं हम इस बात से इंकार कैसे कर सकते हैं कि भ्रष्‍टाचार रूपी दीमक ने देश को कैसे तबाह करके रखा हुआ है। राजनीतिक भ्रष्‍टाचार हो, सामाजिक भ्रष्‍टाचार हो या व्‍यक्तिगत भ्रष्‍टाचार हो कल क्‍या हुआ कब किसने किया उसके लिए विवाद के लिए समय बहुत होते हैं लेकिन आज पवित्र पल हम आगे तो ईमानदारी का उत्‍सव मना सकते हैं ईमानदारी का संकल्‍प लेकर के देश का नेतृत्‍व कर सकते हैं क्‍या देश को ले जा सकते हैं ये समय की मांग है देश के सामान्‍य मानवीकी की मांग है, गरीबी, कुपोषण, अशिक्षा ये हमारे सामने चुनौतियां हैं इन चुनौतियों को हम सरकार की चुनौतियां न माने वो चुनौतिया देश की है देश की गरीब  के सामने संकट भरे सवाल खड़े हैं और इसलिए देश के लिए जीने मरने वाले देश के लिए संकल्‍प करने वाले हम सब लोगों का दायित्‍व बनता है इसको पूरा करने के लिए हम कुछ मुद्दों पर 1942 में भी अलग-अलग धारा के लोग थे। हिंसा में विश्‍वास करने वाले भी लोग थे नेता जी सुभाष बाबू की सोच अलग थी लेकिन 1942 में सबने एक स्‍वर से कह दिया था आपको गांधी के नेतृत्‍व में Quit India यही हमारा मार्ग है। हमारे भी लालन-पालन विचारधारा अलग-अलग रही होगी। लेकिन ये समय की मांग है कि हम कुछ बिंदुओं से देश को मुक्‍त कराने के लिए संकल्‍प का अवसर लेकर के चले चाहे गरीबी हो, भूखमरी हो, अशिक्षा हो अंत स्‍वत: हो। महात्‍मा गांधी का ग्राम स्‍वराज का सपना कितना पीछे छूट गया क्‍या कारण है कि गांव लोग छोड़ छोड़ कर के शहरो की ओर बस रहे है। गांव की उस चिंता को गांधी के मन में जो गांव था क्‍या हम हमारे भीतर उसको पुर्नजीवित कर सकते हैं क्‍या गांव गरीब किसान दलित पीढ़ी शोषित वंचित उसके जीवन के लिए अगर हम कुछ कर सकते हैं मिलकर के करना हैं ये सवाल मेरा और तेरा नहीं है ये सवाल इस पार और उस पार का नहीं है ये हम सबका है सवा सौ करोड़़ देशवासियों का है। सवा सौ करोड़़ देशवासी के जन‍प्रतिनिधि का है और यही तो समय होता है जब वो प्रेरणा हम लोगों को कुछ कर लेने की शक्ति देती है और उसको लेकर के हम आगे चल सकते हैं हम ये भी जानते हैं देश में जाने अनजाने में अधिकार भाव प्रबल होता चला गया, कर्तव्‍य भाव लुप्‍त होता गया। राष्‍ट्रजीवन के अंदर, समाज जीवन के अंदर अधिकार भाव का महात्‍म्‍य उतना ही रहते हुए भी अगर कर्तव्‍य भाव को थोड़ा सा भी हम कम आंकने लगेगे तो समाज जीवन में कितनी बड़ी मुसीबते होती हैं और दुर्भाग्‍य से हम लोगों का way of life हमारे चरित्र में कुछ चीजें घुस गई हैं जिसमें हमें बुराई नहीं लगता है मैं गलत कर रहा हूं अगर मैं चौराहे पर red light cross करके निकल जाता हूं तो मुझे लगता ही नहीं कि मैं कानून तोड़ रहा हूं मैं कहीं पर थूक देता हूं गंदगी करता हूं हमें लगता ही नहीं कि मैं गलत कर रहा हूं हम अपने कर्तव्‍य भाव से एक प्रकार से हमारे जहन में हमारे way of life में इस प्रकार के नियमों को तोड़ना कानूनों को तोड़ना ये स्‍वभाव बनता चला गया। छोटी-छोटी घटनाएं हिंसा की ओर ले जा रही हैं अस्‍पताल में किसी डाक्‍टर के द्वारा कुछ पेशेन्‍ट का कुछ हुआ डाक्‍टर दोषी है नहीं है, अस्‍पताल दोषी हैं नहीं हैं, रिश्‍तेदार जाते हैं अस्‍पताल को आग लगा देते हैं। डाक्‍टर को मारते हैं पीटते हैं हर छोटी-मोटी घटना अगर एक्‍सीडेन्‍ट हो गया हम कार को जला देते हैं ड्राइवर को मार देते हैं। ये जो चला है ये हम law of abiding citizen  के नाते हमारा कर्तव्‍य होना चाहिए हम मानने लगे हैं कि हमारे से कुछ छूट गया है। हमारी way of life में कुछ ऐसी चीजें घुस गई हैं जैसे हमें लगता ही नहीं है कि हम कानून तोड़ रहे हैं और इसलिए ये leadership की जिम्‍मेवारी होती है कि समाज के अंदर हम सबकी जिम्‍मेवारी होती है कि हम समाज के अंदर इन दोषों से मुक्ति दिलाकर के समाज के अंदर कर्तव्‍य भाव को जगाए!

शौचालय स्‍वच्‍छता ये विषय मजाक के नहीं हैं उन मां बहनों की परेशानी समझो तब पता चलता है कि जब शौचालय नहीं होता तो रात के अंधेरे का इंतजार का समय दिन कैसे बिताना पड़ता है और इसलिए शौचालय बनाना एक काम है लेकिन समाज की मानसिकता बदल कर के शौचालय का उपयोग करना ये जनसामान्‍य की शिक्षा के लिए आवश्‍यक है इस बात को हमें जगाना होगा और ये भाव कानूनों से नहीं होता है, कानून बनाने से नहीं होता है कानून सिर्फ मदद कर सकता है लेकिन कर्तव्‍य भाव जगाने से ज्‍यादा हो सकता है और इसलिए हम लोगों को करना होगा। हमारे देश की माताएं बहनें देश के अंदर कम से कम देश पर जो उनका बोझ है।

देश को कम से कम जिनका बोझ सहना पडता है, वो अगर कोई वर्ग है तो इस देश की माताएं, बहनें हैं, महिलाएं हैं। उनका सामर्थ्‍य हमें कितनी ताकत दे सकता है, उनकी भागीदारी हमारे विकास के अंदर हमें कितना बल दे सकती है। पूरे आजादी के आंदोलन में देखिए महात्‍मा गांधी के साथ आंदोलन ये जहां-जहां हुआ, अनेक ऐसी माताएं-बहनें उस आंदोनल का नेतृत्‍व करती थीं और देश को आजादी दिलाने में भी हमारी माताओं-बहनों का उस युग में भी उतना ही योगदान था। आज भी राष्‍ट्र के जीवन में उनका उतना ही योगदान है। उसको आगे बढ़ाने की दिशा में हम लोगों ने कर्तव्‍य से आगे बढ़ना चाहिए।

ये बात सही है कि 1857 से 1942, हमने देखा कि आजादी का आंदोलन अलग-अलग पड़ाव से गुजरा, उतार-चढ़ाव आए, अलग-अलग मोड़ आए, नेतृत्‍व नए-नए आते गए, कभी क्रांति का पक्ष ऊपर हो गया तो कभी अहिंसा का पक्ष ऊपर हो गया। कभी दोनों धाराओं के बीच टकराव का भी माहौल रहा, कभी दोनों धाराएं एक-दूसरे को पूरक भी हुईं। लेकिन हमने देखा है, लेकिन ये सारा 1857 से 1942 का कालखंड हम देखें, एक प्रकार से incremental था। धीरे-धीरे बढ़ रहा था, धीरे-धीरे फैल रहा था, धीरे-धीरे लोग जुड़ रहे थे। लेकिन Nineteen Forty Two to Nineteen Forty Seven, वो incremental change नहीं था। एक disruption का environment था और उसने सारे समीकरणों को खत्‍म करके आजादी देने के लिए अंग्रेजों को मजबूर कर दिया, जाने के लिए मजबूर कर दिया। 1857 से 1942, धीरे-धीरे कुछ होता रहता था, चलता रहता था, लेकिन Forty Two से Forty Seven, वो स्थिति नहीं थी।

हम भी देखें, समाज जीवन में हम पिछले 100, 200 साल का इतिहास देखें तो विकास की यात्रा एक incremental रही थी। धीरे-धीरे दुनिया आगे बढ़ रही थी, धीरे-धीरे दुनिया अपने-आपको बदल रही थी। लेकिन पिछले 30-40 साल में दुनिया में अचानक बदलाव आया, जीवन में अचानक बदलाव आया और technology ने बहुत बड़ा roll play किया। कोई कल्‍पना नहीं कर सकता जो इस 30-40 साल में दुनिया में जो बदलाव आया है, व्‍यक्ति के जीवन में, मानव-जीवन में, सोच में जो बदलाव आया है; 30-40 साल पहले हमें नजर भी नहीं आता था। एक disruption वाला एक positive change हम अनुभव करते हैं।

जिस प्रकार से Incremental से बाहर निकल करके एक sum से एक high jump की तरफ चले गए, मैं समझता हूं 2070 (Two thousand Seventy), 2022 (Two thousand Twenty Two), Quit India के 75 साल और आजादी के 75 साल के बीच का पांच साल, Forty two to Forty seven का जो मिजाज था, वही मिजाज अगर हम दोबारा देश में पैदा करें Two thousand Seventy to Two thousand Twenty Two, आजादी के 75 साल मनाएंगे तब, तब हम देश के, हमारे आजादी के वीरों की जो कामनाएं थीं, उन सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए हम अपने-आपको खपाएंगे। हम अपने संकल्‍प को ले करके आगे चलेंगे। मुझे विश्‍वास है न सिर्फ हमारे देश का ही भला होगा, लेकिन जैसे Forty two to Forty seven की सफलता के कारण दुनिया के अनेक देशों को लाभ मिला, आजादी की ललक पैदा हुई, ताकत मिली, भारत को आज दुनिया के कई देश, एक भाग ऐसा है जो भारत को उस रूप में देख रहा है। अगर हम भारत को Two thousand Seventeen to Two thousand Twenty Two, जो कि हम लोगों की जिम्‍मेवारी का कालखंड है, अगर हम विश्‍व के सामने भारत को उस ऊंचाई पर लेके जाते हैं तो विश्‍व का एक बहुत बड़ा समुदाय है, जो कि नेतृत्‍व की तलाश में, मदद की तलाश में है, किसी के प्रयोगों से सीखना चाहता है; भारत उस पूर्ति के लिए सामर्थ्‍यवान है; अगर उसको करने के लिए हम कोशिश करें, मैं समझता हूं देश की बहुत बड़ी सेवा होगी। और इसलिए एक सामूहिक इच्‍छा-शक्ति जगाना, देश को संकल्‍पबद्ध करना, देश के लोगों को साथ जोड़ करके चलना और इन पांच वर्ष के महत्‍व को हम अगर आगे बढ़ाएंगे तो मुझे विश्‍वास है कि हम कुछ मुद्दों पर सहमति बना करके बहुत बड़ा काम कर सकते हैं।

हमने अभी-अभी देखा जीएसटी, और ये मैं बार-बार कहता हूं ये मेरा सिर्फ राजनीतिक statement नहीं है, ये मेरा conviction है। जीएसटी की सफलता किसी सरकार की सफलता नहीं है, जीएसटी की सफलता किसी दल की सफलता नहीं है। जीएसटी की सफलता इस सदन में बैठे हुए लोगों की इच्‍छाशक्ति का परिणाम है। चाहे यहां बैठे हों, चाहे वहां बैठे हों, ये सबको जाता है, राज्‍यों को जाता है, देश के सामान्‍य व्‍यापारी को जाता है; और उसी के कारण ये संभव हुआ है। जो देश के राजनीतिक नेतृत्‍व अपनी प्रतिबद्धता के कारण इतना बड़ा काम कर लेती है, दुनिया के लिए अजूबा है। जीएसटी विश्‍व के लिए बहुत बड़ा अजूबा है, उसके Scale को देख करके हुए, अगर ये देश ये कर सकता है, तो और भी सारे निर्णय ये देख मिल-बैठ करके कर सकता है। और सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के प्रतिनिधि के रूप में, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों को साथ ले करके 2022 को संकल्‍प ले करके अगर हम चलेंगे, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि जो परिणाम हमें लाना है, और वो परिणाम हम लाके रहेंगे।

महात्‍मा गांधी ने नारा दिया था करो या मरो, उस समय का सूत्र था, करेंगे या मरेंगे। आज 2017 में 2022 को भारत कैसे हो, ये संकल्‍प ले करके अगर चलना है, तो हम लोगों को भी हम सब मिल करके देश से भ्रष्‍टाचार दूर करेंगे और करके रहेंगे। हम सभी मिलकर गरीबों को उनका अधिकार दिलाएंगे, और दिलाकर रहेंगे। हम सभी मिलकर नौजवानों को स्‍वरोजगार के और अवसर देंगे और देकर रहेंगे। हम सभी मिलकर देश से कुपोषण की समस्‍या को खत्‍म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे। हम सभी मिलकर महिलाओं को आगे बढ़ने से रोकने वाली बेड़ियों को खत्‍म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे। हम सभी मिलकर देश से अशिक्षा खत्‍म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे। और कोई भी बहुत विषय हो सकते हैं, लेकिन अगर उस समय का मंत्र था करेंगे या मरेंगे, तो आजाद हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में 75 साल बाद आजादी का पर्व मनाने की ओर आगे बढ़ रहे हैं तब करेंगे और करके रहेंगे, इस संकल्‍प को ले करके हम आगे बढ़ेंगे। ये संकल्‍प किसी दल का नहीं, ये संकल्‍प किसी सरकार का नहीं, ये संकल्‍प सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के जन-प्रतिनिधि, इन सबका मिल करके जब संकल्‍प बनेगा तो मुझे विश्‍वास है संकल्‍प से सिद्धि के ये पांच साल, 2017 से 2022, आजादी के 75 साल, आजादी के दीवानों को सपना पूरा करने का सामर्थ्‍यवान समय, इसको हम प्रेरणा का कारण बनाएं। आज अगस्‍त क्रांति दिवस पर उन महापुरुषों का स्‍मरण करते हुए, उनके त्‍याग, तपस्‍या, बलिदान का स्‍मरण करते हुए, उस पुण्‍य स्‍मरण से आशीर्वाद मांगते हुए, हम सब मिल करके, कुछ बातों पर सहमति बना करके देश का नेतृत्‍व दें, देश को समस्‍याओं से मुक्‍त करें। सपने, सामर्थ्‍य, शक्ति और लक्ष्‍य की पूर्ति के लिए आगे बढ़ें, इसी एक अपेक्षा के साथ मैं फिर एक बार अध्‍यक्ष महोदया जी, मैं आपका आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं और आजादी के दीवानों को नमन करता हूं।

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, delivered an address in the Lok Sabha, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement.

He said that the recollection of movements such as the Quit India Movement, is a source of inspiration, and added that the current generation has a responsibility of passing on the legacy of such movements, to the future generations.

The Prime Minister recalled that even as many senior leaders like Mahatma Gandhi were jailed at the beginning of the Quit India Movement, a new generation of leaders emerged to fill the vacuum and take the movement forward.

The Prime Minister noted that the freedom struggle went through several phases, and recalled various leaders and movements that emerged at various points since 1857. He added that the Quit India Movement that began in 1942, was a decisive movement. Quoting Gandhiji, the Prime Minister said that all sections of people joined in, responding to Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call of “Do or Die.” He said that from political leaders to the common man, everyone was imbued with this spirit. Five years was all it took to achieve the objective of independence, once the entire country shared this common resolve, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister quoted the writer Ramvriksha Benipuri, and the poet Sohanlal Dwivedi to describe the mood that prevailed at that time.

The Prime Minister noted that corruption, poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition are challenges that India now needs to overcome. He said that a positive transformation, and a common resolve is required for this. He also mentioned the role played by women in the freedom struggle, and said that women can add immense strength to our common objectives, even today.

Speaking about rights and duties, the Prime Minister said that while we are well aware of our rights, we cannot forget our duties, and these too, must become part of our way of life.

The Prime Minister said that colonialism began in India, and its end too, began with India’s independence, which was soon followed by the fall of colonialism across Asia and Africa.

In 1942, conditions internationally became favourable for India to get independence, the Prime Minister said, noting that today again, the global conditions are favourable for India. He said, that from 1857 to 1942, the move towards freedom was incremental, but the years from 1942 to 1947, were transformative, and delivered on the objective. The Prime Minister urged the Members of Parliament to rise above differences, and join in a common effort to create an India of the dreams of the freedom fighters in the next five years, from 2017 to 2022, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of independence.

The Prime Minister said that if in 1942, the clarion call was “Karenge Ya Marenge,” today the call should be “Karenge aur Karke Rahenge.” He said that the next five years should also be about “Sankalp se Siddhi” – a resolve which will lead us to accomplishment.

The Prime Minister concluded with the following resolve to overcome corruption, give the poor their rights, give youth self-employment, end malnutrition, end barriers to women empowerment, and end illiteracy:

·         हम सभी मिलकर देश से भ्रष्टाचार दूर करेंगे, और करके रहेंगे

·         हम सभी मिलकर गरीबों को उनका अधिकार दिलाएंगे और दिलाकर रहेंगे

·         हम सभी मिलकर नौजवानों को स्वरोजगार के और अवसर देंगे और देकर रहेंगे

·         हम सभी मिलकर देश से कुपोषण की समस्या को खत्म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे

·         हम सभी मिलकर महिलाओं को आगे बढ़ने से रोकने वाली बेड़ियों को खत्म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे

·         हम सभी मिलकर देश से अशिक्षा को खत्म करेंगे और करके रहेंगे

“On the 75th anniversary of the historic Quit India movement, we salute all the great women & men who took part in the movement.

Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the entire nation came together with the aim of attaining freedom.

In 1942, the need of the hour was to free India from colonialism. Today, 75 years later the issues are different.

Let us pledge to free India from poverty, dirt, corruption, terrorism, casteism, communalism & create a 'New India' of our dreams by 2022.

Let us work shoulder to shoulder to create the India that our freedom fighters would be proud of. #SankalpSeSiddhi”, the Prime Minister said.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the nation on the Sanskrit Day and shared his greetings with the people in Sanskrit. 

The Sanskrit text is as follows:  

“भारतस्य समृद्धः इतिहासः संस्कृतिः परम्परा च संस्कृते अस्ति। संस्कृतस्य ज्ञानम् अस्मान् तेन समृद्ध-वैभवोपेत-अतीतेन सह योजयति।“

“संस्कृतप्रेमिभ्यः तथा च अस्याः सुन्दर्याः भाषायाः पठितृभ्यः सर्वेभ्यः संस्कृतदिवस-सन्दर्भे मम हार्दिक-शुभकामनाः।” 

It implies that India’s rich history, culture and tradition are in Sanskrit. The knowledge of Sanskrit connects us with our rich literature, heritage and glorious past. On the occasion of Sanskrit Day I extend my heartfelt greetings to the scholars and students of this beautiful language.

The second edition of ""Samvad""- Global Initiative on Conflict Avoidance and Environment Consciousness, is being organised in Yangon today and tomorrow.

The Vivekananda Kendra had, in September 2015, hosted the first edition of this unique conference,representing various religions and traditions, in New Delhi, which had been addressed by the Prime Minister.

In a video message to the second edition of Samvad, the Prime Minister said that societies across the world are facing several questions today, such as:

How to avoid conflict?

How to address a global challenge like climate change?

How to live in peace and harmony and secure our lives?

He said that it is only natural that the search for answers be led by the humanity’s longest traditions of thought, rooted in various religions, civilizations, and multiple streams of spirituality.

The Prime Minister said that he is a ""product of the ancient Indian tradition that firmly believes in dialogue on difficult issues."" He said that the ancient Indian concept of “Tarka Shastra” is founded on dialogue and debate as the model for exchange of views and avoidance of conflict.

Giving illustrations from Indian mythology such as Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Lord Buddha and Bhakta Prahlada, the Prime Minister said that the purpose of each of their actions was to uphold Dharma, which has sustained Indians from ancient to modern times.

The Prime Minister said “Samvad” or ""dialogue"" is the only way to cut through deep rooted religious stereotypes and prejudices that divide communities across the world and sow seeds of conflict between nations and societies.

The Prime Minister said that if man does not nurture nature, then nature reacts in the form of climate change. Environmental laws and regulations, while essential in any modern society, afford only an inferior protection to nature, he added, calling for ""harmonious environmental consciousness.""

Man must relate to nature, man must revere nature, not merely consider it a resource to be exploited, the Prime Minister asserted.

""As the inter-connected and inter-dependent world of 21st century battles a number of global challenges, from terrorism to climate change, I am confident that the solutions will be found through Asia’s oldest traditions of dialogue and debate,"" the Prime Minister said.

                A 25 member delegation from the Young FICCI Ladies Organisation called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. 

The delegation interacted with the Prime Minister on subjects such as women entrepreneurship, and women empowerment. 

The Prime Minister responded at length to various questions raised by the delegation members. 

He said Swachh Bharat Mission offers great opportunities for ""waste to wealth"" entrepreneurship, with significant benefits to community health. 

Responding to a question on water conservation, the Prime Minister said all of us should individually focus on judicious use of water; and micro and drip irrigation. 

The Prime Minister said family values, acceptance of diversity and environmental consciousness are three of India’s greatest traditions which we must nurture. 

Subjects such as education, skill development, art and culture and women's safety also came up for discussion.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed via video conference, the 99th birthday celebrations of Dada Vaswani in Pune. He recalled that he had first met Dada Vaswani 27 years ago at the World Religions Conference in the United Nations. He also recalled their meeting in Pune in 2013.

The Prime Minister praised Dada Vaswani for his selfless service to humanity. Appreciating Dada Vaswani’s thoughts on “Making the Right Choice,” the Prime Minister said that if people resolve to make the right choice, evils such as corruption, casteism, drug-abuse, crime etc., can be overcome. He spoke of India’s 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, and said India must resolve today, to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters by then. He urged the Sadhu Vaswani Mission to join this effort, in whatever ways it can.

Dada Vaswani thanked the Prime Minister, and described him as one of the greatest leaders of the world today. He said that initiatives launched by the Prime Minister, such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Make in India, Swachh Bharat etc. are having a visible impact. He said India has changed a lot in three years. He also said that not politics, but right education at the right time, is the key to nation-building. He said we should all strive to build a nation that all Indians can be proud of.

Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s address:

I convey my best wishes to respected Dada J.P. Vaswani on the occasion of his 99th birth day.

It is Dada Vaswani’s birth day but I have the good luck of getting his blessings. My hearty congratulations to all of you present in this program being held on the occasion of beginning of Dada Vaswani’s 100th year. Lakhs of Dada Vaswani’s followers are familiar with his innocent and sacred smile. It was 27 years ago when I first realized the simplicity and humility of his nature. At that time, the World Religion Conference was being held under the auspices of the UN and I also had the occasion to be there. Then I had hours of discussion with Dada Vaswani on nation building and social responsibilities. In 2013, we two jointly inaugurated Sadhu Vaswani College of Nursing in Pune. Last year when Dada Vaswani came Delhi I again had an opportunity to meet him. Even at that time we had a lengthy discussion on important topics like education and health. It would have been better if I could meet you today. I could not make it but for my engagements.

Friends, The personality of Dada Vaswani takes forward the spiritual journey of the sage tradition of modern India. Whenever I meet him I get the lively touch of the real power of fulfillment, humility and love that are there in his personality. The very basis of Dada Vaswani’s life has been the tendency to sacrifice everything for others. I am reminded of one Dada J. P. Vaswani’s sayings –You should do whatever good you can! Do good to as many people as you can. Do good in as many ways as you can. Do good as many times as you can.

These sacred words of Dada Vaswani open the avenue for empowerment of the entire mankind. In our society there are numerous people who are weak, who are sad, who are poor and oppressed, who are exploited and excluded. They have been struggling, they have been working hard to change the condition. Sadhu Vaswani Mission has been working for years to make their lives easier. I convey my sincere regard to them. Friends, I am very happy that you have begun this celebration. I would like to especially discuss the topic that was discussed by you two days ago. The topic, Make The Right Choice, is very relevant in the present context. I would like to repeat here the beautiful thoughts of Dada Vaswani on the topic of making the right and wrong choices in life.

Dada Vaswani has said, “We have to calm our awareness for making the right choices, we have to control our emotions. ‘We can make the right choice by contemplating with an open heart while believing that God is present everywhere. Every experience in life teaches us a lesson. In what way we take that lesson, it depends on us.” Today’s youth should take inspiration from these teachings of Dada Vaswani. A person has to always face this kind of situations in his life. Today, this is the root cause behind plenty of evils plaguing the society that several people choose the wrong path despite knowing that it is wrong. Whether it is corruption or casteism or crime or drug addiction, all of these can be tackled if the person improves his ability to make choices in the life. This is also the basis of an empowered society that every individual of the society makes the correct choices and follows them.

Friends, It’s such a lovely coincidence that this year is the centenary year of the Champaran movement. Mahatma Gandhi not only introduced in the country the power of the passive resistance through Champaran Satyagrah but he also established people’s participation as a powerful formula for fighting the social evils. Government is celebrating the centenary year of Champaran movement as a call for cleanliness. The blessings of Dada Vaswani will further strengthen the call for cleanliness (Swachchagrah). It will be helpful in realising the unfulfilled dream of Mahatma Gandhi.

Clean India mission is going on in the country like a people’s movement. When this campaign was started on the 2nd October 2014 then the coverage of rural cleanliness in the country was just 39 per cent. Today, it has expanded to 66 per cent. One very healthy tradition has also begun. There is a competition among the villages, among the districts and states to declare themselves as open defecation free. Untill now 2 lakh 17 thousand villages of the country have declared themselves as open defecation free. Five states of the country – Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Kerala are part of this list. All of you are doing so much in the field of education, in the field of women welfare and in the field of health. Your contribution in the field of cleanliness campaign will not only teach people but it will also improve their health. Today, I would like to make an appeal to every social organisation of this country through this programme.

Friends, Toilets can be constructed by putting together bricks and stones, roads can be cleaned by gathering the workers, railway stations and bus stations can also be cleaned but in order to keep them clean on regular basis all of us will have to make collective effort. Cleanliness is not a system, it’s a habit. It is necessary that it becomes the habit of all of us. If we make regular and concerted effort by considering the cleanliness as a tendency then it will automatically become the tendency of the society.

Similarly there is a need for regularly making the people aware about the environment protection. Today, climate change has emerged as a very big challenge before the entire world. The programs to plant more and more saplings, the programmes related with the waste to energy scheme, the programmes aimed at motivating people towards solar energy, the programmes aimed at inspiring people towards water conservation will strengthen our nature and environment.

Friends, I would also like to call upon your organisation with a sense of right as Dada Vaswani and his organisation have shown so much affection for me. Our country will celebrate the 75th year of its independence in 2022. Dada Vaswani himself had witnessed the freedom struggle. The dreams of those who sacrificed their lives for the sake of country’s independence are still unfulfilled. In order to realise these unfulfilled dreams, today, the country is making a solemn pledge in 2017. This solemn pledge is for a New India.

The blessings of Dada Vaswani and the will power of Sadhu Vaswani Mission will help in realisation of this solemn pledge. So I urge your organisation to set its goals for 2022. These goals should be quantifiable. For example that every year you people will establish contacts with 10 or 20 thousand people to motivate them for cleanliness, like you people would reach out to 5 or 10 thousand people every year to encourage solar power, these are the pledges to be made by your organisation itself. When every individual of the country, every family and every organisation will decide their own goals and will work hard to realise them then the goal will be achieved and it will also realise the dream of a New India. Given the life of Dada Vaswani, all of us who love him and who have been loved by him, we will have to decide that how we are going to celebrate the centenary year.

I would suggest that this centenary year should be focused on one topic, under which every individual should do something for the society, he should live for the society and I am confident that the hard work of Dada Vaswani will bear fruits. Dada Vaswani’s teachings will continue to inspire us to achieve this goal. I conclude with this hope that his blessings will continue to shower upon us like this. Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today announced a relief package of over Rs. 2000 crore for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and flood mitigation measures in the flood-affected North-Eastern states. The announcement came at the end of a series of high level meetings, where the Prime Minister reviewed the flood situation, and relief measures in the States. 

Through the course of the day, the Prime Minister held separate, detailed review meetings on the situation in the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. The Chief Ministers of the respective States, and senior officials were present at the meetings. A memorandum was received from the Chief Minister of Mizoram, who could not make it to the meeting in person. 

Over Rs. 1200 crore will be given by the Union Government for the infrastructure sector alone. The funds will be utilized for repair, maintenance, and strengthening of roads, highways, bridges, and other damaged infrastructure. 

Rs. 400 crore will be provided for improving the water holding capacity of the Brahmaputra River, which will assist in flood control. 

In the current financial year, the Union Government has approved Rs. 600 crore as central share of SDRF. Out of this, Rs. 345 crore has already been released, and the remaining will be released immediately, to assist the States in relief and rehabilitation work. 

The Union Government will also provide Rs. 100 crore for carrying out a study to synergize efforts towards finding time-bound long term solutions to recurrent floods in the region. 

The North-Eastern region, with eight percent of India's land area, contains one-third of the country's water resources. The Union Government will constitute a High Level Committee, with representation from Ministries of the Government of India and the States, for proper management of the region's vast water resources. 

An ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, and Rs. 50,000/- to each of those seriously injured due to the floods, has been sanctioned under the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF).

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Myanmar for the conservation of earthquake-damaged pagodas at Bagan, Myanmar. The MoU will be signed during the visit of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Myanmar during 6-7 September 2017.

Implementation of the project will further strengthen India’s enduring ties in culture and religion with Myanmar. It will also generate immense goodwill for India among the people of Myanmar due to the religious significance as well as the touristic significance of the project. It will also contribute to India’s development partnership with Myanmar. Bagan is one of the premier tourist attractions of Myanmar. It will be an opportunity to showcase India’s expertise in the restoration and conservation of monuments not only to the people of Myanmar but also to the tourists from other countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the proposal of the Finance Ministry to promulgate an ordinance to suitably amend the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017.

The approval would allow to increase the maximum rate at which the Compensation Cess can be levied from 15% to 25% on:

a) motor vehicles for transport of not more than thirteen persons, including the driver [falling under sub-headings 870210, 8702 20, 8702 30 or 8702 90]; and

b) motor vehicles falling under headings 8703.

The GST Council, in its meeting held in August 2017, taking into consideration the fact that post introduction of GST, the total incidence on motor vehicles [GST+ Compensation Cess] has come down vis-a-vis pre-GST total tax, incidence, and had recommended increase in the maximum rate at which Compensation Cess can be levied on motor vehicles falling under headings 8702 and 8703 from 15% to 25%.

The issue regarding the increase in effective rate of Compensation Cess on motor vehicles will be examined by the GST Council in due course.

This addresses an issue pending for nearly 24 years.  This will ensure that the children of those serving in lower categories in PSUs and other institutions can get the benefit of OBC reservations, on par with children of people serving in lower categories in Government. This will also prevent children of those in senior positions in such institutions, who, owing to absence of equivalence of posts, may have been treated as non Creamy Layer by virtue of wrong interpretation of income standards from cornering government posts reserved for OBCs and denying the genuine non creamy layer candidates a level playing field.

The Union Cabinet also approved the increase in the present income criterion of Rs. 6 lakh per annum for applying the Creamy Layer restriction throughout the country, for excluding Socially Advanced Persons/Sections (Creamy Layer) from the purview of reservation of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The new income criterion will be Rs. 8 lakh per annum. The increase in the income limit to exclude the Creamy Layer is in keeping with the increase in the Consumer Price Index and will enable more persons to take advantage of reservation benefits extended to OBCs in government services and admission to central educational institutions.

These measures are a part of the Government's efforts to ensure greater social justice and inclusion for members of the Other Backward Classes. The Government has already introduced in Parliament, a bill to provide Constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes. It has also decided to set up a Commission, under section 340 of the Constitution, to sub categorize the OBCs, so that the more backward among the OBC communities can also access the benefits of reservation for educational institutions and government jobs. All these decisions, taken together, are expected to ensure greater representation of OBCs in educational institutions and jobs, while also ensuring that the more under-privileged within the category are not denied their chance of social mobility.

Background:

In its judgment dated 16.11.1992 in WP(C) 930/1990 (IndraSawhney case) the Supreme Court had directed the Government to specify the basis, for exclusion of socially and economically advanced persons from Other Backward Classes by applying the relevant and requisite socio-economic criteria.

An Expert Committee was constituted in February 1993 which submitted its report on 10.03.1993 specifying the criteria for identification of socially advanced persons among OBCs i.e. the Creamy Layer. The report was accepted by the then Ministry of Welfare and forwarded to DoPT which issued an OM dated 08.09.1993 on exclusion from the Creamy Layer.

The OM of 08.09.1993 specifies six categories for identifying Creamy Layer (a) Constitutional/Statutory post (b) Group  ‘A’  and Group ‘B’ Officers of Central and State Governments, employees of PSUs and Statutory bodies, universities, (c) Colonel and above in armed forces and equivalent in paramilitary  forces (d) professionals like Doctors, Lawyers, Management Consultants, Engineers etc. (e) Property owners with agricultural holdings or vacant land and/or buildings  and (f) income/wealth tax asessee.

The OM further stipulates that the said parameters would apply mutatis mutandis to officers holding equivalent or comparable posts in PSUs, Banks, Insurance Organizations, Universities, etc. and Government was required to determine equivalence of positions in these organizations with those in Government.

Pending the equivalence to the established in these institutions Income criteria would apply for the officers in these Institutions.

However, this exercise of determining the equivalence of posts in Government and posts in PSUs, PSBs etc. had not been initiated. The determination of equivalence of posts has been thus pending for almost 24 years.

The matter of formulating equivalence has since been examined in detail. In PSUs, all Executive level posts i.e. Board level executives and managerial level posts would be treated as equivalent to group 'A' posts in Government and will be considered Creamy Layer. Junior Management Grade Scale–1 and above of  Public Sector Banks, Financial Institutions and Public Sector Insurance Corporations will be treated as equivalent to Group 'A' in the Government of India and considered as Creamy Layer. For Clerks and Peons in PSBs, FIs and PSICs, the Income Test as revised from time to time will be applicable. These are the broad guidelines and each individual Bank, PSU, Insurance Company would place the matter before their respective board to identify individual posts.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given in-principle approval for Public Sector Banks to amalgamate through an Alternative Mechanism (AM).  The decision would facilitate consolidation among the Nationalised Banks to create strong and competitive banks. 

 Salient features:

 

            The salient features of the approval Framework for Consolidation of Public Sector Banks are as follows:

 

·         The decision regarding creating strong and competitive banks would be solely based on commercial considerations.

·         The proposal must start from the Boards of Banks.

·         The proposals received from Banks for in-principle approval to formulate schemes of amalgamation shall be placed before the Alternative Mechanism (AM).

·         After in-principle approval, the Banks will take steps in accordance with law and SEBI’s requirements.

·         The final scheme will be notified by Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.

 

Background:

 

In 1991, it was suggested that India should have fewer but stronger Public Sector Banks. However, it was only in May 2016 that effective action to consolidate public sector banks began to be taken by announcing amalgamation of six banks into the State bank of India. The merger was completed in record time, unlike earlier mergers of State Banks of Indore and Saurashtra.

 SBI is now a single bank with about 24000 branches, over 59000 ATMs, 6 lakh POS machines and over 50,000 business correspondents, which serve all parts of the country, including far flung areas. Indeed 70% of SBI’s network lies in rural and semi urban areas. In that sense, the bank serves to unite India through a uniform banking culture. It also has a significant international presence, and is one of the largest global banks. Its size, financial strength and outreach have made it possible for customers to access a worldwide network of branches across all time zones, as well as to a very wide variety of banking products and superior technology. Loans to the small business man or woman and to the Krishak have become cheaper as SBI offers the lowest lending rates. More than 8.6 lakh merchants have been on board on BHIM Aadhaar, Bharat QR and POS, increasing the digital banking footprint. SBI has successfully raised Rs.15,000 crore QIP.

 There are now 20 PSBs other than SBI. The banking scenario has changed since 1970/80 when banks were nationalised, with an increased banking presence from Private Sector Banks, non-banking Financial Companies, Regional Rural Banks, Payment Banks and Small Finance Banks. The decision is expected to facilitate the creation of strong and competitive banks in public sector space to meet the credit needs of a growing economy, absorb shocks and have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Nepal on Drug Demand Reduction and Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and precursor chemicals and related matters. 

The MoU lists out the areas of cooperation on drug matters between the two countries. It also indicates the mechanism of information exchange and the competent authorities in the two countries who are responsible for the implementation of the MoU and exchange of any information. 

Cooperation on drug matters is expected to curb the illicit traffic of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals in the two countries. 

The MoU provides that the Parties shall endeavour to: - 

(i) develop mutual cooperation with a view to effectively resolving the issue of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, cooperate in drug demand reduction through prevention, awareness, education and community based programmes, treatment and rehabilitation; and 

(ii) exchange information of operational, technical and general nature in drug matters, exchange literature on their existing laws, rules, procedures, best practices and methods of curbing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors and any further amendments to the existing legislation. 

Background:

India has always supported global efforts to counter drug trafficking and is party to several multilateral and bilateral initiatives in this regard as also United Nations (UN) led initiatives. In accordance with the spirit of UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs, effort is made to enter into Bilateral Agreements/MoUs with neighbouring countries and the countries which have a direct bearing on the drug situation prevailing in our country. Such Bilateral Agreements/ MoUs have already been executed with various countries. The proposed MoU with Nepal is another such MoU which shall be entered for the purpose of bilateral cooperation on drug matters.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a proposal for setting up of a Commission under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issue of sub-categorization of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

The Commission shall submit its report within 12 weeks from the date of appointment of the Chairperson of the Commission. The Commission shall be known as the Commission to examine the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.

The proposed terms of references of the Commission are as follows:

(i)      To examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes/ communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list.

(ii)     To work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters, in a scientific approach, for sub-categorization within such OBCs, and,

(iii)    To take up the exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/ sub-castes/ synonyms in the Central List of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

The Supreme Court in its order dated 16.11.1992 in WP(C) No. 930/1990 (Indra Sawhney and others vs. Union of India) observed that there is no Constitutional or legal bar to a State categorizing backward classes as backward or more backward and had further observed that if a State chooses to do it (sub-categorization), it is not impermissible in law.

Nine States of the country viz., Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have already carried out sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed between India and Nepal for laying down implementation arrangement on Cost sharing, Schedules and Safeguard issues for starting construction of a new Bridge over Mechi River at Indo-Nepal border.

The estimated cost of construction of the bridge is Rs. 158.65 crore, which would be funded by Government of India through ADB loan. The new bridge is part of up-gradation of the Kakarvitta (Nepal) to Panitanki Bypass (India) on NH 327B covering a length of 1500 meters including a 6 lane approach road of 825 meters. Mechi Bridge is the ending point of Asian Highway 02 in India leading to Nepal and provides critical connectivity to Nepal.

The construction of the bridge will improve regional connectivity and has potential to strengthen cross border trade between both the countries and cementing ties by strengthening industrial, social and cultural exchanges.

National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) under Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has been designated as the implementing agency for this project. DPR for this project has been prepared and alignment of bridge has been finalized in consultation with Government of Nepal.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) of upto Rs. 9020 crore as per the requirement during 2017-18 by NABARD through issuance of Bonds for ensuring lending rate of 6% per annum (pa) in respect of borrowings for implementation of Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) works of 99 ongoing prioritized irrigation projects along with their command area development (CAD) works under PMKSY. 

A large number of major and medium irrigation projects taken up under Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) were languishing mainly due to inadequate provision of funds. During 2016-17, 99 ongoing projects under PMKSY- AIBP were identified for completion in phases by December-2019. To cater to the large fund requirement and ensure completion of these projects, the Union Finance Minister, during his Budget speech 2016-17, announced creation of dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) in NABARD with an initial corpus of Rs. 20,000 crore for funding of Central and State share for the identified ongoing projects under PMKSY (AIBP and CAD). 

To make the loan from NABARD attractive for states, it was decided that the rate of interest may be kept around 6% by providing requisite cost free funds to NABARD every year during 2016-17 to 2019-20 on which interest cost would be borne by Govt. of India.

During the year 2016-17, NABARD disbursed aggregate amount of Rs. 9086.02 crore under LTIF, out of which Rs. 2414.16 crore was released for Polavaram project (without EBR component) and balance Rs. 6671.86 crore was released to identified projects using EBR. Further, an amount of Rs. 924.9 crore was disbursed as Central Assistance (CA) through budgetary provision. During 2016-17, overall an amount of Rs 2187 crore was raised by NABARD in the form of Government of India fully serviced bond as EBR. 

During 2017-18, it is estimated that an amount of Rs 29,000 Crore may be required through LTIF, for which EBR of Rs 9020 cr would be required. 

As per the status reported by the states and Central Water Commission during various review meeting, 18 projects have been completed/almost completed. Irrigation potential utilization is expected to be more than 14 lakh hectares during 2016-17 from all the 99 projects. During 2017-18, 33 more projects are likely to be completed. The completion of the identified irrigation projects will generate immediate wage and other employment opportunities in good measure during the construction phase. More importantly, on completion of the projects, the utilization of irrigation potential of about 76 lakh hectares will transform the agriculture scenario of the region resulting in generation of substantially more employment opportunities through increase in cropping intensity, change in cropping pattern, agro processing and other ancillary activities.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a new Metro Rail Policy that seeks to enable realization of growing metro rail aspirations of a large number of cities but in a responsible manner.

The policy opens a big window for private investments across a range of metro operations making PPP component mandatory for availing central assistance for new metro projects. Private investment and other innovative forms of financing of metro projects have been made compulsory to meet the huge resource demand for capital intensive high capacity metro projects.

“Private participation either for complete provision of metro rail or for some unbundled components (like Automatic Fare Collection, Operation & Maintenance of services etc) will form an essential requirement for all metro ra il projects seeking central financial assistance” says the policy, to capitalize on private resources, expertise and entrepreneurship.

In view of inadequate availability and even absence of last mile connectivity at present, the new policy seeks to ensure it focusing on a catchment area of five kms. on either side of metro stations requiring States to commit in project reports to provide necessary last mile connectivity through feeder services, Non-Motorised Transport infrastructure like walking and cycling pathways and introduction of para-transport facilities. States, proposing new metro projects will be required to indicate in project report the proposals and investments that would be made for such services.

Seeking to ensure that least cost mass transit mode is selected for public transport, the new policy mandates Alternate Analysis, requiring evaluation of other modes of mass transit like BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System), Light Rail Transit, Tramways, Metro Rail and Regional Rail in terms of demand, capacity, cost and ease of implementation. Setting up of Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) has been made mandatory which is to prepare Comprehensive Mobility Plans for cities for ensuring complete multi-modal integration for optimal utilization of capacities.

The new Metro Rail Policy provides for rigorous assessment of new metro proposals and proposes an independent third party assessment by agencies to be identified by the Government like the Institute of Urban Transport and other such Centres of Excellence whose capacities would be augmented, as required in this regard. 

Taking note of substantial social, economic and environmental gains of metro projects, the Policy stipulated a shift from the present ‘Financial Internal Rate of Return of 8%’ to ‘Economic Internal Rate of Return of 14%’ for approving metro projects, in line with global practices.

Noting that urban mass transit projects should not merely be seen as urban transport projects but more as urban transformation projects, the new policy mandates Transit Oriented Development (TOD) to promote compact and dense urban development along metro corridors since TOD reduces travel distances besides enabling efficient land use in urban areas. Under the policy, States need to adopt innovative mechanisms like Value Capture Financing tools to mobilize resources for financing metro projects by capturing a share of increase in the asset values through ‘Betterment Levy’. States would also be required to enable low cost debt capital through issuance of corporate bonds for metro projects.

Seeking to ensure financial viability of metro projects, the new Metro Rail Policy requires the States to clearly indicate in the project report the measures to be taken for commercial/property development at stations and on other urban land and for other means of maximum non-fare revenue generation through advertisements, lease of space etc., backed by statutory support. States are also required to commit to accord all required permissions and approvals.

The new policy empowers States to make rules and regulations and set up permanent Fare Fixation Authority for timely revision of fares. States can take up metro projects exercising any of the three options for availing central assistance. These include; PPP with central assistance under the Viability Gap Funding scheme of the Ministry of Finance, Grant by Government of India under which 10% of the project cost will be given as lump sum central assistance and 50:50 Equity sharing model between central and state governments. Under all these options, private participation, however, is mandatory.

The policy envisages private sector participation in O & M of metro services in different ways. These include:

 

1.Cost plus fee contract:  Private operator is paid a monthly/annual payment for O&M of system. This can have a fixed and variable component depending on the quality of service. Operational and revenue risk is borne by the owner.

2. Gross Cost Contract:   Private operator is paid a fixed sum for the duration of the contract. Operator to bear the O&M risk while the owner bears the revenue risk.

3. Net Cost Contract:   Operator collects the complete revenue generated for the services provided. If revenue generation is below the O&M cost, the owner may agree to compensate.

At present, metro projects with  a total length of 370  kms are operational in 8 cities viz., Delhi (217 kms), Bengaluru (42.30  kms), Kolkata (27.39 kms), Chennai (27.36 kms), Kochi (13.30 kms), Mumbai (Metro Line 1-11.40 km, Mono Rail Phase 1-9.0 km), Jaipur-9.00 kms and Gurugram (Rapid Metro-1.60 km).

Metro Projects with a total length of 537 kms are in progress in 13 cities including the eight mentioned above. New cities acquiring metro services are; Hyderabad (71 kms), Nagpur (38 kms), Ahmedabad (36 kms), Pune (31.25 kms) and Lucknow (23 kms).

Metro projects with a total length of 595 kms in 13 cities including 10 new cities are at various stages of planning and appraisal. These are; Delhi Metro Phase IV- 103.93 km, Delhi & NCR-21.10 km, Vijayawada-26.03 km, Visakhapatnam-42.55 km, Bhopal-27.87 km, Indore-31.55 km, Kochi Metro Phase II-11.20 km, Greater Chandigarh Region Metro Project-37.56 km, Patna-27.88 km, Guwahati-61 km, Varanasi-29.24 km, Thiruvananthapuram & Kozhikode (Light Rail Transport)-35.12 km and Chennai Phase II-107.50 km.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval to the proposal to complete the balance works of the North Koel Reservoir Project in Jharkhand and Bihar at an estimated expenditure of Rs.1622.27 crore to be incurred during three financial years from the start of the project. 

The Cabinet also approved storage of water in dam restricted at lower level than envisaged earlier to reduce the submergence and to protect Betla National Park and Palamau Tiger Reserve.

 

The project is situated on North Koel river which is a tributary of Sone river finally joining the river Ganga.  The North Koel Reservoir is located in the most backward tribal areas in Palamau and Garhwa districts of Jharkhand State. The construction was originally started in the year 1972 and continued till 1993 when it was stopped by the Forest Department, Govt. of Bihar. Since then, the work on dam is at a standstill. The major components of project are: 67.86 m high and 343.33 m long concrete dam called Mandal dam originally intended to  store 1160 million cubic metre (MCM) water; 819.6 m long barrage at Mohammadganj, 96 km downstream of the dam; and two canals originating from left and right banks of Mohammadganj Barrage with distributaries system for irrigation. With the new lowered elevation level (EL) of 341 metre, the Mandal dam will now have storage of 190 MCM.  The project aims to provide irrigation to 111,521 hectares of land annually in the most backward and drought prone areas of Palamu & Garhwa districts in Jharkhand and Aurangabad & Gaya districts in Bihar. The unfinished project as on date is providing irrigation to 71,720 hectares and completion of this project will provide additional irrigation benefit to the extent of 39,801 hectares. The irrigation potential through this Project in the two States would be as follows:

 

Total irrigation potential:                               1,11, 521 hectares

Irrigation potential in Bihar:                           91,917 hectares

Irrigation potential in Jharkhand:                   19,604 hectares

 

The total cost of the project as assessed on date is Rs 2391.36 crore.  An expenditure amounting to Rs. 769.09 crore has been incurred on the project till date. The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal for completing the balance of the North-Koel reservoir project in Jharkhand & Bihar at an estimated cost of Rs 1622.27 crore during three financial years. 

 

 The common components amounting to Rs.1013.11 crore of balance works would be funded by the Central Government as a grant from PMKSY Fund.  This would include cost of Net Present Value (NPV) and Compensatory Afforestation (CA) which comes to Rs.607 crore and Rs.43 crore respectively.  The Central Government will also fund 60% of the cost of balance works amounting to Rs.365.5 crore (Bihar Rs.318.64 crore and Jharkhand Rs.46.86 crore) from Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) under PMKSY as grant from the States of Bihar and Jharkhand.  The States of Bihar and Jharkhand will arrange 40% of remaining cost of balance works amounting to Rs.243.66 crore (Bihar 212.43 crore and Jharkhand 31.23 crore) as loan from LTIF through NABARD at the rate which is not subsidised and is related to market borrowing cost with no interest subvention. 

 

The Cabinet also approved execution of balance works of the project on turnkey basis by M/S WAPCOS Ltd., a CPSU under MoWR, RD & GR as Project Management Consultant (PMC).  The execution of the project will be monitored by an Empowered Committee of Government of India headed by CEO NITI Aayog.

Creation of regular posts in the AFHQ Civil Service will alleviate stagnation the cadre. It will be in the interest of better cadre management and bring improvement in the efficiency of the service. This would be an innovative measure entailing no additional cost but would bring benefits from the perspective of cadre management and enable its better utilisation. 

Creation of regular posts in the place of “in situ” promotions will ensure more transparency in cadre management. Assigning of higher responsibilities on regular posts will result in greater productivity and accountability with respect to AFHQ CS officers.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded its approval today for creation of a non-lapsable pool in the Public Account for secondary and higher, education known as ""Madhyamik and Uchchtar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) into which all proceeds of ""Secondary and Higher Education Cess"" will be credited.

The funds arising from the MUSK would be utilized for schemes in the education sector which would be available for the benefit of students of secondary and higher education, all over the country.

In connection with the above fund, the Union Cabinet also accorded its approval to the following:

 (i)      Administration and maintenance of the above pool by Ministry of Human Resource Development.

(ii)     Accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the ongoing schemes of Secondary and Higher Education. However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any future programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement, as per prescribed procedure,

 (iii)    In any financial year, the expenditure on ongoing schemes of the Department of School Education & Literacy and Department of Higher Education would be initially incurred from the gross budgetary support (GBS) and the expenditure would be financed from the MUSK only after the GBS is exhausted.

 (iv)    The MUSK would be maintained as a Reserve Fund in the non-interest bearing section of the Public Accounts of India.

 

The major benefit will be enhancing access to secondary and higher education through availability of adequate resources, while ensuring that the amount does not lapse at the end of financial year.

Features:

 

1.         Accruals into the proposed non-lapsable fund will be made available for expansion of secondary education and higher education. 

 

2.         For Secondary Education: Presently, the Ministry of Human Resources Development envisages that the accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the secondary education for:

    ongoing Rashtriya Madhyamik Shlksha Abhiyan Scheme and other approved programmes including:

    National Means-Cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme and

    National Scheme for Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education.

 

3.         For Higher Education: the accruals would be utilized for:

    ongoing Schemes of Interest Subsidy and contribution for guarantee funds, Scholarship for College & University Students;

    Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyaan;

    Scholarship (from Block Grant to the institutions) and National Mission on Teachers and Training.

    However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement & prescribed procedure.

The purpose of levying cess for secondary and higher education is to provide adequate resources for secondary and higher education.

The fund would be operationalised as per the present arrangements under Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) wherein the proceeds of cess are used for Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Schemes of the Department of School Education & Literacy.

Background:

 

(i)      During the 10th Plan, an education cess of 2% on all central taxes was imposed w.e.f. 1.4.2004 to make available additional    resources    for    basic    education/elementary education to augment the existing budgetary resources. A need was felt to give a similar fillip to the effort of the Central Government in universalizing access to secondary education and expanding the reach of the higher education sector.  Therefore, the Finance Minister, in his budget speech of 2007 proposed an additional cess of 1% on central taxes for secondary and higher education.

 

(ii)  A cess @ 1% on central taxes, called the ""Secondary and Higher Education Cess"" was levied through Finance Act, 2007 to ""fulfil the commitment of the Government to provide and finance secondary and higher education"" (Section 136 of the Act).

 

(iii)  In July, 2010, a draft cabinet note was circulated by the HRD Ministry wherein it was proposed to create a non-lapsable fund   in   the   Public Account   called   ""Madhyamik and Uchchatar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) as a receptacle for the proceeds of the Secondary and Higher Education Cess. The views of concerned Ministries viz the then Planning Commission, Ministry   of   North   Eastern   Region, and Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance were sought in this regard.  The Department of Economic Affairs did not agree to the proposal on the grounds that the Budget allocations for the schemes of Secondary Education and Higher Education have been far more than the amount of 1% cess collected. Therefore, the amount of the cess collected is deemed to have been fully allocated for the schemes of Secondary and Higher Education in the respective financial years. Hence, funds on account of 1% cess for the past period are not available now for allocation.

 

(iv) Subsequently, the HRD Ministry sought the approval of the Department of Economic Affairs for revisiting the issue of creation of ""Madhyamik and Uchchatar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) on 11th February, 2016. Department of Economic Affairs on 20th June, 2016 approved that this Ministry may move a draft Cabinet Note to seek the approval of the Cabinet for creation of. MUSK.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal of Ministry of Railways to close the Bharat Wagon and Engineering Company Limited (BWEL) - a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under Ministry of Railways. 

626 employees of BWEL will be benefitted from the voluntary retirement scheme to be offered at 2007 pay scale. The Government will have to provide one time grant off 151.18 crore towards severance package and for clearing the current liabilities of the company. 

This measure will stop flow of financial support from public funds for carrying on the operations of sick/loss making BWEL resulting in savings for the Government. 

The implementation will be done as per the timelines prescribed in the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) on time bound closure of sick/loss making CPSEs. 

In view of the continues poor physical and financial performance of the company for more than 10 years, in spite of financial assistance and other support provided by Ministry of Railways combined with low probability of its revival in future, Bharat Wagon and Engineering Co. Ltd. is being wound up. 

Background: 

BWEL was incorporated on 4th Dec' 1978 as a CPSE after taking over two sick private sector companies - Arthur Butler & Company, Muzaffarpur and Britannia Engineering Company, Mokama. The Company was referred to BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) in December, 2000 and was declared sick in the year 2002. The Company continues to be a sick Company since then. The administrative control of the company was transferred from Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) to the MoR in August, 2008, as approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. The company is engaged in the manufacture and repair of wagons, and is having two manufacturing units, at Mokama and Muzaffarpur in Bihar.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the renaming of the new Central Sector Scheme - SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) as ""Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) "" for the period of 2016-20 coterminous with the 14th Finance Commission cycle. Earlier, CCEA in its meeting held in May, 2017 approved the new Central Sector Scheme - SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) with same allocation and period . 

Objective:

The objective of PMKSY is to supplement agriculture, modernize processing and decrease Agri-Waste. 

Financial Allocation:

PMKSY with an allocation of Rs. 6,000 crore is expected to leverage investment of Rs. 31,400 crore, handling of 334 lakh MT agro-produce valuing Rs. 1,04,125 crore, benefit 20 lakh farmers and generate 5,30,500 direct/ indirect employment in the country by the year 2019-20. 

Impact: 

• The implementation of PMKSY will result in creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. 

• It will provide a big boost to the growth of food processing sector in the country. 

• It will help in providing better prices to farmers and is a big step towards doubling of farmers’ income. 

• It will create huge employment opportunities especially in the rural areas. 

• It will also help in reducing wastage of agricultural produce, increasing the processing level, availability of safe and convenient processed foods at affordable price to consumers and enhancing the export of the processed foods. 

Measures to give a boost to Food Processing Sector:

Food Processing Sector has emerged as an important segment of the Indian economy in terms of its contribution to GDP, employment and investment. During 2015-16, the sector constituted as much as 9.1 and 8.6 per cent of GVA in Manufacturing and Agriculture sector respectively. 

The manifesto of NDA Government stresses upon incentivizing the setting up of food processing industry for providing better income for the farmers and creating jobs. 

Government has taken various other measures to boost food processing sector as follows: 

(a) To provide impetus to investment in food processing and retail sector, govt. has allowed 100% FDI in trading including through e-commerce, in respect of food products manufactured and / or produced in India.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval to the Scheme of providing Budgetary Support under Goods and Service Tax Regime for the eligible industrial units located in State of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North Eastern States including Sikkim. Budgetary support of Rs. 27,413 crore for the said Scheme has been approved for the period from 1.7.2017 till 31.03.2027 for such industrial units located in aforesaid States which availed the benefit of Central Excise exemption prior to coming into force of GST regime. 

The Government of India was implementing North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP), 2007 for North Eastern States including Sikkim and Package for Special Category States for Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to promote industrialization. One of the benefits of the NEIIPP, 2007 and Package for Special Category States was excise duty exemption for first 10 years after commencement of commercial production. 

Upon repeal of the Central Excise duty laws, the Government has decided to pay a budgetary support equal to the central share of the cash component of CGST and IGST paid by the affected eligible industrial units. The support shall be available for the residual period (ten years from the date of the commercial production) in the States of North Eastern region and Himalayan States. DIPP will notify the Scheme, including detailed operational guidelines for implementation of the scheme within 6 weeks. 

It is estimated that total number of 4284 eligible units located in the State(s) of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North Eastern States including Sikkim will benefit from the above scheme.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the closure of Andaman & Nicobar Islands Forest and Plantation Development Corporation Limited (ANIFPDCL), Port Blair, a Central Government Undertaking and discharging the liabilities of all the employees.

The closure will help to stop unproductive loans to ANIFPDCL from Gol and would enable a more productive utilization of assets.

This would be achieved by offering Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) / Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) package to willing employees and by retrenchment under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 of those not opting for VRS/VSS including settlement of other liabilities, if any.

At present, there are 836 employees on the rolls of the Corporation.

The closure will be done by infusing funds in the following manner:

• Infusion of funds of Rs. 125.72 crore through budgetary support from Gol for funding VSS of all employees on 2007 notional pay scales and for discharging other liabilities.

• Write-off of Gol loans of Rs. 186.83 crore given to ANIFPDCL and accrued interest of Rs 185.18 crore with freezing of interest as on 31.03.2017 after closure of the Corporation.

• Auction of movable assets (Plant & machinery, electrical equipment, vehicles & office equipment, furniture & fixture, elephant & livestock, plantation & other inventories etc.) of ANIFPDCL through Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd. (MSTC Ltd),

• Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) will transfer/sale of immovable assets i.e. land and /or buildings of ANIFPDCL through NBCC Ltd.

Background:

The ANIFPDCL, a Government of India Public Sector Undertaking was set up in 1977, with the objective of development and managing forestry plantations in the Islands. The ANIFPDCL has been operating three main projects viz., Forestry Project, Red Oil Palm Project (ROP) and Katchal Rubber Project (KRP). The forestry operations were the main activities of the Corporation and contributed around 75% of the total revenue. Due to suspension of the forestry activities in view of the order dated 10.10,2001 and 07.05.2002 of Supreme Court, the ANIFPDCL has become an overall loss making venture since 2001 onwards. As a result, the ANIFPDCL was not able to pay salary and wages to its employees. In order to ensure disbursement of salary to the employees of tine Corporation, and other statutory payments, the GoI provided financial assistance to the ANIFPDCL in the form of interest bearing loan.

During the last fifteen years, various committees were appointed and professional agencies were engaged by the Ministry from time to time and they have thoroughly examined all possible avenues that could be availed for revival of the forest Corporation, including right sizing the staff. Based on those decisions, several proposals were examined, but none of them fructified. After thorough examination, Government of India decided to close down the Corporation.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu.

 

The total length of the line will be 86.56 km.  The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1431.90 crore and completion cost of Rs.1552.94 crore with 5% escalation per annum. 

 

The project is likely to be completed in four years by 2020-21.  The project will generate direct employment during construction for 20.77 lakh mandays.

 

The project would not only speed up the operation of goods and coaching trains, but also provide additional capacity for meeting the increase in traffic in future.

 

Background:

 

The section is heavily passenger oriented which also serve the goods traffic from nearby ports.  Operations from Vizhinjam port is likely to start by 2019 and 30% of its gateway traffic is likely to be handled by Railways.  Present line capacity of Thiruvananthapuram-Nagarcoil section of this route has already saturated which is causing heavy detention to trains moving towards Kanniyakumari and Chennai.   Line capacity of this route needs to be enhanced to meet the demands for additional trains and smooth movement of trains through the route.  Hence, doubling of Thiruvananthapuram and Kanniyakumari line needs to be taken up.

The project would not only speed up the operation of goods and coaching trains, but also provide additional capacity for meeting the increase in traffic in future.

Background:

Demands are being received for introduction of additional trains for this area to serve the local people, the ever increasing tourists desiring to visit the area and the traffic originating to/from Ports. Present Line Capacity utilisation of the section on trunk route is 106% which is likely to increase to 154% in next four years. This would cause detention to passenger and goods trains on trunk route and that originating to/from Tuticorin Port in future if double line is not provided on this 160 km section. Hence, doubling of Madurai-Vanchi Maniyachchi-Tuticorin with electrification needs to be taken up.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu.

The total length of the line will be 102 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1003.94 crore and completion cost of Rs.1114.62 crore with 5% escalation per annum. 

The project is likely to be completed in four years by 2020-21. The project will generate direct employment during construction for 24.48 lakh mandays.

The project would not only speed up the operation of goods and coaching trains, but also provide additional capacity for meeting the increase in traffic in future.

Background:

Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli is an important trunk route serving Southern end of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The section is heavily passenger oriented which also serve the goods traffic from nearby ports. Present line capacity of the section has already gone beyond 90% which is causing detention to the moving trains. Line capacity of this route needs to be enhanced to meet the demands for additional trains and smooth movement of trains through the route. Hence, doubling of Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli with electrification needs to be taken up.

The Central Government has launched Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) to develop and encourage the AYUSH system of medicine in the country. The Mission envisages better access to AYUSH services, strengthening of AYUSH educational institutions, enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU &H) drugs and promotion of medicinal plants for sustainable availability of raw-materials for ASU & H drugs in the States/UTs.

Under NAM grant-in-aid is being provided to State/UT Governments as per their proposed State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs). Since implementation of the programme comes under the purview of State/UT Governments, no target has been fixed by the Central Government State/UT wise. However, resource pool allocated under NAM for each State/UT Government is communicated to the States/UTs. Accordingly, States/UTs are required to prepare their State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) as per their requirements in accordance with NAM guidelines.

During 2014-15, under National AYUSH Mission (NAM) funds released by the Central Government is Rs. 7,528.707 lakhs and during the year 2015-16 and the year 2016-17 funds released by the central Government is Rs. 33,101.248 lakhs and Rs. 41711.849 lakhs respectively .

The techniques of Yoga are widely used for de-addiction and rehabilitation of drug users in de-addiction centres. Yoga helps in the de-addiction and rehabilitation of the drug users in de-addiction centres. The yogic protocol includes specific Asanas, Pranayamas, Shatkriyas and Meditation.

The Ministry of AYUSH has not set up specific de-addiction centres due to the fact that the yogic techniques are widely used in most of the existing de-addiction centres.

                A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Department of Space and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Ministry of Science and Technology, in New Delhi today.

 The MoU was signed by Shri V. V. Srinivasan, Director, ISTRAC on behalf of ISRO and Dr D K Aswal Director, NPL, on behalf of CSIR. The Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan and Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh witnessed the signing of MoU. The DG, CSIR, Dr Girish Sahni, and other senior officers were also present on the occasion.

 The MoU provides for time and frequency traceability services to ISRO by CSIR-NPL.

 The scope of this MoU is the rendering by CSIR-NPL, of all the necessary actions, necessary to support the following:

·         Time and Frequency Traceability services from National Time Scale of CSIR-NPL to IRNWT-I and IRNWT-II of ISTRAC/ISRO through Two-way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT).

·         Time and Frequency Traceability services from National Time Scale of CSIR-NPL to IRNWT-I and IRNWT-II of ISTRAC/ISRO through GNSS CV.

·         Annual audit of IRNWT-I and IRNWT-II as per ISO/IEC 17025 for ensuring correctness and accuracy of the time traceability.

 

The MoU came into force from date of signing of the agreement (today) and shall remain valid for a period of 5 years thereafter. Subsequently, the MoU will be renewed on mutual agreement between CSIR-NPL and ISTRAC/ISRO.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that scientists of two premier scientific institutions, NPL and ISRO, have made great efforts in this direction and he applauded them for their contribution. He further said that this is very important landmark and an occasion to acknowledge the great contribution of our scientists. Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi himself encourages scientists to achieve these landmarks. He elaborated that NPL has one of the five Atomic Clocks in India and the people should be encouraged to visit the laboratories and understand science and its contribution to the development of the country.

 Dr Jitendra Singh said that this agreement is very important for ISRO. He said that time is very important and synchronization is essential for ISRO projects. Highlighting the achievements of ISRO, he said that one of the main achievements of the Department of Space is that we have successfully and consistently widened the space technology use to various fields. He said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi takes keen interest in the scientific developments and does personal monitoring of these developments. He said that ISRO has achieved many milestones in the recent past e.g. successful launching of highest number of satellites, completion of 1,000 days of Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), launch of South Asia Satellite etc. He said that ISRO has already signed MoUs with various ministries and departments which is contributing to the social applications of space technology. The ISRO has signed MoU with Ministry of Agriculture for Geo-MNREGA, with Ministry of Railways for guarding the railway crossings. ISRO is also contributing to the Smart City Programme and other initiatives, he added.

Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has deployed an indigenous regional positioning system named as “Navigation with Indian Constellation” (NavIC). It consists of seven satellites in a constellation to provide Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services in Indian mainland and surrounding region up to 1500 Km. It provides two types of services viz. Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS). 

 

A budget of Rs.1420 Crore has been approved by the Government for the realisation of the system including 7 in-orbit satellites, 2 satellites as ground spare and associated ground segment.

 

ISRO has established the required space segment of the NavIC system for providing signal in space enabling position, navigation and timing information and it can support commercial civil applications. Indian entrepreneurs are being enabled for providing services through NavIC receiver system and requisite information has been made available in public domain. The demonstrations for vessel tracking, vehicle tracking, messaging services for fishermen, timing applications have been conducted. Mobile-Apps for navigational alerts across maritime jurisdictions is developed and tested for the Fishermen community using first generation NavIC receivers. Various types of user receivers are being developed indigenously involving Indian industry and discussions amongst government departments, user-receiver manufacturers, system integrators and service providers are taking place for the usage of NavIC system.

 

While the space and ground segment of the NavIC system has been established and demonstrations of various applications/ services have been conducted, the time required for it to become fully operational depends on the service providers making the services available in the market. It may take couple of years to become fully operational in the market

 ISRO and NASA are working towards realisation of NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission by 2021.

 

In NISAR mission, NASA is responsible for development of L-band SAR and ISRO is responsible for development of S-band SAR. The L & S band SAR will be integrated with ISRO’s spacecraft and launched on-board India’s GSLV. The total cost of the project includes ISRO’s work share cost of about Rs. 788.00 Cr and the cost of JPL’s work share of about USD 808 million. After the launch in 2021, the plan of action includes (i) calibration of instruments & validation of data products; (ii) development of science acquisition plan; (iii) development of data processing procedures & applications; and (iv) conduct of outreach activities in research institutes & academia.

 

NISAR employs a futuristic SweepSAR technique, which enables very wide swath of more than 200 km and very high resolution of the order of 5-10m. The L & S band microwave data obtained from this satellite will be useful for variety of application, which include estimating agricultural biomass over full duration of crop cycle; assessing soil moisture; monitoring of floods & oil slicks; coastal erosion, coastline changes; assessment of mangroves; surface deformation studies, ice sheet dynamics etc. 

 

ISRO and NASA have a framework agreement for cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes signed in 2008. Under this framework agreement, ISRO and NASA have executed an implementing arrangement for cooperation in NISAR mission, which is valid until 2034 and provides scope for joint activities on science & applications of NISAR data after the launch.

Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) - Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has been engaged in R&D work on the technology of preservation and hygienization of food and agri-products by radiation. Irradiation is very effective in treating the horticultural produces. Extension of shelf life of horticultural produces is very much depended on the produce, variety and storage conditions. For many fresh agri produce subjected to irradiation and proper storage, substantial shelf life extension has been achieved.

 

Unique advantages of radiation processing are:

·           Significant increase in shelf life for many products including fruits, vegetables, cereals, pulses, spices, sea foods and meat products.

·            Effective elimination of harmful bacteria, viruses and insects/pests.

·           Cold & clean process (No temperature raise or residue); and treatment done after final packaging (no repacking necessary).

 

BARC-DAE has set up two technology demonstration units, one commissioned in the year 2000 for high dose irradiation at Vashi, Navi Mumbai, and another in 2002, for low dose irradiation, KRUSHAK (Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra) facility at Lasalgaon, near Nashik. The facilities are being operated by the Board of Radiation & Isotope Technology (BRIT). Recently the harmonization of food irradiation rules with the international regulation through adaptation of class wise clearance of irradiated food items by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has taken place [Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Sixth Amendment Regulations, 2016] for large scale deployment of this technology.

 

The quantum of horticulture produce in India is huge. Hence, many more facilities are needed. 

Currently 15 irradiation plants are functional in the country which includes two plants set up by Government of India (KRUSHAK at Lasalgaon, Nashik, Maharashtra; and Radiation Processing Plant at Vashi, Navi Mumbai), and one each by State Government of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Annually, about 20,000 MT of food and allied products are being irradiated in the country.

Electricity generated by central sector generating stations is allocated to the beneficiary States and Union Territories in the electricity region by the Ministry of Power (MoP). As per the extant guidelines of MoP, 50% of power is allocated to ‘Home’ State, 15% unallocated power kept at the disposal of Government of India and 35% is allocated to other constituents (except ‘Home’ State) of that region. 

The present tariffs of nuclear power range from Rs 1.07 per unit in case of the oldest nuclear power station, Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS) - 1&2 at Tarapur, Maharashtra to Rs 4.10 in case of the latest station, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) -1&2 at Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu. Nuclear power tariffs are comparable to those from contemporary units of other electricity generating technologies located in the area. 

Reducing costs of nuclear power is an ongoing effort. In respect of indigenously designed Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), efforts in this regard have included increasing unit size from 220 MW to 540 MW and further to 700 MW to gain from economies of scale, standardisation, improvement in design and efficiency and optimisation of gestation period. In respect of projects to be set up with foreign cooperation, the measures include adopting appropriate business models to arrive at competitive unit cost.

                Several foreign companies from various countries including Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) and GE-Hitachi, United States of America (USA), Electricite de France (EDF), France and Rosatom, Russia have shown interest in participating in the country’s nuclear power projects in various capacities as technology partners, suppliers, contractors, service providers, etc.  

As per the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy of the Government, FDI is not permitted in nuclear power sector. Thus, foreign companies cannot invest in nuclear power. Nuclear power projects to be set up with foreign technical cooperation are planned to be funded by a mix of equity and debt, with equity to be mobilised from internal resources of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), Joint Venture companies between NPCIL and other Central Public Sector Undertakings and Government budgetary support. Foreign companies can however, invest in the supply chain for nuclear power projects. 

The present tariffs of nuclear power range from Rs 1.07 per unit in case of the oldest nuclear power station, Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS) - 1&2 at Tarapur, Maharashtra to Rs 4.10 in case of the latest station, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) -1&2 at Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu. Nuclear power tariffs are comparable to those from other electricity generating plants (based on other technologies) located in the same area. Every twin unit nuclear power station would generate a direct employment of about 850 comprising engineers, supervisors, technicians and other personnel. In addition, indirect employment for thousands of people would be generated with suppliers, contractors, service providers, etc. The resultant increase in economic activity would also open up opportunities for various businesses and will result in further employment generation.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of the Election Commission of India to enter into Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in the field of electoral management and administration with the Election Management Bodies of other countries/International Agencies. These are as follows:

i. The National Electoral Council of Ecuador;

ii. The Central Election Commission of Albania;

iii. The Election Commission of Bhutan;

iv. The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan;

v. The National Independent Electoral Commission of Guinea;

vi. The Union Election Commission of Myanmar; and

vii. The India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA).

These MoUs contain standard articles/clauses which broadly express promotion of cooperation in exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational and technical development of electoral process; support in exchanging information, institutional strengthening and capacity building, training of personnel, holding regular consultations etc.

These MoUs would promote bilateral cooperation, aimed at building technical assistance / capacity support for the said Election Management Bodies.

Background:

The Election Commission has been participating in promoting cooperation in the field of election matters and electoral processes across the world with certain foreign countries and agencies by adopting the mode of MoU signed by the concerned parties. The Election Commission, a constitutional body, conducts the largest electoral exercise in the world. It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to organize free and fair election in the country of about 85 crore voters with diverse socio-political and economic backgrounds. In recently years, the role being played by the Election Commission ensures greater participation of people in political affairs. India, today, is considered as the world’s largest democratic country. The success of democracy in India has attracted the attention of almost every political system around the world.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that through its mandate, goals and objectives, the Ministry is trying to ensure that women become part of the mainstream agriculture, reap the benefit  of every penny spent on agriculture and contribute to agricultural productivity and production and in doubling the income of their families. Shri Singh said it today at the “Securing Rights of Women Farmers: Developing a Roadmap for Action” event, organized at the Constitution Club, New Delhi, by the National Women Commission in association with UN Women and Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAKAAM). 

 Shri Singh said that the participation of women in agriculture is well known. According to NSSO (National Sample Survey Office) survey, a decline in both male and female labour force in agriculture has been observed in the last three decades. The number of men in agriculture has decreased from 81 percent to 63 percent, and women from 88 percent to 79 percent. This so because deterioration in the number of women is significantly lower than the men and this can be easily called the feminization of agriculture. Union Agriculture Minister said that rural women’s contribution to the economy of the majority of the developing nations including India is vital.  80% financially independent women are engaged in farm-related activities in India.  Out of them, 33% are working as agricultural labourers and 48% are self-employed farmers. According to as per NSSO report, women lead almost 18% agricultural households and there is not a single area of agriculture in which they are not involved.

 Agriculutre Minister said that the female labourers are facing several inequalities. For instance, the work much longer hours than men and are paid lesser than their counterpart. Also, their ignorance about their rights, opportunities and facilities make their participation in agricultural all the more tougher. Having said that, women play multi-dimensional roles in agriculture - from sowing, harvesting, applying fertilisers, irrigation, plant protection to weeding, storing etc – they do it all while shouldering household chores like cooking, storing water, collecting fuel wood, maintaining the house, etc. Shri Singh said that apart from this, women are active in other agriculture related activities like cattle management, fodder collection and allied activities related to dairy and agriculture such as beekeeping, mushroom farming, pig farming, goat rearing, poultry etc.

 The Ministry’s initiatives to bring women into mainstream agriculture.

  The following measures have been taken to bring women in the mainstream agricultural sector:

 

       I.            Earmarking at least 30% of the budget allocation for women beneficiaries in all ongoing schemes/programmes and development activities.

    II.            Initiating women centric activities to ensure benefits of various beneficiary-oriented programs/schemes reach them.

 III.            Focusing on women self-help group (SHG) to connect them to micro-credit through capacity building activities and to provide information and ensuring their representation in different decision-making bodies.

 IV.            Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare decided to celebrate 15th October of every year as Women Farmer's Day. This marks a significant step forward in women empowerment.

Keeping in line with the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India for “the need for effective decision making in agriculture that integrates science, technology, innovation and the farm ecosystem by asking for an ‘Evergreen Revolution’ the need is to modernise all aspects of agriculture to this purpose by bringing to bear quality analysis of the ecosystem, well-thought decisions and an efficient use of cutting-edge science technology to the very complex Indian farm environment”, Department of Bio-Technology(DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, is holding a ‘Smart Agriculture Conclave’ on 30th  - 31stAugust, 2017.

 

The expected outcome of the Conclave is to provide a roadmap for setting up a cloud-service “FarmerZone” where the right kind of agri data is collated leading to maximum impact, vis-a-vis farmer needs and make this data useful for the farmer, ( data related to weather, disease and pest surveillance and control, soil, market etc ). The Department is collaborating with different stake holders: international, national and industry to set up a “FarmerZone”.

 

The ""FarmerZone” would be a multi-purpose window for solutions and will be available for farmers anywhere in the world. Solutions will provided at the farm, similar to that done by e-commerce companies at the doorstep. The farmer can access the service directly or through an intermediate structure such as local co-operatives. The FarmerZone will include a MarketZone where farmers can directly sell their produce which can be picked up by directly from the farm.

 

Partners:

 

International: Research Councils, United Kingdom and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)

 

Industry: Infosys, Microsoft Research and Jain Irrigations

 

NGOs : GODAN, Ekgaon, FARMER

 

Participants: Experts from UK, USA and India

 

 

Conclave will focus on small and marginal land-hold farmers who constitute a major component of Indian agriculture and challenges faced by them in context of soil, diseases, weather, impact of climate change and market supply chain.

 

Smart Agriculture conclave aims to underpin the challenges faced by farmers and discuss the possible cloud based solutions accessible to the remotest farmer to see as to:

 

 

How existing farm- related data can be accessed, collated, curated and translated into information useful for the farmer

Identification of technological gaps in data acquisition and transfer from farm to cloud and vice versa.

Creating an interface for the usage of advanced cyber-physical systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence, to collect- and analyse- data and create a service for the farmer, which will cater to the farmer’s needs and requirements (disease and pest surveillance, climate change: biotic and abiotic stress etc and advice thereof)

 

Data availability for algorithm development is the key and how best to use AI, cloud computing and drone/phone mapping etc for creating a viable, usable FarmerZone are all expected to be discussed at the two-day Conclave.

 

The Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences will attend the concluding session to review the outcomes of the Conclave.

Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed a gathering at “100 years of Excellence In Sugarcane Research: variety 205 to variety 0238” (sugarcane variety) and “New India Manthan – Sankal Se Siddhi” events, organised by ICAR- Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Regional Centre, Karnal here. Shri Singh informed the gathering that with the help of Sir Dr Venkatraman, for the first time, hybrid clone variety 205 (Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum) was developed for sub-tropical climate, which was launched in 1918 for commercial farming. The hybrid clone led to 50% increase in sugarcane production in North India and popular species like Saccharum Barberi and Saccharum Sinensis were left far behind. 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that after developing species 205, Sugarcane Breeding Institute developed several other hybrid clones for sub-tropical condition and they remained sought after for a long time. After that, the institute developed species 312, first amazing cane variety for the subtropical climate in 1928 and in 1933, it developed species 419 for tropical climate. 

Shri Singh said during three years of Modi government, a significant increase in sugarcane yield and sugar recoveries have been witnessed in the northern states after expansion of species 0238 in the region. In the last season, 0238 was cultivated in 36% cane area in Uttar Pradesh, 63% in Punjab, 39% in Haryana, 17% in Uttarakhand and 16% in Bihar. Shri Radha Mohan Singh said species 0238 and 0118 have become the first choice of sugar mills in north India. The sugarcane farmers are reaping higher yield from the species 0238 and sugar mills are getting more sugar. Sugarcane farmers can make the best of intercropping technique and increase their income by growing oilseeds, pulses, potatoes, and cucumber with cane. 

Union Agriculture Minister said that he is not only here to celebrate the 100 years of Excellence In Sugarcane Research, but also to share that the nation is celebrating the 75th anniversary of Quit India Movement. On August 9, 1942, using sacrifice, penance, and courage as their tool, the youth pledged to free India from barbarous British Rule and the movement led to the country’s freedom in 1947. Shri Singh said that the grand campaign of the country's independence from 1942 to 15 August 1947 is remembered as Sankalp Se Siddhi. 

In the end, Shri Radha Mohan Singh urged people to make a pledge to build a New India by 2022 when we celebrate 75th anniversary of Independence and take honesty to the highest level.

                Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed a gathering at the Sankalp Se Siddhi program organized by ICAR-Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute, Kanpur, Narendra Deva University of Agriculture and Technology, Faizabad and Krishi Vigyan Kendra Varanasi. He said that Sankalp Se Siddhi campaign has become a Mass Movement in the country. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's clarion call, people have come forward to build a New India. The impact of Sankalp Se Siddhi campaign, which was launched on the 75th anniversary of Quit India Movement, can be seen across the country. On the occasion, the Minister asked the people to make a pledge to construct a New India and double farmers' income by the year 2022. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Varanasi also organized a special program to showcase advanced farming techniques. Also, farmers were asked to take a pledge to create Soil Health Cards, adopt integrated and organic farming methods to double farmers' income by 2022.

The Union Minister said that all the centers of All India Wheat and Barley Reform Project are making efforts to deal with Biotic and Abiotic factors to make wheat rich in nutrition by the year 2050. He said it today at the 56th All India Wheat and Barley Research Workers’ Meet (2017) organized at the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.

The Union Minister further said that the integrated program is eco-friendly, economically beneficial and homogeneous. He said that there has been an unprecedented growth in agricultural productivity over the last five decades due to the integrated program. With the integrated program, average yield per hectare has increased from 0.91 tonnes in 1964-65 to 3.22 tonnes in 2016-17.

The Union Minister said that in 1947, during independence, we produced 7 million tons of wheat and the average productivity of wheat was just 700 kg per hectare. However, in 2016-17, we produced 255.68 million tonnes of food grain and production of paddy, wheat and pulses created a new record level. Also, this year we had record production of wheat at 98.38 mt and 3216 kg wheat per hectare. This has been possible due to the hard-work of farmers. He also appreciated concerted efforts by policy makers, agricultural officers, extension workers and the scientific community and said they are the backbone of the project.

He said that we acquired the status of self-sufficient in food grain in the 1970s and during the same period we became wheat exporter too and that is why we can manage the volatility in food stocks or fluctuations year after year so easily.

The Union Minister said innovative techniques, technical interventions and policy reforms made Green Revolution successful. He also reiterated that such sustained efforts resulted in an increase in production and productivity and self-sufficiency in food grain. For this, he gave credit to dwarf variety developed under the All India Wheat and Barley Reform Project. An important milestone in this process was the establishment of the All India Coordinated Wheat Improvement Project in 1965 by the ICAR.

The Union Minister said that so far 421 species of wheat and 92 barleys have been developed under the All India Integrated Wheat and Barley Reform Project, which is being cultivated in different parts of the country. He informed that today we have 8 funded centres and three voluntary centres of barley in main barley producing states.

Some achievements are as follows:

• India's first zinc fortified variety WB2 was developed in the year 2016.

• Production of breeder seeds and capacity building of farmers to produce seeds.

• The draft sequence of Karnal Bunt Fungus has been a big achievement.

• Development of large plots for phenotyping, which are now available as a nodal centre.

 • To fulfil our objective of Per Drop More Crop, development work on deep-rooted wheat variety has started to ensure judicious use of water.

                India ranks first in milk production, achieving an annual output of 155.48 million tons during 2015-16 accounting for 19 % of world production. Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has set target for 100 million Artificial Insemination for 2017-18. A National goal of 300 million ton milk production by 2023-24 has been kept along with increasing the productivity of 40.77 million breedable Indigenous non-descript cows from 2.15 Kg per day to 5.00 Kg per day during the same period.

India has a bovine population of 300 million as per 19th Livestock census 2012. Out of 190 million cattle population, 20% are exotic and crossbreds (39 million) and about 80% belonging to indigenous and Non-descript breeds. While India accounts for more than 18% of the world  population, the  normal Indian cow  with  the   poor farmer barely gives 1 to 2 litres per day. Thus 80% of the cow population gives only 20% of cow milk.

Though India maintains its top ranking in milk production, on the flip side, about 80% Cattle belonging to Indigenous and Non-descript breeds are low yielders whose productivity needs to be improved by adopting appropriate breeding techniques.

Key strategy for increasing productivity is through ensuring Artificial Insemination (A.I.). A.I plays a vital role in improving the productivity of Bovines by upgrading their genetic potential thereby enhancing the milk production and productivity in the country. This core activity is fortified through the ongoing flag ship schemes, National Programme for Bovine Breeding (NPBB) and Indigenous Breeds (IB) under the Umbrella scheme Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) . These programmes envisage twin benefits namely (i) To improve the productivity and enhance milk production and (ii) To increase farmers income that will facilitate the Government’s ambitious goal of doubling their income by 2020.

Though the breeding infra structure has been strengthened substantially for the delivery of breeding inputs at farmers’ doorstep under these schemes, the A.I. coverage is still 26% of the breedable population.

As per 2015-16 data made available by the States, an Artificial Insemination worker merely performs 1.92 A.I per day as against the required average of atleast 4 A.I. per day. Further 3 semen doses are used for achieving one successful conception. Thus there is wastage of high quality semen due to usage of 3 semen doses for each successful A.I. This poor situation is further aggravated by usage of Indigenous bull semen being merely 11% of total A.I coverage.

To facilitate the government’s ambitious goal of doubling farmers income by 2020, a State Wise target of 100 million Artificial Insemination has been shared for 2017-18. Directions have been given to States by Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DADF) in this regard.

ICAR-NAARM Technology Business Incubator (TBI), a-IDEA and Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad’s (IIM-A) incubator Center for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) announces “AGRI UDAAN”- Food and Agribusiness Accelerator 2.0. This programme will help to selected innovative startups who will be mentored in to scale up their operations in agri value chain for effective improvement in agriculture. This is a 6 month program in which shortlisted agri startups with promising innovative business models will be mentored & guided to scale up their operations.

 

Accelerators are 4-8 month program aiming at scaling up innovative startups with a working prototype and initial market traction. This is done through education, mentorship, and financing. Startups enter accelerators for a fixed-period of time, and as part of a cohort. The cohort is shortlisted by evaluation panel comprising of industry veterans, business experts, R&D scientists.  Four distinct factors that make accelerators unique are fixed term, cohort based, mentorship driven and they culminate into demo day.

 

Forthcoming Food & Agribusiness accelerator: AGRI UDAAN

 

Looking at the impact created through NAARM TBI a-IDEA India’s first Food & Agribusiness accelerator 2015 in partnership with IIM-A CIIE, National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), DST has come forward to support AGRI UDAAN – a unique initiative for upliftment of agri startups

 

Through AGRI UDAAN we will be reaching out to agri-startups across the country with a series of road shows in Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata & Hyderabad. This initiative is backed by Caspian Impact Investments as Platinum Partner, Yes Bank as Banking Partner, NCDEX eMarkets Ltd (NeML) & Marico Innovation Foundation as Silver partners.   AGRI UDAAN also received support from National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), Agrinnovate as tech transfer partners, and FICCI as outreach partner.

 

Unique selection process

 

The application is available at www.aidea.naarm.org.in. Applications will be evaluated by mentors from industry, business and partner organizations,  based on the average scores top 40 startups will be shortlisted and allowed to pitch in front of panel of evaluators during cohort finalization programme on 9th and 10th of October 2017 at NAARM.  Out of these about 8 to 12 startups will be selected for final cohort for capacity building workshop.

 

Rigorous mentoring and acceleration

 

The shortlisted cohort of startups will undergo a capacity building (CB) workshop in ICAR-NAARM. During this period, the startups will be trained in different aspects of technology commercialization, product validation, business plan preparation, risk analysis, customer engagement, finance management, fund raising etc.  There will be a match making between startup-mentor. The accelerator program will culminate with demo day/ investors meet at Hyderabad and Mumbai.

                In order to establish the ISARC, a Memorandum of Association (MOA) has been signed today between the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC & FW) represented by Secretary, DAC&FW and International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines represented by Director General, IRRI. Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh graced the occasion.

Shri Singh said that the Center will be the first international Center in the eastern India and it will play a major role in harnessing and sustaining rice production in the region. It is expected to be a boon for food production and skill development in the eastern India and similar ecologies in other South Asian and African countries.

Agriculture Minister said this would be a Centre of Excellence in Rice Value Addition (CERVA) and will include a modern and sophisticated laboratory with the capacity to determine quality and status of heavy metals in grain and straw. The Centre will also undertake capacity-building exercises for stakeholders across the rice value chain.

ISARC will operate under the governance of the IRRI Board of Trustees who will appoint an appropriate IRRI staff member as Director. A Coordination Committee will be headed by Director General, IRRI as Chair and Secretary, Government of India, DACFW as Co-Chair. The other members of Coordination Committee are Deputy Director General (Crop Sciences), ICAR; Director, NSRTC; IRRI representative in India, representative of Government of UP and representatives of Governments of Nepal & Bangladesh and Private Sector.

Shri Singh said that the rich biodiversity of India can be utilised to develop special rice varieties. This will help India to achieve higher per hectare yields and improved nutritional contents. India’s food and nutritional security issues will also be addressed. The Centre will support in adopting value chain based production system in the country. This will reduce wastage, add value and generate higher income for the farmers. The farmers in Eastern India will benefit in particular, besides those in South Asian and African countries.

                  The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&FW) has taken up several initiatives in the field of agricultural extension which includes ‘Support to State Extension Programmes for Extension Reforms’ which is popularly known as ATMA Scheme, Mass Media Support to Agricultural Extension and Kisan Call Centres.  In order to enhance physical outreach of extension personnel for their direct interface with the farmers, financial support for specialists and functionaries down to the Block level has been provided. The key objectives of ATMA scheme include setting up of autonomous institutions at the State/District/Block level, encouraging multi-agency and broad-based extension strategies adopting group approach to extension and facilitating convergence of programmes in planning, executing and implementation. Under Mass Media scheme, the Government is educating farmers through display of exhibits for know-how on new tools and technology, creating awareness about schemes, programmes activities being implemented for benefiting and helping farmers.  Farmers’ education/awareness programmes are being implemented through agriculture fair, exhibitions and use of print, electronic media like Radio, TV and Social Media platforms, etc. Under Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) scheme, farmers’ queries are answered on a telephone call in their own dialect between 6.00 AM to 10.00 PM on all seven days.  Presently, these Call Centres are working in 14 different locations covering all the States and UTs.  A Toll Free No.1800-180-1551 has been allotted for this purpose.

Kisan Suvidha Mobile App has been launched by the Government which provides information to the farmers on Weather report, Plant Protection, Input Dealers, Agro-Advisory and Marketing. Besides, Pusa Krishi Mobile App, Agri-Market App and Crop Insurance Mobile App have also been launched for the benefit of farmers.

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has established a network of 680 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in the country with mandate of Technology Assessment and Demonstration for its Application and Capacity Development.  A number of activities viz. on-farm trials, front-line demonstrations, creation of awareness on improved agricultural technologies, etc. are conducted by KVKs for the benefit of farmers.

 

This Ministry is also implementing various crop development schemes for increasing production and productivity of the crops in the country viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM) on rice, wheat, pulses, coarse cereals and Commercial Crops (cotton, jute & sugarcane); Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI) and Crop Diversification Programme (CDP). Under these schemes, scientific crop production technologies are being promoted at the farmers’ field through organization of cluster demonstrations and training of farmers with latest crop production technologies such as timely sowing, seed rate, recommended package of practices, etc. for reduction in the cost of cultivation.  Assistance is given to farmers on distribution of improved seeds/hybrids, farm implements/machines, irrigation devices, plant protection chemicals, bio-pesticides for promoting Integrated Pest Management and soil ameliorants, etc. through State Government.  New initiatives like distribution of seed mini-kits of newer varieties of pulses free of cost, production of quality seed, creation of seed hubs at SAU and KVKs, strengthening of bio-fertilizers and bio-agent labs at SAUs/ICAR Institute, technological demonstration by KVKs and enhancing up breeder seed production have been included under NFSM.

 Under NFSM and BGREI, there is a provision of ‘Cropping System Based Training’ of farmers which includes four sessions i.e. one before Kharif and Rabi Seasons, one each during Kharif and Rabi Seasons. Under this programme, training of trainers/farmers is imparted by Crop/Subject-Matter Specialist of ICAR Institute/SAUs/KVKs on creating awareness about the new high yielding varieties.   

 National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP): Under NMOOP programme, Transfer of Technology (ToT) component, assistance is provided to States for conducting Farmers Training and Trainers Training Programme, in which training is provided to the farmers and extension workers educating the farmers to avail the benefits of the programme. 

 Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) – ‘Per Drop More Crop’: This Department is implementing ‘Per Drop More Crop’ component of PMKSY. It mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation).

 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecological approach which aims to keep pest population below economic thresholds level by employing available alternate pest control strategies and techniques viz. preventive measures, cultural, mechanical and biological control with greater emphasis on usage of bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin like Neem formulation, etc.  The Government is implementing “Strengthening and Modernization of Pest Management Approach in India” through 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) of Directorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage established across the country, which inter alia, organizes Farmers Field Schools (FFSs) to promote IPM approach.

 The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) envisages production and productivity improvement of horticulture crops like fruits (including apple) and vegetables through various interventions.  Capacity building of farmers and technicians are also provided for adopting improved technologies.  Scheme also envisages creation of infrastructure for Post-Harvest Management (PHM) and marketing for better price realization of produce.

 To develop Common Agriculture Market, the Government has launched National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) project on 14th April, 2016.   Under the e-NAM, 585 regulated markets across the States are to be integrated with e-NAM portal by March, 2018. The e-NAM would facilitate farmers to on-line trade their agricultural produce in any market integrated to the portal and to the buyer registered thereon. So far, 455 markets of 13 States have been integrated with e-NAM portal.

                Milk production has increased by 6.27% per annum during last three years and during the last decade milk production has increased by 4% per annum.

 

As per breed survey report 2012 the country has 37.92 million animals of indigenous cattle breeds as against 23.78 million animals of indigenous cattle breeds during 2007 (as per breed wise livestock census 2007).

 

In order to complement and supplement the efforts made by the States for development and conservation of indigenous breeds Government of India has initiated following programmes after detailed consultations with States and all the stake holders: i) Rashtriya Gokul Mission; ii) National Mission on Bovine Productivity;  iii) National Dairy Plan-I and iv) Breed Improvement Institutes.

 

Government has initiated Rashtriya Gokul Mission with the aim of development and conservation of indigenous breeds and National Mission on Bovine Productivity for enhancing milk production and productivity of bovine population in the country during last three years.

 Steps undertaken by the Government for development of cattle population in the country is as under:

 

(i)                 Rashtriya Gokul Mission has been launched December 2014 for the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds thereby enhancing milk production and productivity. The framework of the scheme is to enhance milk production & productivity through induction of high genetic merit bulls for semen production; field performance recording; strengthening of bulls mother farms; setting up of Gokul Grams etc.

 

(ii)               National Programme for Bovine Breeding is being implemented for enhancing productivity of milch animals through extension of Artificial Insemination (AI) coverage. This is done through establishment of Multi Purpose AI Technicians in Rural India (MAITRIs); strengthening of existing AI centres; monitoring of AI etc.

 

(iii)             National Mission on Bovine Productivity has been launched in November 2016 with the aim of enhancing milk production and productivity and thereby making dairying more remunerative to the farmers. The scheme is being implemented with following components a) Pashu Sanjivni- this component includes identification of animals in milk using UID, issuing health cards to all animals in milk and uploading data on INAPH data base; b) Advance reproductive Technique- under the component sex sorted semen production  facility is being created at 10 A graded semen stations and 50 Embryo Transfer Technology Labs with IVF facilities are being created in the country; c) Creation of E Pashu Haat Portal- The e-pashu haat portal has been launched in November 2016 for linking farmers and breeders of indigenous breeds and d) Establishment of National Bovine Genomic Centre for Indigenous Breeds(NBGC-IB): The NBGC-IB is being established for enhancing milk production and productivity through genomic selection among indigenous breeds.

    

(iv)             Two National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres are being established one in the State of Andhra Pradesh for southern region and other in Madhya Pradesh for northern region of the country with the aim of development and conservation of indigenous breeds in a scientific manner and thereby enhancing milk production and productivity.

 

(v)               National Dairy Plan-I a world Bank assisted project being implemented in 18 major dairy States with aim of enhancing milk production and productivity in order to meet demand of milk in the country through strengthening of semen stations; bull production programme (progeny testing and pedigree selection), ration balancing programme etc.

 

(vi)             Government has also established three subordinate organizations namely (i) Central Cattle Breeding Farms (CCBFs) (ii) Central Herd registration Scheme and (iii) Central Frozen Semen Production & Training Institute. These organizations are also undertaking genetic upgradation of milch animals through supply of disease free high genetic merit bulls for semen production and natural service for use in the breeding programme being implemented by the States.

“Walking the talk of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day 2017, the Government has fixed the ceiling prices of orthopaedic implants used in knee surgeries from today”, informed Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananthkumar, while addressing the media here today. Based on the numbers of about 1 to 1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures done in India every year, there will be a saving of about Rs.1500 crore for the people of India per annum. It is a step to prevent Unethical Profiteering and ensure Affordable and Quality Healthcare for the Last Man, the Minister added.

 

Shri Kumar said that as per the data analysis of National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), under Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, there was huge margin in trade which was found to be unreasonable and in a way unethical 'profiteering'. The NPPA, while fixing the ceiling prices, has kept all the new technology implants in mind and prices have been fixed accordingly, which are as follows:

 

 



	
		
			
			Type of Knee Implant
			
			
			Average

			MRP

			Earlier

			(Rupees)
			
			
			Average

			Price

			Reduction
			
			
			New Ceiling

			Price and MRP*

			(Rupees)
			
		
		
			
			Cobalt Chromium (most widely used)
			
			
			1,58,324
			
			
			65%
			
			
			54,720
			
		
		
			
			Special Metal like Titanium & Oxidized Zirconium
			
			
			2,49,251
			
			
			69%
			
			
			76,600
			
		
		
			
			High Flexibility Implant
			
			
			1,81,728
			
			
			69%
			
			
			56,490
			
		
		
			
			Revision Implants
			
			
			2,76,869
			
			
			59%
			
			
			1,13,950
			
		
		
			
			Specialised Implants for Cancer & Tumour
			
			
			Company specific prices; to be fixed by NPPA at Rs. 1,13,950
			
		
	



*Companies will print the MRP by adding GST on these ceiling prices

 

Shri Kumar informed that it is estimated by World Health Organization (WHO) that by 2020, osteoarthritis is going to be the fourth largest cause of immobility in the world. India has about 1.2 to 1.5 crore orthopaedic patients who require orthopaedic implant surgery. Most of the diagnosed people requiring knee surgery are not able to afford because of very high cost. Government is reforming this state of affairs putting a ceiling on knee implants from today, the Minister added.

 

Shri Kumar said that the Government expects full cooperation from all the stakeholders including importers, distributors, retailers, hospitals etc. in ensuring that the benefit of reduction of prices of knee implants reaches the last man. The Minister added that all complaints of overcharging would be strictly monitored and the overcharged amount would be recovered from erring parties with an interest of 18% over it. A step further, Shri Kumar added that the Government might also consider cancelling of licenses and initiate criminal proceedings against stakeholders engaged in unethical profiteering.

 

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Shri Mansukh Lal Mandaviya, Shri Jai Priye Prakash, Secretary Pharmaceuticals and Shri Bhupendra Singh, Chairman NPPA.

                Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Lal Mandviya, presided over the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony between the Union Government and the State Government of Uttar Pradesh for opening 1000 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) Kendras in the State. The ceremony took place in the presence of Minister of Health of Uttar Pradesh Shri Siddharth Nath Singh and Minister of State for Health, Dr. Mahendra Singh, in Lucknow today. The Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), under Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, signed the MoU on behalf of Government of India with State Agency for Comprehensive Health and Integrated Services (SACHIS) representing Government of Uttar Pradesh.

Addressing the media during the event, Shri Mandaviya said that according to the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Government’s priority under the PMBJP scheme is to provide quality medicines at affordable rates to the poor and marginalized sections of society. The Minister further said that the drugs available under this scheme meet the highest quality benchmarks and are made available by the Government at costs much less than their expensive branded counterparts. Cardiac stent costs have been reduced by almost 85%, which would benefit poor patients who could not afford them earlier, the Minister added.

Shri Mandaviya informed that under the PMBJP scheme, more than 600 medicines and 150 surgical and other medical items are being made available at affordable rates at Janaushadhi Kendras opened across the country. The number of medicines available under the scheme would soon be increased to 1000. Government of India is also giving financial assistance of up to Rs. 2,50,000 to those who open the Kendras under the scheme, the Minister added.

Speaking during the event, Shri Siddharth Nath Singh said that these 1000 stores will be opened in government hospitals and community health centres, so that more and more poor and marginalized sections of society can get benefit of this scheme. Shri Singh also informed that the Cabinet has already given its approval to open Kendras in Hospital complexes and allotment of around 400 Janaushadhi Kendras has taken place.

During the event, Shri Mandaviya also inaugurated the website of the PMBJP Scheme for the State, during the event. This website would aid the people to know more about the scheme, location of the Janaushadhi Kendras, availability of medicines and their prices in real time. Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Suddhansh Pant, Joint Secretary Department of Pharma, along with other senior officers of the Union and State Governments.

Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today, informed that the all India weighted average MRP of Urea has decreased by 71 paise per bag. Therefore, the farmers have directly benefitted from GST. Further, there is adequate availability of all subsidized chemical fertilizers across the country and there is no report of any shortage, the Minister added. 

Shri Mandaviya stated that GST being an Indirect Tax, the dealers and manufacturers collect it for Government and deposit it to the Government treasury. Prior to the implementation of GST, the farmers of different States were paying different taxes (Excise Duty and VAT) ranging between 1% to 7%. With the introduction of uniform GST at 5%, the farmers of different States are liable to pay uniform tax amount. The prices of P&K fertilizers have decreased in majority of States after implementation of GST, he added.

The Minister of Civil Aviation Shri P Ashok Gajapathi  Raju has  announced that the process for bidding for the second round of the Regional Connectivity Scheme – UDAN will start today.  Briefing media persons in New Delhi today, Shri Raju said that the thrust in the second round will be on improving connectivity to priority areas like the North East, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh , Andaman & Nicobar  Islands and Lakshdweep by introducing more operational flexibility and promoting helicopter operations. The Minister informed that the changes in the second round of UDAN had been brought in after extensive consultations with stakeholders over the last four months.

The Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN is a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) which was released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 15th June 2016. UDAN was launched in October, 2016 with the prime objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable for the masses. After the 1st Round of successful bidding  the Ministry launched the 2ndRound

Among the important changes that are being effected, routes with stage length less than 150 Kms will now be permitted for operations as RCS Routes through fixed wing aircraft. This is aimed at providing enhanced connectivity and ease the formation of networks under the Scheme. While exclusivity of operations will continue to be applicable for a period of 3 years,  Selected Airline Operators (SAO)   can issue No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to other airline operators willing to operate on the respective RCS Route .This will ensure there is no supply constraint on RCS Routes. To provide more flexibility to Selected Airline Operators (SAO), the maximum number of flights with VGF have been increased to 14 for Priority Areas. Further, the SAOs can anytime increase the number of flights on RCS Routes to any number. Also, minimum performance specifications will no longer be applicable on Non-RCS Routes.

Helicopter operations under the Scheme are limited to Priority Areas only. To encourage this, the VGF Caps for helicopters has been increased  and 10% of the estimated annual inflows in the RCF will be earmarked for helicopter operations . Further, all 13 passenger seats for helicopters will be considered as RCS Seats and VGF will  be provided  accordingly. The methodology for computing flight duration for helicopters has also been revised based on the recommendation of Expert Committee.

Several changes have been brought in  to improve connectivity to priority areas. Priority RCS Route is being defined as an RCS Route in which at least one of the airports - origin or destination -  is an RCS Airport located in a Priority Area, and the said RCS Airport satisfies the definition of Underserved Airport or Unserved Airport under the Scheme.. An Underserved Airport for Priority Areas will  mean any airport which is not an Unserved Airport and there are no more than fourteen (14) scheduled commercial flight departures per week as per the latest flight schedule published by the DGCA on its website. Additional category of aircrafts will be permitted for operations on Priority RCS Routes. Proposals for these areas will be prioritized. There will be Enhanced VGF Caps for operations through Category-1 A and Category-1 Fixed-wing aircraft for Priority RCS Routes. Also, helicopter operations under the Scheme are being allowed only on Priority RCS Routes.

Also speaking on the occasion MoS Shri Jayant Sinha said that the first round of UDAN has been very successful. Private airlines have placed orders for a large number of aircrafts fly on RCS routes. A total of 29 unserved / under served airports will be connected under the first round of the Regional Connectivity Scheme – UDAN by September end this year. This includes 8 that have already been connected and 21 soon to be connected. The remaining  14 airports out of the 43 unserved / under served airports that were to be connected under the first round, are under process of upgradation. Shri Sinha further said that with its thrust on connecting Priority Areas and the its newly introduced flexibility features, the second round of UDAN will be an improvement over the first round .

The National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016 has envisaged growth of cargo volumes to 10 million tonnes by 2027. As per data maintained by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), air freight handled at Indian airports grew by more than 20 times from 0.08 million metric tonnes in 1972-73 to 2.5 million metric tonnes in 2014-15, and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8.8% during 2013-14 to 2016-17. Measured in million tonne-kilometers, the data maintained by the World Bank also shows that air freight transported by India went up from 96.3 million tonne-kilometers in 1970 to 1,833.8 million tonne-kilometers in 2015. 

The Ministry of Civil Aviation had set up a Committee on Air Cargo Community System (ACCS) composed of various stakeholders, including customs authorities, and it was decided to grant approval to AAI for appointment of consultant to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the development of a uniform and integrated web-based ACCS in the country, based on the above Committee's recommendations.

The Government had approved a Turnaround Plan (TAP) / Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) for operational and financial turnaround of Air India.  The TAP/FRP provides equity infusion of Rs.30,231 crores upto 2021 subject to achievement of certain milestones.  The Company has made substantial progress in both operational as well as financial areas as per TAP Milestones.  As a part of the turnaround strategy, the company, with the overall support of the government, has initiated a number of steps in order to cut costs and losses. These steps, inter-alia, include the following:

 

i. Route rationalization of erstwhile Air India (AI) & Indian Airlines (IA) route and elimination of route network involving parallel operations.

ii. Rationalization of certain loss making routes.

iii. Enhanced utilization of new fleet resulting in production of higher Available Seat Kilometers (ASKMs).

During the last three years Air India initiated a number of steps including various phase market initiatives.  The steps inter-alia include the following:

1. Introduction of New Routes.

2. Preferred seat selection on domestic and international routes.

3. Flash sale of seats to increase revenues and Passenger Load Factor (PLF).

4. To utilize unsold inventory/launching of airfare equivalent to Rajdhani IIAC fare on select sectors.

5. Dynamic pricing and introduction of Advance Purchase fare.

6. Various sales and Marketing Initiatives.

                The Air India has registered remarkable improvement in both operational and financial performance since the introduction of the Turnaround Plan/Financial Restructuring Plan by the Govt. This can be seen from the following:

 

(i)    Improvement in Operational Performance

·         The passenger load factor has improved to 75.6% in 2015-16 from the Seat Factor of 67.9% in 2011-12.

·         The number of Revenue Passenger has increased from 13.4 Million in 2011-12 to 18.0 Million in 2015-16.

 

(ii)    Improvements in Financial Performance

·         The Operating Loss has consistently reduced since 2011-12 and infact in 2015-16 the company has achieved an Operating Profit of Rs 105 crores. The Operating Loss during 2011-12 was Rs 5138.69 crores.

·         The Net Loss during 2015-16 is Rs.3836.77 crores as against loss of Rs.7559.74 Crores in 2011-12.

·         The Company has turned EBIDTA positive by Rs 2413.29 crores as against the negative EBIDTA of Rs 2236.95 crores in 2011-12.

·         Total Revenue increased by Rs.4622.77 crores i.e.29 % as compared to levels of 2011-12.

The main reasons for the losses of Air India is that the company is facing financial pressure and earning less profits due to high debt burden as an offshoot of past accumulated losses.  The debt servicing is at around Rs. 6000 crores per annum for Air India.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 28th June, 2017 has given in-principle approval for considering strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries and constitution of Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism. To implement the decision of CCEA, appointment of Transaction Adviser, Legal Adviser and Asset Valuer shall be taken up as per terms and conditions and scope of work of Advisers/ Valuer in accordance with the model RFPs suggested by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.

For this, AAI has constructed three hangars at Guwahati Airport. Construction of hangars has commenced at Dibrugarh and Imphal airports and tenders have been floated for award of work for construction of hangar at Agartala airport.

                Under the GST regime the applicable tax rate on passenger tickets for economy class has been reduced from 6% to 5% (non-creditable for goods). The tax rate for business and first class has been increased from 9% to 12% (with input tax creditable for both goods and services procured by airlines). With regard to the UDAN Scheme, the applicable tax would also be 5% (non-creditable for goods) on the value of the passenger ticket excluding the subsidies provided by the Central Government and the State Governments. Moreover, since the maximum airfare or cap prescribed for the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) seats is inclusive of the applicable GST and the same is reimbursable to the airline operator(s) concerned at actuals from the Regional Connectivity Fund, there would be no impact on fares charged from passengers booked on RCS seats.

                The Gaggal Airport in Kangra and Bhuntar Airport in Kullu in Himachal Pradesh are suitable for operations of ATR-72 and ATR-42 aircrafts respectively with load penalty in fair weather conditions. In order to make the airports suitable for operations of aircrafts without load penalty, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has projected land requirements of 153 acres and 27.77 hectares respectively for extension of runway and other allied works to the state Government of Himachal Pradesh. Further development works are subject to acquisition and handing over of land free from all encumbrances and free of cost by the state Government to AAI.

                In pre GST regime there was Excise Duty on Coal @ 6% , Stowing Excise Duty @ Rs. 10 per tonne of coal production, VAT@ 5% (on intra-state sale), Central Sales Tax @ 2% (on inter-state sale, on submission of Form C) . Post implementation of GST all the above mentioned taxes and levies have been subsumed and GST @ 5% is being charged to consumers. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Lok  Sabha today.

The Minister further stated that Clean Environment Cess @ Rs 400 per tonne was payable prior to GST which has been repealed and a new levy namely GST Compensation Cess has been introduced @ 400 per tonne of coal. However, previously VAT/CST was charged on Clean Environment Cess but no such taxes are levied on GST Compensation Cess.

 Following Steps have been taken by Ministry of Coal to facilitate the stakeholders in the implementation of GST:-

 

i.   A facilitation cell, headed by JS & FA, Ministry of Coal and facilitation cells in CIL & its subsidiaries and NLCIL are functional. Toll free number has also been provided.

 

ii.   Various meetings at the level of Minister, Secretary & Additional Secretary were held with CPSEs and various stakeholders.

                Recently (on 18 July 2017) India and China jointly submitted a proposal to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) calling for the elimination - by developed countries - of the most trade-distorting form of farm subsidies, known in WTO parlance as Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) or ‘Amber Box’ support as a prerequisite   for consideration of other reforms in domestic support negotiations.

This is an important proposal by India and China in view of the ongoing negotiations for the upcoming 11thMinisterial Conference of the WTO to be held in Buenos Aires in December 2017. It counters the efforts by some countries to target the subsidies of the developing countries while letting the developed countries retain their huge farm subsidies.

The joint paper reveals that developed countries, including the US, the EU and Canada, have been consistently providing trade-distorting subsidies to their farmers at levels much higher than the ceiling applicable to developing countries. Developed countries have more than 90% of global AMS entitlements amounting to nearly US$ 160 bn. Most of the developing countries, including India and China, do not have AMS entitlements.

Listing the most heavily and frequently subsidised products by the US, the EU and Canada since 1995, the paper calls for elimination of such subsidies. The numbers reveal that subsidies for many items provided by the developed world are over 50% and some even more that 100% of the value of production of the product concerned, while developing countries are forced to contain it within 10% of the value of production. In other words, while developed Members have access to huge amount of AMS beyond their de minimis (these are the minimal amounts of domestic support that are allowed even though they distort trade — up to 5% of the value of production for developed countries, 10% for developing.) in contrast most developing Members have access only to de minimis resulting in a major asymmetry in the rules on agricultural trade.

The paper illustrates the adverse effects of concentration of AMS on a few products, which no other proposal in the WTO addresses.  Elimination of AMS, India and China believe, should be the starting point of reforms rather than seeking reduction of subsidies by developing countries, some of which like India provide a subsistence amount of about US $ 260 per farmer per annum compared to over 100 times more in some developed countries.

                The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry initiated the process of formulation of a new Industrial Policy in May 2017. Since the last Industrial Policy announced in 1991, India has transformed into one of the fastest growing economies in the world. With strong macro-economic fundamentals and several path breaking reforms in the last three years, India is equipped to deploy a different set of ideas and strategies to build a globally competitive Indian industry.  The new Industrial Policy will subsume the National Manufacturing Policy.

 

A consultative approach has been taken for industrial policy formulation wherein six thematic focus groups and an online survey on DIPP website have been used to obtain inputs. Focus groups, with members from government departments, industry associations, academia, and think tanks have been setup to delve deep into challenges faced by the industry in specific areas. The six thematic areas include Manufacturing and MSME; Technology and Innovation; Ease of Doing Business; Infrastructure, Investment, Trade and Fiscal policy; and Skills and employability for the future. A Task Force on Artificial Intelligence for India’s Economic Transformation has also been constituted which will provide inputs for the policy. 

 

It is proposed that the new Industrial Policy will aim at making India a manufacturing hub by promoting ‘Make in India’.  It will also suitably incorporate the use of modern smart technologies such as IOT, artificial intelligence and robotics for advanced manufacturing.

 

 Hon’ble Minister of State(i/c) for Commerce & Industry Smt Nirmala Sitharaman will hold consultations with stakeholders, including industry captains, think tanks and State governments in Chennai, Guwahati and Mumbai. The Industrial Policy is likely to be announced in October 2017.

 

DIPP invites comments, feedback, suggestions from the public regarding framing of the new Policy. A discussion paper in this regard is attached herewith. All comments, suggestions, feedback on the new Industrial Policy may be sent to DIPP at kokila.jayram[at]nic[dot]in or jsvk-dipp[at]nic[dot]in by September 25, 2017.

It was mentioned that Tanzania is one of the most important countries in Africa in so far as India’s bilateral co-operation in various sectors is concerned. With an investment of US $ 2.2 billion, Tanzania is among the top 5 investment destinations for India. The Indian side conveyed to the Tanzanian side that the potential areas for Tanzania in India include Light oils and petroleum or bituminous minerals, motor cars and vehicles, medicaments etc Similarly, Metals and Minerals, dried cashew nuts in shells from Tanzania are required in India.

The Tanzanian side encouraged co-operation in the field of Fisheries, Industrial Development including Industrial Research and Development and SMEs Development, Information, Communication and Technology, Labour and Employment, Information, Culture, Arts and Sports.

The Indian Duty Free Tariff Preference Scheme of which Tanzania is a beneficiary has boosted considerably Tanzanian export to India in recent years. India and Tanzania agreed to enhance sectoral co-operation based on respective needs and comparative advantage for mutual benefit.

                The three-day workshop on enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) organized by the Cell for IPR Promotion & Management (CIPAM) concluded today.

The three-day engagement was designed to help enforcement agencies establish a platform to share knowledge on IPR enforcement furthering appreciation and understanding among the enforcement authorities and common people.

Joint Secretary, DIPP, Shri Rajiv Aggarwal, mentioned the need for Indians to respect and commercialize their intellectual property (IP) at the workshop. Shri O.P. Gupta, Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademark (CGPDTM) delivered a speech on “cooperation between various enforcement agencies, role of right holder and way forward”. While talking about the importance of IP for public interest, all the eminent speakers emphasized that the creativity will be restricted to great extent, if creative output is not protected.

Delegates from World International Property Organization (WIPO), Central Government officials, police officers from across the country, people from the legal fraternity, industry experts and law students participated in the workshop. The renowned speakers shared the best practices and various aspects of effective implementation of IPR enforcement.

Creating awareness about IPRs can help in tackling piracy since limited knowledge about its social and economic impacts leads to circulation and consumption of pirated content. With this objective, CIPAM joined hands with the industry and launched a campaign against piracy through a series of animated videos on anti-piracy.

CIPAM has also launched a social media campaign with hashtag #LetsTalkIP to create more interest among people on intellectual property.

She expressed the hope that if the draft agreement under negotiation between India-CIS Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Uzbek Chamber of Commerce is quickly finalized and the Joint Business Council commences work, then it would be a very positive development for enhancing bilateral economic and trade relations.

Both the Ministers underlined the high importance of transport & logistics infrastructure for strengthening bilateral trade ties. Commerce Minister requested Uzbek Minister to become member of multilateral INSTC Agreement which would facilitate increased international transit cargo traffic through Iran.

Commerce Minister requested Uzbek Minister for reduction of import duty on leather goods and footwear in Uzbekistan from current 30% to 10%, which is current MFN rate in India. She mentioned that India could source finished leather from Uzbekistan.

Commerce Minister informed Uzbek Minister that existence of Non-Tariff Barriers such as import quotas and licensing, price and foreign exchange control, complex customs and administrative procedures, harsh sanitary norms and outright border closures have also been limiting inter-regional trade. Minister of Foreign Trade of Uzbekistan informed that Uzbek Government was seriously working to liberalise and simplify various procedures, systems and norms and expressed the hope that most of difficulties faced by exporters would get resolved shortly.

                Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the three-day workshop on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) today, in the august presence of Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of State, Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju.

Addressing the Workshop Shri Rajnath Singh said that counterfeiting and piracy activities give rise to serious organized crimes. Such activities finance criminals and terrorists who deal in counterfeit goods to launder illegal money. He said police officials should be therefore equipped with proper knowledge and training, so as to curb and restrain IPR violations, at the very outset.

The Union Minister of Home Affairs announced that IPR training modules would be introduced in police training institutes and academies across India to familiarize and sensitize our police forces on IPRs.

Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman said that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in collaboration with CIPAM is setting up two Technology and Innovation Support Centres (TISCs) in Punjab & Tamil Nadu for technology and innovation support. She emphasized that people need to understand the ways to create and protect their intellectual property for a secure future.

Shri Kiren Rijijiu, Minister of State, Home Affairs, called upon people to respect others’ intellectual property and talked about creating a strong IPR enforcement mechanism in the country.

This workshop will help enforcement agencies across the country understand and appreciate the importance of their role in IPR enforcement. It will also act as a platform for the officials to share their experiences, exchange best practices and better inter-agency coordination with respect to enforcement of IPRs. Besides people from enforcement agencies, many IP professionals, lawyers, law students and people from industry associations are also participating in the workshop.

The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), a professional body under the aegis of the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India, is organizing this three-day workshop on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) from 22nd – 24th August, 2017, in New Delhi.

                   The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), a professional body under the aegis of the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India, is organizing a three-day workshop on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) from 22nd – 24th August, 2017, in New Delhi.

             Shri Rajnath Singh, Union Minister of Home Affairs, will grace the occasion  as the Chief Guest in august prescence of Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State (I/C), Commerce & Industry, and Shri Kiren Rijijiu, Minister of State, Home Affairs at the inauguration of the workshop.

            Enforcement agencies like police, Customs, as also the prosecution wing, have a major role to play in effective enforcement of IPRs in the country. Creating awareness about IPRs amongst officials of these agencies, while strengthening the enforcement regime, will also assist them in handling cases relating to IPRs in their day to day activities.

            This workshop will help enforcement agencies across the country understand and appreciate the importance of their role in IPR enforcement. It will also act as a platform for the officials to share their experiences, exchange best practices and better inter-agency coordination with respect to enforcement of IPRs.

            Additionally, a workshop was conducted at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, Hyderabad, for IPS officers from all States and the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives.

             Trainings have also been conducted at North Eastern Police Academy (NEPA), where officials from nine states participated. CIPAM aims to conduct such trainings across the country in future as well.

             IPRs have now been made a part of the training calendar at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, Hyderabad, and North-Eastern Police Academy, Meghalaya.

             Earlier this year, the Ministry has also launched a toolkit for police officials across the country to help them deal with IP crimes, specifically Trade Marks counterfeiting and Copyrights piracy.

The Government has simplified the process for companies to set up an Inland Container Depot/ Container Freight Station (CFS)/Air Freight Station (AFS). The improved procedure is aimed at ensuring a speedier and more transparent approval process. Towards this objective, companies can now make their application online and view its progress/update on-line, without a visit to any government office. Also this is a pioneer attempt as a major Inter-Ministerial IT application rather than a mere Intra-Ministerial IT initiative.

The approval process for setting up an ICD/CFS/AFS involves many departments. This is facilitated through an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) which consists of officials from Ministries of Commerce, Finance (Dept. of Revenue), Railways and Shipping. If required, the view of the respective State Government is also sought. This IMC is housed in the Department of Commerce which is mandated to act as a single window for the approval process.

CURRENT PROCESS

In the current process the applicant submits as many as ten physical copies of the application form with the requisite documents to the Infrastructure Division at Department of Commerce (DoC), New Delhi, besides one copy with the Jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs.

 The current process of examination of the application is very cumbersome and the application form is very bulky with the ancillary material running into almost 500-1000 pages. This is initially scrutinized by the Department of Commerce for adherence to the land acquisition guidelines. Copies of the application are then sent to Ministry of Railways, Shipping, Civil Aviation and Department of Revenue (CBEC) for scrutiny and comments. Department of Revenue (CBEC) then sends the copies of this application to the Jurisdictional Commissioners in the field and thereafter on receiving a report from them sends their clearances to Department of Commerce. Upon receiving the comments from the Ministry of Railways, Shipping, Civil Aviation and Department of Revenue (CBEC), Department of Commerce convenes the meeting of Inter-Ministerial Committee where the application is reviewed on the basis of the comments received, and a decision taken on issue of the Letter of Intent (LoI) to the applicant.

Upon receiving the approval, the applicant is required to set up the infrastructure within one year from the date of approval. The IMC may grant an extension of six months after reviewing the justification for delays given by the party.

After the applicant has put up the required infrastructure, conformed with the security standards of the Jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs and provided a bond backed by bank guarantee to the Customs, a final clearance and Customs notification is issued by the Customs department which then declares the facility operational.

IMPROVED PROCESS

There have been frequent complaints from the Stakeholders (applicants) that the manual process is very cumbersome and not only does it result in loss of documents in the transit but also there is lack of transparency regarding the status of various clearances by the various agencies/departments. There have been persistent demands from the various stakeholders to streamline the processes and therefore, Department of Commerce embarked upon a project to have the complete process made online for the convenience of the applicants.

Now with the culmination of the project, the backend process will also be online and the applicant can see the various stages of processing of his application in the various Ministries/Departments as it is visible online.

Apart from saving reams of paper, the process also brings about greater transparency by disclosing the status of the application. This includes sending out SMS and Email alerts to keep all the stakeholders abreast with the progress.

This approach was conceived under the broader umbrella motto of the government – “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” espoused by honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi

The 59th Annual General Meeting of ECGC, chaired by Ms. Rita Teaotia, Commerce Secretary was held in Udyog Bhawan on 10th August, 2017. 

It was noted that despite ECGC reducing the premium rates (in order to bring down the transaction costs of the exporters) by an average 17% under policies, ECGC recorded only a marginal decline in premium of less than 4%.

ECGC has posted Profit Before Tax of Rs.407 Crores, an increase of 5% over previous year. It has also declared a dividend of Rs.72.5 Crores at the rate of Rs.5 per share. 

ECGC’s support of total exports at Rs.2,65,000 Crores was around 15% of total merchandise exports in 2016-17. A significant aspect of ECGC’s performance was that 85% of its support was accounted for by MSME exporters. 

It was mentioned that 12029 covers were in force as on 31st March, 2017 with a total maximum liability of Rs.86,215 Crores. With a view to increase Indian exports in new markets like Africa, covers provided by ECGC to exporters exporting to Africa recorded a growth of 15% over previous year. This was even when exports to Africa recorded a decline of 5% in 2016-17. 

ECGC has over 4,00,000 Overseas Buyers on record of which more than 1,20,000 buyers are regular and active buyers for Indian exporters. The cumulative exposure on these active buyers made available by ECGC is more than Rs.1,25,000 Crores for Indian exporters. An active management of exposures on these buyers is supported by a strong data base, built over more than five decades. 

ECGC also supports diversification of exports to Focus Markets identified by Department of Commerce by favourably rating such countries to enable coverage of exports at a very competitive rates. 

ECGC has been a pioneer in providing ECIB covers to banks, which enables the exporters to get adequate and timely finance from Banks at pre and post-shipment stages. Recognising ECGC’s significant contribution in helping Indian Exporters to get much needed working capital finance for the last 50 years, it was most fittingly accorded in its Diamond Jubilee Year the Best ECA Award by Trade and Forfaiting Review for 2017, an award that has been in vogue for last twenty years. ECGC’s unique achievement is when pitched against stalwarts ECAs from Germany and UK, it won the award. 

ECGC also manages the NEIA Trust of the Government of India that provides credit insurance covers to Medium and Long Term Exports, including Project Exports. The NEIA has supported 76 Contracts with a project value of around Rs.35,000 Crores, being executed by Indian Exporters in 29 countries. 

During the Financial Year 2016-17, ECGC hosted the meeting of Heads of BRICS ECAs in New Delhi while India was the BRICS Chair. It has also organized 2 International Workshops for BRICS ECA participants. It also hosted Meeting of Heads of ECAs of G12 Countries consisting of 8 OECD and 4 BRIC Countries, in Chennai during the year.

                The primary responsibility of industrial development of backward areas rests with the State Governments. The Union Government supplements their efforts through various Schemes launched by it with a view to promote industrialization in industrially backward areas of the Country. Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) was implementing Schemes for development of North East region and Special Package Scheme for Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir, which have now ended.

Section 94 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 provides that the Central Government shall take appropriate fiscal measures, including offer of tax incentives to the State of Andhra and the State of Telangana, to promote industrialization and economic growth in both the States. Government of Andhra Pradesh has submitted a proposal for formulation of Entrepreneurship Facilitation Scheme.

                Setting up of Border Haats is one of the methods for facilitating and increasing border trade across neighbouring countries.

Currently four Border Haats are operational along India-Bangladesh border. Two Border Haats are located in Meghalaya at Kalaichar and Balat and two are located in Tripura at Srinagar and Kamalasagar. In addition to the four functional Border Haats, Government of India and Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh have agreed to set up six more border haats-two in Tripura and four in Meghalaya.

Government of India has also executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Government of the Republic of Union of Myanmar under which Border Haats are to be set up at nine mutually agreed locations.

                The Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha has called upon C-DOT, Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) to innovate and develop Telecom products at reasonable costs for exporting to SAARC countries and other developing regions of the world. In a message on the occasion for 34th Foundation Day celebrations of C-DOT, he said that the premier Telecom R&D center of the Government of India, can develop products having far reaching impact in the areas of Agriculture, Education and Health care. The Minister said that in an era of M2M communications, Internet of Things, 5G, Cognitive learning and hyper speed networks, C-DOT has to play an important role in developing state of the art telecom infrastructure at affordable rate for the common man. Referring to the launch of C-DOT’s latest innovation, “WiDHWAN”, Shri Sinha said that, it has been exclusively designed to cater to the recurring call drop issues in no-signal and low-signal network scenarios in places such as offices and homes. He also congratulated C-DOT for regularly organizing lecture series on its foundation day, attracting national and international talents from the fields of IT and Engineering to brain storm on the future challenges facing the sector.

In her address, Secretary, Department of Telecom,MsAruna Sundararajan said that in view of the current government’s huge thrust on accelerating digitization as the only way forward for India, C-DOT can emerge as a leading digital infrastructure provider as it has both deep capabilities and enormous talents to achieve the same. She said that at present 70 to 80 percent of telecom equipment is imported in India and C-DOT can play an important role in bringing down this huge import bill by developing cutting edge telecom products in the country through schemes like Design in India, Make in India or Digital India. Lauding the role of the premier Telecom R&D center, the Secretary said that after the rural telephony exchange, the country is witnessing the largest ever roll out of C-DOT powered G-PON for broadband connectivity in the rural areas with local R&D and local products.

In his address, Executive Director, C-DOT Shri VipinTyagi said that in the coming years there will be a new paradigm of communications and his organization has to rise to the new challenges.

                BSNL was the first operator to provide free national roaming on 15th June 2015. Following the same, it has now decided to allow the benefit of Voice/SMS, Special Tariff Voucher (STV) and Combo Vouchers in national roaming on the occasion of 71st independence day on PAN India basis with effect from 15 August’ 2017 in the area where BSNL operates.

The offer is beneficial to those who frequently travel including our jawans and journalists. Presently if you for any STV, the benefit is available in the home state/ Licence Service Area (LSA), but from 15th August this benefit will be available even when a person travels outside his home LSA.

For example, STV 349 which offers unlimited voice call to any network only in home LSA, now the benefit of unlimited voice call on any network will be available even when customer is travelling out from Home LSA in any area where BSNL operates.

The Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha today said that the Indian telecom industry has seen a paradigm shift from a voice centric market to a data-centric market. While voice business still contributes a large chunk towards operator revenues, data revenues have shown an exponential growth trajectory over the last few years. Speaking at a Workshop on Telecom India here, the Minister said that by the end of 2016 the number of internet subscribers in India was 391.50 million making India globally the 2nd highest in terms of internet users.

            He said that mobile data traffic also grew by 76 per cent in India in 2016 primarily attributed to increased smart phone penetration. This growing usage of smart phones, especially in urban areas, has increased the usage of internet on hand-held devices – in 2016, 559 megabytes of mobile data was generated per month by an average smart phone, up from 430megabytes per month in 2015.Consumption of video content is also forecasted to be 75 percent of India’s mobile data traffic by 2021, compared to 49 percent in 2016.

Shri Sinha said that advancements in innovative IoT technologies, like health monitors, smart transport, smart meters among others, is projected to result in 21 per cent increase in M2M services. These advances will result in a significant growth of mobile data, and as the telecom sector moves to newer technologies, TSPs will need to identify innovative avenues to monetise this data opportunity. He said that Indian Telecom Market is expected to cross the INR 6.6 trillion revenue mark by the year 2020.

The Minister said that Indian Government had launched the ‘Digital India’ initiative in July 2015 which had three broad targets – providing Digital Infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen, Governance and Services on Demand as well as Digital empowerment of citizens.

   Shri Sinha said that one of the projects under the ‘Digital India’ initiative was ‘BharatNet’, launched to deploy high-speed optical fiber cables to connect 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayat across the country by 2018. This project would also help in increasing the fiberized sites in India which currently stands at less than 20 per cent as compared to other developed countries. The project is being implemented in Phases, with more than100,000 gram panchayats connected under Phase-I as of July2017 and states like Kerala, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh neared 100 per cent completion.

The Minister also outlined the major achievements of the Indian Telecom Industry-

·         Over 400 million internet users

·         FDI quadrupled in FY2016-17 recording inflow of approximately USD 5.6 billion

·         Greater than 20 per cent tower sites now diesel free

·         Rural Tele density increased by 30 per cent over the last five years

·         More than 3/4th of the data consumption was from 3G/4G

·         Telecom industry generates over 4 million jobs direct and indirect

·         LTE device ecosystem grew by 270 per cent from 2015

·         38 new mobile manufacturing units set up since September 2015

·         30 new locations added to ‘Smart City’ mission in June 2017, total count reaches 90 smart cities

·         The government, is also working aggressive to connect 54,000 unconnected villages and would speed up its efforts after getting due reports from all states.

·         There is the inter-ministerial group to look into the financial health of the sector.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Telecom, Ms Aruna Sundararajan said that in tune with the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India is attempting to do nothing short of charting a new digital strategy for growth. She said that new Telecom Policy will be a key building block for achieving the growth target of 10 percent from the current 7.6 percent as Telecom and IT are the two sectors contributing to 16.5 percent to the GDP, and there are immense possibilities for it to go up to 25 percent.

                As part of its efforts to ensure that the prices of essential commodities are kept under control, Government has taken a decision to enable the States/UTs to impose control measures on traders/dealers of onion to ensure adequate availability of essential commodity at reasonable prices. On 25.08.2017, Government has notified this decision vide Order SO No. 2785 (E). States may now impose stock limits on onions and undertake various measures like de-hoarding operations, action against speculators and profiteers.

This has been necessitated due to the abnormal rise in prices of onions in recent weeks particularly from July end of this year onwards, though the production and supply of onions in the market is better than last year during the same period. As per all India average retail price, the prices have increased from Rs. 15 per kg to Rs. 28.94 per kg. In the Metros the rise has been even steeper, Rs. 31 per kg in Chennai, Rs. 38 per kg in Delhi, Rs. 40 per kg in Kolkata and Rs. 33 per kg in Mumbai.

After examination of all the circumstances, Government has inferred that there are some other reasons than shortage of onions, contributing to the abnormal price rise of onions like hoarding, speculation etc. Therefore the States/UTs were required to be enabled to take action against those traders who are engaged in speculative trading, hoarding and profiteering in onions. The measure is expected to bring the prices of onions down to a reasonable level to give an immediate relief to the consumers.

                The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides a consumer the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods or services.

In so far as drugs are concerned, the manufacture, sell and distribution of drugs is regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945. The said Rules require various statutory details on the label of the drugs. However, labelling of drugs in regional Indian languages is not mandatory in the said Rules. As regards bank pass books, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a circular in July, 2011 to all the scheduled banks to the effect that in order to ensure that banking facilities percolate to the vast sections of the population, banks should make available all printed material used by retail customers including account opening forms, pay-in-slips, passbooks etc in trilingual form, i.e., English, Hindi and the concerned Regional language.

This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.

                On account of implementation of GST there may be instances where the retail sale price printed on pre-packaged commodity is required to be changed. The Department has therefore issued an order according to which, manufacturers/packers/importers of pre-packaged commodities are to declare the revised retail sale price (MRP), by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be, on the unsold stock

Manufactured/packed/imported prior to 1st July, 2017, if any, in addition to the existing retail sale price (MRP), for three months i.e. upto 30th September, 2017. Use of un-exhausted packaging material/wrapper has also been allowed upto 30th September, 2017 after making the necessary corrections.

The said information has already been disseminated to all the stakeholders and Controllers of Legal Metrology of all States/UTs for immediate necessary action. The Department’s website contains FAQs for explaining the manner in which MRP can be undertaken.

The matter is being monitored on a continuous basis, and the complaints received so far for not selling the pre-packaged commodities at decreased prices where the rate has been decreased on National Consumer Helpline have been forwarded to the Controllers of Legal Metrology of all States/UTs for immediate necessary action.

Further as per the information of CBEC, section 171 of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 provides for Anti-Profiteering measure according to which any reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices and the Central Government may constitute an Authority to examine the same. Many business entities have reduced the prices of their goods and services in view of lower GST rates under the GST regime. They have been publishing these revised rates in leading new dailies from time to time for consumer benefit.

The Department has already issued an advertisement in the Newspaper regarding MRP aspects and the final price to protect consumer interests. The Department is also doing the outdoor publicity through creatives on MRP after implementation of GST.

                The Government has amended the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 vide G.S.R. 629(E) dated 23 June, 2017 and incorporated a new provision under Rule 6(1) as follows:

“6(1)(da) If a package contains a commodity which may become unfit for human consumption after a period of time, the ‘best before or use by the date, month and year’ shall also be mentioned on the label:

Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply if a provision in this regard is made in any other law.”

The facility of ‘e-code’ for net quantity assurance of the commodity and other required declarations is proposed to be given to the industries to ensure that the commodity is correct in quantity and declarations, which is optional and not mandatory.

The e-commerce companies are required to ensure that the mandatory declarations are displayed on the digital and electronic network used for e-commerce transactions viz. Name and address of the manufacturer/ packer/ Importer, Name of the Commodity, Net quantity, Retail sale price in the form MRP (inclusive of all taxes) and consumer care details.

The size of the numerals printed on the pre-packaged commodities have been increased vide this new amendment in the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. The said amendment will come into force w.e.f. 1stJanuary, 2018 to enhance consumer protection.

For the violation of these Rules, the penalty provisions are made under section 36 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, which examined the Consumer Protection Bill, 2015, already introduced in Parliament, has recommended for stringent provisions to tackle misleading advertisement, as well as to fix liability on endorsers/celebrities. The recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee are under consideration of the Government.

This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.

                The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, which examined the Consumer Protection Bill, 2015, has recommended for a fine of Rs. 10 lakhs and imprisonment up to two years or both for first time offence and fine of Rs. 50 lakhs and imprisonment for five years for second time offence against endorsers of misleading advertisements. The recommendations are under consideration of the Government.

Under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, the Central Government has issued instructions permitting manufacturers or packers or importers of pre-packaged commodities to declare the changed retail sale price (MRP) on the unsold stock manufactured/packed/imported prior to 1st July, 2017 after inclusion of the increased amount of tax due to GST, if any, in addition to the existing MRP , for three months with effect from 1st July, 2017 to 30th September, 2017, by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing. Further, for reducing the MRP, a sticker with the revised lower MRP (inclusive of all taxes) may be affixed and the same shall not cover the MRP declaration made by the manufacturer or the packer or importer, as the case may be, on the label of the package.

The Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 provide for penalty for violation of the provisions.

The Department of Revenue has set up a helpline to address the queries/complaints related to GST. In the Department of Consumer Affairs, the grievances/complaints related to GST are handled by the National Consumer Helpline.

This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.

                For food security of the people, the Government is implementing the National Food Security Act which provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural and upto 50% of the urban population at the all India level to receive foodgrain at highly subsidized prices. Under the Act, allocation of foodgrains to States/UTs is made on the basis of State/UT-wise coverage of population and the foodgrain entitlements prescribed in the Act. There is no proposal to change the allocation norms. NFSA is being implemented in all 36 States/UTs.

On the basis of peak stock requirement during procurement season, the overall storage capacity required in the country is about 600 Lakh MT. Against this, the total capacity available with Food Corporation of India and State Agencies for storage of foodgrains as on 30.06.2017 was 794.48 Lakh MT. Thus on the overall, there is sufficient capacity for storage of foodgrains in the country. Beside this, Government of India is implementing three schemes to augment and modernize the storage facilities.

(a) Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme under which storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. A capacity of 138.51 lakh MT has already been completed as on 30.06.2017; (b) Central Sector Scheme with special focus on the North Eastern States. During 12th Five Year Plan, a capacity of 1,17,680 MT in North Eastern (NE) States and 20,000 MT in other than NE States has been created by FCI. Further, a capacity of 46,495 MT has been created by State Governments; and (c) Construction of steel silos under which Government of India has also an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in 3 phases.

Before the commencement of Rabi and Kharif Marketing Seasons, Department of Food & Public Distribution issues uniform specifications for procurement of foodgrains for the Central Pool. These uniform specifications are circulated to F.C.I. and all State Govts./Agencies with instructions to ensure that foodgrains are procured strictly in accordance with the uniform specifications. Foodgrains procured by F.C.I. and State Govts/Agencies are stored in covered godowns as well as in CAP (cover and plinth). During storage, the following steps are taken for safe storage and preservations of foodgrains:

(1) All godowns are constructed as per specifications.

(2) Foodgrains are stored by adopting proper scientific code of storage practices.

(3) Adequate dunnage materials such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, polythene sheets are used to check migration of moisture from the floor to the foodgrains.

(4) Fumigation covers, nylon ropes, nets and insecticides for control of stored grain insect pests are provided in all the godowns.

(5) Prophylactic (spraying of insecticides) and curative treatments (fumigation) are carried out regularly and timely in godowns for the control of stored grain insect pests.

(6) Effective rat control measures, both in covered godowns as well as in CAP storage are used.

(7) Foodgrains in ‘Cover and Plinth’ (CAP) storage are stored on elevated plinths and wooden crates are used as dunnage material. Stacks are properly covered with specifically fabricated low-density black polythene water -proof covers and tied with nylon ropes/nets.

(8) Regular periodic inspections of the stocks/godowns are undertaken by qualified and trained staff and all senior officers. The health of the foodgrains is monitored at regular intervals by a system of checks and super checks at different levels. Following Checks and Super checks are conducted in the godowns by FCI to ensure proper preservation of foodgrains in the storage.

I. Fortnightly inspection of stocks on 100% basis by Technical Assistant.

II. Monthly inspection by Manager(QC)

III. Quarterly inspection by AGM(QC)

IV. Super Checks by Regional, Zonal and FCI Hqrs Squads.

(9) The principle of “First in First Out” (FIFO) is followed to the extent possible so as to avoid longer storage of foodgrains in godowns.

(10) Only covered rail wagons are used for movement of foodgrains so as to avoid damage during transit.

(11) Damage Monitoring Cells have been set up at District, Regional and Zonal levels to regularly monitor quality of stocks and reduce damages.

The steps taken to ensure remunerative price to farmers are:

1) The minimum support prices (MSP) are announced by the Government of India at the beginning of the sowing season for crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) which determines the MSP based on the input costs and margin to farmers. MSP (Minimum Support Price) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media.

2) Procurement centres are opened by respective State Govt. Agencies/ FCI taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of the farmers.

3) For further strengthening the system that the farmers directly get the MSP announced by GOI, the GOI decided to do away with the levy system of procurement of rice with effect from KMS 2015-16, allowing the entire procurement of paddy to be done only by the State Agencies/FCI and payment to farmers is done largely through electronic mode or account payee cheque by State Agencies/FCI other than in Punjab & Haryana where it is routed through the Arthiyas as per APMC Act of the State.

4) The agricultural produce brought by a farmer is procured by Govt. agencies and payments are made through RTGS/electronic mode/ account payee cheque within 48 hours of purchase of his produce.

Department of Food & Public Distribution is implementing a Scheme on 'End-to-end Computerization of TPDS Operations' with the aim to improve the efficiency of the current system and to address various challenges such as leakages and diversion of foodgrains, elimination of fake and bogus ration cards etc. The scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanism.

                Standards for Packaged Mineral Water and Packaged Drinking Water (other than Mineral Water) are prescribed under sub-regulations 2.10.7 and 2.10.8 of Food Safety and Standards (Food Products & Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 respectively and compliance to these standards is mandatory for any packaged drinking water manufacturer in the country. These products are also under mandatory certification of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

 

These requirements are to be followed by all manufacturers of packaged water.  However, cases of sale of packaged water by unlicensed units and not meeting the prescribed standards have come to the notice of FSSAI.  Therefore, FSSAI has been regularly taking up the matter with the Food Safety Commissioners of States/UTs and urging them to undertake regular and effective enforcement action in the matter.

 

Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products, including packaged water are being undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check that they comply with the standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules and regulations made thereunder.  In cases where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

 

Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) from time to time receives complaints regarding quality of BIS Standard marked Packaged Natural Mineral water and Packaged Drinking Water as per IS 13428 and IS 14543 respectively. Similarly complaints are also received regarding misuse of Standard Mark on Packaged Drinking Water/Packaged Natural Mineral water by manufacturers without having valid BIS Licence.

 

Complaints regarding quality of BIS Standard Marked Packaged Natural Mineral water and Packaged Drinking Water are investigated both at complainant-end and Licencee’s premises for redressal.

 

Complaints regarding misuse of BIS Standard Mark (ISI mark) on Packaged Natural Mineral water and Packaged Drinking Water are investigated. Depending on outcome of the investigation, raids are conducted and cases are filed in the concerned court of law

 

As per the information available with FSSAI from the State/UT Governments, the details of samples of Packaged Drinking Water/Mineral Water collected, tested, found not conforming and action taken during the year 2016-17 is as under:

On the occasion of 75th Anniversary of the Quit India Movement and the Azad Hind Fauj, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (I/C) for Culture and Tourism inaugurated an exhibition “Quit India and Azad Hind Fauj – 75th Anniversary (1942-2017)” in the National Archives of India, Janpath, New Delhi today. Addressing on the occasion, Dr Sharma said that the ‘Quit India Movement’ was an important milestone in the Indian Freedom Movement which made the entire nation determined to attain freedom from the British rule. Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call and the mantra of ‘Do or Die’. Gandhi Ji and prominent freedom struggle leaders were all arrested on 9th August, 1942. Dr Sharma said that the Prime Minister, in his ‘Man ki Baat’ of 30 July 2017, said: ‘Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.’ The forthcoming exhibition is just such endeavour.

The exhibition will continue till 1st September 2017. The exhibition is based on public records, private papers, photographs, newspaper reports and proscribed literature banned by the British Government which came out during the last phase of freedom movement.  Some of original papers are on display in this exhibition.

The exhibition has large digital content which can be accessed through interactive mode.  The film presenting the passing of the “Quit India Resolution”, arrest of freedom struggle leaders, the role of INA and Subhas Chandra Bose is also on display.

 The exhibition is spread over four sections viz:

1.      The Prelude to the Quit India Movement

2.      The Actual Movement

3.      The Impact of the Movement and

4.      The Indian National Army and Azad Hind Fauj.

(1) The Prelude to the Quit India Movement:  The Section displays documents/reports pertaining to the coming of the Cripps Mission to India and its failure, Gandhiji’s description of the offer of the Mission as “post-dated cheque”.  The section also depicts the All India Congress Committee resolution of 14 July 1942 at Wardha and its adoption on 8 August 1942 in Mumbai.

 

(2) The Actual Movement: This section includes the coining of the term “Quit India” and “Do or Die” by Yusuf Mehar Ali, besides Gandhi’s message in his own words ‘Karenge Ya Marenge – Mat Puccho Kyon’.Depicting the calendar of events, the section also highlights the role of important personalities like Sarojini Naidu, Suchita Kripalani, Aruna Asaf Ali, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan, J.B. Kripalani and Usha Mehta (who was instrumental in setting up private radio broadcast).

 

(3) The impact of the Movement: The section reflects the disturbances that occurred all over the country after the arrest of the prominent leaders on 9 August 1942. The exhibits also showcase the parallel governments that were set up in different parts especially in Midnapur, Satara, Ballia, Tamluk (West Bengal) etc.

 

(4) The Indian National Army and Azad Hind Fauj: The important documents displayed in this section consist of Indian Independence League, Tokyo 1942, message of Rash Bihari Bose 1942, publicity material, including various posters and banners of Azad Hind Fauj etc.

 

The last portion in the exhibition is assigned to the message of the Prime Minister, who while addressing the nation via ‘Man ki Baat’ on 30 July 2017, gave a call to our countrymen and women to come together to launch a new ‘Quit India’ Movement:

·         Filth                 – Quit India;

·         Poverty            – Quit India;  

·         Corruption       – Quit India;

·         Terrorism         – Quit India;

·         Casteism          – Quit India;

·         Communalism – Quit India.

 

The need of the hour is not ‘Do or Die’, instead, to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly for making a new India.

                01 September 2017 marks the 60 years of induction of the English Electric Canberra in the Indian Air Force. It was the first generation Jet Bomber manufactured in large number through the 1950s. The prototype of Canberra, first flew in May 1949 and in January 1957 the aircraft was selected by the Indian Air Force to equip its bomber and strategic reconnaissance fleet. The Canberra Jet bomber was first inducted in the IAF in No. 5 Squadron (Tuskers) at Agra on 01 September 1957.

When political turmoil broke out in Belgian Congo in 1961, UNO requested India for strike aircraft. Within five years of serving the IAF, on 09 October 1961, under the command of Wing Commander AIK Suares Vir Chakra, six Canberra aircraft of No 5 Squadron took off from Agra for Leopoldville, over 6000 km away to join the United Nations’ Multinational Force in the Congo. This was the first ever-Indian fighter-bomber contingent to take part in UN operations. The offensive operation in Congo earned the Squadron two Vir Chakras, one Vayu Sena Medal and five Vishisht Seva Medals.

The Canberras took part in all major operations including the liberation of Goa in 1961, the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, 1987 Op Pawan in Sri Lanka, 1988 Op Cactus in Maldives and 1999 Kargil war. On 18 December 1961, Canberras of No 16 and 35 Sqn bombed the Dabolim airport forcing Portuguese forces to surrender. The Canberra last saw action in the Kargil war in 1999 where it flew recce missions, during one of the missions one aircraft’s engine was hit by a missile. The sturdy Canberra could survive the enemy’s missile attack and landed safely with all vital information. During its service, Canberra provided invaluable photo reconnaissance inputs of enemy territory during wars and peace time operations, resulting in accurate and effective operations. After 50 years of glorious service to the Nation on 11 May 2007 at Air Force Station Agra, the IAF bid adieu to its legendry old war horse.

                The ordnance factories under the administrative control of the Department of Defence Production, Ministry of Defence are managed by the officers of Indian Ordnance Factories Service (IOFS), which is an organized Group 'A' Central Service. The Service is responsible to ensure that the ordnance factories are always geared to cater to the varied logistical needs of the Armed Forces. Indian Ordnance Factories Service provides requisite leadership to the 39 Ordnance Factories employing about 1 lakh employees.

The Government is taking various steps to improve the performance of Ordnance Factories by making its officers accountable to ensure delivery of quality products to Armed Forces of the nation in prescribed timelines.

One of the steps taken in this direction was to initiate rigorous screening of overall performance of its officers based on their entire service records in pursuance of instructions contained in the Fundamental Rule 56(j) and Rule 48(1)(b) of Central Civil Service(Pension) Rules, 1972 and prematurely retire the officers whose overall performance is not found upto the mark.

The Government, after having assessed the overall performance of officers of Indian Ordnance Factories Service, following the prescribed procedure, has decided to retire its 13 Group 'A' officers from Government service in public interest due to their overall unsatisfactory performance.

                A Commemoration Ceremony was held at Air Force Station Hindan to mark the successful operationalisation of the C-130 J full motion level D Weapons System Trainer (Simulator). The simulator was rededicated to the nation and the Indian Air Force by Air Marshal C Hari Kumar AVSM VM VSM ADC, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Air Command. The event coincided with the completion of yet another aircrew training programme wherein eight pilots graduated towards the next phase of operational deployment. Expressing his satisfaction over the progress of trainees, the Air Marshal said “….. training is the bedrock of achieving operational excellence. Successful completion of the training here lays foundation for the new platforms that IAF is inducting, including C-17 Globemaster, Apache and Chinook.”

The C-130 J simulator is the first full motion simulator for the IAF, operationalised, managed and maintained by Mahindra Defence Systems Ltd in association with Lockheed Martin Corporation, USA. The technology and configuration and configuration of the simulator enable trainee aircrew to perform precision low-level flying, airdrops, disaster relief, HADR Operations and landing in blackout conditions status with zero Flight Time.

Complementing Mahindra Defence Systems, the Air Marshal, added that the IAF has tremendously benefitted from this industry led training model and he hoped that this association would bring rich dividends to the Air Force.

In a first ever exercise after Independence, the Ministry of Defence in consultation with the Indian Army has decided to reform the Indian Army in a planned manner. These decisions were approved by the Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley after an extensive consultation with all stakeholders.

 The first phase of the reforms involves redeployment and restructuring of approximately 57,000 posts of officers/JCOs/ORs and civilians. Major reforms concerning the following have been approved:-

·         Optimisation of Signals Establishments to include Radio Monitoring Companies, Corps Air Support Signal Regiments, Air Formation Signal Regiments, Composite Signal Regiments and merger of Corps Operating and Engineering Signal Regiments.

·         Restructuring of repair echelons in the Army to include Base Workshops, Advance Base Workshops and Static/Station Workshops in the field Army.

·         Redeployment of Ordnance echelons to include Vehicle Depots, Ordnance Depots and Central Ordnance Depots apart from streamlining inventory control mechanisms.

·         Better utilization of Supply and Transport echelons and Animal Transport units.

·         Closure of Military Farms and Army postal establishments in peace locations.

·         Enhancement in standards for recruitment of clerical staff and drivers in the Army.

·         Improving the efficiency of the National Cadet Corps.

 

Implementation has begun with the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security to close 39 military farms in a time bound manner.

 The Ministry of Defence had constituted a Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Lt Gen (Retd) (Dr.) DB Shekatkar with a mandate to recommend measures for enhancing of Combat Capability & Rebalancing Defence Expenditure of the Armed Forces with an aim to increase ""teeth to tail  ratio"".

 The Committee of experts had submitted its report to the Ministry in December, 2016, which was considered by the Ministry of Defence and 99 recommendations were sent to the Armed Forces for making an implementation plan. The Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley has approved 65 of these recommendations pertaining to the Indian Army for implementation.

 These reforms will be completed in all respects by 31 December 2019. Restructuring by the Indian Army is aimed at enhancing Combat Capability in a manner that the officers/JCOs/ORs will be used for improving operational preparedness and civilians will be redeployed in different wings of the Armed Forces for improving efficiency.

                Dr. Jagdish Mukhi, Lieutenant Governor, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, commissioned IN LCU L52 into the Indian Navy today at Port Blair. IN LCU L52 is the second Landing Craft Utility (LCU) Mk-IV class to be inducted into the Indian Navy. The ship has been indigenously designed and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Kolkata. The commissioning of L-52 is yet another manifestation of the potential of the country’s indigenous design and ship building capability.

LCU MK-IV ship is an amphibious ship with the primary role to transport and deploy Main Battle Tanks, Armoured Vehicles, troops and equipment from ship to shore. These ships would be based in the Andaman and Nicobar Command and can be deployed for multirole activities like beaching operations, search and rescue, disaster relief operations, supply and replenishment and evacuation from distant islands.

The ship, commanded by Commander Kaushik Chatterjee, has a complement of 05 officers, 46 sailors and is capable of carrying 160 troops in addition. The ship, displacing 830 Tons, is capable of transporting various kinds of combat equipment such as Main Battle Tanks Arjun, T72 and other vehicles. The ship is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced systems like Integrated Bridge System (IBS) and Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS).

The remaining six ships of the same class are in advanced stages of construction at M/S GRSE, Kolkata and are scheduled to be inducted in the next two years. The induction of these ships will contribute to the nation’s maritime security needs and is in consonance with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s drive for ‘Make in India’.

                The Ministry of Defence has decided to delegate administrative and financial powers to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) right upto the level of Chief Engineer and Task Force Commander, so as to avoid delays on account of references between the Chief Engineer and HQ DGBR and also between HQ DGBR and the Ministry. 

Functioning under the control of the Ministry of Defence since 2015, the BRO is engaged in road construction to provide connectivity to difficult and inaccessible regions in the border areas of the country. The Ministry of Defence intends to bring transformational changes in the organization in order to improve the pace of execution of works and to achieve the desired outcomes according to the requirement of the Armed Forces. 

In line with the aim to bring in transformational changes in the BRO, various powers of delegation have been revised. According to the earlier delegation of powers, a Chief Engineer in the BRO could give administrative approval of works only upto Rs. 10 crore, that too only for departmental works, whereas the ADGBR had powers to accord administrative approval only upto Rs. 20 crore for departmental works. For contractual works, all administrative approvals were given by DGBR, who had powers only upto Rs. 50 crore. Enhancing the powers at all levels in the BRO, the Ministry of Defence has now approved that for both departmental and contractual mode of execution, a Chief Engineer of BRO can accord administrative approval upto Rs. 50 crore, ADGBR upto Rs. 75 crore and DGBR upto Rs. 100 crore. 

Further, according to the earlier delegation of powers, a Chief Engineer in the BRO had the power to accept execution of contracts only upto Rs. 10 crore, ADGBR had powers upto Rs. 20 crore, beyond which all tenders had to be sent to DGBR. With the intent to speed up the tendering process, the Ministry of Defence has now enhanced the powers of Chief Engineer for acceptance of bids with cost of contract upto Rs. 100 crore and that of ADGBR for cost of contract upto Rs. 300 crore. With this delegation, the entire tendering process including acceptance of bids would be completed at the level of Chief Engineer/ADGBR for a majority of the contracts. 

For adopting the DPR mode of execution, there is a need to outsource consultancy services. According to the earlier delegation of powers, a Chief Engineer had powers only upto Rs. 10 lakh, ADGBR upto Rs. 50 lakh and DGBR upto Rs. 2 crore. The Ministry of Defence has now enhanced the powers of Chief Engineer to accord administrative approval for outsourcing of consultancy services upto Rs. 2 crore and ADGBR upto Rs. 5 crore and full powers beyond Rs. 5 crore to DGBR. 

There also is a need to replace obsolete construction equipment in the BRO with modern equipment. According to the earlier delegation of powers, DGBR had powers only upto Rs. 7.5 crore for procurement of indigenous equipment and Rs. 3 crore for procurement of imported equipment. All other cases of procurement had to be referred to the Ministry of Defence. In order to fast track the procurement of latest construction machinery and equipment in the BRO, the Ministry of Defence has enhanced the delegation of powers upto Rs. 100 crore to DGBR for procurement of both indigenous/imported equipment. 

In case of emergent need for construction equipment, DGBR has been given full powers for hiring upto three years and for Chief Engineers (Project), powers have been enhanced from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 5 crore and the period of hiring has been enhanced from 6 months to one year. 

The BRO is engaged in road construction activities in the most difficult areas and the usage norms and fixation of life of construction equipment varies from terrain to terrain. Earlier, all cases of revision of norms of equipment and fixation of life had to be referred to the Ministry of Defence. In a departure from the earlier policy, full powers in this regard have been delegated to DGBR. 

The Ministry of Defence in consultation with the Armed Forces would identify the roads to be entrusted to the BRO and fix priorities by approving the Long Term Roll-On Works Plan and Annual Works Programme for the BRO. Thereafter, powers related to execution of works have been delegated to be exercised by different levels within the BRO. However, to ensure accountability, a MIS is being developed for online monitoring of progress of works. 

From the current year, the BRO has initiated the practice of preparation of DPRs for all new road projects to be taken up and has adopted the project mode of execution. In an important policy change from the conventional departmental mode of execution followed by the BRO in the past, the organisation has now also started adopting the EPC mode of execution. The Ministry of Defence has approved policy guidelines in this regard, based on which the BRO may engage big construction companies for taking up road projects on a turnkey basis.

It is expected that with delegation of powers by the Ministry of Defence to the BRO, the pace of road construction in border areas would improve and the BRO would be able to complete ongoing/new projects in compressed timelines.

            Navika Sagar Parikrama is a project wherein a team of women officers of the Indian Navy would circumnavigate the globe on an Indian-built sail boat INSV Tarini. This is the first ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. The project is scheduled to commence in early Sep 17. INSV Tarini is the sister vessel of INSV Mhadei. The project is considered essential towards promoting Ocean Sailing activities in the Navy while depicting Government of India’s thrust for ‘Nari Shakti’.

 

            The first Indian Solo circumnavigation was undertaken by Capt Dilip Donde, SC (Retd) from 19 Aug 09 to 19 May 10 onboard the Indian built vessel, INSV Mhadei. The first Indian non-stop solo circumnavigation was undertaken by Cdr  Abhilash Tomy, KC from 01 Nov 12 to 31 Mar 13.

            The expedition has been aptly titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’, aimed at promoting women empowerment in the country and ocean sailing by the Indian Navy. The expedition would inspire the youth of our nation to develop an understanding of the sea and instill a spirit of adventure and camaraderie.

 

            Additional aims of the Expedition are as follows:-

 

(a)       Nari Shakti.     In consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential, the expedition aims to showcase ‘Nari Shakti’ on the world platform. This would also help to discard the societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of participation by women in challenging environment.

 

(b)       Environment and Climate Change.       Sailing encourages the use of environment friendly non-conventional renewable energy resources which affects the life of women. The expedition thereby aims at harnessing the energy to optimise the livelihood of the women onboard.

 

(c)        Make in India.          The voyage also aims to show case the ‘Make in India’ initiative by sailing onboard the indigenously built INSV Tarini.

 

(d)       Meteorological/ Ocean/ Wave Data Observation. The crew would also collate and update Meteorological/ Ocean/ Wave data on a daily basis for subsequent analysis by research and development organisations.

 

(e)       Marine Pollution.    The crew would monitor and report marine pollution on the high seas.

 

(f)        Interaction with Local PIOs. Since the expedition aims to promote Ocean Sailing and the spirit of adventure, the crew would interact extensively with the local PIOs at the various port halts.

Indian Air Force today embarked upon an all women camel expedition along with Border Security Force from Utarlai (Barmer, Rajasthan) to Attari (Amritsar, Punjab). The expedition will conclude on 30 Sep 17. The team was flagged off from Air Force Station Uttarlai today. The expedition is planned with a team of 10 Women Air Warriors of IAF and 10 Women personnel from BSF.

The team of 10 IAF women Air Warriors is led by Sqn Ldr Anioushka Lomas and is attempting this unique feat in desert areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab. Earlier in the year 2011, IAF had created history by hoisting tricolour and IAF flag on top of the world during the all women Mt Everest Expedition.

Keeping the spirit of its motto 'Touch the Sky with Glory', IAF team is poised to explore this adventurous journey of approximately 1400 Km. During the expedition, the team will interact with civilians with an aim to spread awareness about 'Swachh Bharat' and 'BetiBachaoBetiPadhao'Abhiyan. The team will also spread awareness about IAF and its role and various career options available for youth (particularly girls) in IAF. The expedition also aims to promote adventure activities in IAF and thereby motivating Indian youth to join Indian Air Force.

The Team underwent training along with BSF personnel in Subsidiary Training Centre of BSF Jodhpur. On the occasion, IAF Skydiving Team `Air Devils' also carried out a skydiving display.

Following is the text of customary broadcast by the Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley to the Armed Forces personnel over All India Radio on the eve of the 71st Independence Day:

 

My Dear Jawans,

 

The country will be celebrating our 71st Independence Day tomorrow. On this momentous occasion, I extend my heartiest greetings and best wishes to each one of you serving in the Armed Forces. I extend my greetings to all serving personnel as well as ex-servicemen of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard. I also extend my best wishes to the family members of our Armed Forces personnel, many of whom are deployed far from their homes in not only tough terrain but also in deep seas.

 

2.         On this auspicious occasion, my thoughts and gratitude are with the near and dear ones of all those who laid down their lives protecting our nation. We are forever indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice. Since the Armed Forces are at the forefront of our nation’s defence, I assure you that the Government will do all that is necessary to keep your morale high and to meet your functional requirements.

 

3.         Despite our repeated requests to our Western neighbour not to use our territory occupied by it not only to train terrorists but also use it as launch pad for pushing these militants into India, such nefarious activities continued. We ran out of patience as these terrorists were not only targeting our Armed Forces but also civilians. Based on specific and credible inputs about some terrorist teams having positioned themselves at launch pads along Line of Control to carry out infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes in Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other States, the Indian Army conducted surgical strikes on 29 September last year at several of these launch pads to pre-empt infiltration by terrorists. The operations were focussed on ensuring that these terrorists did not succeed in their design to cause destruction and endanger the lives of our citizens. During these counter terrorist operations significant casualties were caused to terrorists and those providing support to them.

 

4.         Even now our jawans continue to be vigilant on the Line of Control, defending the nation, as our adversary continues with its abhorrent acts. Some of our soldiers continue to make the supreme sacrifice while defending our motherland. The nation is indebted to their martyrdom.

 

5.         The Government is committed for the welfare of our jawans. The Government has taken decision on recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission on Allowances, which will benefit 14 lakh Defence Forces personnel. Some of these include, rates of Siachen Allowance for extreme risk and hardship increased from Rs14,000 per month to Rs 30,000 per month; Counter Insurgency Operations Allowance increased from between Rs 3,000 and 11,700 per month to between Rs 6,000 and 16,900 per month. Territorial Army Allowance increased from between Rs 175 and 450 per month to Rs 1,000 and 2,000 per month.

 

6.         The welfare of Ex-Servicemen has been paramount for the government. The benefits of One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme started reaching the accounts of Ex-Servicemen and families since last year. Till July 10 this year, a sum of Rs 4,156 crores and Rs 2,385 crores have been paid towards first and second instalments of OROP arrears to around 20,40,000 Ex-Servicemen/family pensioners and 15,93,000 Ex-Servicemen respectively. Further, a sum of Rs 2,250 crores has also been paid to 15,13,000 Ex-Servicemen as third instalments of OROP arrears. The Government is also sympathetically considering the report of the one-man judicial committee headed by Justice L Narasimha Reddy on OROP to look into the anomalies, if any, arising out of implementation of OROP and will take decision soon.

 

7.         The government has enhanced penury grant to non-pensioner Ex-Servicemen/Widows to Rs 4,000/- per month from the existing rate of Rs 1,000/- per month. We have approved the enhancement of the penury grant following the demands by different stake holders, including Ex-servicemen Associations, Rajya Sainik Boards, Ex-servicemen/widows. The grant is provided to non-pensioner Ex-servicemen/widows, who are above 65 years of age by the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare through Kendriya Sainik Board. It will benefit a large number of non-pensioner Ex-servicemen and widows who are virtually in a state of penury.

 

8.         With the inspiration of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, to help create a spirit of respect for our real heroes, my esteemed cabinet colleague, Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre jointly launched a campaign to have a ‘Wall of Valour’ in 1,000 educational institutions across the country in the Month of May. Portraits of Param Vir Chakra decorated soldiers will be displayed at designated places on educational campuses to instil sense of nationalism among the students.

 

9.         I had privilege to inaugurate the Sainik Rest House at Naraina in New Delhi last month. It is built at a cost of around Rs 8 crore. I hope that this is the beginning of an initiative and the KSB will be able to expand on these in the years to come so that such facilities become an integral part of facilities for Ex-Servicemen. The facilities which have been created are extremely hygienic and very liveable. The Armed Forces have a tradition of maintaining their properties and preserving them well. And I am sure that the kind of modest charges which have been fixed will be of a great assistance and value to all serving and Ex-Servicemen.

 

10.       With these words, I once again extend my greetings to all of you and your family members on the eve of 71st Independence Day. We fought long for our Independence and became Independent nation in which countless patriots immersed themselves in the struggle so that the new generation could live in a free India. The nation now looks to you to defend its borders with all your might and to the best of your strength & abilities so that all our people sleep in peace tonight so that we all see a new dawn together, tomorrow and to take our country to new heights of peace and prosperity for all our people. 

 

11.       Jai Hind!

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will unfurl the National Flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, tomorrow to celebrate the 71st Independence Day. After unfurling the Tricolour, Shri Narendra Modi will address the nation.

 On arrival at Lahori Gate of Red Fort, the Prime Minister will be received by the Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre and Defence Secretary Shri Sanjay Mitra.

 The Defence Secretary will introduce the General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area, Lt. General Manoj Mukund Naravane to the Prime Minister. The GoC Delhi Area will then conduct the Prime Minister to the Saluting Base where a combined Inter-Services and Police Guard will present the general salute to the Prime Minister. Thereafter, Shri Narendra Modi will inspect the Guard of Honour.

 The Guard of Honour contingent for the Prime Minister will consist of one officer and 24 men each from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Delhi Police. The Guard of Honour will be positioned directly in front of the National Flag across the moat below the ramparts.

 This year, the Army being the Coordinating Service, the Guard of Honour will be commanded by Lt Col Dheeraj Singh of the Indian Army. The Army Contingent in the Prime Minister’s Guard will be commanded by Major Sourav Goswami, the Navy contingent by Lt Cdr VV Krishnan, while Sqn Ldr Salil Sharma will lead the Air Force contingent and the Delhi Police contingent by ACP Ankit Chauhan.

 The Army contingent for the Prime Minister's Guard is drawn from the 8th Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry (Siachen). The battalion was raised as the First Battalion Border Scouts by volunteers who took up arms in the aftermath of communal passion and the smouldering embers of Partition to check the multitude of Kabailies intruding into Poonch on 18 December 1947. ‘Born in Battle and Purified in Blood’, the battalion was re-designated as 8th Jammu & Kashmir Militia on 15 April 1948.

 In the 1971 War, the battalion was outnumbered but never outclassed in valour and fought the defensive battle successfully despite the enemy’s passion for Chhamb.

                Rifle Factory Ishapore (RFI) successfully developed Rifle 5.56 x 45mm Excalibur in association with Army. The Gun has been tried by the Indian Army and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). RFI has already supplied around 20000 Nos. Excalibur Rifles to various Police Forces. The design of 5.56 x 45mm Assault Rifle Excalibur is established and proven.

Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) has indigenously developed 7.62 x 39mm Assault Rifle (Ghaatak) for MHA Units and Police Forces. After elaborate evaluation, State and Central Police Forces have placed order of around 5000 Nos. out of which OFB has already supplied 1230 Nos. The Indian Army and Indian Navy will be evaluating the weapon.

RFI had developed 5.56 x 45mm INSAS 1C Assault Rifle in the year 2015-16. The Rifle was extensively evaluated by Army and was able to achieve reliability of international standards.

However, in August, 2016, Army changed the calibre of the Assault Rifle from 5.56 x 45mm to 7.62 x 51mm. As a result of this change of calibre, the indigenous Assault Rifle of 5.56 x 45mm Calibre could not be inducted in Army.

Case for declaring an equipment ‘Obsolete’ is taken up by Line Directorate, Army Headquarters (Infantry Directorate, Army Headquarters for Small Arms). No further provisioning for said equipment and spares is done thereafter. Line Directorate caters for introduction of new equipment as replacement for equipment which it plans to phase out.

This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri M Chandrakasi in Lok Sabha today.

The expenditure on the exercises is either part of the regular overseas deployment programme of Indian Naval Ships or is met from the revenue budget of the Indian Navy.

The reason for leaving DRDO is primarily cited as “Personal Grounds” which is less than the 1%.

Government has introduced a comprehensive ‘Incentive Scheme for DRDO Scientists’, details are given below:-

Incentive Scheme for DRDO Scientists’

I.            Financial Incentives:

·         Additional Increments: Two additional increments are given to Scientists C, D, E & F.

·         Professional Update Allowance:  Scientist ‘B’, ‘C’ & ‘D’ are granted Rs. 15, 000 p.a., Scientists ‘E’ & ‘F’ Rs. 30,000 p.a. and Scientists ‘G’ & above Rs. 45, 000 p.a. as Professional Update Allowance.

·         Variable Increments:  Up to maximum of six increments are granted to deserving Scientists at the time of promotion under FCS depending upon merit.

 II.            Growth related Incentives:

To give better growth and promotional avenues to the Scientists in DRDO, Merit based Flexible Complementing Scheme (FCS) is in place, where promotions are based on assessment and not on available vacancies.  Under the FCS, Scientist recruited at the level of Sc ‘B’ in the lowest rung of Gp ‘A’ can move up to the level of Scientist ‘H’ in Level 15 Higher Administrative Grade (HAG) scale and thereafter, the level of Distinguished Scientist in the Level 16 (HAG+ scale ) achievable on personal up-gradation basis.

 III.            Proposed Incentives:

As regards Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) it may be mentioned that 7th CPC has not recommended PRIS for DRDO although the same is in operation in Department of Space & Department of Atomic Energy.

         IV.            Qualification/Skill Improvement:

Scientists in DRDO are being sponsored for M.E./M.Tech programmes at Indian Institute of Technologies (IITs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and other reputed institutes under the Research & Training Scheme at Government expense so that they can up-grade their knowledge and skills.  Further, scientists are also encouraged to complete Ph.D. in their respective field, for which necessary assistance is provided.

                Defence sector being a User driven sector, Defence Forces are actively involved in various policies & procedures related to procurement, indigenous design, development & manufacture of defence equipment, co-development & co-production with foreign OEMs, thus contributing towards ‘Make in India’ . Some of the major areas, where defence personnel are involved, are listed below:

‘Make Procedure’: ‘Make’ procedure as given out at Chapter-III of Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)-2016, envisages involvement of Defence personnel at various stages of development of a defence equipment. The ‘Make’ projects are identified through a consultative process with involvement of members from Services Head Quarters (SHQs). Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by Service officer, established at SHQs, is responsible for monitoring the implementation of ‘Make’ projects of respective SHQ. The Integrated Project Management Team (IPMT) mandated to steer the Make project, is also headed by Service Officer.

Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme: TDF scheme launched by the Government aims at funding the development of defence and dual use technologies that are currently not available with the Indian defence industry, or have not been developed so far, thus creating an Eco-system for enhancing cutting edge technology capability for Defence application. The scheme envisages constitution of Empowered Committee and Technical Committee with representation from Armed Forces as members, which are involved in identification of technologies, Project Monitoring & Mentoring activities.

‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ Categories of Capital Acquisition: ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ categories of capital acquisition under DPP, envisage tie-up between Indian Vendor/ Indian Production Agency & foreign OEM, for indigenous production of defence equipment involving Transfer of Technology (ToT) of critical technologies to promote ‘Make in India’. The Defence Personnel are engaged at various stages of procurement to progress the projects categorized under these categories.

Army Design Bureau (ADB): SHQ (Army) has established an Army Design Bureau (ADB) in August - 2016 as a single point coordination with Industry & Academia. The mandate of ADB, inter- alia is to act as a central repository of technical know-how, to bring forward the innovation undertaken by field formation, to generate long-term research requirement for Indian Army etc.

In addition, a large number of personnel from the Armed forces are posted in DRDO (Defence Research & Development Organisation) to provide impetus to design & development of projects of the Armed forces, thus contributing to indigenization process.

                Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is manufacturing Sukhoi-30 MKI, Hawk, and Dornier 228 (DO 228) aircraft under License from foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for which Technologies have been fully absorbed to the extent of Transfer of Technology (ToT) contracts.

Light Combat Aircraft “TEJAS” and Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Dhruv are indigenously designed & developed.

Indigenization of components is a continuous process involving development and qualification. New technologies especially, advanced avionics, advanced  mechanical  systems, structured  design  capabilities;

several world class high value ground test rigs have been established and HAL has also involved private industries to supply airborne items, aircraft/helicopter sub-assemblies and assemblies which can directly fit on aircraft/helicopter. 

The present status of indigenization of the major platforms manufactured by HAL is as below:-

Government has taken various steps to encourage indigenization and self-reliance in defence. Under ‘Make in India’ initiative, Government has taken following initiatives:-

i.     A new Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), 2016 has been promulgated by the Government to take effect from 01st April, 2016 whereby a new category of procurement ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)}’ which has been accorded top–most priority for procurement of Capital equipment. Besides this, preference has been accorded to ‘Buy (Indian) and ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ categories of capital acquisition over  ‘Buy (Global)’ and  ‘Buy  &  Make (Global)’ categories. The ‘Make’ Procedure has been simplified with provisions for funding of 90% of development cost by the Government to Indian industry and reserving projects not exceeding development cost of Rs. 10 Crore (Government funded) and Rs. 3 Crore (Industry funded) for MSMEs.

ii.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy has been revised. FDI up to 49% is allowed through automatic route and beyond 49% under Government approval route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.

iii.  Indian licensing regime for Indian manufacturers has been liberalized and most of the components/ parts/ sub-systems have been taken out from the list of Defence products requiring industrial license which has resulted in reduction in the entry barriers for new entrants in this sector particularly SMEs.  The initial validity of industrial license has been increased from 3 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 3 years on         a case to case basis.

iv.  Issues related to level playing field between Indian and foreign manufacturers and between Public sector & Private sector have also been addressed. These include Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) protection for Indian vendors.

v.  Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing change of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) and Offset components even in signed contracts. Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are now not required to indicate the details of IOPs and products at the time of signing of contracts. ‘Services’ as an avenue of offset have been re-instated.

vi.  In HAL, an R&D Corpus of 10% of the operational profit after tax is earmarked for R&D activities both in-house and with private vendors.

vii.  Strategic partnership model has been formulated by the Government in May, 2017 to focus on substitution of imported spares, ensure greater self-reliance and dependability of supplies, essential to meet national security objectives.

viii. Certain components of some of the defence equipment of Russian origin have been identified and published on the web for identifying Indian  private sector companies for indigenous manufacture under Joint Ventures/Transfer of Technology agreements with Russian OEMs.

As per the operational requirement of Army, Long Term Roll on Works Plan of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for five years (2015-2020) has been formulated to include 519 roads of length measuring 22,225 km for construction / improvement by BRO.

Out of above 519 roads, 61 roads of length measuring 3417 Km have been identified as strategic Indo-China Border Roads (ICBR).  In addition to meeting the operational requirement, the above mentioned roads, on completion, would also enhance accessibility to border areas including areas where the border infrastructure and forward connectivity is lacking.

                ‘Make in India’ in defence manufacturing is primarily driven by capital acquisition of defence equipment and other policy measures taken to promote indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence equipment in the country by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector. These measures include according priority and preference to procurement from Indian vendors under the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016, liberalization of the licensing regime and FDI policy by raising the cap on FDI in the defence sector, simplification of export procedure, streamlining of defence offset guidelines etc. Recently, the Government has notified the ‘Strategic Partnership (SP)’ Model which envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian Private entities through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they would tie up with global OEMs to seek technology transfers to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains.

The Capital expenditure on procurement of defence equipment by three Services, from Indian vendors has increased from Rs. 31575 Crore (47% of total Procurement value) in 2013-14 to Rs. 41873 Crore (60.5% of total Procurement value) in 2016-17. In last three financial years i.e. 2014-15 to 2016-17, the Government has accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for 145 proposals worth Rs. 399800 Crore approximately, out of which 103 proposals worth Rs. 2,46,400 Crore approximately have been approved under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ and ‘Make’ categories of capital acquisition.

After opening up of the Defence Industry Sector for private Sector participation in 2001, so far 342 Letters of Intents (LOIs) / Industrial Licences (ILs) have been issued to 205 Indian companies for manufacture of a wide range of defence items to public / private companies. 13 ILs have been issued to 12 Indian companies for manufacture of fighter aircrafts, helicopter, or their parts / components / assemblies etc in the country.

Foreign companies are allowed to have tie-ups with Indian vendors for indigenous production involving Transfer of technology (ToT) under ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ categories of capital acquisition. Some of the major projects approved under these categories in the past three years include 155mm / 52 caliber Mounted Gun system, Extended Range (ER) Rockets for 122mm GRAD Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher, Successor to Air Defence Guns, New Generation Ammunition for 84mm Rocket Launcher, Mine Ploughs Sets etc.

One of the objectives of ‘Make in India’ initiative is to build world class manufacturing infrastructure in the country so as to reduce dependence on imports and to reduce the cost in the long run. However, this being a long term activity, it is premature to assess its impact on reduction in manufacturing cost at this stage.

                The Government had constituted a committee comprising two members viz. Lt. Gen. (Retd.) G.S. Katoch and Lt. Gen. (Retd.) A.K. Ahuja to examine and give their recommendations on the changes in promotion policy and the Quantified System of Selection (QSS) for officers of Indian Army. The terms of reference of the committee were as below:-

• To study and recommend appropriate amendments in the Quantified System of Selection (QSS) in order to infuse more objectivity, transparency and fairness in the system.

• To study and recommend the changes required in the Promotion policy presently followed in the Army. This will cover aspects like method for calculation of vacancies, Cut-off CRs required, Consideration of Special Review / Withdrawn and Deferred cases, Zone of consideration, Notional Empanelment etc.

• To suggest the Model Calendar of Selection Boards.

The committee has already submitted its report.

Bringing Transparency in promotion policy is a continuous process and all necessary steps are taken from time to time.

                Since the launch of ‘Make in India’ in September 2014, several measures have been taken by the Government to promote indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence & aerospace equipment in the country by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector. These measures inter alia include:

• Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has been revised and has come into effect from 1st April 2016. A new category of procurement ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)}’ has been introduced in DPP-2016 which has been accorded top most priority for procurement of capital equipment. Besides this, preference has been accorded to procurement under ‘Buy (Indian)’ and ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ categories of capital acquisition over ‘Buy (Global)’ & ‘Buy & Make (Global)’ categories. The ‘Make’ Procedure has been simplified with provisions for funding of 90% of development cost by the Government to Indian industry and reserving projects not exceeding development cost of Rs.10 Crore (Government funded) and Rs.3 Crore (Industry funded) for MSMEs.

• FDI Policy has been revised and under the revised policy, Foreign Investment up to 49% is allowed through automatic route and above 49% under Government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.

• Industrial licensing regime for Indian manufacturers under IDR {Industries (Development and Regulation)} Act,1951 has been liberalised and most of the components/ parts / sub-systems have been taken out from the list of defence products requiring Industrial Licence. This has reduced entry barriers for new entrants in this sector, particularly SMEs. The initial validity of Industrial Licence under IDR Act, has been increased from 3 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 3 years on a case to case basis.

• Issues related to level-playing field between Indian & foreign manufacturers, and between public sector & private sector have also been addressed. These include Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) protection for all Indian vendors, removing existing tax anomalies etc.

• Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing change of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) and offset components, even in signed contracts. Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are now not required to indicate the details of IOPs and products at the time of signing of contracts. ‘Services’ as an avenue of discharge of offset have been re-instated.

• The process for export clearance has been streamlined and made transparent & online.

• Recently, the Government has notified the ‘Strategic Partnership (SP)’ Model which envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian companies through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they are required to engage with global OEMs for Transfer of Technology and domestic manufacturing infrastructure.

The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under Ministry of Commerce & Industry, administers ‘Modified Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme (MIIUS)’ for upgradation of common industrial infrastructure in Industrial Clusters in the country. Project proposals for Defence and Aero Manufacturing Clusters are also considered under MIIUS.

Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) and Dholera Industrial City Development Limited (DICDL), after identifying the land around Sanand and Dholera respectively, forwarded the following two proposals related to Defence and Aerospace manufacturing sector to Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India:-

• The first project proposal was for establishment of Defence park at Sanand Industrial Estate, under MIIUS, from GIDC. Since, DIPP had already approved two other non-defence project proposals under MIIUS, this proposal could not be considered due to cap of two projects per State in MIIUS guidelines.

• Another proposal was received from DICDL, Government of Gujarat for seeking support and guidance for attracting major Aerospace and Defence manufacturing companies to invest in Dholera. DIPP had advised to DICDL to take up the proposal for establishment of Aerospace and Defence Manufacturing Park in Dholera with associations like Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) etc.

Government is committed to the goal of achieving self reliance in meeting national security objectives. The ‘Make in India’ initiative is the focal point of the current defence procurement policy and procedure and aims to promote indigenous design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment, platforms and systems, involving the public and private sector in the country. 

As an important step towards meeting broader national objectives, Government has recently promulgated the Strategic Partnership Policy to facilitate broader participation of the private sector, in addition to DPSUs / OFB, in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment such as aircraft, submarines, helicopters and armoured vehicles. It is expected that the implementation of the Policy will enhance competition, increase efficiencies, facilitate faster and more significant absorption of technology and create a tiered industrial ecosystem in the country, including in the MSME Sector. The award of contracts in such cases will be through a transparent and competitive process. The policy is expected to contribute to building indigenous capabilities within the country in respect of the identified segments.

The critical gaps of Indian Army in artillery guns, infantry weapons, light helicopters, night fighting devices, etc., have been identified and have been suitably addressed in 13th Defence Plan 2017-2022 and the Annual Acquisition Plan 2017-19. Modernisation and capability development are ongoing complex processes with long gestation period. The Government has taken a number of effective measures to streamline acquisition process through Defence Procurement Procedures (DPP) 2016 and strategic partnership model etc. This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri C Mahendran in Lok Sabha today.

                The States of Gujarat and Rajasthan had experienced heavy rains and floods in past few days. Considering the gravity of situation, the State Emergency Operation Cell requested Indian Air Force for rescue operations in flood affected areas of Mehasana, Deesa, Banaskantha and Patan. Accordingly, the IAF team swung into action and deployed Mi-17V5 and Chetak helicopters at various location of the State for rescue and relief operations. A dedicated Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Cell was activated at South Western Air Command, Gandhinagar to monitor the relief operations round the clock. Under the challenging weather conditions, with limited ground reference, these helicopters carried out rescue operations to save stranded people. The rescue operation included a patient in dire need of dialysis who was airlifted from the rooftop in the shortest possible time, along with a pregnant woman with small child and husband.

Despite inclement weather, a total of 220 sorties were flown by IAF rescue team in Gujarat Area and 35 sorties in Rajasthan area. During the rescue operations, the crew dropped a total of 86 tonnes of food packets in flood affected areas of Gujarat state. A radar was also operationalised at Deesa for communication which was specially transported by An-32 aircraft till Ahmedabad and thereafter moved by road to Deesa.

C-17 and C-130J aircraft airlifted NDRF personnel and load to the airports nearest to the flooded areas.

                Minister of State for Defence, Dr Subhash Bhamre inaugurated 75th raising day function of the Armed Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) Civilian Services here today. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Bhamre said that AFHQ civilian personnel have been standing firmly with the Armed Forces, providing them with the essential support and working for the safety of the nation with dedication and commitment, both in times of peace and war.

He appreciated the administrative acumen and work culture of the cadre who have been working shoulder to shoulder with Service personnel and providing them with the logistical support in manpower, quartering, material management, administration and human resources development.

The service cadre came to existence when the office of Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) was constituted in the Ministry of Defence on August 1, 1942 and all the civilians were brought under one Cadre Controlling Authority.

Defence Secretary Shri Sanjay Mitra also addressed the function, which was organised at Mavalankar Hall in the Constitution Club of India. The dignitaries also gave away sports and cultural awards to outstanding personnel. Joint Secretary & CAO Shri V Anandarajan presented the Annual Report on the occasion.

 Every aircraft accident/incident is thoroughly investigated by a Court of Inquiry to ascertain the cause of accident and the recommendations of the completed Court of Inquiry are implemented. Various preventive measures are being taken including invigoration of Aviation Safety Organization, streamlining of accident/ incident reporting procedure, analytical studies and quality audits of the aircraft fleets to identify vulnerable areas to avoid aircraft accidents. Accident prevention programmes have been given an added thrust to identify risk prone/hazardous areas specific to the aircraft fleets and operational environment to ensure safe practices/procedures.

The coastal security issues are regularly reviewed at appropriate levels with National committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS), being the apex body for inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. A coastal security mechanism in the form of a three-tiered cover comprising Indian Navy (IN), Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and State Marine Police with demarcated areas of responsibility has been put in place. Coastal Security Exercises are being conducted in all coastal States and Union Territories to assess the effectiveness of existing mechanisms and to address gaps.

Coastal Surveillance Network (CSN) which includes radars has been established along the coastline. Under Phase-I of this project 45 radars have been made operational. Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard have been provided with adequate powers under the Coast Guard Act, 1978 and other Acts / Rules to enable them to face various challenges effectively.

                Northeast Venture Fund offered by the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER) is attracting young Start-Ups in more and more numbers and has generated huge enthusiasm among entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity in the North-Eastern region.

Stating this here today after a meeting with the officials of the Ministry of DoNER, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, said that hundreds of queries are pouring in each day with the DoNER Ministry and over 60 proposals are already in the pipeline for consideration.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the Northeast Venture Fund is the first dedicated venture capital fund for North-Eastern region and the initiative to set it up began in April this year. He said, Prime Minister’s “Startup India, Standup India” is an incredible programme which includes unprecedented provisions and incentives like, for example, tax holiday in the early phase and an exit period of three months. Added to this, the Ministry of DoNER is offering an additional benefit of providing the initial Venture Capital Fund to any youngster who decides to set up an entrepreneurship in the North-Eastern region.

Dr Jitendra Singh further explained that “North-East Venture Fund” has been set up by the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi), which already has the mandate to encourage entrepreneurship in the region primarily by offering support to the first-generation entrepreneurs. In addition, the NEDFi also performs the role of hand-holding and capacity building, he said.

Recalling Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Shillong last year when he had stressed the importance of entrepreneurship in the region, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the region has huge potential for young Start-Ups unlike many other parts of the country and hoped that the unique idea of setting up a dedicated Venture fund will make up for the constraints faced by a youngster when he sets out to be on his own. He hoped that if the idea of Venture Fund supported StartUp entrepreneurship catches up, the day is not far when Northeast will become a favourite destination for young entrepreneurs and StartUps, not only from the Northeast region but from the whole of India.

Secretary DoNER, Shri Naveen Verma and senior officers of the Ministry were present during the meeting.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has called for indigenous “StartUp” initiatives.

In his address after inaugurating the 3-day “StartUp Expo 2017” at Pragati Maidan here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s “StartUp” initiative has the capacity to open new avenues of employability. At the same time, one can also serve the rich cultural and traditional heritage of India if we focus on “StartUp” ventures through indigenous resources and means, he added.

Citing example, Dr Jitendra Singh said, for instance, the pieces of artisan excellence prepared by some of the creators which are on display in the exhibition stall, were completed after several months of labour but could fetch very little on sale because of lack of value addition and partly lack of awareness. Other aspect of concern is that such streams of art were being kept alive by certain “Gharanas” or “Khandaans” but with the next generation youth opting for hi-tech professions, there is nobody to carry forward this original indigenous vocation, he lamented.

Dr Jitendra Singh stated that just as in Northeast, the Ministry of DoNER has taken the initiative of offering “Venture Capital Fund” to any young “StartUp” who wishes to set up a unit in one of the North-Eastern States, similarly the respective State Governments could also come forward with certain specific and exclusive incentives for youngsters who undertake “StartUp” initiatives in the field or discipline which traditionally identifies with the culture and heritage of that particular State. 

Uttar Pradesh Industry Minister Shri Satish Mahana and Chairman MMTC (Mineral & Metal Trade Corporation) Shri Rajnish Goenka also spoke on the occasion.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has called for establishing a “Make in India” health module. Addressing the CII Health Conference organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here today, he said that this module can be based on public-private partnership as well as multi-centric healthcare collaboration to meet the changing health needs of 21st century India.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Indian society, as a whole, is fast evolving and at the same time, in recent years, India too has become a part of shrunken global world and this phenomenon is impacting every sphere of life including the healthcare system. While on the one hand, disorders like Diabetes and heart disease, which were hitherto confined to urban population, are now also on the rise in rural areas, on the other hand, the access to modern modalities of treatment is confined only to cities and big towns, as a result of which 70% of rural population gets access only to 1/3rd of country’s hospitalization facilities and over 600 million people in the country are deprived of access to affordable healthcare, he added.

Describing the emergence of private sector as an inevitable phenomenon, Dr Jitendra Singh stressed that for a heterogeneous country like India, public sector healthcare was still very much relevant and therefore, called for a healthy synergism between public sector and private sector healthcare agencies. He cited the experience from Northeast where he had motivated some of the country’s leading corporate sector hospital groups to set up healthcare outlets of different magnitudes depending on the viability of the location, in the form of OPD clinics or diagnostic centres or even full fledged hospitals.

Referring to the constraints of heterogeneity and diversity, Dr Jitendra Singh mentioned topographical and geographical variations in different regions of India. In this regard, he referred to vast expanses of inaccessible areas in the North East where he had proposed the introduction of Helicopter Care Service in the form of Air Clinics wherein specialist doctor could fly to remote areas to hold the OPD and on way back,could also carry some needy patients requiring hospitalization. The same concept, he said, could also be applied to hill states like Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said here today that youth aspiration will determine India’s future, as also the pace and pedestal of India’s ascent as a frontline world nation within next few years.

Speaking at a seminar organised by ASSOCHAM on the occasion of World Entrepreneurs’ Day, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in a country like India, which has more than 70 percent population below the age of 40, any future programme will have to be youth- centric to be successful. In the same vein, he said, the various contours of future entrepreneurship will also have to be seen through the eyes of the youth.

In the last 3 years, as a result of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s proactive outreach, Dr Jitendra Singh said, not only the foreign investors are finding India an attractive destination but even those Indians who had gone abroad and settled there several decades ago in search of green pastures, are now looking forward to an opportunity to come back to India and launch an enterprise.

Dr Jitendra Singh observed, there is no dearth of aptitude amongst the youth which needs to be tapped. It is important to first understand what a given individual youth is capable of doing to his best, as much as it is equally important to understand what he is not capable of doing in spite of peer pressures or social compulsions, he said.

To enable the future entrepreneurs to achieve to the maximum of their potential, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a mass awareness programme is required for a change in social behaviour. The youth can utilize their potential by taking advantage of the start-up scheme of the Government, he added

Dr Jitendra Singh also disclosed that for the youngsters wishing to launch an entrepreneurship in Northeast, the Government of India’s “Start-up India, Stand-up India” Programme will be supplemented by an added incentive by Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) in the form of Venture Fund.

Israeli Ambassador Mr Daniel Carmon, President ASSOCHAM Shri Sandeep Jajodia and Secretary General ASSOCHAM Shri DS Rawat, among others, also spoke on the occasion.

The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that a North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre will be set up in Delhi soon. He was briefing the media here today. He said that this will be a new gift to the people of North East (NE) India. He said that this is in line with the priority being given to North East by the Union Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had allotted a land measuring 5341.75 sqm. (1.32 acre) at Sector-13, Dwarka, New Delhi, at a cost of approx Rs. 6 crore, to North Eastern Council (NEC) for the purpose of construction of North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre. He said that this Centre will act as a cultural and convention/information hub of the North Eastern Region in Delhi. The Minister said that it will be constructed at par with the international standards and will have a library-cum-reading room with material on North Eastern Region, an art gallery showcasing the North East. The project is expected to be completed within 1-2 years and at a cost of approximately Rs. 50-55 crores, he added. 

Highlighting the other initiatives, he said that the Ministry of DoNER has created “Venture Capital Fund” for the young Start-Ups and entrepreneurs, who decide to initiate an enterprise in NE region. He also said that, keeping in view the large number of NE students studying in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the foundation stone was laid in JNU in July 2017, for the construction of Barak hostel for accommodating NE students. Similarly, the foundation stone was also laid in Bengaluru University in June 2016, for the construction of a hostel exclusively for girl students from Northeast. Four permanent stalls have also been set up in Dilli Haat to promote North East products, he added. 

The Minister said that ‘Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Center for Policy Research and Analysis’ was formally launched at the Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management (RGIIM), Shillong, as a step towards linking the NEC with institutes of excellence to make it as a state-of-art resource centre. He said that a number of fast-track initiatives have been undertaken in order to make the conditions more conducive and friendly to attract investors from outside. He said that steps are being undertaken for providing better connectivity to this region via rail networks, roads and waterways. He further added that tourism has gained momentum in the North East in the last few years, which is giving boost to the economy there. He also talked about the setting up of Brahmaputra Study Centre in the Guwahati University. 

Shri S. N. Pradhan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of DoNER said that the North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre will act as a hub for cultural and convention related activities of North East. He further said that it will be a vibrant national Centre for the international exposition of art and culture. He said that a series of events on North East India will be organized by the Ministry of DoNER later this year.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh released a book titled ‘Vande Mataram’ here today. The book traces the journey of ‘Vande Mataram’ since the time of its creation, over the years, through different phases. 

On the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that ‘Vande Mataram’ is a symbol of India’s nationalist ethos and it is wrong to associate it with any particular religion or sect. The Minister recalled that Vande Mataram first came to be known in the form of a poem composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1870’s which was later included in the author's 1881 novel ""Anandamath"", but what is most significant is that several verses of the song were adopted as the National Song in early 20th century and the same later became a popular marching song for political activists and crusaders of India’s freedom movement. Vande Mataram can be appropriately described as a symbol, which united people of India from different regions, different religions and different faiths, and inspired them to come together for the common cause of Mother India, he added. 

The book is written by Shri Akhilesh Jha and Ms. Rashmita Jha, which particularly focuses on the references to Vande Mataram during the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly and the Indian Parliament, and at the same time, also traces the musical versions of Vande Mataram through recorded sounds and gramophone over the last one-and-a-half century.

As the Swachh Bharat Mission approaches the third anniversary of its launch by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation today launched a third party verification survey report to take stock of the progress already made by the Mission in rural India. The Quality Council of India (QCI) has conducted a transparent third-party assessment of the present status of rural sanitation in all States and UTs, called Swachh Survekshan Gramin 2017. 

Under the Swachh Survekshan Gramin 2017, QCI surveyed 1.4 lakh rural households across 4626 villages, and found the overall toilet coverage to be 62.45%. At the time of the survey, i.e. May-June 2017, the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) MIS reported the coverage to be 63.73%. The survey also observed that 91.29% of the people having access to a toilet, use it.  The Swachh Survekshan Gramin 2017 report was launched at a press conference today in New Delhi by the Union Minister, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, and the Secretary, Shri Parameswaran Iyer.

It was also announced at the press conference that, to encourage States and districts to improve their Sanitation coverage and Solid Liquid Waste Management (SLWM), the MDWS will also begin ranking all districts in India based on the data available on the SBM-G IMIS quarterly. The ranking will be done based on parameters of Performance, Sustainability and Transparency, and the first ranking will be announced on 2nd October, 2017 for the quarter July-September 2017. To instil healthy competition amongst districts, they will also be given awards based on this ranking on a quarterly basis. The formula for calculating these rankings will be:

Total score (100) = Performance (50) + Sustainability (25) + Transparency (25)

Further, in response to the Prime Minister’s call to the nation to Quit Filth, it was announced by Shri Tomar that the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) will celebrate the week leading up to the 70thIndependence Day as “Khule Mein Shauch Se Azaadi”saptaah. Highlights of this week are:

1.    More than 24 States have prepared their Swachhta Action Plan for the week to reinforce their swachhta efforts by innovative methods and with community engagement. 

2.    On 12 August, 2017, MDWS and MoWR, RD & GR will jointly announce 24 Ganga Grams from five States, Uttarakhand (3), UP (10), Bihar (4), Jharkhand (5) and West Bengal (2) to make them Aadarsh Ganga Gram.

3.    30 SwachhtaRaths will be launched at Allahabad on August 12, 2017 in the presence of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Shri Tomar. 

4.    Swachhta Raths will also be launched in other parts of the country.

Shri Tomar also announced that, in the run up to completion of three years of Swachh Bharat Mission, MDWS is planning various Swachhta events across the country from 25th September to 2nd October 2017. During this week, National Swachhta Awards will be given to grass root level swachhta champions, district officers, Best Pakhwada Ministries, outstanding contributions by Ministries, PSU sponsors for Swachh Iconic Places and Swachhta Action Plan. 

Over 4.54 crore household toilets have been constructed since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin. 2,20,104 villages, 160 districts and 5 States declared ODF.Sanitation Coverage has increased from 39% in October 2016 to 66% in August 2017.

Behaviour change is the key to Swachh Bharat Mission’s success. In past three years, tireless effortsmade by thousands of government officials, grassroots leaders, volunteers and Swachhagrahishave made it possible that the number of ODF(Open Defecation Free) States has today gone up to 5, that of ODF districts has gone up to 156, and the number of ODF villages has crossed the 2 lakh mark.  People from all walks of life have shown an exemplary commitment towards making India open defecation free (ODF), and have transformed the Swachh Bharat Mission into a true jan-aandolan. The core strategy for achieving the goals of SBM is Information, Education and Communication (IEC)

However, there have been some recent reportsof inappropriate action on part of certain field level functionaries which have come to the attention of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.

The Ministry has issued the following advisory to all the State Governments on 25 July, 2017 as a proactive step to reinforce the stance of the Swachh Bharat Mission on this issue:



	
		
			
			No.AR/SBM-11/2017

			Government of India

			Ministry of Drinking Water  and Sanitation

			Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) Division

			4th Floor, Pt. DeendayalAntyodayaBhawan

			CGO Complex, Lodhi Road,

			New Delhi – 110003

			 

			Dated : 25.07.2017

			 

			 

			Subject :         Advisory on Approach and Communication

			 

			 

			 

			Dear Principal Secretary/Secretary,

			 

			 

			The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has taken note of some recent instances of local administrations adopting inappropriate and gender insensitive approaches in the context of preventing open defecation. Such actions are not in keeping with the spirit of the Swachh Bharat Mission.

			 

			We would like to reiterate that the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) focuses on encouraging communities to collectively and voluntarily adopt and use toilets, as well as promote swachhta in their villages. This objective needs to be achieved through facilitation by local authorities by using appropriate messaging and positive behaviour change communication.

			 

			State Governments are requested to communicate the above message to all concerned.

			 

			With regards,

			 

			Yours Sincerely,

			 

			 

			 

			(Akshay Rout)

			Officer on Special Duty

			Swachh Bharat Mission

			Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation

			 

			To: All Principal Secretaries/Secretaries

                Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar today directed the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) to take measure for adoption of solar energy in all Navodaya Vidyalayas. Chairing the 35th Meeting of Executive Committee of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti in New Delhi today, he asked the Samiti to seek the guidance of Ministry of Power to speed up the process.

He applauded the performance of the Navodaya Vidyalaya students in 10th and 12th Board and particularly the impressive performance of NV students in IIT-JEE Advance and NEET. He noted with satisfaction that out of the 14183 NV students who appeared in NEET, 11875 qualified in the examination of which 7000+ already placed in various good medical colleges. Navodaya Vidyalayas have already become a brand for quality education and the recent successes have further enhanced its brand.

Acknowledging the important role being played by some of the NVS alumni in guiding students voluntarily to prepare for competitive examinations, Shri Javadekar directed the NVS to use social media network to connect with more such NVS alumni. This, he said, would broad-base the voluntary involvement of alumni and have a positive impact on the progress of Vidyalayas. He also appealed to NV alumni to come forward in a big way to support their Alma matter.

Shri Javadekar also desired that the teachers who are deputed for training abroad through scholarship should be asked to share a report on their learning and its utility for the system.

He also directed that water and solar energy harvesting should form part of proposals in the new building plans and explore the possibility of having water harvesting and Bio-Gas plants in existing campuses.

While reviewing the functioning of NVS, the Minister directed the Samiti to conduct study of positive impact of: 1) Student-Teacher living together 2) Teachers living together in school campus and 3) Health improvement of students.

The minister appreciated the efforts of the Samiti in filling up all posts of teachers in North Eastern region.

Hon’ble Minister of State of Human Resource Development Shri Upendra Kushwaha, Secretary School Education Shri Anil Swarup, Joint Secretaries and Financial Advisor of MHRD and NVS Commissioner, other Members and senior officials from the Samiti were also present.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded its approval today for creation of a non-lapsable pool in the Public Account for secondary and higher, education known as ""Madhyamik and Uchchtar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) into which all proceeds of ""Secondary and Higher Education Cess"" will be credited.

 

The funds arising from the MUSK would be utilized for schemes in the education sector which would be available for the benefit of students of secondary and higher education, all over the country.

 

In connection with the above fund, the Union Cabinet also accorded its approval to the following:

 

(i)      Administration and maintenance of the above pool by Ministry of Human Resource Development.

 

(ii)     Accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the ongoing schemes of Secondary and Higher Education. However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any future programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement, as per prescribed procedure,

 

(iii)    In any financial year, the expenditure on ongoing schemes of the Department of School Education & Literacy and Department of Higher Education would be initially incurred from the gross budgetary support (GBS) and the expenditure would be financed from the MUSK only after the GBS is exhausted.

 

(iv)    The MUSK would be maintained as a Reserve Fund in the non-interest bearing section of the Public Accounts of India.

 

The major benefit will be enhancing access to secondary and higher education through availability of adequate resources, while ensuring that the amount does not lapse at the end of financial year.

Features:

 

1.         Accruals into the proposed non-lapsable fund will be made available for expansion of secondary education and higher education. 

 

2.         For Secondary Education: Presently, the Ministry of Human Resources Development envisages that the accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the secondary education for:

    ongoing Rashtriya Madhyamik Shlksha Abhiyan Scheme and other approved programmes including:

    National Means-Cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme and

    National Scheme for Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education.

 

3.         For Higher Education: the accruals would be utilized for:

    ongoing Schemes of Interest Subsidy and contribution for guarantee funds, Scholarship for College & University Students;

    Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyaan;

    Scholarship (from Block Grant to the institutions) and National Mission on Teachers and Training.

    However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement & prescribed procedure.

 

The purpose of levying cess for secondary and higher education is to provide adequate resources for secondary and higher education.

 

The fund would be operationalised as per the present arrangements under Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) wherein the proceeds of cess are used for Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Schemes of the Department of School Education & Literacy.

 

Background:

 

(i)      During the 10th Plan, an education cess of 2% on all central taxes was imposed w.e.f. 1.4.2004 to make available additional    resources    for    basic    education/elementary education to augment the existing budgetary resources. A need was felt to give a similar fillip to the effort of the Central Government in universalizing access to secondary education and expanding the reach of the higher education sector.  Therefore, the Finance Minister, in his budget speech of 2007 proposed an additional cess of 1% on central taxes for secondary and higher education.

 

(ii)  A cess @ 1% on central taxes, called the ""Secondary and Higher Education Cess"" was levied through Finance Act, 2007 to ""fulfil the commitment of the Government to provide and finance secondary and higher education"" (Section 136 of the Act).

 

(iii)  In July, 2010, a draft cabinet note was circulated by the HRD Ministry wherein it was proposed to create a non-lapsable fund   in   the   Public Account   called   ""Madhyamik and Uchchatar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) as a receptacle for the proceeds of the Secondary and Higher Education Cess. The views of concerned Ministries viz the then Planning Commission, Ministry   of   North   Eastern   Region, and Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance were sought in this regard.  The Department of Economic Affairs did not agree to the proposal on the grounds that the Budget allocations for the schemes of Secondary Education and Higher Education have been far more than the amount of 1% cess collected. Therefore, the amount of the cess collected is deemed to have been fully allocated for the schemes of Secondary and Higher Education in the respective financial years. Hence, funds on account of 1% cess for the past period are not available now for allocation.

 

(iv) Subsequently, the HRD Ministry sought the approval of the Department of Economic Affairs for revisiting the issue of creation of ""Madhyamik and Uchchatar Shiksha Kosh"" (MUSK) on 11th February, 2016. Department of Economic Affairs on 20th June, 2016 approved that this Ministry may move a draft Cabinet Note to seek the approval of the Cabinet for creation of. MUSK.

                Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister of State, Ministry of Human Resource Development launched the Indian National Anthem video in sign language at Films Division Auditorium, New Delhi today.

The video features Mr Amitabh Bachchan along with children with disability singing the National Anthem in sign language at the backdrop of the Majestic Red Fort. The film is conceptualised by Satish Kapoor, Founder Director, We Care Film Festival. We Care Film Festival produced the Film under the aegis of Brotherhood, an NGO. It is directed by Govind Nihalani and the music is scored by late Aadesh Shrivastava.

Speaking on the occasion the Minister said that our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has a vision that India’s development will be complete when our divyangjan become an integral part of it and come forward in the nation building. Shri Modi had suggested that the term 'divyang' (divine body) instead of 'viklang' be used for persons with disability.

He further said that we must create an environment for the disabled people by which they can be able to earn a livelihood and live an independent life like any other citizen. It is our responsibility to mainstream them into all walks of life, and to make things accessible to them so that they can be fully integrated into national life.

He praised the government for its decision on the reservation in vacancies in government establishments to increase it from 3% to 4% for certain persons or class of persons with benchmark disability.

He appreciated the efforts of the organizers and wished them all the success in future endeavors.

Those present on the occasion were Mr. Sudesh Verma, National Spokesperson of BJP and Patron of We Care Film Festival, Mr. Derek Segaar, Director United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, Mr Al-Amin Yusuph, Adviser, Communication and Information for South Asia, Mr. Suresh Srivastava, Secretary General, Indian Federation of United Nations Associations, among others. Many disabled students from different schools were also present.

                The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has been designated as the vehicle for implementing the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Since the inception of SSA in 2000-01 till 31.03.2017, 3.64 lakh new elementary schools, construction of 3.11 lakh school buildings and 18.73 lakh additional classrooms, 2.42 lakh drinking water facilities, 10.36 lakh school toilets and 19.46 lakh teacher posts have been sanctioned to States and UTs. Out of this, 3.59 lakh elementary schools have been opened, 2.93 lakh school buildings and 17.76 lakh additional classrooms have been constructed, 2.32 lakh drinking water facilities have been provided, 9.83 lakh school toilets have been constructed and 15.75 lakh teachers have been recruited as on 31st March, 2017.

The implementation of SSA is reviewed twice every year by a Joint Review Mission comprising independent experts and external funding agencies covering States. The Ministry of Human Resource Development convenes periodic meetings with State Education Ministers and Secretaries to review the programme implementation. Educational data on outcomes is collected through a Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) every year. The status of these evaluations and monitoring is placed in the public domain on the Ministry’s website. National Achievement Surveys (NAS) are conducted to check the health of the educational system and to provide information about the learning achievement of students.

The RTE Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down pupil teacher ration (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools. At primary level, the PTR should be 30:1 and at the upper primary level, it should be 35:1. As per UDISE 2015-16, the PTR at national level for elementary schools is 25:1.

The recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers are primarily in the domain of the State Governments and UT Administrations. The Central Government has been consistently pursuing the matter of expeditious recruitment and redeployment of teachers with the States and UTs at various fora. Advisories on this issue have also been issued to States and UTs from time to time.

As per an independent survey commissioned in 2014 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, 60.64 lakh children were estimated to be out of school in the age group of 6 to 13.

Universal enrolment is the first goal of SSA, and hence all efforts are being made to bring all children in schools. SSA has provided 2.06 lakh primary and 1.61 lakh upper primary schools for ensuring universal provisioning of schooling facilities. Preference for opening of school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and minority population. In addition, 3729 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, which are residential schools for girls at upper primary level, have also been sanctioned to the States for improving access to marginalised girls particularly out of school, either drop out or never enrolled.

Under SSA, provisions have also been made for residential schools/hostels and transportation/escort facility for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection. Special training is also provided to all such children who are school dropouts and long absentees and they are enrolled in “back to school” camps.

Additionally, other strategies adopted under SSA such as strengthening school infrastructure, improving pupil-teacher ratios, providing incentives like free textbooks, uniforms for eligible category of children and mid-day meal in schools have proved to be useful in increasing the enrolment of children in elementary schools.

                The cooking cost which includes the cost of vegetables, pulses, oil, condiments & fuel is being upwardly revised annually since 01.04.2010. The cooking cost has been enhanced by 7% w.e.f. 01.07.2016 and it now stands at Rs.4.13 and Rs.6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary stages respectively. Besides the above, the Central Government provides 100% funding for foodgrains, transport assistance, kitchen devices and Management/Monitoring Expenses. Several State/UT Governments are also contributing additional funds over and above their minimum mandatory share under Mid Day Meal Scheme.  Food grains under mid day meal scheme are provided through Food Corporation of India (FCI) to States/UTs at rates under National Food Security Act i.e Rs. 2 and Rs. 3 per kg for wheat and Rice respectively.  The economic cost of wheat is Rs. 23.45 per kg and that of rice is Rs. 32.67 per kg.

The Central Government has notified the Mid Day Meal Rules, 2015 in September, 2015 under the National Food Security Act, 2013.  These Rules, inter-alia, provide that hot cooked meal provided to children shall be evaluated and certified by the Government Food Research Laboratory or any other laboratory accredited or recognized by law so as to ensure that the meal meets with the prescribed nutritional standards and quality.  The samples are to be collected at least once in a month from randomly selected schools or centralized kitchens for testing by such laboratories.

The Mid Day Meal Guidelines prescribe the following nutritional content and calorie count to achieve the objectives of the Scheme in the mid day meal:

                The University Grants Commission (UGC) was established in 1956 under the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) was established in 1987 under the All India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987. These two institutions have been created to achieve two distinct objectives in the sphere of higher education. While the objective of the UGC is to promote and co-ordinate University education and to determine and maintain standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities, the AICTE aims at ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical and management education and maintenance of standards.

The idea of establishing a single regulator for higher education is not new. Various committees on higher education have earlier recommended a single regulatory body. While National Knowledge Commission (2006) recommended an independent regulatory authority for higher education, the Committee on Renovation and Rejuvenation of Higher Education (Professor Yashpal Committee: 2009) advocated an apex regulatory body by converging multiple regulatory agencies in the field of higher education. Further, the University Grants Commission Review Committee (Prof. Hari Gautam Committee) in 2014 had recommended that the UGC should be replaced by an apex institution titled National Higher Education Authority.

However, no such proposal is under consideration at present, to merge the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) into a single higher education regulator.

                The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducts periodic national surveys of learning achievement of children in classes III, V, VIII and X. Four rounds of National Achievement Survey (NAS) for class V, three rounds for classes III and VIII and one round for class X, have been conducted so far. These surveys reveal improvement in learning achievement levels of pupils, in identified subjects from first round to fourth round.

As per results of third round of National Achievement Survey (NAS) in class-III 73% children achieved above 50% in language and 76% children achieved more than 50% in Maths. In class-V 36% children achieved more than 50% in language and 37% children achieved more than 50% in Mathematics. In class VIII the achievement in Maths was low as only 14% children could achieve more than 50% marks. In science similar positions persisted as only 17 % children could answer more than 50% questions correctly. In class X the 16% children achieved more than 50% marks in maths and in science 22% children achieved more than 50% scores.

From current year onwards, Government has decided to conduct Survey of Learning Outcomes as National Achievement Survey with district as the sampling unit. The Survey will assess the competencies developed in the students studying in grades III, V and VIII in government and government aided schools.

In order to focus on quality of education, the Central Rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise and subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary level have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for States and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level. The students learning assessment will be according to the Learning Outcomes developed by NCERT.

                A total sum of Rs. 23,500 crore has been provided for SSA for the year 2017-18 at Budget Estimate stage against the Ministry’s estimated resource demand of Rs. 55,000 crore.

Under the SSA programme, budgetary support, as per the existing funds sharing pattern, is provided towards implementation of the different components of the Scheme including the payment of teachers’ salaries etc. Further, Section 7(1) of the RTE Act, 2009, States that both the Centre and the State shall have concurrent responsibility for providing funds for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 7(3) states that the Central Government shall provide to the State Government, as grants-in-aid of revenues, such percentage of expenditure as it may determine, while, Section 7(5) states that the State Government shall, taking into consideration the sums provided by the Central Government to a State Government, be responsible to provide funds for the implementation of the provisions of the Act.

With the acceptance of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission by the Government of India, the devolution of funds to the States has been increased from 32% to 42 % of the net Union Tax Receipts. With the enhanced devolution of funds, States may consider allocating more funds to SSA so as to carry out the functions and responsibilities conferred upon the States by Section 7(5) of the RTE Act, 2009.

It is, therefore, clear that the responsibility for meeting the fund requirement vests with both the Centre and the States.

Shri Upendra Kushwaha, Minister of State, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a NCERT’s Web portal for supply of textbooks to schools and individuals in New Delhi today. The portal will ensure better distribution of textbooks across the country and will also address the apprehensions, on the part of schools and parents, regarding unavailability of NCERT textbooks.  The schools will be able to log on to the portal, by entering their respective Boards’ affiliation numbers and other details, till 8th September 2017 for placing their orders for the session 2018-19. The Web Portal can be accessed atwww.ncertbooks.ncert.gov.in.

At the time of placing the orders, the schools are not required to make the payment; the payment can be made just before the supply. The schools will also have the option of directly procuring textbooks either from their nearest NCERT vendors or from the Regional Production-cum-Distribution Centres (RPDCs) of the NCERT’s located at Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Guwahati, and Bengaluru.

Very soon the portal will also be opened to the individual buyers. They can place their orders by login in onto the portal, and books will be delivered at their doorsteps with nominal postal charges. The portal will also enable the buyers to track the status of their respective orders placed with NCERT. The textbooks will also continue to be sold at the Retail Sales Counters located at the NCERT’s headquarters in Delhi; at its Regional Institutes of Education (RIEs) Ajmer, Bhopal Bhubaneswar, Shillong, and Mysuru; and at its Regional Production-cum-Distribution Centres (RPDCs) based in Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Guwahati and Bengaluru.

The NCERT textbooks can also be downloaded, free of cost, from the NCERT’s website www.ncert.nic.in; one can access the digital versions of NCERT’s textbook by logging onto ‘epathshala’ or through mobile applications. NCERT also gives copyrights to different States/Union Territories for printing of its textbooks. Fifteen States and UTs have been given copyright for the session 2017-18.

 

Shri Anil Swarup, Secretary, School Education & Literacy, Smt. Rina Ray, Special Secretary School Education & Literacy, Shri R.K. Chaturvedi, Chairman CBSE, Dr. Hrushikesh Senapaty, Director, CBSE were also present on the occasion.

                (a) & (b) : PRATHAM, a non-governmental organization conducted the annual achievement surveys released in the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). It is a household survey, limited to rural areas of the country. The Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development was not associated with this ASER - 2016 survey.

(c) & (d) : The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 lays down the duties of the appropriate Government and the local authority to ensure that good quality elementary education conforming to norms and standards is provided, curriculum and courses of study are prescribed in a timely manner, and teachers are trained. In order to focus on quality education, the Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for States and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level.

Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiskha Abhiyan (SSA), the State Governments and UT Administrations are supported on several interventions to improve teaching standards, including regular in-service teachers’ training, induction training for newly recruited teachers, training of all untrained teachers to acquire professional qualifications through Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode, recruitment of additional teachers for improving pupil-teacher ratios, academic support for teachers through block and cluster resource centres, continuous and comprehensive evaluation system to equip the teacher to measure pupil performance and provide remedial action wherever required, and teacher and school grants for development of appropriate teaching-learning materials, etc.

                (a) to (c): The University Grants Commission(UGC) has circulated the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 and Amendment Act, 2012 to all Central Educational Institutions directing them to implement reservation provisions for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) including admission of OBC students to these Institutions. UGC has issued instruction to all the grant-in-aid institutions funded by the Central Government, except minority Institutions under Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India to implement 27% reservation for OBCs.

As per the information available with the Ministry, during 2015-16, 22 out of 40 Central Universities have successfully achieved the prescribed percentage of student intake from OBC Community. Some of the universities like Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Milia University and some like Mizoram University, Nagaland University, North Eastern Hill University could not achieve the prescribed percentage as these were either minority institutions or were situated in Tribal dominated areas where less OBC students apply for admissions. All Indian Institutes of Technology/National Institutes of Technology/Indian Institutes of Information Technology achieved the stipulated 27 % intake of OBC students. Further, 13 Indian Institutes of Management out of 19 and 22 out of 31 National Institutes of Technology recorded more than the stipulated 27% student intake.

The Government of India and UGC has been continuously monitoring the progress of implementation of Reservation policy for OBCs in admission to courses at all level in Universities/Institutions.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development through UGC instructs Universities/Institutions to furnish periodic reports on the implementation of reservation guidelines for OBCs for admissions to courses at all level and Hostel accommodation for students.

UGC has a dedicated SC/ST/OBC section which monitors effective implementation of the Reservation Policy for all communities including OBCs in admission and recruitment to various posts in universities and colleges.

                In order to focus on quality education, the Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20 th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for States and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level. 

The students learning assessment will be according to the Learning Outcomes developed by NCERT. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducts periodic national surveys of learning achievement of children in classes III, V and VIII and X. Four rounds of National Achievement Survey (NAS) have been conducted so far for class V and three rounds for classes III & VIII. These reveal improvement in learning achievement levels of pupils, in identified subjects from first round to fourth round. From current year onwards, Government has decided to conduct National Achievement Survey where district will be the sampling unit. The students learning assessment will be according to the Learning Outcomes developed by NCERT. Under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiskha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), the State Governments and UT Administrations are supported on several interventions to improve teaching standards, including regular in-service teachers’ training, induction training for newly recruited teachers, recruitment of additional teachers for improving pupil-teacher ratio, academic support for teachers through block and cluster resource centres, Maths and Science kits, Lab equipment, special teaching for learning enhancement, ICT facilities in schools, introduction of vocational education component at the secondary level and activities under ‘Unnati’ project for improvement in English language skills Additionally, the Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme of SSA namely ‘Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat’ (PBBB) in classes I and II. Further, the Government has launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, inter alia, as a subcomponent of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

                (a) : To ensure quality education to be imparted in All India Council for Technical Education(AICTE) approved institutions, AICTE has set norms and standards to regulate the technical education by way of grant of approval for conducting courses and renewal of the same. In consonance with the provision of the University Grant Commission(UGC) (Establishment of and Maintenance of Standards in Private Universities) Regulations, 2003, the UGC has already conducted on the spot inspection of 159 out of 278 Private Universities to assess whether the Private Universities are fulfilling the minimum criteria in terms of programmes, faculty, infrastructural facilities, financial viability, etc., as laid down from time to time by the UGC and other concerned statutory bodies/councils. Copy of the UGC visiting committee report is sent to the concerned Private University to submit compliance in respect of the suggestions given by the UGC Committee. The report of the visiting committee alongwith the compliance submitted by the University is placed before a Committee of the Members of the Commission for consideration. The recommendations of this Committee are placed before the Commission to take final decision in the matter. As such, UGC is taking all the necessary steps to ensure quality of education in Universities. 

(b) : There is not a single Indian educational institution in the top 20 world class institutions, as per various world rankings. To increase investments in the infrastructure of higher educational institutions, the Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) has been set up with an initial capital base of Rs. 300 crores. The HEFA has been incorporated as a Section 8 Company under the Company Act, 2013 and would mobilize debt/Bond funds from the market to finance improvement in infrastructure and research facilities in the higher educational institutions. The loans would be serviced through the internal accruals of the institutions.

On this occasion, Prof D P Singh, Director, NAAC emphasized the need for holistic education which brings a harmonious balance between modern knowledge and ancient wisdom so that education becomes an effective tool to connect individuals at social, national and global levels.

In his address, Prof M K Sridhar, Member, Committee to Draft National Education Policy, 2017 gave a brief outline on the mandate of the committee. He further noted that considering the perspectives and suggestions of all the stakeholders, the committee intends to submit the report by the end of the year.

These rights are over 75000 sq. km of area in international waters allocated by International Seabed Authority for developmental activities for polymetallic nodules. The estimated polymetallic nodule resource potential is 380 million tonnes, containing 4.7 million tonnes of nickel, 4.29 million tonnes of copper and 0.55 million tonnes of cobalt and 92.59 million tonnes of manganese. This has been approved unanimously in the 23rd session of International Seabed Authority (ISA) concluded on August 18, 2017 at Kingston, Jamaica. 

India is the first country to have received the status of a pioneer investor in 1987 and was allocated an exclusive area in Central Indian Ocean Basin by United Nations (UN) for exploration and utilization of nodules. India is one among the top 8-countries/ contractors and is implementing a long–term programme on exploration and utilization of Polymetallic Nodules through Ministry of Earth Sciences. This includes survey and exploration, environmental studies, technology development in mining and extractive metallurgy, in which significant contributions have been made. 

While, the extraction of metals from the polymetallic nodules lying at the deep ocean floor is not yet found to be economically viable at this stage, an area of about 7860 square km has been identified in the CIOB for the First Generation Mine Site on the basis of detailed surveys and analysis. Environmental studies for mining of deep-sea polymetallic nodules were also carried out to evaluate the possible impacts of mining on deep-sea environment. 

A Remotely Operable Submersible (ROSUB 6000), capable of operating at 6000 m water depth was also developed and tested successfully at a depth of 5289 m. A remotely operable in-situ soil testing equipment was also developed for obtaining detailed geotechnical properties of the mining area at CIOB and tested successfully at 5462 m water depth. 

A mining system is under development which has been tested for 500m water depth. Metallurgical process routes for extracting copper, nickel and cobalt from polymetallic nodules have been developed and tested in a demonstration pilot plant set up on semi-continuous basis at Hindustan Zinc Limited, Udaipur with a capacity to process 500 kg nodules per day. 

International Seabed Authority (ISA) is a UN body set up to regulate the exploration and exploitation of marine non-living resources of oceans in international waters. India actively contributes to the work of International Seabed Authority. Last year, India was re-elected as a member of Council of ISA. India’s nominees on Legal and Technical Commission and Finance Committee of the ISA were also elected last year.

The mandate of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is to provide services for weather, climate, ocean and coastal state, hydrology, seismology and natural hazards; to explore marine living and nonliving resources in a sustainable way and to explore the three polar regions (Arctic, Antarctic and Himalayas). To achieve this mandate, the research & development and operational activities of MoES are carried out under the following five major programs:

 

1.    Atmosphere and Climate Research – Modelling, Observing Systems and Services (ACROSS).

2.    Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources, Modelling and Science (OSTORMS).

3.    Polar and Cryosphere Research (PACER).

4.    Seismology and Geosciences (SAGE).

5.    Research, Education, Outreach and Training (REACHOUT).

 

The progress and details of these schemes during the above period are as follows:

Better quality and high resolution digital data from INSAT-3D satellite and other satellites.  Establishment of High Performance Computing System with 1.2 Petaflop speed to meet the modelling requirements.

·         Under the National Monsoon Mission, a high resolution global deterministic weather prediction model has been commissioned for generating operational weather forecasts at a horizontal resolution of 12 km. With this, MoES has attained the same capability as in USA in using high resolution weather prediction models. Many major improvements have been made in data assimilation for the ingestion of data from the Indian and International satellites in numerical models.

·         Development of first version of Earth System Model (ESM) with good fidelity in simulating the present climate and its variability. The ESM will be the first climate model from India to contribute to the forthcoming sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change assessment process. 

·         Expansion of Agro-meteorological Advisory Services. Presently around 21.6 million farmers are directly benefitted by this service.

·         Noteworthy improvement was made in track and intensity forecast of the tropical cyclones (24 hour forecast error in track prediction reduced from 141 km to 97 km and Landfall error from 99 km to 56 km during 2006 to 2015). Accurate forecasts of the recent cyclones, Phailin, HudHud and Vardah saved thousands of human lives.

·         Noticeable improvements achieved in skills of Heavy Rainfall Forecasts (False Alarm Rate reduced from 46% to 11% and Probability of Detection increased from 49% to 67% from 2002 to 2015).  For the first time in 2016, forecasts on different time scales during the hot weather season (April to May) including heat waves were issued by the India Meteorological Department.

·         Many observational campaigns have been taken up as special atmospheric observations help us to understand model deficiencies and to improve the models. A large-scale joint India UK observational campaign was carried out during the period June-July 2016, which involved the deployment of UK’s BAe-146- 301 atmospheric research aircraft with sophisticated scientific instruments and India’s Sagar Nidhi and Sindhu Sadhna research ships.

 

An observational campaign to understand different physical features of Fog and factors responsible for its genesis, intensity and duration was initiated during December 2016 at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and at Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi. These observations will be useful for improving model forecasts.

·         A High Altitude Cloud Physics Laboratory with a complete range of the observational system has been set-up at Mahabaleshwar and Munnar to study the interaction of clouds with other environmental parameters through continuous observations inside the clouds at high altitude.

·         The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) system has been developed and deployed at Delhi, Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad and an Air Quality Forecasting Model has been set up for four cities to forecast the air quality of various pollutants along with weather parameters with a lead time of 1-3 days.

 

(ii) OSTORMS

·         The Ocean State Forecast service has been extended for neighbouring countries, Seychelles and Sri Lanka for providing 3- day forecasts on winds, waves, currents, temperature. 

·         Launching of International Indian Ocean Expedition-2 (IIOE-2) towards promotion of ocean science in the Indian Ocean Region. 

·         Operationalization of International Training Centre for Operational Oceanography at Hyderabad.

·         The Search and Rescue Aid Tool (SARAT) was dedicated to the Nation It was used to provide Search and Rescue support to all the concerned in connection with the missing AN 32 aircraft, which was reportedly missing off Chennai on 22 July 2016. 

·         The online oil spill advisory module has been further updated to facilitate the indication of eco-sensitive zones, potential fishing zones, fishing avoidance zone during the event of oil spill. 

·         Deployment of Arctic Ocean Observing system was completed. 

·         Indigenously developed 500 m depth rated shallow water/Polar Remotely Operated Vehicle (PROVe). It was successfully deployed in the Andaman coral Islands and the vehicle was successfully manoeuvred in the undulating reef terrain to record high quality underwater visuals of coral reef biodiversity with spectral irradiance. 

 

·         Developed backward bent ducted buoy to generate power from sea waves, drifter buoy, deep ocean bottom pressure recorder, and autonomous passive acoustic monitoring system.

·         Beach nourishment technique was demonstrated at Pondicherry coast leading to gain of 60 m wide beach.

·         65% of deep water topographic surveys of Exclusive Economic Zone beyond 500 m water depth were completed.

·         MoES signed a 15-year contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA), for exploration of PolyMetallic Sulphides (PMS) in Indian Ocean.

·         India became a member of the International Energy Agency Ocean Energy Systems (IEA-OES) through signing of the Implementing Agreement. By becoming a member of the IEAOES, India will have access to advanced R&D teams and technologies across the world.

 

(iii) PACER 

 

·         Established a high altitude research station in Himalaya called HIMANSH at a remote region in Spiti, Himachal Pradesh.

·         Deployed India’s first multi-sensor moored sub-surface observatory (IndARC) at a water depth of ~180 m in the Arctic. 

·         India successfully commenced operations at the 3rd Indian Permanent Research Station Bharati, at Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica.  Three (34th, 35th and 36th) Indian Scientific expeditions to Antarctica were launched and executed successfully.

·         India has been accorded the Observer status in the Arctic Council in recognition of her scientific contributions endeavors in Polar research.

·         Research studies were carried out on variability of Cryosphere using remote sensed data, southern Indian Ocean and past climate and oceanic variability of Polar Regions.

 

(iv) SAGE 

·         Setting up of the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) at New Delhi to provide added thrust to seismological services in the country.

·         Strengthening of the Seismic Observational Network: NCS now has 84 national observatories with real time data streaming through VSAT connectivity.

·         VSAT communication facilities to additional 50 seismic stations as well as 30 GPS stations in the country under the Indian Seismic and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Network (ISGN). With the current seismic network, and data centers, an earthquake of M>3 anywhere in the country can be located in 3-5 minutes.

 

·         The Scientific Deep Drilling Project at Koyna, Maharashtra started in 2016 with the aim of setting up of borehole observatory at 3.0 to 5.0 km depths for directly measuring parameters in the near field of earthquakes - before, during and after their occurrence. The pilot borehole has reached to a depth of 3 km.

·         Setting up of Multi-Parameter Geophysical Observatories at Ghuttu, in NW Himalaya and Imphal in NE region to monitor various geophysical, geochemical and seismological precursory signals.

·         Launching of a facility for Geochronology with an objective to generate high-quality geo-chronological data and its characterization.

·         For the first time, Deep Sea Drilling in the Laxmi Basin enabled scientists to collect more than 1700m long sediment cores from the Eastern Arabian Sea to understand possible tectono-climatic link.

·         First time successful deployments of Ocean Bottom Seismometers in the Indian Ocean Geoidal Low region to understand possible deep seated sources for remarkable geoid anomaly in the Indian Ocean.

 

(v) REACHOUT 

 

·         Under this program, Ministry has supported 55 focused research projects in the area of Atmospheric Science and Geoscience during the last 3 years and current year.

·         As human resource development and capacity building, the ministry has supported the following:  M.Tech/Ph.D. programme by sponsorship 5 M.Tech and 5 PhD students in Atmospheric-Oceanic Sciences & Technology at IIT Delhi ,  User-oriented M.Tech. programme on Ocean technology at IIT Madras  2 year M.Sc. course in Ocean & Atmospheric Sciences in University of Hyderabad.

·         Established MoES Chairs at IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Gandhinagar.  Following specialized lab facilities have also been set-up as National Facilities for use by researchers:

 

(a)   Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Measurement facility for 14C at Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi.

(b)   Laser Heating Diamond Anvil Cell at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata.

(c)   Laser Raman Spectrometer at National Center for Earth Science Studies (NCESS), Trivandrum. 

·         Three Earth Science and Technology Cells (ESTC) have been established in various universities for conducting research in different specialized areas of marine and atmospheric sciences during the last 3 years as follows:

 

·         Marine Coastal Ecology of west Coast of India at M.K. Bhavnagar University.

·         Satellite Meteorology at SRM University Katanklathur, Chennai (SRMU), Tamilnadu.

·         Coastal and Ocean Technology at NITK, Surathkal, Mangalore, Karnataka Successful international cooperation with different countries for collaborative research and human resources development.

 

The quality of weather services by the Ministry has shown appreciable improvements during the past 3 years. The loss of lives during the last 3 years sue to tropical cyclones has reduced to less than hundred as compared to the thousands during the previous decade. For example, the famous 1999 Super Cyclone in Orissa killed more than 10,000 people while the same intense Phailin claimed only less than 20 people in Orissa. This large reduction in casualties is attributed to substantial improvement in monitoring and prediction of tropical cyclones.

 

MoES for the first time started issuing forecasts for heat waves over the country. The heat wave forecasts issued during the 2016 hot weather season (April to May) were very successful. A few state governments like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra and Odisha have initiated state actions plans based on these forecasts during the hot weather season, which could help them to warn people in advance about the occurrence of heat waves and thus saving their lives.

 

The third party assessment by the National Council if Applied Economic Research (NCAER) on the Agro-meteorological Advisory Services provided by the India Meteorological Department concluded that the annual economic benefit for the farmers cultivating 4 principal crops (Wheat, Rice, Sugarcane and Cotton) was Rs. 42,000 Crore in 2015.

 

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) provides PFZ advisories to 2.75 lakh fisherman on a daily basis to help them to easily locate the areas of abundant fish in the ocean. As per the 2015 report of NCAER, the Fishermen in the country made an annual profit of Rs. 3000 crores from these PFZ advisories and the cumulative economic benefits exceeding Rs. 370000 crores have been accrued from these ocean forecasts.

 

Ocean State Forecasts (forecasts of waves, currents, sea surface temperature, etc.) to fisher folk, shipping industry, oil and natural gas industry. Navy, Coast Guard and other stakeholders have improved considerably during the last 3 years. Oil spill advisories are being provided to facilitate the indication of eco-sensitive zones, potential fishing zones, fishing avoidance zone during the event of oil spill. About 16.5 lakh users are currently receiving the OSF.

 

This information was given by Minister of State for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Shri Y.S.Chowdary in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

A high altitude cloud physics observatory has been established at Munnar (Kerala), in Western Ghats, the region which is gateway for the monsoon of India. 

High altitude cloud physics observatory at Munnar is used to observe cloud and rain processes over that region with state of the art observations. Such facility will enable understanding of rainfall distribution and will allow better characterization of rainfall processes in the numerical models used for prediction of monsoon rainfall. 

It is expected that long term monitoring of cloud and rainfall processes will enable accurate representation of cloud micro-physical process in forecast models to improve over all skill of rainfall prediction for severe weather phenomena viz, heavy rainfall, thunderstorm etc., not only over Kerala but for the whole country. 

An allocation of Rs. 10 Crore has been made for the establishment of the laboratory. 

High altitude cloud physics laboratories are functional at Mahabaleshwar (Konkan) and Munnar (Kerala) to study the monsoon cloud microphysics process modulated by the Western Ghats only and hence no such additional facility are contemplated. 

Studies were undertaken in four climate sensitive regions of the country, viz. Himalayan Region, Western Ghats, North Eastern Region and Coastal Areas to assess the possible impacts on the four sectors viz. agriculture, water, forests and health and associated ecosystem.

                The following is the text of the address of the Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, at the Business and Climate Summit (BCS) 2017 here today:

             “I am delighted to speak on this occasion of the Business and Climate Summit (BCS) 2017.  I am glad that the Summit has brought together businesses, investors and policymakers to mobilise the business community in support of climate action.

            The world came together in 2015 and agreed upon the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It came into force in November 2016 and till date, 160 Parties have ratified the agreement.  India as a party to the Paris Agreement is committed towards its successful implementation. 

             It is also however, critical and necessary that equal focus is given to Pre-2020 actions by developed countries under Kyoto Protocol and that they fulfil their commitments of providing effective finance, technology transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries.

             In order to strengthen Pre-2020 actions and close the emission gap, we also need to agree on a timeline for early ratification of the Second Commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  India deposited its instrument of acceptance of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol on August 8, 2017.  UNFCCC should endeavour to promote developed country parties in fulfilling their commitments in the Pre-2020 period.

             One of the key features of Paris Agreement is ‘Nationally Determined Contributions’.  India submitted its NDCs in 2015.  It includes 8 goals, 3 of which are quantitative, including reducing the emissions intensity of our GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level; achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 and creating an additional sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.  The other five goals pertain to healthy and sustainable lifestyle, climate friendly and clean path to economic development, building capacities on climate technology and mobilise domestic and new additional funds.

             We are now working on developing a roadmap for implementation of our NDC and have constituted an Implementation committee and six thematic Sub-committees involving key Ministries and Departments.

             To achieve the goals, Government of India is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which encompasses eight national missions representing multipronged, long-term and integrated strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.  The broad policy initiatives of the government are supplemented by actions of the State Governments through their State Action Plan on Climate Change.  Key sectors covered by SAPCCs include agriculture, water, habitat, forestry, health and disaster management among others. 

             Government of India has set an ambitious target of 175 GW renewable power installed capacity by the end of 2022 and we have already achieved 58.3 GW of renewable energy installed capacity so far.

             There are a number of other initiatives including distribution of energy efficient appliances where we have distributed about 23.39 crores LED lights; Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana to provide free clean cooking gas connections to women below poverty line where more than 2.8 crore  LPG connections have been released.

             Through our missions like AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission, we are transforming our cities to make them efficient and climate resilient. 

             Government of India is also implementing its own National Adaptation Fund with a corpus of Rs. 350 crore.

             However, with the responsibility of lifting around 360 million people out of poverty and raising the standard of living of an even greater number of people, technology is one of the powerful solutions for countries like India that can simultaneously address climate change and our development needs.

             At the international level, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, India launched the International Solar Alliance (ISA) jointly with Government of France.  It provides a common platform where global community including bilateral and multilateral organisations, corporates, industry and stakeholders can make a positive contribution to the common goals of increasing utilisation of solar energy in meeting energy needs of ISA member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.  So far, 36 countries have signed the ISA and 7 countries have ratified it.

             Private sector is an integral part of India’s action on climate change as well.  Private sector has embarked on a number of voluntary actions.  The Indian industry has participated in voluntary carbon disclosure programmes whereby they report their carbon management strategy and GHG emissions.

             India is also planning to establish a voluntary carbon market with World Bank assistance with focus on uncovered areas.

             Going forward, as political leaders and representatives of the people, we have major role and responsibilities towards the citizens of our country and the globe and a duty to think long-term.  We should listen to the voice of science seriously and act accordingly to safeguard our people against the risks posed by climate change. 

             Sustainability has been a way of life in India for centuries.   Indian ethos and values promulgate simple living, respect for life and reverence of nature.  Irresponsible pursuit of extravagant lifestyle is slowly eroding traditional values and as a result, minimalist lifestyle, has started to ebb from people’s way of life. 

             Access to clean air, water and a liveable climate are inalienable human rights.  And solving this crisis is just not a question of politics. It is our moral obligation.  We have only one planet and humankind must become accountable on a massive scale for the wanton destruction of our collective home.  Protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species. 

             The global nature of climate change calls for a collective response.  India has been engaging actively in multilateral negotiations under the UNFCCC, in a positive, constructive and forward-looking manner to establish an effective cooperation and equitable global approach, based on the principles of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities & Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) enshrined in the Convention and the Paris Agreement. 

             As we move forward in our work on implementation of Paris Agreement, we believe that the incoming COP 23 Presidency of Fiji and UNFCCC Secretariat will host a successful meeting with an outcome, which is agreed upon by all Parties.”

                Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr.  Harsh Vardhan, launched the “Harit Diwali, Swasth Diwali” campaign, here today.  Addressing a gathering of about 800 children from schools of Delhi and NCR, the Minister impressed upon the children the importance of their contribution towards reducing pollution by not bursting harmful fire crackers during Diwali.  Congratulating the teachers and students, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that it is heartening to see that children have taken on the leadership role in combating air and noise pollution caused by burning of fire crackers during Diwali celebrations.  The Minister added that whenever children take up any task, they do not spare any effort in ensuring its success.  He urged the children to also learn about the chemicals present in the fire crackers and the impact of these chemicals on various parts of the human body.    Dr. Harsh Vardhan impressed upon the children to celebrate this year’s Diwali by not buying fire crackers and instead buy a gift, food items, or sweets for the poor and underprivileged children living in their locality.

Later, Dr. Harsh Vardhan also administered a Pledge for a Green and Healthy Diwali to the gathering of students.  The Pledge will be widely circulated to the schools/colleges and other educational institutions and the school administration will be requested to administer the said Pledge during their school assembly up to Diwali.  Students presented ‘Nukkad Nataks’ (street plays) and also sang “Prakriti Vandana” on the occasion. 

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha expressed the hope that the message of celebrating “Harit & Swasth Diwali” will be taken across the country.  Shri Jha asked the children to buy earthen lamps and other such environment-friendly products.

As a part of the campaign, the Environment Ministry will undertake various activities to create awareness among various stakeholders and encourage people to participate in combating air pollution.

Diwali is an integral part of our rich tradition and a festival that embodies joy and happiness.  In recent times, the pattern of celebration has changed somewhat and has got associated with excessive bursting of crackers, which contributes significantly to air and noise pollution.  As a result, there has been a significant impact on the environment and health of the people. 

As has been the experience in the past few years, airborne pollution has been rising above safe limits during winter in many cities.  The excessive burning of crackers during Diwali aggravates the problem.  The pollution levels in Delhi last year, especially post Diwali, reached such levels that the government had to declare an emergency situation, which had socio-economic consequences like closing down of schools, construction sites and power stations. 

In October this year, India will be hosting FIFA U-17 World Cup. It is an important occasion and a matter for pride for India.  It is important for us to ensure that there is no inconvenience caused in the conduct of the event and our national image is protected and enhanced.

Some of the activities to promote Green Diwali among school children include stickers/logo distribution, poster competition, advertisement on public transport systems, public appeal using Radio/FM, involving industry associations and other stakeholders.  As a part of the social media campaign, an online competition will be conducted, where any individual/organisation can make a video/audio clip on the theme ‘Pollution Free Diwali’.  The best of these clips will be used officially to promote the theme across the country. 

Additional Secretaries, MoEF&CC, Shri Anil Kumar Jain and Shri A.K Mehta, besides senior officers and officials of Environment Ministry were among those present in the gathering.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the closure of Andaman & Nicobar Islands Forest and Plantation Development Corporation Limited (ANIFPDCL), Port Blair, a Central Government Undertaking and discharging the liabilities of all the employees.

The closure will help to stop unproductive loans to ANIFPDCL from Gol and would enable a more productive utilization of assets.

This would be achieved by offering Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) / Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) package to willing employees and by retrenchment under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 of those not opting for VRS/VSS including settlement of other liabilities, if any.

At present, there are 836 employees on the rolls of the Corporation.

The closure will be done by infusing funds in the following manner:

• Infusion of funds of Rs. 125.72 crore through budgetary support from Gol for funding VSS of all employees on 2007 notional pay scales and for discharging other liabilities.

• Write-off of Gol loans of Rs. 186.83 crore given to ANIFPDCL and accrued interest of Rs 185.18 crore with freezing of interest as on 31.03.2017 after closure of the Corporation.

• Auction of movable assets (Plant & machinery, electrical equipment, vehicles & office equipment, furniture & fixture, elephant & livestock, plantation & other inventories etc.) of ANIFPDCL through Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd. (MSTC Ltd),

• Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) will transfer/sale of immovable assets i.e. land and /or buildings of ANIFPDCL through NBCC Ltd.

Background:

The ANIFPDCL, a Government of India Public Sector Undertaking was set up in 1977, with the objective of development and managing forestry plantations in the Islands. The ANIFPDCL has been operating three main projects viz., Forestry Project, Red Oil Palm Project (ROP) and Katchal Rubber Project (KRP). The forestry operations were the main activities of the Corporation and contributed around 75% of the total revenue. Due to suspension of the forestry activities in view of the order dated 10.10,2001 and 07.05.2002 of Supreme Court, the ANIFPDCL has become an overall loss making venture since 2001 onwards. As a result, the ANIFPDCL was not able to pay salary and wages to its employees. In order to ensure disbursement of salary to the employees of tine Corporation, and other statutory payments, the GoI provided financial assistance to the ANIFPDCL in the form of interest bearing loan.

During the last fifteen years, various committees were appointed and professional agencies were engaged by the Ministry from time to time and they have thoroughly examined all possible avenues that could be availed for revival of the forest Corporation, including right sizing the staff. Based on those decisions, several proposals were examined, but none of them fructified. After thorough examination, Government of India decided to close down the Corporation.

                Union Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, launched ‘Gaj Yatra’ here today, a nationwide campaign to protect elephants on the occasion of World Elephant Day. The campaign is planned to cover 12 elephant range states.

Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Dr. Vardhan urged the people to prepare a strategy for a more even distribution of the elephant population in all the states of the country. The Minister emphasised that an attempt must be made to bring to an end the chapter of man-animal conflict. He added that a war must be waged against poachers and hunters who harm elephants and other wildlife. Calling for proactive, innovative and out-of-the-box ideas, Dr. Vardhan said that efforts for elephant conservation must bring about a qualitative improvement by the next World Elephant Day.

Dr. Vardhan pointed to the need to broad-base the movement for conservation of elephants and to involve people from all walks of life in the conservation of elephants and other wildlife. He emphasised the immense energy and potential of children in making such movements successful, as was the case with the anti-Polio campaign. The Minister said that an effort would be made to install the models of elephants being carved out from waste material at prominent public places like Parliament, Rashtrapati Bhawan and at the Ministry’s premises in Indira Paryavaran Bhawan.

The Environment Minister released the All India Census 2017 Report on elephants as also the Agreed Points of Action on Trans-Boundary Conservation of Elephants by India and Bangladesh and a document titled ‘Right of Passage’ on elephant corridors in India. A compilation, ‘Glimpses of Initiatives Taken for Elephant Conservation in India (2012-2017) based on Parliamentary Questions and Replies’ by ENVIS Centre, WWF-India and the Project Elephant Division, MoEF&CC, was also released. The publication covers the concerned environmental issues in the form of a compact disc, which can serve as a ready reference source for scientists, policy-makers, technocrats and others concerned with the cause of conservation and sustainable development. Later, Dr. Vardhan administered a pledge on elephant conservation to the children present on the occasion.

The Director-General Forest and Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri Siddhanta Das, Director, Project Elephant, Shri R.K Shrivastav, Director, Wildlife Trust of India, Shri Vivek Menon and Prof R. Sukumar also addressed the gathering.

During the period of the campaign, artists and craftsmen will create life-size works on the theme of elephants in places along the route of the roadshow, covering 12 states that have wild elephants, using local art and craft. Specially fabricated vehicles will be deployed to display these on pre-determined routes with campaigners. The ‘Gaju’ mascot, which was released by the Ministry in 2012, will be helm the campaign. The campaign will be led by the Wildlife Trust of India.

Actor and wildlife enthusiast, Ms. Dia Mirza, participated in the walk and run event organised on the occasion along with the children.

WORLD ELEPHANT DAY: BRIEF BACKGROUND

World Elephant Day is an annual global event celebrated across the world on August 12, dedicated to the preservation and protection of elephants. The goal of World Elephant Day is to create awareness about the plight of elephants and to share knowledge and positive solutions for the better care and management of captive and wild elephants. African elephants are listed as “vulnerable” and Asian elephants as “endangered” in the IUCN Red List of threatened species. As per the available population estimates, there are about 400,000 African elephants and 40,000 Asian elephants.

World Elephant Day is celebrated to focus the attention of various stakeholders in supporting various conservation policies to help protect elephants, including improving enforcement policies to prevent illegal poaching and trade in ivory, conserving elephant habitats, providing better treatment for captive elephants and reintroducing captive elephants into sanctuaries. The elephant is part of India’s animal heritage and the Government celebrates this day to spread awareness about the conservation of the species.

Though a nation-wide population census exercise for elephants is conducted every five years, this is the first time than an all-India synchronised elephant census was carried out one year in advance, to avoid errors in estimation arising from the significant movement of elephants across different states. The field operations of the census were completed in May 2017 and data has been compiled on direct count, indirect count (dung count), waterhole and salt lick observations. Elephant distribution mapping has also been done.

World Elephant Day was conceived in 2011 by Canadian filmmakers Ms. Patricia Sims and Mr. Michael Clark of Canazwest Pictures and the Secretary- General of the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation of Thailand, Sivaporn Dardarananda. It was officially funded, supported and launched by Ms. Sims and the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation on August 12, 2012. Since then, Ms. Sims continues to lead and direct World Elephant Day, which is now supported by over 65 wildlife organisations and many individuals in several countries across the globe.

“Biosphere Reserve (BR) is an international designation by UNESCO for representative parts of natural and cultural landscapes extending over large area of terrestrial or coastal/ marine ecosystems or a combination thereof. BRs are designated to deal with one of the most important questions of reconciling the conservation of biodiversity, the quest for economic and social development and maintenance of associated cultural values. BRs are thus special environments for both people and the nature and are living examples of how human beings and nature can co-exist while respecting each other’s needs.

There are 18 Biosphere Reserves in the country. List of Biosphere Reserves is given in the Annexure.

The Biosphere Reserve Programme is guided by UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme as India is a signatory to the landscape approach supported by MAB programme.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Myanmar for the conservation of earthquake-damaged pagodas at Bagan, Myanmar. The MoU will be signed during the visit of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Myanmar during 6-7 September 2017.

Implementation of the project will further strengthen India’s enduring ties in culture and religion with Myanmar. It will also generate immense goodwill for India among the people of Myanmar due to the religious significance as well as the touristic significance of the project. It will also contribute to India’s development partnership with Myanmar. Bagan is one of the premier tourist attractions of Myanmar. It will be an opportunity to showcase India’s expertise in the restoration and conservation of monuments not only to the people of Myanmar but also to the tourists from other countries.

                The Government has brought about a transformational change in its engagement with the Indian diaspora. The 30 million strong Overseas Indian community is an invaluable partner in the progress of the nation. A successful, prosperous, and influential diaspora is an asset for India.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention, PBD Conferences, Regional PBDs, Youth PBD, Know India Programme, Scholarship Programme for Diaspora Children, Bharat Ko Jaaniye Quiz are some of the important programmes undertaken by the Government to strengthen diaspora’s connect and engagement with India. The Government’s efforts are also aimed at harnessing the diaspora potential to its fullest including through investments, philanthropy and transfer of knowledge and expertise.

Ongoing economic reforms and flagship programmes viz Swachh Bharat Mission, National Mission for Clean Ganga, Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, Stand up India provide an enabling environment to our youth. The Government is also trying to convert ‘brain drain ‘into ‘brain gain’ by engaging the Indian diaspora in making India strong and self-reliant.

Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) can also avail the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card scheme. As per the provisions of the scheme, OCI card holders under Section 7A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 get multiple life-long entry visa for visiting India and they are exempted from registration in FRRO irrespective of duration of their stay in India.

This information was given by GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD), the Minister of State for External Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                A centralised system of issuing passports called the Passport Seva Project (PSP) is being successfully run in the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode with M/s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as the Service Provider.

There are 92 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and 56 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) functioning as on 29 July, 2017 as extended arms of the 38 Passport Offices (PO) across the country thus providing extended reach to passport applicants in various States/ Union Territories. The Government has decided to open another 180 POPSK and thereafter intends to open POPSK in the Head Post Offices (HPO) in the country in such a manner that there is a PSK available within a radius of 50 km of every HPO. The PSK and the POPSK are rendering passport-related services to the citizens in a timely, transparent, more accessible manner and in a comfortable environment through streamlined processes.

The entire passport issuance process is online. The Passport Portal (www.passportindia.gov.in) is accessible to anyone, anywhere and anytime. The applicants apply for passport service online, pay the passport fee also through the Portal and visit the PSK/ POPSK at the appointed date and time. The presence of the applicant in person at the PSK/ POPSK enables the Passport Issuing Authority to capture their photographs and biometrics. The applicants also get full opportunity to see and affirm their personal particulars to be entered in the passport. Status of applications can be tracked by the applicants through the passport website or through the mPassport Seva mobile application. Periodic SMS messages are sent to the citizens intimating the various stages of the process of passport application including date of police verification and dispatch of passport. In the current system of passport issuance, there is no manual intervention at any stage, and the complete process is digitally flown with re-engineered process through a single visit clearance.

This information was given by GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD), the Minister of State for External Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                The exact numbers of foreign jobs for Indians in foreign countries is not available with the Ministry as many countries do not have policy to share these data with Indian Missions abroad. Indian Mission in the UAE has reported that such information is not shared by the local UAE authorities and hence it cannot be confirmed whether foreign jobs for Indians have come down in the UAE or not. However, the Government maintains the data in respect of Emigration Check Required (ECR) passport holders, travelling legally to any of the 18 ECR countries for overseas employment. The number of such Indian workers emigrating to the UAE over the last 3 years is as follows: 2,24,037 (2014), 2,25,512 (2015) and 1,63,731 (2016). According to the limited information received from Saudi sources, Indian Mission in Saudi Arabia conveyed that there were about 25 lakh Indian workers in Saudi Arabia in 2016.Indian Mission in Bahrain has reported that the number of Indian expatriate workforce in Bahrain, including dependants, has been increasing and the number has grown from 2,53,907 in 2013 to 3,18,731 in 2017, up to July. Indian Mission in Oman has reported that there has been no significant change in the number of Indian workers in Oman despite economic slowdown due to low oil prices. While the number of Indian workers in Oman stood at 5,99,473 in December 2013, it increased to 6,69,882 in December 2015 and stood at 6,89,600 in December 2016. 

In the United States, in April 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled ""Buy American and Hire American” which states that in order to create higher wages and employment rates for workers in the US, and to protect their economic interests, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to rigorously enforce and administer laws governing entry into the United States of workers abroad. The UK Government introduced certain changes to its work visa regime in November 2016 and April 2017, like increasing the salary thresholds and levy of Immigration Health Surcharge and Immigration Skills Charge. In April, 2017, Australia announced phased abolition of 457 visa category for skilled worker, to be replaced with the ‘Temporary Skills Shortage Visas’ programme starting March 2018, providing for a short-term visa for up to two years and medium term visas of up to four years depending on the occupation. As the number of professions in the eligible Occupation List is curtailed, it will impact the number of jobs available under ‘Temporary Skills Shortage Visas’ programme. These changes/proposed changes are not India specific and their impact will be assessed in due course. 

This information was given by GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD), the Minister of State for External Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                The Government of India launched a concerted drive against black money with Demonetisation being an important step in that direction. Among the main objectives of Demonetisation was the flushing out of black money and also conversion of the non-formal economy into a formal economy to expand the tax base. The impact of Demonetisation on black money, widening of tax base and Direct Tax Collections is summed up hereunder:

A.   Impact on black money:

Quantum jump in Enforcement actions based on Demonetisation data:

Searches 

·         158% increase in number of searches (from 447 to 1152 groups)

·         106% increase in seizures (from Rs. 712 crore to Rs.1469 crore)

·         38% increase in admission of undisclosed income (from Rs.11,226 crore to Rs. 1,54,96 crore)

       Surveys

·         183% increase in surveys (from 4422 to 12520)

·         44% increase in undisclosed income detected (from Rs. 9654 crore to Rs. 13920 crore)

Operation Clean Money:

The Income Tax Department launched ‘Operation Clean Money’(OCM) on 31st January, 2017 to analyse the data of the persons who deposited large sums of cash and whose returns of income were not in sync with such deposits.

Phase 1:

·         In the first phase of OCM, 18 lakh suspect cases were identified through use of data analytics where cash transactions did not appear to be in line with the tax profile of depositors.

·         Online verification in these cases was enabled and done in a record time of 4 weeks.

·         The success of the first phase was also attributable to the massive taxpayers’ awareness and media campaigns on Operation Clean Money launched by the Department.

·         The scale of the Operation may be gauged from the fact that response of 9.72 lakh persons in respect of 13.33 lakh accounts involving cash deposits of around Rs.2.89 lakh crore, as per pre-defined parameters on sources of the cash deposits was captured by the Income Tax Department within a short span of 3-4 weeks. Online queries were raised in more than 35000 cases and online verification was completed in more than 7800 cases.

Phase 2:

·         The Operation Clean money has since moved into the next phase that includes enforcement actions in high risk cases, taxpayer engagement through a dedicated website in medium risk cases and close monitoring in low risk cases.

·         The high, medium and low risk cases have been identified through use of advanced data analytics, including integration of data sources, relationship clustering and fund tracking.

·         The exercise has also unearthed large number of persons and clusters having suspect transactions. These include about 14,000 properties of more than Rs.1 crore each where persons have not even filed Income Tax Returns.  The investigations are in progress.

B.   Impact on Widening of Tax-base:

·         The number of e-returns of Individual taxpayers filed till 5th August, 2017 (due date of filing) increased to 2.79 crore from 2.22 crore returns filed during the corresponding period of last year, registering an increase of about 57 lakh returns (25.3%). This shows marked improvement in the level of voluntary compliance as a result of action taken by the Income Tax Department on the basis of data of cash deposits in the wake of demonetization.

·         The total number of all returns (electronic + paper) filed during the entire Financial Year 2016-17 was 5.43 crore which is 17.3% more than the returns filed during FY 2015-16.

·         For FY 2016-17, 1.26 crore new taxpayers (return filers + non-filers making tax payments) were added to the tax base (till 30.06.2017).

C.   Impact on Direct Tax Collections:

The effect of Demonetization is also clearly visible in the growth in Direct Tax Collections. Collection of Advance Tax under Personal Income Tax (i.e. other than Corporate Tax) as on 05.08.2017 showed a growth of about 41.79% over the corresponding period in F.Y. 2016-2017. Collection of Self-Assessment Tax under Personal Income Tax showed a growth of 34.25% over the corresponding period in F.Y. 2016-2017.

At a time when the interest rate on various financial instruments including Savings Bank is declining, Atal Pension Yojana as a pension scheme offers a guaranteed rate of 8% assured return for the subscribers and also the opportunity of higher earnings in case the rate of return is higher than 8% at the time of maturity, after staying invested in the scheme for 20-42 years. Increasing enrolment is attributed to financialisation of assets and driving the people to pension products which has Govt of India implicit guarantee to give an assured pension to the subscriber, spouse and return of corpus to the nominee.

Department of Financial Services in association with Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has been organizing various APY campaigns to give thrust through which the population not covered by any pension scheme is approached by APY Service Provider banks and Department of Posts to inform about the salient features and benefits of the APY scheme and are encouraged to get enrolled in the scheme. PFRDA organised a National Level Pension Mobilization Campaign '' One Nation One Pension’’ from 2nd August to 19th August 2017 in association with the APY Service Provider Banks all over the country. 62 lacs subscribers have become members of the Atal Pension Yojana till date in 2 years after launch of the scheme. 

The objective of PFRDA is to cover the maximum possible population uncovered by any pension scheme under the APY scheme so that India as a nation can move from a pension less to a pensioned society and the citizens can live a life of dignity in their vulnerable years.

In this regard, it is hereby clarified that Section 243 of the Code which provides for repeal of said enactments has not been notified till date and further, provisions related to insolvency resolution and bankruptcy for individuals and partnerships as contained in Part III of the Code are yet to be notified. Hence, it is advised that stakeholders who intend to pursue their insolvency cases may approach appropriate authority/court under the existing enactments, instead of approaching the Debt Recovery Tribunals.

                A seminar on ‘Policy and Regulatory Framework for Algorithm/ High Frequency Trading in India’ was organised in New Delhi today by the Department of Economic Affairs and the National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM). “Fair access and zero tolerance to manipulative practices is what regulations for algo trading shall strive for” said Secretary Economic Affairs, Shri. S.C. Garg in his Key note address. Speaking on the occasion, Chief Guest Shri Ashok Lavasa, Finance Secretary, pointed out that Stock markets in India have matured and induction of technology as enabler is now inescapable to intrinsic issues of trading. He also highlighted that use of technology could effectively reduce the cost of have-nots accessing the market. The Finance Secretary said that setting up of Fin-Cert – the computer emergency response team in the financial sector to address cyber security is also underway.

 

A study report on Algo Trading / High Frequency Trading was released during the Seminar. Copy of the report can be accessed at http://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/NIFM%20Report%20on%20Algo%20trading.pdf.

 

Algorithmic Trading and, particularly, High Frequency Trading and Colocation, are one of the most debated issues impacting the way the securities transactions are being conducted in the world. Speedy execution, accuracy, reduced costs and avoiding the errors of human emotions are some of the reasons for its increasing popularity. At the same time, the development of such technology raises several regulatory challenges, particularly with respect to market manipulation and ensuring equity and integrity of the markets. The seminar was organised in this context. Director NIFM Smt Meena Agrawal welcome the participants to the seminar. Shri Praveen Garg, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance introduced the seminar theme by providing a brief background of the evolution of algorithmic trading in India and highlighting some of the major concerns generated by it.

 

Mr. Muralidhar Rao, Executive Director SEBI informed that SEBI is carrying out simulation exercises to understand the merits and demerits of its proposals unveiled in its Discussion Paper of August 2016, in view of the various public comments received in this regard. SEBI has also setup a panel to evaluate concepts like regulatory sandbox for dealing with the technological challenges posed by algos and fintechs.

 

The panel consisting of Mr. Ashish Chouhan, MD, BSE, Mr. Vikram Limaye, MD, NSE, Mr. Mrugank Paranjape MD, MCX, Mr. Hector Colon, COO, Citadel Securities, Hong Kong, Mr. Nirav Parikh, Global Head, Electronic Trading Citigroup, Singapore and Mr. Tushar Mahajan, Listed F&O, Nomura Securities debated on relative positioning of Indian markets infrastructure vis a vis global markets, comprehensive risk management and surveillance systems already being put in place, aspects of latency which are hurting the system, Fintech evolution and how current Indian capital markets may co-exist, benefit from, and compete with the Fintech firms, efficacy of penalising based on order to trade ratio, unintended consequences of overhauling the micro structure of markets for controlling HFT, need for recognising and rewarding market making etc. The panel focused on the need for having a regulatory framework specific to the Indian ecosystem with clarity on what needs to be achieved rather than what needs to be controlled.

 

The seminar was attended by policy makers, regulators, academicians and leading market participants.

                “Three years ago today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a flagship program: Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) aimed at providing financial services to the poor. These included opening bank accounts for the poor, giving them electronic means of payment (via RUPAY cards), and placing them in a position to avail themselves of credit and insurance. 

The vision underlying it was, of course, much broader: nothing short of ending the financial, and hence economic, digital and social exclusion faced by India’s poor. India’s poor would not only be able to overcome their economic deprivation but they would also become an integral part of the social mainstream. 

Three years on, the achievements have been remarkable along many dimensions. 

1. Total PMJDY accounts opened increased from 12.55 crore in January 2015 to 29.52 crore as of 16th Aug 2017. 

2. The number of rural accounts opened under PMJDY has grown from 7.54 crore in January 2015 to 17.64 crore as of 16th Aug 2017. 

3. No. of RuPay cards issued increased from 11.08 crore in January 2015 to 22.71 crore as of 16th Aug 2017. 

4. The total balance in beneficiary accounts Rs. 65,844.68 crore and the average balance per account increased from Rs. 837 in January 2015 to Rs. 2231 as of 16th Aug 2017. 

5. Zero balance accounts under PMJDY declined from 76.81 % in September 2014 to 21.41 % in August 2017. 

6. As of March 2014, women constituted about 28 per cent of all savings accounts, with 33.69 crore accounts. As of March 2017, according to data from top 40 banks and RRBs, women’s share has risen to about 40 per cent. This includes 14.49 crore accounts opened by women under PMJDY, out of a total of 43.65 crore women’s accounts. This represents a sizeable and rapid growth in financial inclusion of women. 

In addition to financial inclusion, the government has taken steps to provide security to the poor via life insurance under the Pradhan Mantra Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and accident insurance Pradhan Mantra Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY). As on 7th August, 2017, total enrollment was 3.46 crore under the PMJJBY and 10.96 crore under PMSBY. In both schemes, close to 40 percent of the enrollees are women. 

The entire network created by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has also enabled implementation of the Mudra Yojana. As on 18.8.2017, Rs.3.66 lakh crore have been distributed to 8.77 crore beneficiaries. These monies have all gone into their bank accounts. 

But as it turned out, PMJDY and the other schemes were only the first step because in turn they have unleashed the “JAM” revolution. 

JAM, a term coined, and a vision conceptualized, by our Chief Economic Adviser, is nothing short of a social revolution because it has brought together financial inclusion (PMJDY), biometric identification (Aadhaar) and mobile telecommunications. Today, about 52.4 crore unique Aadhaar numbers are linked to 73.62 crore accounts in India. 

As a result, the poor are able to make payments electronically. Every month now, about 7 crore successful payments are made by the poor using their Aadhaar identification. 

Above all, the government now makes direct transfer of Rs. 74,000 crore to the financial accounts of 35 crore beneficiaries annually, at more than Rs. 6,000 crore per month. These transfers are made under various government anti-poverty and support schemes such as PAHAL, MNREGA, old age pensions, student scholarships etc. 

Now with the BHIM app and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), JAM can become fully operational. A secure and seamless digital payments infrastructure has been created so that all Indians, especially the poor can become part of the digital mainstream. 

The JAM social revolution offers substantial benefits for government, the economy and especially the poor. The poor will have access to financial services and be cushioned against life’s major shocks. Government finances will be improved because of the reduced subsidy burden; at the same time, government will also be legitimized and strengthened because it can transfer resources to citizens faster and more reliably and with less leakage. 

Within reach of the country is what might be called the 1 billion-1 billion-1 billion vision. That is 1 billion unique Aadhaar numbers linked to 1 billion bank accounts and 1 billion mobile phones. Once that is done, all of India can become part of the financial and digital mainstream. 

Just as GST created one tax, one market, one India, the PMJDY and the JAM revolution can link all Indians into one common financial, economic, and digital space. No Indian will be outside the mainstream. This is nothing short of a social revolution”.

                Query has been raised regarding GST applicable on selling of space for advertisement in print media.

 Selling of space for advertisement in print media is leviable to GST @ 5%.If the advertisement agency works on principal to principal basis, that is, buys space from the newspaper and sells such space for advertisement to clients on its own account, that is, as a principal, it would be liable to pay GST @5% on the full amount charged by advertisement agency from the client.

 

 On the other hand, if the advertisement agency sells space for advertisement as an agent of the newspaper on commission basis, it would be liable to pay GST@ 18% on the sale commission it receives from the Newspaper. ITC of GST paid on such sale commission would be available to Newspaper.

 

However, if the advertisement agency supplies any service other than selling of space for advertisement, such as designing or drafting the advertisement, and such supply is not a part of any composite supply, the same would be liable to tax @18%. If such supplies are part of any composite supply, the rate applicable for the principal supply shall apply.

Therefore, everything depends on the terms of the contract between the newspaper, advertisement agency and the client.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Nepal on Drug Demand Reduction and Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and precursor chemicals and related matters. 

The MoU lists out the areas of cooperation on drug matters between the two countries. It also indicates the mechanism of information exchange and the competent authorities in the two countries who are responsible for the implementation of the MoU and exchange of any information. 

Cooperation on drug matters is expected to curb the illicit traffic of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals in the two countries. 

The MoU provides that the Parties shall endeavour to: - 

(i) develop mutual cooperation with a view to effectively resolving the issue of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, cooperate in drug demand reduction through prevention, awareness, education and community based programmes, treatment and rehabilitation; and 

(ii) exchange information of operational, technical and general nature in drug matters, exchange literature on their existing laws, rules, procedures, best practices and methods of curbing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors and any further amendments to the existing legislation. 

Background:

India has always supported global efforts to counter drug trafficking and is party to several multilateral and bilateral initiatives in this regard as also United Nations (UN) led initiatives. In accordance with the spirit of UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs, effort is made to enter into Bilateral Agreements/MoUs with neighbouring countries and the countries which have a direct bearing on the drug situation prevailing in our country. Such Bilateral Agreements/ MoUs have already been executed with various countries. The proposed MoU with Nepal is another such MoU which shall be entered for the purpose of bilateral cooperation on drug matters.

“The Union Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley said that since the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code has been implemented a few months back, this has changed the debtor and creditor relationship. Shri Jaitley was delivering the Inaugural Address at the National Conference on Insolvency and Bankruptcy: Changing Paradigm in Mumbai today .He said “A legislation is a skeletal structure ,the flesh and blood is provided by judicial Interpretation .The new legislation should see that effective functioning of a company does not come to a standstill .Debtors will have to make sure that debts are serviced.

Various news reports/articles have appeared in the media regarding inconsistency in the estimates of the number of taxpayers added after demonetization. It has been commented that the following different figures have been given at different forums by different authorities: 

(i) The Prime Minister mentioned in his Independence Day speech that additional 56 lakh people filed Personal Income Tax Returns from 1st April to 5th August, 2017. Last year for the same period, the figure was 22 lakh. 

(ii) The Economic Survey Vol.2 released on August 12, 2017 mentions that 5.4 lakh new taxpayers were added post demonetization.

(iii) On May 17, 2017, the Finance Minister stated that 91 lakh taxpayers have been added to the tax net as a result of action taken by the Income Tax Department.

(iv) In reply to Unstarred Question No. 2017 in Rajya Sabha on 01.08.2017, it was stated that 33 lakh new taxpayers have been added to the tax net post demonetization.

It is clarified that there is no inconsistency in the data provided by the Government in the statements referred to above as these are in different contexts and for different time periods. The detailed clarification on each of the above numbers is as under: 

(a) The Prime Minister’s speech referred to the increase in number of e-filed Personal Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed from 1st April, 2017 to 5th August, 2017 over the ITRs filed in corresponding period of earlier years. The data maintained by the IT Department shows that during 1st April, 2017 to 5th August, 2017, 2.79 crore e-returns of Individual taxpayers were received as against 2.23 crore e-returns received during 1st April, 2016 to 5th August, 2016. Thus, the additional ITRs received in 2017 works out to be 56 lakh. During the same period of 2015, 2.00 crore e-returns were received, meaning thereby, that in 2016, only 22 lakh (rounded off)) additional e-returns were received by the due date of filing. This data has already been put in public domain by CBDT’s Press Release dated 7th August, 2017.

(b) The analysis given in Table-6 on page 22 of the Economic Survey (Vol.2) is based on the data for the period of 9th November to 31st March of 2016-17 and corresponding periods of last two financial years. Moreover, the growth in the number of taxpayers discussed in the Economic Survey is based on the number of new taxpayers assuming the previous year’s growth rate as the reference growth rate. On the other hand, the growth of Individual return-filers referred to in PM’s speech is with respect to new as well as old taxpayers. Thus, the data used in Economic Survey is different from data referred to in PM’s speech in respect of the period of filing as well as the type of taxpayers and the two are not comparable.

                The Union Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley has written to State Chief Ministers urging the States to reduce burden of Value Added Tax (VAT) on Petroleum Products used as inputs in making of goods after the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

The letter by Finance Minister highlights a concern being raised by the manufacturing sector in the country regarding the rise in input costs of petroleum products happening on account of transition to Goods and Services Tax regime. In the pre-GST regime, because the petroleum products as well as the final goods produced both attracted VAT, input tax credit of petroleum products being used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different States. However, in the post-GST scenario, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products used in the manufacturing attract VAT and, therefore, it would lead to cascading of taxes. In view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector.

Thus Sh Arun Jaitley has requested other States also to explore the possibility of having a lower rate of VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing of those items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods.

As per the rules, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the month of July 2017 has to be paid by 20th August, 2017. Only after the payment of full GST, return in summary Form 3B can be filed. 

Concerns have been raised about the form for claiming transitional input tax credit not being available on the GSTN website. This form will be available on the GSTN website from 21st August, 2017. In view of this, a small window of opportunity is being given to all the taxpayers. For those taxpayers who do not want to claim any transitional input tax credit have to necessarily pay the tax and file return in Form 3Bbefore the due date of 20th August, 2017. The taxpayers who want to avail the transitional input tax credit should also calculate their tax liability after estimating the amount of transitional credit as per Form TRANS I. They have to make full settlement of the liability after adjusting the transitional input tax credit before 20th August, 2017. However, in such cases, they will get time upto 28th August, 2017 to submit Form TRANS I and Form 3B. In case of shortfall in the amount already paid vis-à-vis the amount payable on submission of Form 3B, the same will have to be paid with interest @ 18% for the period between 21stAugust,2017 till the payment of such differential amount.

                Agriculture and Food Management

 

Reforms: Managing and reducing the various risks in agriculture activities can make the sector resilient, increase profitability and can ensure stable income flows to the farmers. The following reforms are suggested for increasing productivity in agriculture and allied sector:

 

·         To address the price risks in agriculture and allied sectors, marketing infrastructure along the entire value chain needs to be built and strengthened.

·         To address production risks, the share of irrigated area should be expanded by increasing the coverage of water saving irrigation systems like micro irrigation systems.

·         To increase productivity of crops, standards should be set and enforced for better quality, pest and disease resistant seeds.

·         Trade and domestic policy changes should be announced well before sowing and should stay till arrivals and procurement is over.

·         To enhance women’s involvement in the dairy projects, funds should be earmarked through appropriate mechanisms.

·         Providing timely and affordable formal and institutional credit to the small and marginal farmers is the key to inclusive growth.

·         Regime based on timely interventions needs to be adopted.

 

Industry and Infrastructure

 

·         Railways should go for more non-fare sources along with station redevelopment and commercially exploiting vacant buildings at the station, monetizing land along tracks by leasing out to promote horticulture and tree plantation, and through advertisement and parcel earnings.

·         During the last few years the non-major ports are gaining more share of cargo handling compared to major ports. It is required to develop non-major port and also enhance their efficiency and operational capacity.

·         Reforms such as privatization/ disinvestment of Air India, creation of aviation hubs and reconsidering the 0/20 rule are some suggestions to improve Indian airlines’ share in the international market.

 

Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development

 

·         India, is emerging as a knowledge based economy, poised for double digit growth, and needs to strengthen social infrastructure by investing in health and education.

·         The education policies need to be designed with focus on learning outcomes and remedial education with interventions which work and maximize the efficiency of expenditure. There is need for bio-metric attendance of school staff, independent setting of examination papers, neutral examination and for DBT for schools. There is need to adopt outcome measures for the education and skilling activities to ensure improvement in delivery of schemes/ programmes.

·         In order to make the labour market system dynamic and efficient, the government has taken several reforms/initiatives, both legislative as well as technological such as notification of ‘Ease of Compliance to maintain Registers under various Laws Rules, 2017’ and introduction of e-Biz Portal. These registers/forms can also be maintained in a digitized form.

·         Government has been imparting short term skill training through Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and long term training through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). Model Skill Centers are being set up in every district of the country under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra Scheme. The emphasis is on enhancing the quality of skill training programmes and making a competency-based framework with giving individuals an option to progress through education, training, prior learning and experiences.

·         There has to be concerted efforts by the Central and State governments to reform the health sector, by addressing quality issues, standardising rates for diagnostic tests, generating awareness about alternative health systems and introduction of punitive measures like fines on hospitals and private health providers for false claims through surgery, medicines etc. For more equitable access to health services, government should provide health benefits and risk cover to poorer sections of the society.

·         Towards addressing the challenges in health sector, the Government has formulated the National Health Policy, 2017, which aims at attaining the highest level of good health and well-being, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services, without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence.

·         Addressing the social security of large number of vulnerable workers in the informal economy should be prioritized by the Government along with ensuring the safety and security of women to raise their participation in economic activities.

                Fiscal Developments

 

·         The fiscal outcome of the Central Government in 2016-17 was marked by strong growth in tax revenue, sustenance of the pace of capital spending and a consolidation of non-salary/pension revenue expenditure. This combination allowed the Government to contain the fiscal deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2016-17.

·         The Union Budget for 2017-18 opted for a gradual fiscal consolidation path: the fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2017-2018. The fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP under the FRBM framework is projected to be achieved in 2018-19.

·         The Budget for 2017-18 introduced a number of procedural reforms, including: the integration of the Railway Budget with the Union Budget; advancing of the date of the Union Budget to February 1, almost by a month; elimination of the classification of expenditure into ‘plan’ and ‘non-plan’; and, restructuring of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement with projected expenditures (revenue and capital) for each demand for the next two financial years.

·          Overshadowing these otherwise significant fiscal policy initiatives is the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax with effect from the 1st day of July 2017, encompassing a plethora of the Central and State level indirect taxes, paving the way for a dramatic transformation of the Indian markets and the economy.

 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation

 

·         The Reserve Bank of India cut the policy rate by 50 basis points during 2016-17. However, it shifted its monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral in February 2017.  As of August 2017 Repo rate stood at 6.00 per cent and reverse repo rate at 5.75 per cent.

·         Monetary aggregates decelerated significantly following the withdrawal of legal tender status of specified bank notes on November 9, 2016. As of 31st March 2017, currency in circulation contracted by 19.7 per cent whereas reserve money contracted by 12.9 per cent.

·         Credit off-take from banks continued to decelerate further. During 2016-17, gross bank credit outstanding grew at around 7 per cent on an average. The average gross bank credit to industry contracted by 0.2 per cent in the FY 2016-17.

·         Sluggish growth and increasing indebtedness in some sectors of the economy have impacted the asset quality of banks and this is a cause for concern. The gross non-performing advances (GNPAs) ratio of SCBs rose from 9.2 per cent in September 2016 to 9.5 per cent in March 2017.

·         Financial inclusion is proceeding apace under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. Zero balance accounts under PMJDY has declined consistently from nearly 58 per cent in March 2015 to around 24 per cent as of December 2016.

 

Prices and Inflation

 

·         Significant moderation in CPI headline inflation during the last three years. CPI inflation fell to a series low of 1.5 percent in June 2017.

·         Broad based decline in all commodity groups during 2016-17, the most significant being decline in food. 

·         Food inflation, which was the main driver of inflation in the past, declined significantly during the year because of improvements in supply of pulses and vegetables on the back of a normal monsoon. Core inflation-indicative of underlying trends -- too declined in the last few months.

·         Convergence between CPI and WPI inflation in the last few months.

·         Most States/UTs witnessed sharp decline in CPI inflation in 2016-17 as compared to the previous year.

·         Both rural and urban inflation have declined in 2016-17 and the gap between rural and urban inflation has narrowed down in recent months.

 

Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Energy

 

·         India ratified the Paris Agreement on 2nd October, 2016. India’s actions for the post-2020 period are based on its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

·         India’s NDC targets to lower the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 - 35 per cent by 2030 from2005 levels, to increase the share of non-fossil based power generation capacity to 40 per cent of installed electric power capacity(cumulative) by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 Gt CO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.

·         At the multilateral level, the international community is engaged in writing the “Paris rule book” which includes guidelines and modalities for the implementation of the Paris Agreement for the transparency framework for action and support, features and accounting of NDCs etc. At the national level, the roadmap for implementation of India’s NDC is being prepared, by constituting an Implementation Committee and six Sub-Committees. The Committees are working to elaborate their respective NDC goals and identify specific policies and actions aimed at achieving them.

·         India has set itself ambitious targets in the area of renewable energy. Moving ahead in this direction, India is implementing the largest renewable energy expansion programme in the world. It envisages a 5-fold increase in the overall renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022. This includes 100 GW of solar, 60 GW of wind, 10 GW of biomass, and 5 GW of small hydro power capacity. 

·         There is an urgent need to further increase the access of the poor to more efficient energy resources. Many schemes have been implemented by the government to tackle this like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, PAHAL scheme, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. A large number of focused initiatives have been taken in various sectors of the economy to ensure a pathway of lower emission and climate resilient development.

·         India is at a stage of development that requires it to grow at a fast rate and lift the large number of their citizens from below the poverty line. Energy deprivation levels for a sizeable portion of population remain at high levels. The SDG 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

·         Social cost analysis of coal and renewables based power done in the chapter indicate higher social costs for renewables. Storage costs and stranding of assets based on coal based power are major costs associated with the renewables based power. Given that the first goal for India is to provide 100 per cent energy access to its population and bridge the development deficit gap, all energy sources need to be tapped.

·         A number of initiatives have been taken in the Indian financial sector also. In the renewable energy segment, as per the notification of the RBI in May 2016, bank loans of up to Rs.15 crore for solar-based power generators, biomass-based power generators, wind mills, micro-hydel plants, etc. will be considered part of Priority Sector Lending. The External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) norms have been further liberalized so that green projects can tap this window for raising finance across the borders. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, in May 2017, put in place the framework for issuance of green bonds.

 

External Sector

 

·         India’s balance of payments situation which was benign and comfortable during 2013-14 to 2015-16, further improved in 2016-17, as a result of low and falling trade and current account deficits and moderate and rising capital inflows, resulting in further accretion of foreign exchange reserves.

·         Reflecting the slowly improving world economic situation, India’s exports turned positive at 12.3 per cent in 2016-17 after an interregnum of two years. This along with a marginal decline in imports by 1.0 per cent resulted in narrowing down of trade deficit to US$ 112.4 billion (5 per cent of GDP) in 2016-17 as compared to US$ 130.1 billion (6.2 per cent of GDP) in 2015-16.

·         The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed down progressively to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 led by sharp contraction in trade deficit which more than outweighed a decline in net invisibles earnings.

·         Net capital inflows were slightly lower at US$ 36.8 billion (1.6 per cent of GDP) in 2016-17 as compared to US$ 40.1 billion (1.9 per cent of GDP) in the previous year, mainly due to fall in NRI deposits.

·         Gross FDI inflows to India increased significantly to US$ 60.2 billion in 2016-17 from US$ 55.6 billion in 2015-16. Net FDI inflows (i.e. net of outward FDI) at US$ 35.6 billion, however, moderated marginally by 1.1 per cent from US$ 36.0 billion in 2015-16.

·         In 2017-18 (April-June) there was double digit export growth at 10.6 per cent with export growth continuing to be in positive territory continuously for the last eleven months.

·         Among the major economies running current account deficit, India is the second largest foreign exchange reserve holder after Brazil with reserves at US$ 386.4 billion as on 7th July, 2017.

·         The average monthly exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar after depreciating continuously from November 2016 to January 2017, has appreciated continuously from February to June 2017, while in the case of the Pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen there have been monthly variations. The rupee performed better than many other EME-currencies in 2016-17.

·         During 2016-17, while on an average (on a y-o-y basis), the Indian rupee depreciated by 2.4 per cent against the US dollar, in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) against a basket of 6 and 36 currencies, the rupee depreciated by 0.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively. However, in terms of the real effective exchange rate (REER) against a basket of 6 and 36 currencies, it appreciated by 2.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively in 2016-17.

·         Most of the external debt indicators of India improved at end-March 2017 compared end-March, 2016. India’s aggregate external debt stock at end-March 2017 stood at US$ 471.9 billion registering a decline of US$ 13.1 billion (2.7 per cent) over end-March 2016. The ratio of external debt to GDP fell to 20.2 per cent from 23.5 per cent, while foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 78.4 per cent to external debt compared to 74.3 per cent in the previous year. Debt service ratio fell to 8.3 per cent from 8.8 per cent and ratio of concessional debt to total external debt increased to 9.3 per cent from 9.0 per cent. Short term debt (residual maturity) to total external debt fell to 41.5 per cent from 42.7 per cent. Short term debt (residual maturity) to forex reserves also fell to 52.9 per cent from 57.4 per cent. Cross country comparison of external debt indicates that India continues to be among the less vulnerable countries.

·         Some green shoots have started to appear in the trade horizon as well with world trade growth projected at 3.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent in 2017 and 2018 and India’s trade growth also picking up.

 

Agriculture and Food Management

 

·         The average farm size in India is small, and declining since 1970-71. The predominance of small operational holdings is a major limitation to reap the benefits of economies of scale in agriculture operations.

·         The progress in agriculture needs to be evaluated in terms of outcomes such as catching up with global yields of various crops as a means to increase incomes of farmers.

·         Credit is an important mediating input for agriculture to improve productivity. The predominance of informal sources of credit for farmers is a concern. There is regional disparity in the distribution of agricultural credit which also needs to be addressed.

·         The key challenge that the horticulture sector faces in India are post-harvest losses, availability of quality planting material and lack of market access for horticultural produce of small farmers.

 

Industry and Infrastructure

 

·         Industrial performance has shown a moderation from 8.8 percent during 2015-16 to 5.6 percent in 2016-17.

·          Industrial growth as per Index of Industrial Production (IIP) new series of 2011-12 shows overall IIP growth at 5 percent in 2016-17 as compared to 3.4 percent last year.

·         The Index of Eight Core Industries growth during 2016-17 was 4.8 percent as compared to 3.0 percent in 2015-16.

·         The Government in 2016 introduced imposition of Minimum Import Price (MIP) to counter dumping of Steel into Indian markets. Steps taken by the government have borne fruit since imports of Steel by India have declined by 36.2 percent while exports have risen by 102 percent in 2016-17.

·         The apparel sector is a highly employment intensive industry especially for women. The Government on 22nd June 2016 approved Rs.6,000 crore special package for textile & apparel sector. Post the release of funds in November 2016, there has been a marked rise in clothing exports.

·         The measures taken by the Government has resulted in FDI equity inflow of 43.4 Billion USD in Financial Year 2016-17, which is the highest ever FDI Equity inflows.

·         India is far ahead than many emerging economies in terms of providing qualitative transportation related infrastructure.

·         During 2016-17, Indian Railways registered freight earnings at Rs.104339 crore (P), registered a negative growth of 4.5 per cent over 2015-16 due to carrying larger volume of low fare freight in the year. Passenger earnings at Rs.46280 crore (P) registered an increase of 4.5 per cent during 2016-17.

·         Indian domestic airlines have a very lower share in international traffic to and from India. Factors like foreign airlines utilising the 6th freedom of the air, expansion of capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements with foreign countries, lower utilisation of India’s own capacity entitlements, the 0/20 rule and fleet constraints are responsible for the same.

•      The Government formulated and launched the UDAY scheme for financial turnaround of power distribution companies on November 20, 2015. The 26 states and 1 UT which have joined the UDAY scheme account for total outstanding debt of Rs. 3.82 lakh Cr. So far, fifteen states have issued UDAY bonds totaling Rs.2.09 lakh Cr. and DISCOMs have issued Bonds worth Rs. 0.23 lakh Cr.

•      After the introduction of UDAY, National average (all UDAY states) of AT&C loss has come down to 20.2 per cent in FY 2017 from 21.1 per cent in FY 2016; billing efficiency has been increased by 2 per cent from 81 per cent in 2015-16 to 83 per cent in 2016-17 at all India level and 15 states have issued tariff-revisions for FY 2017-18.

•      Under Smart Cities Mission, 57 projects worth Rs.941 crore have already been completed as of April 2017. An estimated additional 462 projects worth Rs.15307 crore are likely to be completed through 2018 provided all the projects that have commenced implementation and those that have been tendered stick to their timelines.

 

Services Sector

 

·         The services sector remains the key driver of India’s economic growth, contributing almost 62 per cent of its gross value added growth in 2016-17. However, the growth of this sector has moderated to 7.7 per cent in 2016-17 compared to 9.7 per cent achieved in the previous year, though it continues to be higher than the other two sectors and nearly at the top among the 15 major economies.

·         The services growth moderation is mainly due to deceleration in growth in two services categories- trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting (7.8 per cent), and financial, real estate & professional services (5.7 per cent). The share of services sector in total gross capital formation (GCF), at current prices has increased consistently over the last four years from 53.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 60.3 per cent in 2015-16.

·         There has been a significant growth in FDI equity inflows in 2014-15 and 2015-16 in general (27.3 per cent and 29.3 per cent) and to the services sector in particular (67.3 per cent and 64.3 per cent for top 15 services). However, in 2016-17, the growth rate of total FDI equity inflows moderated and FDI equity inflows to the services sector (top 15 services) declined.

·         India’s and world’s services export trend growth were almost flat in the pre-crisis period, while in the post-crisis period, the deceleration in trend growth of India’s services was sharper than world services export growth. In 2016-17, services exports recorded a positive growth of 5.7 per cent with pick up in some major sectors like transportation, business services and financial services; and good growth in travel. However, Software services exports, accounting for around 45.2 per cent of total services, declined though marginally by 0.7 per cent.

·         The performance of India’s Services Sector has been subdued in 2016-17 in line with the global trend. However, some services continue to be key drivers of India’s economic growth. There was reasonably good performance in telecom with increase in telecom connections reflecting the Jio effect, aviation particularly domestic travel, tourism related services particularly in terms of foreign exchange earnings, and even information technology-business process management (IT-BPM) despite fall in growth in computer software.  

·         As per the Ministry of Tourism data, Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) during 2016 grew by 9.7 per cent and Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) through Tourism, in US$ terms, grew by 8.8 per cent. Various initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote tourism sector of the country that include e-Visa for the citizens of 161 countries, promotion of India as a 365 days destination, launching of Multilingual Tourist Infoline, and Swachh Paryatan Mobile App.

·         As per NASSCOM, in 2016-17 India’s total revenue (exports plus domestic) of the IT-BPM sector including and excluding hardware is expected to touch US$154 billion and US $140 billion, with growths of 7.8 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively. IT-BPM exports are expected to reach USD 117 billion, with a growth of 7.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the Government of India’s rapid adoption of technologies as a platform to delivery of government-to-government and government-to-citizen services is a tremendous push factor for the domestic IT-BPM market.

·         Real estate sector including ownership and dwellings accounted for 7.6 per cent share in India’s overall GVA in 2015-16. The growth of this sector decelerated in the last three years from 7.5 per cent in 2013-14 to 6.7 per cent in 2014-15 and further to 4.5 per cent in 2015-16. Despite the subdued demand, residential prices did not fall with the NHB RESIDEX, showing increase in prices in 33 cities out of 50 cities in 2016-17 Q4 over 2015-16 Q4.

·         Satellite mapping and launching services are two areas in which India is making a mark and has huge potential for the future. The foreign exchange earned by India from satellite mapping in the last five years was more than Rs 100 crores. Foreign exchange earnings of India from export of satellite launch services has increased noticeably in 2015-16 and 2016-17 and consequently India’s share in global satellite launch services revenue has also increased.

·         India’s services sector growth, which was highly resilient even during the global financial crisis, has been showing moderation in recent times.  However, pick up is seen in recent months with some segments of the sector showing better performance.

 

Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development

 

·         The deterioration in quality learning in primary education sector and achievement of targeted enrolment level in the middle education is a challenge

·         Employment in India poses a great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal, unorganized and seasonal workers, and is characterized by high levels of under employment, skill shortages, with the labour markets impacted by rigid labour laws, and the emergence of contract labour.

·         The health sector in India faces many challenges in the form of declining role of public delivery of health services, high Out of Pocket (OoP) expenses on health and issues of accessibility and affordability of health services for many.

·         The Government’s Swachh Bharat Mission has had remarkable progress since its inception. With its focus on cleanliness and Open Defecation Free (ODF) India, there has been a significant decline in the number of people who defecate in the open, which is estimated at less than 35 crores.

                Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation

 

·         The fiscal outcome of the Central Government in 2016-17 was marked by strong growth in tax revenue, sustenance of the pace of capital spending and a consolidation of non-salary/pension revenue expenditure. This combination allowed the Government to contain the fiscal deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2016-17.

·         The Union Budget for 2017-18 opted for a gradual fiscal consolidation path: the fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2017-2018. The fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP under the FRBM framework is projected to be achieved in 2018-19.

·         The Budget for 2017-18 introduced a number of procedural reforms, including: the integration of the Railway Budget with the Union Budget; advancing of the date of the Union Budget to February 1, almost by a month; elimination of the classification of expenditure into ‘plan’ and ‘non-plan’; and, restructuring of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement with projected expenditures (revenue and capital) for each demand for the next two financial years.

·          Overshadowing these otherwise significant fiscal policy initiatives is the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax with effect from the 1st day of July 2017, encompassing a plethora of the Central and State level indirect taxes, paving the way for a dramatic transformation of the Indian markets and the economy.

 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation

 

·         The Reserve Bank of India cut the policy rate by 50 basis points during 2016-17. However, it shifted its monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral in February 2017.  As of August 2017 Repo rate stood at 6.00 per cent and reverse repo rate at 5.75 per cent.

·         Monetary aggregates decelerated significantly following the withdrawal of legal tender status of specified bank notes on November 9, 2016. As of 31st March 2017, currency in circulation contracted by 19.7 per cent whereas reserve money contracted by 12.9 per cent.

·         Credit off-take from banks continued to decelerate further. During 2016-17, gross bank credit outstanding grew at around 7 per cent on an average. The average gross bank credit to industry contracted by 0.2 per cent in the FY 2016-17.

·         Sluggish growth and increasing indebtedness in some sectors of the economy have impacted the asset quality of banks and this is a cause for concern. The gross non-performing advances (GNPAs) ratio of SCBs rose from 9.2 per cent in September 2016 to 9.5 per cent in March 2017.

·         Financial inclusion is proceeding apace under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. Zero balance accounts under PMJDY has declined consistently from nearly 58 per cent in March 2015 to around 24 per cent as of December 2016.

 

Prices and Inflation

 

·         Significant moderation in CPI headline inflation during the last three years. CPI inflation fell to a series low of 1.5 percent in June 2017.

·         Broad based decline in all commodity groups during 2016-17, the most significant being decline in food. 

·         Food inflation, which was the main driver of inflation in the past, declined significantly during the year because of improvements in supply of pulses and vegetables on the back of a normal monsoon. Core inflation-indicative of underlying trends -- too declined in the last few months.

·         Convergence between CPI and WPI inflation in the last few months.

·         Most States/UTs witnessed sharp decline in CPI inflation in 2016-17 as compared to the previous year.

·         Both rural and urban inflation have declined in 2016-17 and the gap between rural and urban inflation has narrowed down in recent months.

 

Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Energy

 

·         India ratified the Paris Agreement on 2nd October, 2016. India’s actions for the post-2020 period are based on its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

·         India’s NDC targets to lower the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 - 35 per cent by 2030 from2005 levels, to increase the share of non-fossil based power generation capacity to 40 per cent of installed electric power capacity(cumulative) by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 Gt CO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.

·         At the multilateral level, the international community is engaged in writing the “Paris rule book” which includes guidelines and modalities for the implementation of the Paris Agreement for the transparency framework for action and support, features and accounting of NDCs etc. At the national level, the roadmap for implementation of India’s NDC is being prepared, by constituting an Implementation Committee and six Sub-Committees. The Committees are working to elaborate their respective NDC goals and identify specific policies and actions aimed at achieving them.

·         India has set itself ambitious targets in the area of renewable energy. Moving ahead in this direction, India is implementing the largest renewable energy expansion programme in the world. It envisages a 5-fold increase in the overall renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022. This includes 100 GW of solar, 60 GW of wind, 10 GW of biomass, and 5 GW of small hydro power capacity. 

·         There is an urgent need to further increase the access of the poor to more efficient energy resources. Many schemes have been implemented by the government to tackle this like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, PAHAL scheme, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. A large number of focused initiatives have been taken in various sectors of the economy to ensure a pathway of lower emission and climate resilient development.

·         India is at a stage of development that requires it to grow at a fast rate and lift the large number of their citizens from below the poverty line. Energy deprivation levels for a sizeable portion of population remain at high levels. The SDG 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

·         Social cost analysis of coal and renewables based power done in the chapter indicate higher social costs for renewables. Storage costs and stranding of assets based on coal based power are major costs associated with the renewables based power. Given that the first goal for India is to provide 100 per cent energy access to its population and bridge the development deficit gap, all energy sources need to be tapped.

·         A number of initiatives have been taken in the Indian financial sector also. In the renewable energy segment, as per the notification of the RBI in May 2016, bank loans of up to Rs.15 crore for solar-based power generators, biomass-based power generators, wind mills, micro-hydel plants, etc. will be considered part of Priority Sector Lending. The External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) norms have been further liberalized so that green projects can tap this window for raising finance across the borders. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, in May 2017, put in place the framework for issuance of green bonds.

 

External Sector

 

·         India’s balance of payments situation which was benign and comfortable during 2013-14 to 2015-16, further improved in 2016-17, as a result of low and falling trade and current account deficits and moderate and rising capital inflows, resulting in further accretion of foreign exchange reserves.

·         Reflecting the slowly improving world economic situation, India’s exports turned positive at 12.3 per cent in 2016-17 after an interregnum of two years. This along with a marginal decline in imports by 1.0 per cent resulted in narrowing down of trade deficit to US$ 112.4 billion (5 per cent of GDP) in 2016-17 as compared to US$ 130.1 billion (6.2 per cent of GDP) in 2015-16.

·         The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed down progressively to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 led by sharp contraction in trade deficit which more than outweighed a decline in net invisibles earnings.

·         Net capital inflows were slightly lower at US$ 36.8 billion (1.6 per cent of GDP) in 2016-17 as compared to US$ 40.1 billion (1.9 per cent of GDP) in the previous year, mainly due to fall in NRI deposits.

·         Gross FDI inflows to India increased significantly to US$ 60.2 billion in 2016-17 from US$ 55.6 billion in 2015-16. Net FDI inflows (i.e. net of outward FDI) at US$ 35.6 billion, however, moderated marginally by 1.1 per cent from US$ 36.0 billion in 2015-16.

·         In 2017-18 (April-June) there was double digit export growth at 10.6 per cent with export growth continuing to be in positive territory continuously for the last eleven months.

·         Among the major economies running current account deficit, India is the second largest foreign exchange reserve holder after Brazil with reserves at US$ 386.4 billion as on 7th July, 2017.

·         The average monthly exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar after depreciating continuously from November 2016 to January 2017, has appreciated continuously from February to June 2017, while in the case of the Pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen there have been monthly variations. The rupee performed better than many other EME-currencies in 2016-17.

·         During 2016-17, while on an average (on a y-o-y basis), the Indian rupee depreciated by 2.4 per cent against the US dollar, in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) against a basket of 6 and 36 currencies, the rupee depreciated by 0.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively. However, in terms of the real effective exchange rate (REER) against a basket of 6 and 36 currencies, it appreciated by 2.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively in 2016-17.

·         Most of the external debt indicators of India improved at end-March 2017 compared end-March, 2016. India’s aggregate external debt stock at end-March 2017 stood at US$ 471.9 billion registering a decline of US$ 13.1 billion (2.7 per cent) over end-March 2016. The ratio of external debt to GDP fell to 20.2 per cent from 23.5 per cent, while foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 78.4 per cent to external debt compared to 74.3 per cent in the previous year. Debt service ratio fell to 8.3 per cent from 8.8 per cent and ratio of concessional debt to total external debt increased to 9.3 per cent from 9.0 per cent. Short term debt (residual maturity) to total external debt fell to 41.5 per cent from 42.7 per cent. Short term debt (residual maturity) to forex reserves also fell to 52.9 per cent from 57.4 per cent. Cross country comparison of external debt indicates that India continues to be among the less vulnerable countries.

·         Some green shoots have started to appear in the trade horizon as well with world trade growth projected at 3.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent in 2017 and 2018 and India’s trade growth also picking up.

 

Agriculture and Food Management

 

·         The average farm size in India is small, and declining since 1970-71. The predominance of small operational holdings is a major limitation to reap the benefits of economies of scale in agriculture operations.

·         The progress in agriculture needs to be evaluated in terms of outcomes such as catching up with global yields of various crops as a means to increase incomes of farmers.

·         Credit is an important mediating input for agriculture to improve productivity. The predominance of informal sources of credit for farmers is a concern. There is regional disparity in the distribution of agricultural credit which also needs to be addressed.

·         The key challenge that the horticulture sector faces in India are post-harvest losses, availability of quality planting material and lack of market access for horticultural produce of small farmers.

 

Industry and Infrastructure

 

·         Industrial performance has shown a moderation from 8.8 percent during 2015-16 to 5.6 percent in 2016-17.

·          Industrial growth as per Index of Industrial Production (IIP) new series of 2011-12 shows overall IIP growth at 5 percent in 2016-17 as compared to 3.4 percent last year.

·         The Index of Eight Core Industries growth during 2016-17 was 4.8 percent as compared to 3.0 percent in 2015-16.

·         The Government in 2016 introduced imposition of Minimum Import Price (MIP) to counter dumping of Steel into Indian markets. Steps taken by the government have borne fruit since imports of Steel by India have declined by 36.2 percent while exports have risen by 102 percent in 2016-17.

·         The apparel sector is a highly employment intensive industry especially for women. The Government on 22nd June 2016 approved Rs.6,000 crore special package for textile & apparel sector. Post the release of funds in November 2016, there has been a marked rise in clothing exports.

·         The measures taken by the Government has resulted in FDI equity inflow of 43.4 Billion USD in Financial Year 2016-17, which is the highest ever FDI Equity inflows.

·         India is far ahead than many emerging economies in terms of providing qualitative transportation related infrastructure.

·         During 2016-17, Indian Railways registered freight earnings at Rs.104339 crore (P), registered a negative growth of 4.5 per cent over 2015-16 due to carrying larger volume of low fare freight in the year. Passenger earnings at Rs.46280 crore (P) registered an increase of 4.5 per cent during 2016-17.

·         Indian domestic airlines have a very lower share in international traffic to and from India. Factors like foreign airlines utilising the 6th freedom of the air, expansion of capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements with foreign countries, lower utilisation of India’s own capacity entitlements, the 0/20 rule and fleet constraints are responsible for the same.

•      The Government formulated and launched the UDAY scheme for financial turnaround of power distribution companies on November 20, 2015. The 26 states and 1 UT which have joined the UDAY scheme account for total outstanding debt of Rs. 3.82 lakh Cr. So far, fifteen states have issued UDAY bonds totaling Rs.2.09 lakh Cr. and DISCOMs have issued Bonds worth Rs. 0.23 lakh Cr.

•      After the introduction of UDAY, National average (all UDAY states) of AT&C loss has come down to 20.2 per cent in FY 2017 from 21.1 per cent in FY 2016; billing efficiency has been increased by 2 per cent from 81 per cent in 2015-16 to 83 per cent in 2016-17 at all India level and 15 states have issued tariff-revisions for FY 2017-18.

•      Under Smart Cities Mission, 57 projects worth Rs.941 crore have already been completed as of April 2017. An estimated additional 462 projects worth Rs.15307 crore are likely to be completed through 2018 provided all the projects that have commenced implementation and those that have been tendered stick to their timelines.

 

Services Sector

 

·         The services sector remains the key driver of India’s economic growth, contributing almost 62 per cent of its gross value added growth in 2016-17. However, the growth of this sector has moderated to 7.7 per cent in 2016-17 compared to 9.7 per cent achieved in the previous year, though it continues to be higher than the other two sectors and nearly at the top among the 15 major economies.

·         The services growth moderation is mainly due to deceleration in growth in two services categories- trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting (7.8 per cent), and financial, real estate & professional services (5.7 per cent). The share of services sector in total gross capital formation (GCF), at current prices has increased consistently over the last four years from 53.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 60.3 per cent in 2015-16.

·         There has been a significant growth in FDI equity inflows in 2014-15 and 2015-16 in general (27.3 per cent and 29.3 per cent) and to the services sector in particular (67.3 per cent and 64.3 per cent for top 15 services). However, in 2016-17, the growth rate of total FDI equity inflows moderated and FDI equity inflows to the services sector (top 15 services) declined.

·         India’s and world’s services export trend growth were almost flat in the pre-crisis period, while in the post-crisis period, the deceleration in trend growth of India’s services was sharper than world services export growth. In 2016-17, services exports recorded a positive growth of 5.7 per cent with pick up in some major sectors like transportation, business services and financial services; and good growth in travel. However, Software services exports, accounting for around 45.2 per cent of total services, declined though marginally by 0.7 per cent.

·         The performance of India’s Services Sector has been subdued in 2016-17 in line with the global trend. However, some services continue to be key drivers of India’s economic growth. There was reasonably good performance in telecom with increase in telecom connections reflecting the Jio effect, aviation particularly domestic travel, tourism related services particularly in terms of foreign exchange earnings, and even information technology-business process management (IT-BPM) despite fall in growth in computer software.  

·         As per the Ministry of Tourism data, Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) during 2016 grew by 9.7 per cent and Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) through Tourism, in US$ terms, grew by 8.8 per cent. Various initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote tourism sector of the country that include e-Visa for the citizens of 161 countries, promotion of India as a 365 days destination, launching of Multilingual Tourist Infoline, and Swachh Paryatan Mobile App.

·         As per NASSCOM, in 2016-17 India’s total revenue (exports plus domestic) of the IT-BPM sector including and excluding hardware is expected to touch US$154 billion and US $140 billion, with growths of 7.8 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively. IT-BPM exports are expected to reach USD 117 billion, with a growth of 7.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the Government of India’s rapid adoption of technologies as a platform to delivery of government-to-government and government-to-citizen services is a tremendous push factor for the domestic IT-BPM market.

·         Real estate sector including ownership and dwellings accounted for 7.6 per cent share in India’s overall GVA in 2015-16. The growth of this sector decelerated in the last three years from 7.5 per cent in 2013-14 to 6.7 per cent in 2014-15 and further to 4.5 per cent in 2015-16. Despite the subdued demand, residential prices did not fall with the NHB RESIDEX, showing increase in prices in 33 cities out of 50 cities in 2016-17 Q4 over 2015-16 Q4.

·         Satellite mapping and launching services are two areas in which India is making a mark and has huge potential for the future. The foreign exchange earned by India from satellite mapping in the last five years was more than Rs 100 crores. Foreign exchange earnings of India from export of satellite launch services has increased noticeably in 2015-16 and 2016-17 and consequently India’s share in global satellite launch services revenue has also increased.

·         India’s services sector growth, which was highly resilient even during the global financial crisis, has been showing moderation in recent times.  However, pick up is seen in recent months with some segments of the sector showing better performance.

 

 

 

Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development

 

·         The deterioration in quality learning in primary education sector and achievement of targeted enrolment level in the middle education is a challenge

·         Employment in India poses a great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal, unorganized and seasonal workers, and is characterized by high levels of under employment, skill shortages, with the labour markets impacted by rigid labour laws, and the emergence of contract labour.

·         The health sector in India faces many challenges in the form of declining role of public delivery of health services, high Out of Pocket (OoP) expenses on health and issues of accessibility and affordability of health services for many.

·         The Government’s Swachh Bharat Mission has had remarkable progress since its inception. With its focus on cleanliness and Open Defecation Free (ODF) India, there has been a significant decline in the number of people who defecate in the open, which is estimated at less than 35 crores.

The Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement (MTEF) was laid in Parliament in national capital today. The MTEF Statement sets forth a three-year rolling target for the expenditure indicators with specification of underlying assumptions and risks involved. The MTEF is essentially a vertical expansion of the aggregates of the expenditure projections in the fiscal framework presented along with the Annual Financial Statement and Demands for Grants.

The objective of the MTEF is to provide closer integration between Budget and the FRBM Statements. It provides medium term perspective to the fiscal management and furthers the Government’s commitment towards fiscal consolidation. In FY 2016-17, an additional Statement giving demand wise revenue-capital breakup of expenditure over medium-term was annexed to the MTEF. To give a focus to the expenditure pattern and projections of the Government a scheme-wise projection in respect of some selected schemes which include all Centrally Sponsored Schemes and some Central Sector Schemes is also annexed with this year’s MTEF statement. It is expected that these projections will provide a focus to the spending departments and also give a general direction to the fiscal management of the entire country.

The document can be accessed on http://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/MTEF%202017-18%20uploaded_english.pdf. Section 3 of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 requires the Government to place three Statements of Fiscal Policy viz., the Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, the Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement and the Macroeconomic Framework Statement in both the Houses of Parliament along with Annual Financial Statement and Demands for Grants. This Section was amended to require the Government to lay a Fourth Statement viz., the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) Statement in both the Houses of Parliament, immediately following the Session of the Parliament in which the Budget has been presented.

                Government has launched the ‘Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY)’ to provide social security during old age and to protect elderly persons aged 60 and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme enables old age income security for senior citizens through provision of assured pension/return linked to the subscription amount based on government guarantee to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

The scheme provides an assured return of 8% per annum payable monthly for 10 years. The differential return, i.e. the difference between return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis. The scheme is open for subscription till 3rd May 2018.

Pension is payable at the end of each period during the policy tenure of 10 years as per the frequency of monthly/quarterly/half-yearly/yearly as chosen by the subscriber at the time of purchase. Minimum purchase price under the scheme is Rs.1,50,000/- for a minimum pension of Rs. 1,000/- per month and the maximum purchase price is Rs.7,50,000/- for a maximum pension of Rs.5,000/- per month. The scheme is exempted from Goods and Services Tax.

The scheme is widely advertised in national and regional media and through brochures, hoardings, flex-boards and on the website of LIC.

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                All Scheduled Commercial Banks provide Education Loan to students. Simple interest is charged during the study period and up to commencement of repayment. Accrued interest is added to the principal amount borrowed while fixing EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) for repayment.

 The Schemes launched by the Government to provide interest subsidy to the students include:

 

(i)        Central Scheme to provide Interest Subsidy (CSIS) wherein full interest subsidy is available for the students belonging to economically weaker sections, for studies in India, for educational loans disbursed on or after 1st April, 2009 during the period of moratorium.

(iii)             Dr Ambedkar Central Sector Scheme of Interest Subsidy on Educational Loan for Overseas Studies for Other Backward Classes whereby interest payable by the students for the period of moratorium is borne by the Government of India.

                India’s current account deficit (CAD) at US$ 3.4 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) in Q4 of 2016-17 was higher than US$ 0.3 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) in Q4 of 2015-16 but narrowed from US$ 8.0 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP) in the preceding quarter. For 2016-17 full year, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed down to 0.7 per cent of GDP from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2015-16. Quarterly data on India’s CAD are given in Table 1.

The widening of the CAD in Q4 of 2016-17 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis was on account of a higher trade deficit (US$ 29.7 billion) due to a larger increase in merchandise imports relative to exports. High increase in imports of Petroleum, Oil & Lubricants (POL) and gold & silver imports led to the rise in imports in Q4 of 2016-17. Despite the widening in Q4 of 2016-17, the CAD is low and within manageable limits. The Government and the RBI closely monitor the emerging external economic situation including CAD and calibrate policies on an on-going basis.

This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                e-Shakti is a pilot project of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) for digitisation of Self Help Groups (SHGs). It was initiated to address certain concerns like improving the quality of book keeping of SHGs and to enable banks to take informed credit decisions about the group through a Management Information System (MIS). The project covers 25 districts and 1,30,176 SHGs have been digitised as on 31st March, 2017.

As per information compiled by NABARD, about 69,696 SHGs of the SHGs which have been digitised are credit linked as on 31st July, 2017.

No SHG has been de-recognised on account of, or, after digitisation. The digitisation project does not impact the profit/ loss position of the SHGs.

                The Government has revised the base year of All-India Wholesale Price Index (WPI) from 2004-05 to 2011-12. The revision of the base year of the macroeconomic indicators is a regular exercise to capture structural changes in the economy and to improve the quality, coverage and representativeness of the indices. The base year revision of WPI has aligned the series with the base year of other macroeconomic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The new series of WPI has the following salient features and improvements over the old series:

• The revised basket of WPI and its weighting structure conform to the structure of economy in 2011-12.

• The number of items in the basket has increased from 676 to 697 and the number of price quotations has increased from 5482 to 8331.

• New series of WPI does not include indirect taxes. This is in consonance with international practices and will make the new WPI conceptually closer to Producer Price Index.

• A new “Food Index” is compiled to capture the inflation in food items.

• Seasonality of fruits and vegetables has been updated to account for more months as they are now available for longer duration.

• Item level aggregates for new WPI are compiled using Geometric Mean (GM) instead of Arithmetic Mean.

The Government has modernized the data collection methods by adopting international norms and global best practices such as submission of data online through web portals, use of computer assisted personal interviewing methods etc.

This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

The Government of India has disinvested 6.83% of paid up equity in Hindustan Copper Limited through Offer for Sale (OFS). The Government is likely to get approximately ₹ 400 crore from this disinvestment. The trading took place on 2nd and 3rd August 2017. The floor price was fixed at Rs 64.75 per share (Face value Rs 5/- each) and retail investors were offered discount of 5% on the cut off price for the Non-Retail Category. 

 

The initial offer was for disinvestment of 4% paid-up capital, with an option to retain over-subscription up-to 4%. The trading for Non Retail portion opened on 2nd August, 2017. Against an offer size of 2.96 crore shares for the Non Retail Category, bids were received for 5.05 crore shares, resulting in over subscription by 1.71 times. As a result, the Government revised the total offer size to 6.83% of the paid-up capital.

 

The retail portion of HCL OFS also got good response from the retail investors and the revised offer size of 1.26 crore shares also got fully subscribed.

 

Overall, HCL OFS got good response from the investors. This is the 4th CPSE OFS in the Current Financial Year 2017-18. The Government’s shareholding in HCL after this OFS will come down to 76.05%.

The Government has received representations from small businesses relating to exemption from GST, reduction in applicable rates of GST, and product and area wise exemptions. The GST rates on supply of goods and services have been notified based on the recommendations of the GST Council. The tax rates on goods have been fixed taking into consideration, inter alia, the total indirect tax incidence on goods prior to GST, which included the central excise duty rates / embedded central excise duty incidence, VAT rates or weighted average VAT rates, embedded VAT incidence, cascading of VAT over excise duty, incidence on account of CST, Octroi, entry tax, etc.

Keeping in view the interests of small business, any supplier in the State or Union territory, other than special category States, whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed Rs.20 lakh [Rs.10 lakh in the case of Special Category States] is not liable to be registered under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.

Further, a composition scheme has been provided for the benefit of small business. An eligible registered person in the State or Union territory, other than Special Category States [other than Uttarakhand], can avail benefit of this scheme (Except those manufacturing ice-cream, pan masala and tobacco products) by paying an amount equal to 2% of turnover in the State in case of manufacturers and 1% equal to the turnover in the State in the case of trader dealers. The turnover limit for availing of composition levy initially was Rs. 50 lakhs in the preceding financial year. However, keeping in view the interests of small businesses, the same was increased to 75 lakhs [except in case of Special Category States]. The raised limit in case of Uttarakhand, however, is Rs. 75 lakhs. Thus, the interests of traders are not likely to be adversely affected in general.

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

The number of income tax payers has increased after demonetization. During the period of 09.11.2016 to 31.03.2017, 1.96 crore returns were filed as compared to 1.63 crore returns filed during corresponding period of FY 2015-16 and 1.23 crore returns filed during corresponding period of FY 2014-15.

Demonetisation seeks to create a new ‘normal’ wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. This exercise is a part of Government’s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding.

Permanent Account Number (PAN) is the key identifier of taxable entity and aggregator of all financial transactions undertaken by one person. One PAN for one person is the guiding principle for allotment of PAN. However, for achieving the objective of one PAN to one assessee it is required to maintain uniqueness of PAN. The uniqueness of PAN is achieved by conducting a de-duplication check on all already existing allotted PAN against the data furnished by new applicant. Under the existing system of PAN only demographic data is captured. Some instances are found where multiple PANs have been allotted to one person or one PAN has been allotted to multiple persons despite the application of de-duplication process based on demographic data. Linkage of Aadhaar number into PAN database will allow a robust way of de-duplication as Aadhaar number is based on biometric attributes of finger prints and iris images. Further seeding of Aadhaar will allow the Income-tax Department to weed out any undetected duplicate PANs. It will also facilitate resolution of cases of one PAN allotted to multiple persons.

As on 27.7.2017, 11,44,211 PANs have been identified and deleted or de-activated in cases where multiple PANs were found allotted to one person. Similarly, as on 27.7.2017, 1,566 PANs have been identified as ‘Fake’ which were allotted to either non-existent person or in the names of persons with false identities. In this regard, the PAN service provider carries out onsite verification of PAN applications to verify identity and addresses of the applicant and share the report of such verification to the concerned Assessing Officer. On receipt of such report the assessing officer also conducts enquires and mark the PAN as “Fake”. If information of allotment of more than one PAN is received, the facility to delete or de-activate the PAN is available with the Assessing Officer through application software. Further, during 2004 to 2007, an exercise for de-duplication of PAN was conducted in the Department to identify probable duplicate PANs, which were consequently deleted or de-activated by the concerned assessing officers after examinations. 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

With a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating black money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on the real economy, the Government decided to cancel the legal tender character of the high denomination bank notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 issued by the Reserve Bank of India on 8th November 2016. 

There was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. However, post demonetization, the Income Tax Department (ITD) conducted searches in 900 groups of persons during November 2016 to March, 2017 leading to seizure of Rs 900 crores and admission of undisclosed income of Rs 7961 crores. During the same period, 8239 surveys were conducted leading to detection of undisclosed income of Rs 6745 crores. Information of various kinds of wrong-doings by about 400 persons was also shared with other law enforcement agencies such as Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation for appropriate action.

Further, during the current Financial year (01.04.2017 to 30.06.2017) the ITD has conducted searches in 102 groups, seizing assets worth Rs. 103 crore. The persons searched have admitted undisclosed income of Rs. 2670 crore. During the same period surveys conducted in 202 cases (01.04.2017 to 31.05.2017) led to detection of Rs. 150 crore as undisclosed income. 

The Department has also launched ‘Operation Clean Money’ on 31st January 2017 with the mission to “create a tax compliant society through a fair, transparent and non-intrusive tax administration where every Indian takes pride in paying taxes”. Broad outcome of the operation so far is as under:

i. About 18 lakh persons whose cash transactions did not appear in line with their tax profile were identified and approached through email/sms. 

ii. More than 9.27 lakh responses were received giving information on 13.33 lakh accounts involving cash deposits of around Rs.2.89 lakh crore. Out of this record number of 5.27 lakh responses were received in the first 12 days of the operation.

iii. Advance data analytics tools were deployed which further identified 5.56 lakhs new cases and about 1 lakh those cases in which either partial or no response was received in the earlier phase. Besides, about 200 high risk clusters of persons were identified for appropriate action.

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

            Any restructuring is to be carried out in accordance with detailed guidelines issued by RBI on restructuring like Joint Lenders’ Forum (JLF), Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) and Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A). Disclosure of the names and details of borrowers is covered under section 45E of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 and Banking Laws, which oblige financial institutions to maintain secrecy about the affairs of their constituents.

 

            As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines contained in master circular on relief measures by banks in areas affected by natural calamities dated July 1, 2015, wherever repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers has been impaired due to natural calamities, banks are empowered to provide the benefit of restructuring (including conversion of short term debt to term loan or re-schedulement of repayment period) to such borrowers with the benefit of retention of asset classification.

 

            For agricultural accounts that became impaired on account of reasons other than natural calamities, restructuring is allowed in terms of RBI guidelines issued vide master circular on Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC).

Government has taken decision to organize workshops to make the people aware about Goods and Services Tax (GST).  Both at the Central and States level have been organizing GST Awareness campaigns through workshops all across the country to spread awareness on GST.

 

The workshops are being conducted in a town hall format all across the country by the field formations of CBEC, with power point presentations and resource material provided by National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes and Narcotics (NACIN).

 

All field formations are involved in conducting these workshops, and even though a city-wise record is not maintained, an online portal has been especially created by the Directorate General of Systems, CBEC (https://gstawareness.cbec.gov.in) for online reporting of awareness campaigns all over India. The website, apart from capturing data of the events held, also provides information to the public on upcoming events (date and place) for their convenience.

 

A typical GST Awareness workshop is conducted for half a day (about 3 hours). A total of 5198 workshops have been held till date (28.07.2017) all over India in almost all cities. Region-wise details are as under:-

 


	
		
			
			Zones
			
			
			No. of Workshops

			Total

These workshops were started in a structured manner from last week of March, 2017.

Numerous senior officers of Central Board of Excise and Customs, Commercial Taxes Department and officers trained by National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes and Narcotics (NACIN) are conducting these workshops.

 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has deregulated the interest rate on advances sanctioned by Scheduled Commercial Banks and these interest rates are determined by banks with the approval of their respective Board of Directors subject to regulatory guidelines on interest rate on advances contained in RBI’s Master Direction dated 03.03.2016. Interest rates on loans could vary from time to time and be based on credit profile of the borrowers. The information on interest rates charged on loans, vehicle type-wise is not maintained centrally.

With a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. Under the said scheme, additional subvention of 3% is given to those farmers who repay their short term crop loan in time, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4% p.a. for such farmers.

Further, with effect from 2014-15, the Long Term Rural Credit Fund (LTRCF), was created with NABARD out of shortfall in achievement of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) targets by Scheduled Commercial Banks, in order to provide long term refinance to Cooperative banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to encourage long term investment credit lending in agriculture. At present the interest rate on advances to banks under LTRCF is at 4.90%. 

This was stated by Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

As per data reported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the number of cyber crime pertaining to credit card, ATM, debit card and Internet banking shows a marginal increase of 4.4% from 13,083 in 2014-15, to 13,653 in 2016-17.

RBI has issued Cyber Security Framework in Banks, mandating banks to put in place a Board-approved cyber-security policy, which covers the risks from cyber threats and the measures to address/ mitigate these risks.

RBI has issued instructions to banks for reversal of erroneous debits arising from fraudulent or other transactions, and for Board-approved bank policy to cover customer protection, the mechanism of compensating the customer for the unauthorised electronic banking transactions, and display of the same on the bank’s website, along with the details of grievance-handling / escalation procedure. Under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, if a customer does not receive any reply within a period of one month after receipt of representation by the bank or is not satisfied with the reply given, he can file a complaint before the Ombudsman, who can ask the bank to pay compensation of up to Rs. 20 lakh to the customer for loss, suffered by the customer due to an act of omission of the bank, and also compensation of up to Rs. 1 lakh for mental agony and harassment.

       The Government has taken the following initiatives to reduce the debt burden of farmers: 

 

·         With a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. Under the said scheme, additional subvention of 3% is given to those farmers who repay their short term crop loan in time, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4% p.a. for such farmers.

·         Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued master directions on relief measures to be provided by lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities including drought which, inter alia, include identification of beneficiaries, extending fresh loans and restructuring of existing loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc.  The benchmark for restructuring of loans has been reduced from 50% to 33% crop loss, in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. In addition, as per the Priority Sector Lending Guidelines issued by RBI, loans to distressed farmers to repay non-institutional lenders, are eligible under priority sector.

·         Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of insured crops due to non-preventable natural risks, thus providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/ damage arising out of unforeseen events; stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming; and encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices. 

·         For development of agriculture and welfare of farmers of the country, the Government in Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), is implementing various Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which include:

 

                                i.            Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)

                              ii.            National Food Security Mission (NFSM)

                            iii.            National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)

                            iv.            National Mission For Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)

 

·         Post demonetisation, Government has taken the following relief measures for the farmers in the cooperative sector:

 

        i.            An additional grace period of 60 days for prompt repayment incentive @ 3% was provided to such farmers whose crop loans dues fell due between 01/11/2016 to 31/12/2016 and if such farmers repaid the same within 60 days from their due date in this period.

      ii.            Interest waiver for two months (November and December, 2016) for all short term crop loans availed from Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 to 30.09.2016 and upfront deposit of the same in the accounts of the concerned farmers.

    iii.            National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) raised short term borrowings from the market at prevailing market rate of interest for ₹17,880.78 crore and disbursed the same under refinance for on-lending to Cooperative Banks at 4.5% rate of interest during 2016-17.

                The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, Government of India has been taking several initiatives in the area of Public Expenditure Management in the North Eastern States with special focus on capacity building of the State Government officials and integration of the State Treasuries with the Union Public Financial Management System (PFMS) in order to improve the efficiency and transparency of public expenditure. These initiatives were reviewed recently by Shri Ashok Lavasa, Finance Secretary & Secretary (Expenditure) in a meeting with the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and Director, National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

Treasury Integration with PFMS

To provide the Centre and State Governments with a real time, reliable and meaningful Management Information System and an effective Decision Support System (DSS) as well as track fund flow in respect of Central Sector (CS) and Central Assistance to State Plan (CASP) schemes, the IT system of all the North East States' Treasuries (namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Tripura) except Nagaland, have been integrated with PFMS.

Capacity Building

In last six months, 15 Trainings have been organized by the Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) of PFMS and different Ministers/Departments of Government of India in North Eastern States on PFMS. These 15 trainings include one training in each State Head quarter (two in Assam) by CPMU and six (6) trainings organized by different Ministers/Department in Assam/Meghalaya. Total 739 officers/officials/Non officials have been trained in these trainings. Scheme specific training on PFMS being organized by line Ministers/Departments are also being attended by the North Eastern States.

Besides the above, the participants from North East have also been attending Treasury Integration Workshops being organized at New Delhi. State Project Management Units at Guwahati and Shillong are by now well equipped with the skill set required for providing guidance for implementation of PFMS and these SPMUs are providing and holding support to the implementing agencies on need basis.

The National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM), an autonomous body under the Department of Expenditure has take-up training of the officers from the North Eastern States as a special focus area. Government E-Marketplace (GeM) training was conducted by NIFM faculty at Guwahati, Assam for three days, from 27th to 29th June 2017, wherein 53 participants of the Government of Assam were provided practical exposure to use of GeM for procurement of Goods and Services. A one week program on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in North-Eastern States has been conducted from 10th July 2017. More programs on GeM, Government Accounts and Finance and GST are planned to be conducted for officers of the North Eastern States in the coming months.

                Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries launched Common Food Processing Incubation Center for Shallots (Small Onions) in Chettikulam village in Perambalur District of Tamil Nadu through video conferencing from here today.

 

Speaking on the ocassion Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that it is a historic & auspicious occasion for Tamil Nadu and Chettikulam Village in particular. She also congratulated Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT), Thanjavur for their initiatives to help double farmers' income by 2022. She also said that farmers in Perambalur District are producing 70000 tons of shallots per year in a cultivation area of 8000 hectares, inspite of the increasing difficulty in cultivation due to increase in prices of inputs, unpredictable weather, disease outbreak and not getting adequate prices in the market. This Central Processing Center for Shallots in Perambalur will ensure that no shallots are getting wasted, increase farmers' income and also ensure availability of shallots to consumers. This Onion processing technology should be taken to all parts of India.

Shri C. Anandharamakrishnan, Director, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology said that his Institute has decided to take one crop per year and develop processing technologies and related infrastructure for that crop. In this regard Mission Banana was implemented in the previous year and this year it is Mission Onion. Central Food Processing Center for Shallots in Chettikulam, Perambalur District is part of the Mission Onion in improving the lives of Onion farmers in this area. This center will help farmers’ to double their income through value addition. This center will process Shallots and produce 4 Shallot products viz. Fresh Shallot, Peeled Shallot, Onion Powder, Onion Paste, Onion Flakes. He also said that IIFPT is working on Mission Coconut which will be launched next year on World Coconut Day (2nd September 2018).

 

 

Background:

Perambalur district is the hub for small onions (Shallots) cultivation in over 8000 hectares producing around 65,000 to 70,000 tonnes every year. Farmers reported massive losses due to conventional methods of handling and storage. Stakeholders from this region expressed their need to provide technological solutions to minimize wastage, particularly during seasons with surplus production. The farmer producers union which will be involved in this initiative was also launched recently.

 



 

IIFPT has developed three machines viz.,

1.      Small Onion Stem and Root Cutter

2.      Small Onion Peeler

3.      Solar Assisted Curing cum Storage Unit for Onions

 

This Center will make four value added products

1.      Onion Powder

2.      Onion Paste

3.      Vacuum Packed Peeled Onion

4.      Onion Flakes

 

Benefits of the Value addition created

1.      Reduction of storage losses

2.      Ease of handling

3.      Shelf life extension

4.      Increase in income generation

5.      Wider market coverage for local farmers

6.      More jobs created

 

Even with proper storage and handling, unprocessed small onions last only upto 15 days and even lesser when stored after peeling. But with the value addition, Onion powder will last for 6 months, Onion Paste for 5 months, Vacuum Packed Peeled Onion for 1 month (under refrigeration), Onion Flakes for 6 months. Thus it increases shelf life and farmers get better prices for their produce.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the renaming of the new Central Sector Scheme - SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) as ""Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) "" for the period of 2016-20 coterminous with the 14th Finance Commission cycle. Earlier, CCEA in its meeting held in May, 2017 approved the new Central Sector Scheme - SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) with same allocation and period . 

Objective:

The objective of PMKSY is to supplement agriculture, modernize processing and decrease Agri-Waste. 

Financial Allocation:

PMKSY with an allocation of Rs. 6,000 crore is expected to leverage investment of Rs. 31,400 crore, handling of 334 lakh MT agro-produce valuing Rs. 1,04,125 crore, benefit 20 lakh farmers and generate 5,30,500 direct/ indirect employment in the country by the year 2019-20. 

Impact: 

• The implementation of PMKSY will result in creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. 

• It will provide a big boost to the growth of food processing sector in the country. 

• It will help in providing better prices to farmers and is a big step towards doubling of farmers’ income. 

• It will create huge employment opportunities especially in the rural areas. 

• It will also help in reducing wastage of agricultural produce, increasing the processing level, availability of safe and convenient processed foods at affordable price to consumers and enhancing the export of the processed foods. 

Measures to give a boost to Food Processing Sector:

Food Processing Sector has emerged as an important segment of the Indian economy in terms of its contribution to GDP, employment and investment. During 2015-16, the sector constituted as much as 9.1 and 8.6 per cent of GVA in Manufacturing and Agriculture sector respectively. 

The manifesto of NDA Government stresses upon incentivizing the setting up of food processing industry for providing better income for the farmers and creating jobs. 

Government has taken various other measures to boost food processing sector as follows: 

(a) To provide impetus to investment in food processing and retail sector, govt. has allowed 100% FDI in trading including through e-commerce, in respect of food products manufactured and / or produced in India. This will benefit farmers immensely and will create back - end infrastructure and significant employment opportunities. 

(b) The govt. has also set up a Special Fund of Rs. 2000 crore in NABARD to make available affordable credit at concessional rate of interest to designated food parks and agro processing units in the designated food parks. 

(c) Food and agro-based processing units and cold chain infrastructure have been brought under the ambit of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) to provide additional credit for food processing activities and infrastructure thereby, boosting food processing, reducing wastage, create employment and increasing farmers' income. 

Background:

PMKSY is an umbrella scheme incorporating ongoing schemes of the Ministry like Mega Food Parks, Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, etc. and also new schemes like Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages, Creation / Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities.

                Health Secretary, Shri C K Mishra emphasised upon the need for innovative approaches to make the facilities at the peripheries work to avoid crowding of tertiary care facilities which impacts the quality of healthcare. He was chairing the National Review of the National Health Mission here recently. The national review meeting was attended by State Health Secretaries and NHM Mission Directors from all States/UTs. Issues on the agenda included reduction of MMR, IMR, improving immunization and uptake of family planning measures in selected States /UTs, roll out of recent initiatives such as, strengthening sub Centres as Health and Wellness Centres, screening for NCDs, progress in TB elimination, status of preparedness for swine flu, addressing HR challenges, DBT payments, digital payments, rare diseases etc.

The Health Secretary asked the States/UTs to take a critical look at problem areas at all layers and resolve them through innovative approaches and new ideas. He stated that NHM provides unparalleled flexibilities to address healthcare challenges specific to State context and needs. While there has been considerable improvement as reflected in accelerated decline of MMR, U5MR, TFR and reversing the incidence of diseases such as TB, HIV, AIDS and Malaria, areas such as NCD prevention and control requires better response, he stated. The disease burden on account of NCDs is increasing resulting in substantial economic loss for families and the nation as a whole, he said. He emphasised on strengthening health systems, particularly making SNCUs, FRUs and NBCCs functional with requisite HR and equipment backed by trained team for provisioning of quality services.

States were urged to focus on labour room protocols for intra partum care, carry out 100% Maternal Death Audit for understanding cause of maternal death and monitoring of inborn and out born deaths of sick newborns separately. Shri Mishra stressed that Mission Indradhanush is not a programme but a campaign towards increasing immunisation coverage. The states must focus on strengthening routine immunization. There is gap in initiation of early breast feeding which needs to be actively bridged through interventions/programmes such Mothers’ Absolute Affection-MAA. Complementary feeding and its quality are also issues that States need to address, he said.

Shri Mishra urged the State to utilise the NHM flexibilities to devise new strategies and sharpen existing strategies for last mile approach. He exhorted States to start measuring service delivery and monitoring performance based on a set of deliverables with clear allocation of responsibilities and roles for incentivising and fixing accountability. He urged States to co-opt the private sector as elimination of TB is not possible otherwise.

States/UTs actively participated by highlighting problem areas, challenges and providing suggestions thereby serving not only as a forum for inputs for the Health Ministry but also for cross learning across States/UTs.

                The National Health Policy 2017 envisages providing access and informed choice to the patients, providing an enabling environment for practice of different systems of medicine, an enabling regulatory framework and encouraging cross referrals across these systems. Further, National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy 2002 also envisages integration of AYUSH with the healthcare delivery system.

Furthermore, under National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to the States/UTs to strengthen their health systems and the principle of ‘Mainstreaming of AYUSH’ was adopted under NHM to enhance choice of services for beneficiaries of public health facilities and also to revitalize local health care traditions. Accordingly, NHM Implementation Framework envisages co-location of AYUSH services in health facilities.

Public Health and hospital  being a State subject, provision of healthcare services for the people through scientific and effective methods lies under the jurisdiction of the respective State/UT Governments. However, the Directorate General of Health Services, Government of India has issued various Standard Treatment Guidelines for different conditions. These are available at URL http://clinicalestablishments.nic.in/En/1068-standard-treatment-guidelines.aspx.

Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems, including for mainstreaming of AYUSH, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).

The yearly allocations in the recent years have had an increasing trend. The increase in budgetary outlay would facilitate meeting more and more expenditure of treatment and investments under various systems of medicines.

During the current year, Rs.21,940.70 Cr has been allocated to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for the National Health Mission as per Budgetary Estimate of 2017-18. (Detail statement showing Budgetary Allocations is given below):

The Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006  has come into effect from 5th August, 2011. The Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Rules, 1955 stood repealed with commencement of theFSS Act. FSSAI takes up the issue of effective implementation and enforcement of the provisions of FSS Act, Rules and regulations thereunder with the State authorities through intermittent communications and interactions during the meetings of the Central Advisory Committee in which Commissioners of Food Safety of all States and UTs are represented. Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products , including soft/cold  drinks,  are undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/ UTs to check that they comply with the standards laid down under FSS Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In cases, where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Junk Food is a term used for food containing high levels of calories from sugar or fat with little fiber, protein, vitamins or minerals. These foods lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels (high glycemic index) which forces the body to produce high levels of insulin to counter the rising blood sugar.

As reported by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), development of obesity is multi-factorial and eating of junk and processed food is one of them. Childhood obesity is a risk factor of developing heart diseases and diabetes in later life.

The results available from 15 States/UTs of an ongoing ICMR India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) Study on the prevalence of diabetes indicate overall prevalence of Diabetes varying from 4% to 13%. According to the Report of National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, there were 641 lakh cases of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) in India in the year 2015.

Ministry of Women and Child Development had constituted a Working Group on addressing consumption of foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) and promotion of healthy snacks in schools of India, which has given its report.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) constituted an Expert Group on Salt, Sugar and Fat. The Expert Group prepared a draft report on consumption of these items and its health impacts among Indian population and recommendations on healthy dietary intake of these items. While preparing the above report, Expert Group has considered WHO guidelines on ‘Sugar Intake for Adults and Children regarding the adverse impact of high sugar in foods.

ICMR, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and other institutions carry out research and studies related to food and healthy diet. Apart from this, the consumers are made aware of food safety through consumer awareness programmes launched jointly by the Department of Consumer Affairs and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) which also includes advertisements in different media, campaigns, educational booklets, information on FSSAI website and Mass awareness campaigns.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is all geared up for its 2nd  round of National Deworming Day (NDD) 2017 on 10th August in 33 States/UTs followed by mop-up activities on 17th August targeting 31 crore children. A total of 7.8 crore children are targeted in private schools and 3.5 crore out of school children will be covered in this program through Anganwadi workers and ASHAs.

 

This is one of the largest public health programs reaching large number of children during a short period. The first NDD round of 2017 implemented in February covered 26 crore children with a coverage of 89%.

 

The NDD program has been launched in 2015 as WHO estimates that 220 million children below 14 years of age are at risk of STH infections in India. National Deworming Day is organised twice in a year covering all the children from 1-19 years of age except the States of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh where deworming is carried out once in a year. The Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) prevalence in these two States is less than 20%. All the children are provided deworming tablet in schools and anganwadis. The deworming has the potential to improve nutritional status of children. The deworming tablet called ‘Albendazole’ is a safe and efficacious drug for controlling worm infestation.

 

The first round of NDD was observed in February 2015 and 8.9 crore children were administered the deworming tablet across 11 states/UTs by achieving 85% coverage. Thereafter, 25 crore, 12 crore and 26 crore children were covered in NDD February 2016, August 2016 and February 2017 rounds respectively.

During NDD, besides the deworming tablet, various health promotion activities related to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) are also being organised in schools and anganwadis. This program is being implemented in close collaboration with Ministry of Human Resource & Development and Ministry of Women & Child Development. The program strategies for effective implementation are planned as per the NDD operational guidelines which include Steering Committee Meetings at states and districts, timely integrated distribution of drugs, IEC materials, community awareness and mobilization efforts to include out-of-school and unregistered children into the program.           

 

National Deworming Day aims to reach every child, regardless of their socio-economic circumstance. Schools and anganwadis are ideal platforms for such a program, reaching children in their natural environment in a coordinated, cost-effective, and systematic way. In addition, through extensive awareness generation and community mobilization efforts at state, district, and community levels, children who are out of school, live in hard-to-reach areas, and are from vulnerable populations are also mobilized to be dewormed at anganwadis on National Deworming Day.

 

A coordinated effort is rolled out across the country with tablets, communication material, and reporting forms delivered to the very last school and anganwadi well in time for the deworming program. Officials and functionaries at all levels are trained, including teachers and anganwadi workers, who are pillars of the program. This results in lakhs of anganwadi workers and teachers, who are trusted by the community, administering the deworming tablet to crores of children on a single day across the country.

 

Deworming may have very few side effects and some children, especially those with high worm infections, might experience nausea, mild abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, and fatigue. In line with the guidance from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, comprehensive adverse event protocols have been put in place.

 

Apart from being dewormed, maintaining healthy and hygienic practices will help children and communities remain safe from worm infections.

*The Referral Food Laboratories work as appellate laboratories for the purpose of analysis of appeal samples of food lifted by the Food Safety Officers of the State/UTs and local bodies and the imported food samples

 

A  Scheme, inter alia, for strengthening of State Food Testing labs (atleast one in each state with a provision of 2 labs in large states) and support for Mobile Food labs (one mobile lab for every 20 district with a provision of atleast one mobile lab in each state) has been rolled out by FSSAI  withan outlay of Rs. 481.95 Crore. Under the scheme, the State Food Testing Laboratories are under the obligation to attain the NABL Accreditation i.e. International Standards Organization Accreditation (ISO/IEC 17025:2005).

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

Health is a State subject, however to supplement the efforts of State, the Government of India is implementing  National Programme for Palliative Care (NPPC) under National Health Mission (NHM). There is no state-wise/national data maintained under NPPC, which suggest the inadequacy of number of palliative care units in the country as the support under the Program for the States/UTs is primarily for establishing basic palliative care services at district hospitals.

 

The program is a part of the ‘Mission Flexipool’ of National Health Mission (NHM). A framework of operational and financial guidelines for the states has been developed, on the basis of which the states/UTs prepare their proposals related to palliative care and incorporate them in their respective Programme Implementation Plan (PIPs) to seek financial support under NHM. The palliative care units at district hospitals, which are supported under the program, are at different stages of getting operational. A list of the districts covered, so far, under the program is given below:

                The Twelfth Five Year Plan projected to increase total public fund, plan and non-plan on core health to 1.87 per cent of GDP by the end of Twelfth Plan. The National Health Policy, 2017 envisages increasing public expenditure on health to 2.5% of GDP in a time bound manner by 2025.

As per WHO Global Health Expenditure database 2014, the expenditure on healthcare for BRICS is China (3%), the Russian Federation (4%), Brazil (4%) and South Africa (4%) of Gross Domestic Product. The Government spending on healthcare in India as a percentage of GDP has increased from 1.16% in 2004-05 (Actual) to 1.4% in 2016-17 (BE) as per Economic Survey.

The allocation of funds for health sector is based inter-alia, on the availability of resources and competing claims on these resources. An increase in economic growth makes available increased resources for funding the health sector. In addition to this, availability of overall resources, past utilization, requirements and absorptive capacity inter-alia guide the allocations to the health sector.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the provision of healthcare services is the primary responsibility of the respective State/UT Governments. However, under National Health Mission (NHM) technical and financial support is provided to the States/U.Ts to strengthen their health systems, including support for projects/programmes under Public Private Partnership mode based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIP) within their overall resource envelop to achieve universal health coverage.

Towards this, based on consultation with States and other stakeholders, under NHM, Guidelines for provision of healthcare services under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode have been circulated to the States/UTs for:

• Emergency Transport Services

• Mobile Medical Units Services

• Provision of Free Diagnostics Service Initiative (Free Pathological Services, Free Tele radiology Services, Free CT Scan Services)

• Biomedical Equipment Management Maintenance Programme

• National Dialysis Programme

• Provision of Hospital Waste management, segregation, treatment and disposal services in health facilities

• Management of the Health Facilities by NGOs under PPP mode

Further, after consultations with the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, States and other stakeholders and with the assistance of the World Bank Group, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog has developed a draft Model Concessionaire Agreement (MCA) for the provision of prevention and treatment services for non-communicable diseases (Cardiovascular diseases, Oncology and Pulmonary Sciences) at the district level, especially in Tier 2 & 3 cities, to bring advanced healthcare systems where there is clear unmet need. The States have the flexibility to adopt or not to adopt and to customize the model document before rolling out the initiative as well as to decide the strata of society to be provided services free of cost.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

* - Includes provisions for State share under NHM

Under National Health Mission financial and technical support is provided to States/ UTs for strengthening their healthcare system based on the proposals received from the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans. This support includes support for transforming of 1.25 lakh Sub Centres to Health & Wellness Centres in phased manner, for which in the current year, approvals have been given to 2323 Health and Wellness Centres in 9 States based on proposals received from them.

 

For ensuring prescription of generic drugs the provision in Medical Council of India’s code of Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics has already been amended on 8th October 2016. The provision mandates that every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters and he/she shall ensure that there is rational prescription of drugs.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                Increased consumption of soft drinks, colas and other canned foods, contribute to obesity which is risk factor of Hypertension, Cardio-vascular problems, Diabetes, Stoke, etc. Further, as per sub-regulation 2.2.2.3(ii) of the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, quantity of sugar per 100g or 100 ml or per serving of the products, is required to be specified on the label. However, there is no proposal to fix quantity of sugar in aerated drinks and energy tonics, under consideration in the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

                Central Licensing Authority i.e. Drugs Controller General (India) has given approval for conduct of various clinical trials of Antibiotics on children under one year of age. During the last three years, such clinical trials approved were mainly related to trials in Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) and Tuberculosis Meningitis in children. The details of the clinical trials are registered in Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), which is publicly available (www.ctri.nic.in).

 

Antibiotic use is a major driver of resistance. Neonates are more prone to infections and vulnerable to ineffective treatment. Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, especially during the first five days of life and in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).

 

Antibiotics are included in Schedule H and H1 to the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945, and, therefore, cannot be sold in retail except on and in accordance with the prescription of a Registered Medical Practitioner.

 

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has launched a programme on Antimicrobial Stewardship, Prevention of Infection and Control (ASPIC) in 2012. Functional infection control programmes not only cut down the rates of nosocomial infections, but also reduce the volume of antibiotic consumption and are a critical part of any comprehensive strategy to contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Further, a red line campaign has been launched to regulate over the counter sale of Schedule H antibiotics. The campaign is aimed at discouraging unnecessary prescription and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics causing drug resistance for several critical diseases including TB, malaria, urinary tract infection and even HIV.

 

The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has also launched a programme named ‘National Programme on Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance’ to address the problem of growing AMR.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                India, along with ten other WHO South East Asia Region member countries, have resolved to eliminate measles and control rubella/congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2020. In this direction, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has initiated measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign in the age group of 9 months to less than 15 years in a phased manner across the nation. The campaign aims to cover approximately 41 crore children and is going to be the largest ever vaccination campaign worldwide. All children from 9 months to less than 15 years of age will be given a single shot of Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccination during the campaign. Following the campaign, MR vaccine will become a part of routine immunization and will replace measles vaccine, currently given at 9-12 months and 16-24 months of age of child.

The first phase of measles-rubella vaccination campaign has been successfully completed in five states, namely, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. More than 3.3 crore children were vaccinated, reaching out to 97% of the intended age group. The campaign was carried out in schools, community centers and health facilities. The next round is starting in 8 states/UTs (Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Uttarakhand) from August 2017, aiming to cover 3.4 crore children.

The campaign aims to rapidly build up immunity for both measles and rubella diseases in the community so as to knock out the disease, therefore, all the children should receive MR vaccine during the campaign. For those children who have already received such vaccination, the campaign dose would provide additional boosting to them. In order to achieve maximum coverage during the campaign, multiple stakeholders have been involved, which includes, apart from Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, other Ministries, development partners, Lions clubs, professional bodies, for example, Indian Association of Pediatrics, Indian Medical Association, Civil Society Organizations etc.

The Measles-Rubella campaign is a part of global efforts to reduce illness and deaths due to measles and rubella/CRS in the country. Measles immunization directly contributes to the reduction of under-five child mortality, and in combination with rubella vaccine, it will control rubella and prevent CRS.

Health being a state subject, it is primarily the responsibility of States/UTs to ensure the availability of essential drugs including Hepatitis-C drugs in the States/UTs.  Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare delivery system including support for provision of essential drugs free of cost to those who access public health facilities under the NHM Free Drugs Service Initiative. All the States/UTs have reported that they have notified free drug policy in their respective States/UTs.  A National Steering Committee on Viral Hepatitis has also been formed for prevention, care and treatment of viral Hepatitis.

 The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                The Government has approved National Health Policy, 2017 with goal of attainment of the highest possible level of health and well-being for all, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence. Aligned to such policy goal, the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM),as a submission of National Health Mission (NHM), was approved in May 2013. It aims to provide equitable and quality primary health care services to the population in urban areas with special focus on slum and vulnerable sections of the society.

The National Health Policy 2017 envisages that for achieving the objective of having fully functional primary healthcare facilities especially in urban areas to reach under-serviced populations, the Government would collaborate with the private sector for operationalizing such health and wellness centres to provide a larger package of comprehensive primary health care across the country. Partnerships could be in areas of diagnostics services, ambulance services, safe blood services, rehabilitative services, palliative services, mental healthcare, telemedicine services etc.

Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, responsibility to provide healthcare facilities including in urban areas, falls under the jurisdictionof respective State/UT Governments. Under the NHM, technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening the healthcare systems including support for private sector partnership, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                The Central Government had constituted a Group of Experts (GoE) headed by late Prof. Ranjit Roy Choudhary to study the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and make recommendations to the Government to make the Medical Council of India (MCI) modern and suited to the prevailing conditions. The report of GoE was subsequently examined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health & Family Welfare and they too made their recommendations. Further, a four member committee headed by Vice Chairman NITI Aayog was constituted to examine all options for reforms in MCI and suggest way forward. The Committee has framed a draft “National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill” which provides for constitution of NMC in place of MCI. The draft Bill has been relooked by a Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted for the purpose. The GoM has approved the draft Bill with some modifications. The proposed National Medical Commission shall have an Appellate Tribunal and four boards viz. Under-Graduate medical Education Board (UGMEB), Post-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMED), Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) and Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB).

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                The allocation of funds for health sector is based, inter-alia, on the availability of resources and competing claims on these resources. An increase in economic growth makes available increased resources for funding the health sector. In addition to this, availability of overall resources, past utilization, requirements and absorptive capacity inter-alia guide the allocations to the health sector.

The National Health Policy 2017 proposes raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP in a time bound manner by 2025.

As per Economic Survey 2016-17 brought out by Ministry of Finance, expenditure by Government (Central and State Governments combined) on health as percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for last three years is as under:

(i) 2014-15 - 1.1%

(ii) 2015-16 - 1.3% (RE)

(iii) 2016-17 - 1.4 % (BE)

The funds allocated to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, for last three years and current year, are as under :

(i) 2014-15 - Rs. 39,237.82 Crore

(ii) 2015-16 - Rs. 33,282.17 Crore

(iii) 2016-17 - Rs. 39,532.55 Crore

(iv) 2017-18 - Rs. 50,592.63 Crore

                In order to ensure the quality of drugs in the country, both the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the state drug regulators pick up a large number of samples of drugs from all over the country and have them tested and analysed in the laboratories of the Central and State Governments. In a few cases, the samples tested and analysed do not meet the prescribed standards. The details of the drugs that do not meet the standards are immediately notified by the Central or State regulator concerned.

 

The Government is committed to ensuring that the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs are not compromised. With this in view, the Government has taken a series of measures including strengthening legal provisions, workshops and training programmes for manufacturers and regulatory officials and measures such as risk based inspections.

 

The manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs in the country are regulated under the provisions of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945 thereunder through a system of licensing and inspection. Licenses for manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs are granted by the State Licensing Authorities (SLAs) appointed by respective State Governments. SLAs are legally empowered to take stringent action against violation of provision of the Act and Rules including product recall.

                As per latest data, IMR has reduced by 58% in India during the period of 1990-2015 which is more than to Global decline of 49% during the same period. The full immunization coverage also improved from 43.5% in 2005 to 62.0% in 2015 and mortality due to Tuberculosis has reduced from 76 per 1,00,000 in 1990 to 32 per 1,00,000 in 2015.

 

The steps being taken by the government to further combat infant mortality and increase vaccine coverage under the National Health Mission are as under:

(1) Promotion of Institutional deliveries through cash incentive under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) which entitles all pregnant women delivering in public health institutions to absolutely free ante-natal check-ups, delivery including Caesarean section, post-natal care and treatment of sick infants till one year of age.

(2) Strengthening of delivery points for providing comprehensive and quality Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) Services, ensuring essential newborn care at all delivery points, establishment of Special Newborn Care Units (SNCU),

Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSU) and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units for care of sick and small babies. Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) is being provided by ASHAs to improve child rearing practices. India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) was launched in 2014 to make concerted efforts towards attainment of the goals of “Single Digit Neonatal Mortality Rate” and “Single Digit Stillbirth Rate”, by 2030.

(3) Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices are promoted in convergence with Ministry of Women and Child Development. Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs) are observed for provision of maternal and child health services and creating awareness on maternal and child care including health and nutrition education. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched MAA-Mothers’ Absolute Affection programme in August 2016 for improving breastfeeding practices (Initial Breastfeeding within one hour, Exclusive Breastfeeding up to six months and complementary Breastfeeding up to two years) through mass media and capacity building of health care providers in health facilities as well as in communities.

(4) Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is being supported to provide vaccination to children against many life threatening diseases such as Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis B and Measles. Pentavalent vaccine has been introduced all across the country and “Mission Indradhanush” has been launched to fully immunize children who are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated; those that have not been covered during the rounds of routine immunization for various reasons.Measles Rubella Campaign is being undertaken in select States for children from 9 months to 15 years of age with the aim of eliminating Measles by 2020.

(5) Name based tracking of mothers and children till two years of age (Mother and Child Tracking System) is done to ensure complete antenatal, intranatal, postnatal care and complete immunization as per schedule.

(6) Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) for health screening, early detection of birth defects, diseases, deficiencies, development delays including disability and early intervention services has been Operationalized to provide comprehensive care to all the children in the age group of 0-18 years in the community.

(7) Some other important interventions are Iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for the prevention of anaemia among the vulnerable age groups, home visits by ASHAs to promote exclusive breast feeding and promote use of ORS and Zinc for management of diarrhoea in children.

(8) Capacity building of health care providers: Various trainings are being conducted under National Health Mission (NHM) to build and upgrade the skills of health care providers in basic and comprehensive obstetric care of mother during pregnancy, delivery and essential newborn care.

(9) Low performing districts have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) which entitles them to receive high per capita funding, relaxed norms, enhanced monitoring and focused supportive supervisions and encouragement to adopt innovative approaches to address their peculiar health challenges.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                The Government has launched the ‘Test and Treat Policy for HIV patients’ in April 2017. As per this policy all people living with HIV (PLHIV) are to be treated with Antiretro Viral Therapy regardless of CD4 count, clinical stage, age or population. The National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS and STI 2017-24 has been approved in June 2017.

The details of the strategies under National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS and STI 2017-24 are as follows:

 

(i) Accelerating HIV prevention in key population and ‘at risk group’.

 (ii) Expanding quality assured HIV testing with universal access to comprehensive HIV care.

  (iii)  Elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and syphilis .

 (iv) Addressing the critical enablers in HIV programming

 (v)  Restructuring the strategic information system to be efficient and patient-centric.  

 

As per HIV estimation 2015, India is estimated to have 21 lakhs people infected with HIV and 15.2 lakhs PLHIV know their HIV status through the strategy of scaling up of HIV counseling & testing services in  23,019 health facilities.

A total of 536 Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) centres are providing ART treatment across the country.

The National Guidelines on HIV Counselling & Testing Services were revised in Dec 2016. They include the HIV screening through trained ancillary health care provider in community based setting for priority population including High Risk Groups, TB suspect & patients, STI/RTI attendees, sexual partners/ spouses of PLHIV, prison inmates, pregnant women, adolescent age group etc.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Central Government provides assistance to the States for strengthening of health infrastructure under the National Health Mission. This facilitates treatment for various diseases and emergencies including snake bites. Health being a State subject, the Ministry has asked the States to procure anti-snake venom serum under National Health Mission after reflecting the same in their annual PIP for approvals.

 Rabies is transmitted to the humans following bite of animals (dogs, cats, monkeys, mongoose etc.) infected by rabies virus. For prevention of deaths due to Rabies, Government of India is implementing the National Rabies Control Programme in the country. The objectives of the program are to:

 

·         Prevent human deaths due to rabies

·         Prevent transmission of rabies virus in dog population

·         Mass vaccination of dogs.

·         Dog population management

·         Strengthening surveillance & response.

 

To prevent deaths due to human rabies, the strategy adopted is to implement more cost effective Intra Dermal (ID) route of inoculation for anti-rabies vaccines for Category II & Category III bites and infiltration of Rabies immunoglobulin in all Cat III bites in all major anti-rabies clinics of government health facilities. 

 The States are asked to organize training of health professional on animal bite management and ID route of anti-rabies vaccination, IEC activities for community awareness on dos’ and don’ts in the eventof animal bite, strengthening surveillance of human rabies and strengthening lab diagnostics for rabies.

 As per reports received from the States, details of State wise deaths due to snake bite and rabies, during the last three years in the country are given below:

                Breastfeeding Week is observed in the first week of August to focus attention on the important aspect of promotion and support of breastfeeding. The theme of this year’s breastfeeding week is ‘Sustaining Breastfeeding’. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has planned various activities at the national level during this week in association with IAP and Rammohan Lohia Hospital.

 To intensify the efforts further for promotion of breastfeeding, the Health Ministry has initiated a nationwide programme called “MAA-Mother’s Absolute Affection'’ to bring undiluted focus on promotion of breastfeeding and provision of services towards supporting breastfeeding, along with ongoing efforts of routine health systems. In addition, “National Guidelines on Lactation Management Centres in Public Health Facilities” have been recently released to facilitate establishment of lactation management centres for ensuring that the sick and pre-term babies are fed with safe human breast milk.

The key components of the MAA programme are awareness generation, promotion of breastfeeding & inter personal counselling at community level,  skilled support for breastfeeding at delivery points and monitoring and Award/ recognition of health facility. Under this programme, ASHA has been incentivized for reaching out to pregnant and lactating mothers and provide information on benefits and techniques of successful breastfeeding during interpersonal communication. ANMs at all sub-centres and health personnel at all delivery points are being trained for providing skilled support to mothers referred with issues related to breastfeeding.

 Under NHM, funding support has been recommended for all States and UTs (since 2016) for successful implementation of the MAA programme. 23 States have started implementing various activities under MAA programme such as one day sensitization of health staffs, convergence meetings with line departments, Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) training of staffs at health facilities, communication activities using mass media and mid-media etc. Around 2.5 lakhs ASHAs and 40,000 health staffs including programme managers at district and block level, doctors (MOs), staff nurses (SNs) and ANMs have been sensitized for breastfeeding promotion strategies under MAA programme and around 2800 health facility staffs (MOs, SNs and ANMs) are trained in 4 days IYCF training. In addition more than 75,000 mother’s meetings were also carried out by ASHAs at village level to sensitize mothers regarding importance of appropriate breastfeeding practices.

 Breastfeeding is an important efficient and cost-effective intervention promoting child survival and health.Breastfeeding within an hour of birth could prevent 20% of the newborn deaths. Infants who are not breastfed are 15 times more likely to die from pnuemonia and 11 times more likely to die from diarrhoea than children who are exclusively breastfed, which are two leading causes of death in children under-five years of age. In addition, children who were not breastfed are at increased risk for diabetes, obesity, allergies, asthma, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death syndrome etc. Apart from mortality and morbidity benefits, breastfeeding also has tremendous impact on improved IQ.

 The trend of breastfeeding has shown an upward trend. As per recent data, initial breastfeeding has been nearly doubled in last decade. i.e from 23.4 per cent to 41.6 per cent (NFHs-3, 2005-06 and 4, 2015-16). Significant improvement has also been reported for exclusive breastfeeding as proportion of children under age 6 months exclusively breastfed, has gone up to 54.9 (NFHS-4) per cent from 46.4 per cent (NFHS-3). However, there is further scope of improving initial breastfeeding rates considering the high proportion of institutional deliveries in the country.

                Both the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the state drug regulators pick up a large number of samples of drugs from all over the country and have them tested and analysed in the laboratories of the Central and State Governments. In a few cases, the samples tested and analysed do not meet the prescribed standards. The details of the drugs that do not meet the standards are immediately notified by the Central or State regulator concerned. In the case of samples picked up by CDSCO, the list of drugs declared as ‘Not of Standard Quality’ (NSQ)/ spurious/ adulterated/misbranded alongwith the names of respective manufacturers is regularly uploaded on the website of CDSCO (www.cdsco.nic.in) since 2012, under the heading “Drug Alert”. However, such data in respect of the samples picked up by State drug regulators is not maintained centrally.

                As per the UN Inter–Agency estimates in the publication “Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015"", It is estimated that India accounts for 15% of the total global maternal deaths.

As per SRS 2001-03 major reasons of maternal deaths are Haemorrhage (38%) Sepsis (11%), Abortion (8%), Hypertensive disorders (5%), Obstructed labor (5%) and other causes (34%) - including anaemia and various other causes.

To address the issue of poor health, anaemia and deficient medical facilities, Government of India has taken several steps:


	Operationalization of Sub-Centers, Primary Health Centers, Community Health Centers and District Hospitals for providing 24x7 basic and comprehensive obstetric care.



	To overcome the shortage of maternity beds so that quality care can be given to pregnant women and neonates, Mother and Child Health wings (MCH wings) have been sanctioned at high case load delivery points, based on the proposal received from the States and UTs in their annual Project Implementation Plans (PIPs).



	Operationalization of Safe Abortion Services and Reproductive Tract Infections and Sexually Transmitted Infections (RTI/STI) at health facilities with a focus on “Delivery Points”.
	Capacity building of health care providers in basic and comprehensive obstetric care with a strategic initiative “Dakshata” to enable service providers in providing high quality services during childbirth at the institutions.



	Augmenting the availability of skilled manpower at health facilities for providing basic comprehensive & emergency obstetric care, different skill-based trainings such as Skilled Birth Attendance for Auxiliary Nurse Midwives/Staff Nurses/Lady Health Visitors; training of MBBS Doctors in Life Saving Anaesthetic Skills, Emergency Obstetric Care including Caesarean Section.



	Universal screening of pregnant women for anaemia is a part of ante-natal care and all pregnant women are to be provided iron and folic acid tablets during their ante-natal and post natal visits.After the first trimester of pregnancy, every pregnant woman during ANC is to be given iron and folic acid (IFA) tablets for six months, and six months post-partum. Pregnant women, who are found to be clinically anaemic, are to be given double the dose of IFA.

                With the aim to accelerating the full immunization coverage and provide greater focus on urban areas and other pockets of low immunization coverage, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has drawn up an aggressive action plan to achieve the target by 2018. According to the plan, States will conduct Intensified Mission Indradhanush drives for 7 working days from 7th day of every month starting from 7th October 2017 for four consecutive months excluding Sundays, holidays and Routine Immunization days. A total of 118 districts, 17 urban areas and 52 districts of North East states will be targeted under Intensified Mission Indradhanush.

Under Intensified Mission Indradhanush, greater focus will be given on urban areas which were one of the gaps of Mission Indradhanush. This will be done through mapping of all underserved population in urban areas and need-based deployment of ANMs for providing vaccination services in these areas. Mobility support to field staff for deployment to such areas in urban as well as rural areas will be provided.

Intensive monitoring and strong accountability mechanism is being established at all levels with Cabinet Secretary at national level and the Chief Secretary at state level reviewing the preparations and progress. Every district identified for Intensified Mission Indradhanush will be monitored by partners through an identified nodal person for each district. Further, emphasis will also be given on integration of Intensified Mission Indradhanush sessions into routine immunization microplans after completion of for rounds of Intensified Mission Indradhanush. The integration of these sessions will also be monitored by partners and senior government officials.

A distinctive feature of Intensified Mission Indradhanush is that greater focus is being given on convergence with other ministries/departments especially women and child development, panchayati raj, urban development, youth affairs, NCC etc. The convergence of ground level workers of various departments like ASHA, ANMs, Anganwadi workers, Zila preraks under NULM, self-help groups will be crucial for successful implementation of Intensified Mission Indradhanush.

Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) of India prevents mortality and morbidity in children and pregnant women against 12 vaccine preventable diseases. In the past it has been seen that the increase in immunization coverage had slowed down and it increased at the rate of 1% per year between 2009 and 2013. To accelerate this coverage Mission Indradhanush was envisaged and implemented since 2015 to rapidly increase the full immunization coverage to 90%.

Four phases of Mission Indradhanush have been completed in 528 districts across the country. More than 2.47 crore children and around 67 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated under Mission Indradhanush so far. The first two phases of Mission Indradhanush led to an increase of 6.7% full immunization coverage in 1 year as compared to 1% increase in the past. This increase has been more prominent in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

            Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are under the administrative control of their respective Ministries / Departments and CPSEs are required to follow the various statutory provisions / Court orders / Government instructions including instructions on wage related issues of various categories of employees, wherever applicable. However, the responsibility to monitor the implementation of above said statutory provisions / court orders / Government instructions vests with the Board of CPSEs and the concerned administrative Ministry / Department. As such, no centralized information in this regard is maintained by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) and accordingly no status report on implementation of Supreme Court verdict on equal pay for equal work with reference to the contractual and temporary employees in CPSEs is also maintained in Department of Public Enterprises.

                As per information available from Ministries/Departments, 6 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) have been closed during the last two years i.e. 2014-15 and 2015-16. During 2014-15 and 2015-16, 76 CPSEs and 78 CPSEs were incurring losses respectively. The information of Private Enterprises is not centrally maintained in Department of Public Enterprises.

The proposals to restart closed down CPSEs or making loss incurring CPSEs into profitable is dealt with by the concerned administrative Ministries/Departments and the management of concerned CPSEs.

There were 378 employees working in these closed CPSEs.

Steps are taken by Government to revive loss making CPSEs in terms of (a) financial restructuring such as, conversion of loan into equity, waiver of loan and interest including penal interest, Government guarantee for raising loans, grant of moratorium on payment of interest/loan, (b) business restructuring, such as, formation of joint ventures, merger with another PSE, modernization and improved marketing strategies, human resources management and entering into technology joint ventures or strategic alliances etc.

                Since Industry is a State subject, the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) does not maintain any centralized data regarding generation of new employment and investment made in heavy industries in the country. The role of DHI is confined to the administration of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. So far as details of employment and investment in CPSEs, in the country, is concerned, the Public Enterprises Survey 2015 – 16, already laid in both the houses of Parliament on 21st March, 2017 indicates that the total number of employees in CPSEs is declining every year since 2009 – 10 except during 2011 -12 and the investment in these CPSEs during the last 3 years i.e. 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 was Rs. 992095.67 cr., 1095554.32 cr. and 1171844.25 cr. respectively.

            With a view to promote electric mobility in the country, the Government of India approved the National Mission on Electric Mobility (NMEM) in 2011 and subsequently National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 was unveiled in 2013. This Mission Plan has been designed mainly considering the Fuel Security and Environmental Pollution in the country. NMEM aims for a cumulative fuel saving of about 9500 million litres equivalent resulting in reduction of pollution and green house gas emission of 2 million tonnes with targeted market penetration of 6-7 million vehicles by 2020.

 

As part of this mission, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a scheme namely FAME -India [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India]. The overall scheme is proposed to be implemented over a period of 6 years, till 2020, wherein it is intended to support   the  hybrid  /  electric   vehicles   market   development    and    its manufacturing eco-system to achieve self-sustenance at the  end of the stipulated period. The scheme is one of the green initiatives of the Government of India, which will be one of the biggest contributors in reducing pollution from road transport sector in near future. The scheme has 4 focus areas i.e. Technology Development, Demand Creation, Pilot Projects and Charging Infrastructure.

 

Under FAME India Scheme, 148275 electric/hybrid vehicles (xEVs) have been given direct support by way of demand incentives amounting to Rs. 192.56 Crore (Approx) since its launch on 1st April 2015 and till 30th June 2017. This has resulted in approximately fuel saving of 13553917 litre and CO2 reduction of 33971052 Kg.

 

For promotion of electric mobility, the Government has already given financial support under different focus area of the FAME India Scheme since its inception on 1st April 2017, as per detail given below:

                National Capital Goods Policy, 2016 has identified that issues like lack of positive bias towards domestic value addition in public procurement policies, difficult contract conditions, persistent import and use of second-hand machinery with no incentive for replacement, zero duty import under ‘Project Imports’ and delays in project implementation are having an adverse effect on the domestic demand of capital goods.

 

            In February, 2017, Ministry of Finance has revised General Financial Rules to encourage procurement by domestic manufacturers by introducing elements like government e-market place, life cycle cost, reverse auction and purchase preference to locally manufactured goods.

 

            Recently,  on 15th June, 2017, Ministry of Commerce and Industry has issued a detailed Order on Public Procurement  to enhance the positive impact of Public Procurement on ‘Make in India’ initiative through measures like requirement of purchase preference to local suppliers, minimum local content, requirement for specification in advance, increase in minimum local content and manufacturing under licence,  technology collaboration agreement with phased indigenization. 

 

            Also, Ministry of Defence had revised their Procurement Procedure with effect from 01.04.2016 which have provisions to facilitate participation of domestic manufacturers in defence procurement.

 

         This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.

                Government of India  approved the National Mission on Electric  Mobility  in  2011 and  subsequently  National  Electric  Mobility Mission Plan 2020  was  unveiled in 2013. Under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020, Government of India has an ambitious target to achieve 60-70 lakh sales of hybrid and electric vehicles by 2020.

 

            As part of the mission, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a scheme namely FAME -India [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India]. The overall scheme is proposed  to be implemented over a period of 6 years, till 2020, wherein it is intended to support the  hybrid / electric   vehicles market   development and its manufacturing eco-system to achieve self-sustenance at the end of   the stipulated period. At present, the Phase-1 of the scheme is being implemented, which was originally for a period of 2 years commencing from 1st April 2015 till 31st March 2017, and has now been extended for a further period of 6 months till 30th September 2017.

 

            Since FAME India Scheme, at present, is not applicable PAN-India in totality, the Department captures the data of vehicles which are sold under Demand Creation focus area of the scheme, whereby demand incentive is  extended for purchase of electric & hybrid vehicles in these covered areas.             Under the scheme, a total of 1,50,550 electric/hybrid vehicles were extended incentive as on 26th July 2017.

                The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju has said the MHA recently launched the robust Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS), which will mark a huge jump in national security. Shri Rijiju was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 10th Annual Summit on Cyber and Network Security here today. He said in our country we have the rule of law, and not ruled by law. Unlike authoritarian countries where enforcement is easy, here citizen awareness is very important, he added.

Encouraging the private sector to partner with the Government in Cyber Security, Shri Rijiju said the digital age has dawned upon us. There is no escaping the digital economy, he said adding, every aspect of modern life is dependent on the cyber world, be it health, banking or taxation. Cashless economy is a reality, the Minister said, adding that the more we become exposed to the cyber world, the more vulnerable we become to the looming cyber threats and malwares, which may even lead to the economy crippling in the wake of a cyber attack. Shri Rijiju said that we will have to live in this cyber world; at the same time we have to protect our national security and identity.

Asking industry to promote the Indian languages, Shri Rijiju observed that studies reveal that English language is the most prone to cyber attacks worldwide, and that it might be of interest to see how other foreign languages such as the Chinese fare facing cyber threats.

In his address, Dr Gulshan Rai, National Cyber Security Coordinator, said cyber security has become paramount since the world over the challenge facing mankind is cyber war, barring a rare nuclear threat over the Korea peninsula. Still, the effect of a conventional or nuclear war would be geographically localized, but the cyber war is affecting scores of nations. The word “cyber” is embedded today into every aspect of our lives, driving efficiency and increasing productivity of the various systems, he added.

On the occasion, Shri Rijiju released the ASSOCHAM Knowledge Report on “Securing the nation’s cyber space.”

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the YUVA – a skill development programme and an initiative by Delhi Police under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, here today. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that these kind of initiatives improve the image of the police among common man. He said that it is a big task that Delhi Police has opened skill development training centres in the police stations. He said that the 21st Century India will also like to see Indian police in this form only. The Home Minister said that core policing is important for any police, but at the same time the police should also adopt people-friendly measures and increase their social interaction. He also thanked the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship for the YUVA project. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that the Police should engage with the youth who are prone to drug addiction and other crimes. He expressed happiness over the fact that efforts are being made that about 70-80% youth under this project get employment. He further said that it is the collective responsibility of the police and the society to bring the youth of the country on right path. He appreciated the fact that Delhi Police has started this project with the same objective in mind. 

Addressing the gathering, the Minister of State for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (Independent Charge) Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the skill development has increased the employability among the youth. He said that the system in the country needs to be such that it gives enough importance to the skills possessed by any individual. He added that many skills are in huge demand world over and our youth can tap this opportunity, if groomed properly. 

Speaking on the occasion, Lt. Governor, Delhi, Shri Anil Baijal said that the Government is making efforts to reorient the working of Delhi Police. He also emphasised that the police should establish connect with the youth and community. He also said that the YUVA programme is a big initiative to make youth employable. 

The Delhi Police Commissioner, Shri Amulya Patnaik also emphasised on the need of social service along with prevention of crimes. He said that due to this project, a lot of alienated youth can be brought into the mainstream. 

The ‘YUVA’ initiative by Delhi Police aims to connect with youth by upgrading their skill as per their competencies. It will help them to get a gainful employment under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna under the Ministry of Skill Development. Delhi Police has tied up with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) for providing mass job linked skill training for the selected youth. National Skill Development Corporation shall be providing skill training to the youth under ‘Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna’ (PMKVY) and CII will provide job linked training through its Sector Skill Councils who are connected to industry and thereby provide job guarantee. 

A detailed exercise was conducted in all 13 districts of Delhi Police to select the youth in the age of 17-25 years for this training belonging to categories such as School dropouts, Juvenile offenders, Victims of crimes and families in dire state due to incarceration of the bread earner of the family, mostly from the underprivileged colonies. 

So far, 2,269 candidates have been selected to be trained by 36 training partners in 45 skills in the next three months. A total of 32 police station buildings have been identified where Skill Development Centers would be opened at the earliest. 

The youth coming for skill training in a police station building will be a huge step in building up their confidence and faith in police organization and will go a long way in building a positive image of police in the long run.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today reviewed the internal security and law & order situation in the country in general and in Haryana and adjoining areas, and Jammu & Kashmir in particular. 

The situation in Haryana was assessed at present to be under control, though it is being carefully monitored. The Home Minister took note of the assurance of DGP, Haryana that the law & order situation in Haryana would be kept in control. 

The Home Minister also reviewed the on-going encounter in Pulwama, J&K. He expressed his profound sorrow over the martyrdom of one personnel of J&K Police and two personnel of CRPF, and expressed his heart-felt condolences to the families of these brave policemen. The terrorists have been cornered in a set of Government quarters and action to flush them out is in process. The exact number of terrorists is still not known. Two SPOs of J&K are trapped in the building where the terrorists have been cornered. 

The Home Minister expressed the hope that these two SPOs would be rescued safely soon.

                Following is the Country Statement of India at the 9th meeting of Heads of Governments of SCO dealing with the prevention and elimination of emergency situation, made by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh at Cholpon- Ata in Kyrgyz Republic today:

“India warmly congratulates Mr Almazbek Atambayev, the President of Kyrgyz Republic and Minister Boronov for the excellent arrangements for this ninth meeting.  I am told that the Experts Group meeting yesterday was also held with a great sense of camaraderie and purpose to develop a comprehensive agenda for prevention and elimination of emergencies.

As a new member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, we are happy to note that the area of cooperation identified for this meeting is timely and appropriate.

Over the period 1996 to 2015, the SCO countries have lost 300,000 lives to natural disasters. The economic losses from disasters are also extremely high and cascading. We are all exposed to a range of natural and man-made hazards. Natural events like earthquakes, floods, storms, landslides, epidemics etc are the major killers. The frequency and intensity of hydro-meteorological hazards is likely to rise in view of the climate change. If we do not make our communities, our capital assets, our economic activities resilient, disaster losses will continue to rise. For us in SCO nations, mitigating these risks is central to ensuring that our economic growth, our human development is sustainable.

In an interconnected world, risk reduction is no longer merely a local activity. Actions in one part of the world affect risks in other parts of the world. Even when there is no obvious link between disasters in two distant geographies, underlying challenges in preventing disasters are common across the world. Therefore, we must continually learn from each other, innovate, and push the envelope so that we can build a safer world for ourselves and for the generations to come.

Nearly 40% of the humanity lives in our countries. We represent some of the fastest growing economies. If we are able to prevent and reduce the impact of disasters and emergencies, it will have huge global benefits as well. None of the global targets on reducing disasters losses – whether they are enshrined in the Sendai Framework or Sustainable Development Goals – can be met by 2030, unless they are achieved by the SCO countries. International cooperation in this area is therefore important for all of us.

In India, we are making concerted efforts to reduce preventable deaths and other losses. We are analyzing the patterns of disaster mortality and taking focused, steps.

Our effective handling of two major cyclones- Phailin and Hudhud in the recent past is the direct outcome of over a decade of policy initiatives, enhancement of early warning capabilities, advance preparation, training and capacity development. In these two disasters, loss of lives was reduced to 45 persons compared to nearly 10,000 lives in the 1999 Odisha cyclone alone. In other words, in little over a decade, we have been able to reduce the loss of lives to less than 1% in comparison to that of the past.

In addition to reduction in cyclones related mortality, we have taken urgent steps to reduce deaths related to extreme temperatures.  Working across the entire chain of stakeholders – meteorologists, disaster managers, public health officials, municipal bodies, construction site managers, water and power supply departments – we have improved heat wave early warning protocols and their application at the local level. This has helped us achieve significant reduction in heat wave-related deaths: from more than 2,000 in 2015 to 250 in 2017.

For low-frequency, high-impact events such as earthquakes, reducing mortality-risk would be a long-term endeavor; but we have already made the beginning. Among other things, we have made improvements in risk-resilience arrangements at the national and local levels to ensure a safer-built environment. Our National Disaster Management Plan launched in 2016 addresses these systemic issues. In addition to the National Plan, all our states and 90% of our districts have completed their disaster management plans.

India believes that cooperation on prevention of disasters and emergencies within the SCO framework will give added impetus to our domestic efforts. At the same time, there are useful lessons from our work in India that other SCO member states can benefit from. Within the overall framework of cooperation, I would like to highlight three specific themes for your consideration:

First in the list is cooperation on reducing earthquake-related losses. Over the last twenty years, earthquakes have taken lives of more than 200,000 people, which accounts for two-thirds of disaster related mortality in SCO countries. We must develop concrete cooperation activities to reduce the losses in future.

In this regard, a joint Urban Earthquake Search and Rescue exercise will be very useful in improving our collective preparedness. When the Search and Rescue teams engage in a joint exercise, they not only build a common understanding of internationally recognised procedures to coordinate in emergencies, they also build personal acquaintances and friendships that come in handy when they have to respond together. India offers to host a joint exercise on Urban Earthquake Search and Rescue in 2019.

In addition, a meeting of technical experts can be organised to facilitate exchange of knowledge and experiences on earthquake-resistant building construction, model building codes and standard processes for ensuring compliance. This can help address the medium and long term issues for reducing earthquake losses.

Secondly, we can work on regional cooperation for making our infrastructure disaster-resilient. Over the coming decades, investment in infrastructure in the SCO countries will be the driver of sustainable development. It is important to ensure that this infrastructure is resilient to the impact of disasters. Within the SCO framework we should exchange knowledge, experience and expertise on making infrastructure resilient through better understanding of risks, standards of design, and stronger technical capacities.

Finally, we need cooperation in the area of early warning systems for extreme weather events. The SCO member states may have very different climate and weather systems but the underlying processes for forecasting adverse weather events, anticipating their impacts and issuing early warnings remain the same. A technical meeting of representatives of our meteorological services will be a very beneficial first step to foster collaboration in this area. The meeting can be structured around specific components of a comprehensive end-to-end severe weather early warning system. In this regard, India offers to host a meeting of the meteorological services of SCO countries in early 2019.

To conclude, I would like to reiterate that in achieving our common goals in preventing disasters and emergencies, India is willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with other SCO nations and explore all possible avenues of collaboration.

We have invested heavily in developing international collaborative initiatives:

·         We have established the Tsunami Early Warning System for the Indian Ocean Rim Countries

·         We have deployed our National Disaster Response Force in other affected countries for response operations

·         We have hosted joint bilateral exercises with SAARC and BIMSTEC countries

·         Last year we hosted the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction

·         And in May this year we launched the South Asia Geostationary Communication Satellite that will improve communication, weather forecasting, etc. among the South Asian countries

 

We will work with the same level of commitment under the SCO framework and offer to host the next meeting of this Forum in India in 2019. We are indeed looking forward to moving hand in hand with all of you and extend my invitation to heads of SCO Member State to attend the next meeting in India.

I am sure that the deliberations over the last two days will lay a strong foundation for our collective understanding and cooperation towards management, mitigation and reduction of disaster risks.

With these words, I thank our esteemed host once again and extend a warm invitation to all of you to visit India.

Thank you.”

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh is leading a delegation today to the Kyrgyz Republic to attend the 9th Meeting of Heads of Governments of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Member states to be held on August 24-25, 2017, dealing with the prevention and elimination of emergency situations. The Indian delegation includes senior officers from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Ministry of External Affairs.

India got the full membership of SCO this year and the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s annual Summit meeting held in Astana, Kazakhstan in June, 2017. The participation of India as SCO Member will open the additional opportunities for giving new impetus to the development of international cooperation in the field of protecting the population and territories from emergency situations within the framework of the SCO and will bring it qualitatively new positions in regional and global formats.

Meeting of Heads of Government authorities of Shanghai Cooperation Organization Member states will consider and approve the draft Action Plan for 2018-2019 for the implementation of the agreement between the governments of the SCO Member States on cooperation in providing assistance in the elimination of emergency situations.

During the visit, the Home Minister is likely to have bilateral meetings with the Ministers of some of the SCO Member States.

                A delegation of Gorkhaland Movement leaders called on the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh here today. The delegation submitted a memorandum of their demands to the Union Home Minister. Shri Rajnath Singh made an appeal to the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) and other stakeholders to call off the hunger strike, and also to withdraw the bandh call, allowing normalcy to return to the area. He also appealed to the West Bengal Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee to initiate a dialogue with the GJM and other stakeholders of Darjeeling, who are on a strike for last 60 days. 

Following is the text of appeal of the Union Home Minister: 

“The Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) has called for an indefinite strike in Darjeeling hills with effect from 12-06-2017 demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland. 

I am concerned about the developments in Darjeeling and the loss of valuable lives and sufferings of people over the past 60 days which pains me immensely. 

Violence can never be a solution to any problem. In a democracy, solutions are always found through restraint, mutual dialogue and within the legal ambit. 

We all are aware of the strategic importance of the locality and the challenges that we face in the region, and I am kept informed of the developments on a regular basis by my colleague, Shri S S Ahluwalia, MP, Darjeeling. 

Keeping in mind the national interest, as well as in the interest of our Gorkha brothers and sisters, who are brave and large hearted people and have contributed immensely to nation building, I appeal to GJM and all other stakeholders to call off the hunger strike, and also to withdraw the bandh call, allowing normalcy to return to the area. It is a move that will help to create an atmosphere for finding a solution to the current crisis. 

I also appeal to West Bengal Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee to initiate a dialogue with the GJM and other stakeholders of Darjeeling, who are on a strike for last 60 days. In the meantime, the state government should restore all civil supplies and also restore internet services, Cable TV & local channels. 

I also appeal to the people of Darjeeling to display sensitivity, and also keep in mind their civic responsibilities. No grievances & problems can be resolved without any dialogue.”

As per information received from State Government of Assam, 29 out of 33 districts have been affected due to heavy rains/ flood/ erosion during this monsoon season. As on 6th August 2017, 84 people have lost their lives and 25.42 lakh people have been affected by the flood.

The State Government has framed Disaster Management Manual 2015, which has stipulated roles and responsibilities for various line department and district administrations for management of flood. All required arrangements have been made accordingly by the State/ District administration.

As per the National Disaster Management Policy, the primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the States. The prevention and rehabilitation of flood affected people in flood prone areas is required to be undertaken by the concerned State Government from its own resources/ Plan funds. The State Government is providing relief assistance and looking for suitable land to rehabilitation of flood affected people as per its existing land policy.

The State Governments have been taking necessary rescue, relief & prevention measures in the affected areas which include evacuation of people to safer places, operation of relief camps, cattle camps and providing essential commodities viz. cooked food, rice/ rice bran, chura, wheat, salt, baby food, kerosene oil, matchboxes, candles, halogen tablet, fodder, Polythene sheets, etc. They are also taking necessary steps to prevent outbreak of any epidemic during floods/ post flood period.

NDMA has prepared guidelines on flood management and assisted them in the preparation of their flood management plans. It has provided an amount of Rs.61.4 lakh to the State Government of Assam in 2015-16 for strengthening of State Disaster Management Authority.

                Full Body Truck Scanners (FBTS) involve high end technology which require extensive technical evaluation for finalization of Qualitative Requirements (QRs) as well for examining bids by various specialist agencies. The infrastructure for installation of FBTS also involves elaborate civil work including clearance of soil reports etc. Also, No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) and Bhaba Atomic Research Centre(BARC) is required in view of the technology that involves radiations. Hence, though the global tender was floated on 26th February, 2015, price bid could only be opened on 26th July, 2016. Contract would be awarded on completion of all requisite formalities. Hence, it cannot be said that delay has occurred in this matter.

Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) and Guidelines have been issued from time to time to regulate and mitigate the security concerns in the Cross LoC Trade.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Sh. Anand Sharma in the Rajya Sabha today.

                As per reports of agencies, the demonetization of bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denomination resulted in significant positive impact on most theatres of violence in the country including stone pelting incidents in J&K. Since illegally held cash forms the major chunk of terrorist funding, after the demonetization, most of the cash held with the terrorists turned worthless. Demonetization also led to instant extinguishment of Pak-printed high quality Fake Indian Currency Notes. It also adversely affected the hawala operators.

The decision of the Government to demonetize high denomination notes of Rs.500/- and Rs1000/- caused disconcert among Left Wing Extremism (LWE) formations. LWE cadres tried to minimize their losses by having the money deposited into the accounts of the sympathizers or in the accounts of simple villagers on the basis of threats and coercion. Instances of such efforts of depositing of high denomination currency notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- worth several lacs by LWE cadres have come to notice in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and specific cases have also been reported. As per inputs, security forces seized nearly Rs.97.75 lakh from various LWE groups in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Telangana during demonetization. Besides, LWE affiliates also undertook protests against the demonetization decision.

The Government has constituted a Combating Financing of Terrorism Cell (CFT Cell) in the Ministry of Home Affairs to coordinate with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental international body dealing with anti-money laundering and CFT issues. National Investigation Agency (NIA) has also constituted a terror funding and fake currency cell to focus on terror funding and fake currency cases. Besides, various agencies such as Financial Intelligent Unit and regulatory and enforcement agencies under the Ministry of Finance keep a check on the inflow of foreign funds. In addition to above, a surveillance mechanism has been put in place by the State Government to check cases relating to foreign and suspicious funding, including Hawala and cases under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Kiranmay Nanda in the Rajya Sabha today.

                The Government has further liberalized, simplified and rationalized the visa regime in India. E-visa scheme has been categorized into three sub-categories i.e. e-Tourist Visa, e-Business Visa and e-Medical Visa with increased number of entries and duration of stay. Further, long term Tourist visa is given for 5 years in respect of most of the countries of the world.

Liberalized visa regime will result in higher number of foreigners visiting India which will give a boost to the tourism, medical and business sectors resulting in substantial increase in direct and indirect employment in these sectors.

                The CRPF Helpline was launched in Jammu and Kashmir on 16.06.2017. The helpline is getting good response with callers seeking help in matters relating to medical assistance, misbehavior by anti-socials, recruitment details and complaints about unavailability of civic amenities. They also seek assistance in organizing sports events and improving sports facilities especially in rural areas.

The Helpline has been started to build bridge of trust and confidence with citizens.

It is true that some calls are silent. It is difficult to attribute a particular reason though it may possibly be that citizens are trying to confirm about the existence of toll free helpline.

CRPF has undertaken Publicity Campaigns through print, electronics, social media and audio-visual media also to reach out to every Kashmiri and for increasing the awareness about CRPF Helpline among local public.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Dr. P Venugopal in the Lok Sabha today.

                Due to onset of militancy in the State of Jammu and Kashmir during early 1990s, most of the Kashmiri Pandit families along with some other families migrated from Kashmir valley to Jammu, Delhi and other parts of the country. At present, there are about 62,000 registered Kashmiri migrant families in the country.

The State Government of Jammu and Kashmir has informed that no cases of threat to Kashmiri Pandits living in the valley have been reported.

The State government has allotted flats to 31 such Kashmiri Pandit families, who did not leave the valley during 1990s. These flats were constructed under the Scheme approved in 2008 by the Government of India for rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants. Further, the Government of India has sanctioned a scheme on 4th December 2015 for providing 3000 additional State Government jobs to Kashmiri migrants and construction of 6000 transit accommodations in the Kashmir valley. The Kashmiri Pandit families who did not leave the Kashmir valley during the terrorist violence in the State of Jammu and Kashmir in early 1990s and who are still residing in the Kashmir valley are also eligible for the benefits under the scheme.

                A Study commissioned by the Government has recommended gradual outsourcing of ‘maintenance functions’ of the construction major, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to reputed private agencies for improving user services, establishing benchmarks and image improvement.

This significant recommendation was among a set of measures suggested by Ernst & Young in it’s Report on ‘Working and Reogranisation of CPWD for Improved Efficiency and Effectiveness’ presented to the Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today.

The Report stressed on the need to redefine the focus of CPWD so as to promote it’s competency in the core area of construction for which maintenance of residential properties need to be outsourced. It was noted that more than 50% of the total strength of CPWD of 21,806 personnel are currently engaged in maintenance works which account for only 20 % of its turn over by value.

While suggesting that CPWD could continue as an attached office of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, the Report advocated radical reorganization of business processes and decision making systems for ensuring completion of projects in time, transparency, accountability, ease of working, better coordination etc. In place of the present eight levels of processing and decision making, two to three layers have been suggested by categorizing projects into small, medium and large.

As against present mode of selection of Director General of CPWD based on seniority, it has been recommended that DG be chosen from a panel of senior officers. Extensive use of technology in the form of integrated IT based ‘Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)’ system has been recommended for effective monitoring and resource utilization.

Since a large component of projects undertaken by CPWD are commissioned by various ministries and other agencies of the Government, the Report has suggested clear definition of obligation of such agencies like ensuring encumbrance free land, approvals etc.

Proper integration of different wings of CPWD like civil, electrical, horticultural and architecture cadres under common command is among the other recommendations.

Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (HUA) discussed the recommendations with Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Narendra Singh Tomar. It was decided that CPWD will initiate action to outsource maintenance functions in select areas of Delhi to begin with and a road map will be evolved to implement other recommendations after detailed examination.

These recommendations have been made in the context of over 50% of works being implemented by CPWD getting delayed, lower levels of satisfaction over maintenance services, 70% of projects being of less than Rs.5.00 cr value each, 47% of total staff located in Delhi Region etc.

The Ministry has commissioned Ernst & Young in May this year to study the functioning of CPWD for suggesting measures for improvements.

                The Government’s construction major, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has undergone a major digital transformation enabling payments worth Rs.20,000 cr per year electronically. This has been done by networking all the 400 field offices of CPWD across the country through a special integrated portal ensuring digital payments from this month. With this, CPWD has become the first organization of a civil ministry to become digital at the field level.

CPWD executes over 25,000 project works across the country involving annual payments of over Rs.20,000 cr every year by it’s 400 field offices including in remote, hilly and North-Eastern parts. The new digital payment mode covers over six lakh transactions. The Office of Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has evolved this special Public Financial Management (PFMS) Portal for CPWD.

During a demonstration of this online payment system to Shri Duga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (HUA), Shri Shyam Dubey, CCA explained that it enables real time monitoring of expenditure in respect of each of the 25,000 projects across the country. Since fund release is linked to progress of works, digital payments also ensures efficient utilization of funds, he said.

In yet another initiative, electronic Measurement Book (e-MB) has also been developed for CPWD that enables reporting of progress of works online as per the schedule of agreement with contractors based on which payments will be made. e-MB has been made mandatory from the first of next month doing away with manual reporting by all the 400 field offices.

Shri Durga Shanker Mishra directed CPWD and CCA to further ensure geo-tagging of physical progress of works for effective monitoring.

PFMS is an end-to-end solution for electronic processing payments, tracking fund flow, monitoring, accounting, reconciliation and reporting etc.

PFMS has been adopted by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs since October, 2015 by which the allocation of Rs.34,000 cr has been transferred electronically. With CPWD now going digital, the volume of e-payments of the Ministry and CPWD would be about Rs.60,000 cr during 2017-18.

Since CPWD has a separate scheme of delegation of functions and financial powers, it required a special PFMS e-module for online transactions.

                The Government’s construction major, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has undergone a major digital transformation enabling payments worth Rs.20,000 cr per year electronically. This has been done by networking all the 400 field offices of CPWD across the country through a special integrated portal ensuring digital payments from this month. With this, CPWD has become the first organization of a civil ministry to become digital at the field level.

CPWD executes over 25,000 project works across the country involving annual payments of over Rs.20,000 cr every year by it’s 400 field offices including in remote, hilly and North-Eastern parts. The new digital payment mode covers over six lakh transactions. The Office of Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has evolved this special Public Financial Management (PFMS) Portal for CPWD.

During a demonstration of this online payment system to Shri Duga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (HUA), Shri Shyam Dubey, CCA explained that it enables real time monitoring of expenditure in respect of each of the 25,000 projects across the country. Since fund release is linked to progress of works, digital payments also ensures efficient utilization of funds, he said.

In yet another initiative, electronic Measurement Book (e-MB) has also been developed for CPWD that enables reporting of progress of works online as per the schedule of agreement with contractors based on which payments will be made. e-MB has been made mandatory from the first of next month doing away with manual reporting by all the 400 field offices.

Shri Durga Shanker Mishra directed CPWD and CCA to further ensure geo-tagging of physical progress of works for effective monitoring.

PFMS is an end-to-end solution for electronic processing payments, tracking fund flow, monitoring, accounting, reconciliation and reporting etc.

PFMS has been adopted by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs since October, 2015 by which the allocation of Rs.34,000 cr has been transferred electronically. With CPWD now going digital, the volume of e-payments of the Ministry and CPWD would be about Rs.60,000 cr during 2017-18.

Since CPWD has a separate scheme of delegation of functions and financial powers, it required a special PFMS e-module for online transactions.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind  presented the National Safety Awards (Mines) for the years 2013 and 2014 at a function held at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi today.



 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is endowed with an impressive mineral wealth. Today, the mineral sector contributes 2.6 per cent of our national GDP and provides direct employment to over one million people on a daily average basis, and helps the lives of their families.

 

The President said that in recent decades, the Indian mining industry has progressed appreciably in production and productivity through intensive mechanisation and adoption of new technology. Never before in its long history has the Indian mining industry experienced such revolutionary change, at such an accelerated pace. The balance between greater productivity and profit margins and the safety of workers is vital. Human safety and lives must always come first. They are always the priority.

 

The President said that he was confident that the National Safety Awards in Mines will continue to be an excellent motivator for upholding safety and welfare standards in the mines of our country. The safety practices of the award winning mines from today’s event should be case studies for students of mining engineering and management. Students should also visit such mines as part of their familiarisation programmes.

 

The Minister of State(IC) for Labour and Employment, Shri Bandaru Dattatreya congratulated the award winners and said that the growth of mining sector has to go hand in hand with rapid industrialization in other sectors, and has to remain an important cog in the wheel of development. However, the production of minerals at any cost, especially in terms of human sufferings is not acceptable. The mining community must adhere to the principles of “safe mining”, which consequently benefits the whole society.

 

Shri Dattatreya informed that the Ministry of Labour and Employment is keenly interested to ensure reduction in risk of occupational diseases and casualties to persons employed in mines by drafting appropriate legislation and setting standards, through various promotional initiatives & awareness programmes, creating an environment in which safety is given due priority.

The Labour and Employment Minister informed that the appropriate amendments of the Mines legislation have already been taken up and at present, the amendments of the Coal Mines Regulations and Oil Mines Regulations are in the final stage. DGMS has taken initiatives to bring awareness amongst workers, mine owners of small mines in unorganized sector and community as a whole, by organizing awareness camps in silicosis prone states.

The Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, Smt. M. Sathiyavathy said that National safety awards will not only motivate the recipients to achieve highest standards of safety & health in mines but also will inspire every single person involved with mining industry for achieving the same.

Occupational safety, health and welfare of persons employed in all mines - coal, metalliferous and oil - all over the country comes under the domain of the Central Government. Provisions for occupational safety of persons employed in mines are contained in the Mines Act, 1952, and the Rules and Regula­tions framed thereunder. The responsibility of implementation of the provisions of the Mines Act and the legislation framed thereunder lies with the mine management. The Directorate General of Mines Safety under the Ministry of Labour & Employment oversees compliance of the same through a system of periodic inspection and inquiry. Recognizing the need for involvement of the work persons in safety and health matters, the Government has been promoting the concepts of ""Self-Regulation"" and ""Participative Management"" with a view to influence human behaviour at work so that a real breakthrough in accident prevention could be achieved. A variety of safety educational/ promotional measures have been conceived, formulated and promoted from time to time for the cause of safety. National Safety Awards (Mines) Scheme is one such measure.

 To recognize and encourage any notable and exemplary performance for prevention of accidents in mines, the Union Ministry of Labour launched the National Safety Awards (Mines) in the year 1982-83. These awards were given away for the first time in the year 1984 for the contest years 1982 & 1983 and thereafter, regularly every year.

 For the purpose of the contest for National Safety Awards (Mines) all mines have been divided into 7 different groups depending upon the type of mineral and nature of workings. The indicators of safety performance for determining eligibility of these awards are:

          

·         Longest accident free period (LAFP) in terms of manshifts  worked during  three consecutive years ending with the contest year

              ·         Lowest  injury frequency rate  (LIFR) during  three  consecutive years ending with the contest year

         

To scrutinize and adjudge applications from mines for awards, a tripartite National Safety Awards Committee has been constituted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The Committee comprises of eight representatives from mine managements, eight representatives from trade unions and Government represented by Director General as Chairman and one officer of DGMS as its Member Secretary.

 In all, there are 37 Winner prizes and 34 Runner-up prizes which will be given away to the winning mines in the award function organized by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The award for each mine is received jointly by one management representative and one workers’ representative. Awards for the contest year 2013 & 2014 will be given away by Hon’ble President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind on 17th August, 2017 at 1200-1300 hours at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi.

                       The Ministry of Labour and Employment has taken a number of legislative initiatives in labour laws during the last 3 years. Such initiatives include:

Ø  Amendment to the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 by which   eligibility limit for payment of bonus enhanced from Rs 10,000/- to Rs. 21,000/- per month and the Calculation Ceiling from  Rs. 3,500/- to Rs. 7,000/- or the minimum wages.

Ø  Payment of Wages (Amendment) Act, 2017 enabling payment of Wages to employees by Cash or Cheque or crediting it to their bank account.

Ø  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 provides for complete ban on employment of children below 14 years in any occupation or process.

Ø  Maternity Benefit Amendment Act, 2017, increases the paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.

Ø  The Employee Compensation (Amendment) Act, seeks to rationalize penalties and strengthen the rights of the workers under the Act.

Ø  Ministry has notified  “Ease of Compliance to maintain Registers under various Labour Laws Rules, 2017” on 21st February 2017 which has in effect replaced the 56 Registers/Forms under 9 Central Labour Laws and Rules made there under in to 5 common Registers/Forms. This will save efforts, costs and lessen the compliance burden by various establishments.

Ø  A Model Shops and Establishments (RE&CS) Bill, 2016 has been circulated to all States/UTs for adoption with appropriate modification. The said Bill inter alia provides for freedom to operate an Establishment for 365 days in a year without any restriction on opening/closing time and enables employment of women during night shifts if adequate safety provisions exist.

Ø  A category i.e. Fixed Term Employment has been introduced under Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 to impart flexibility to an establishment to employ people in case of Apparel Manufacturing Sector to meet the fluctuating demands of the sector due to its seasonal nature.

 

These legislative initiatives are expected to not only facilitate effective enforcement but also enhance wage security, job security, social security and safety, health and working conditions for workers.

         This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya, the Minister of State (IC) for Labour & Employment, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.

                The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare; and Safety and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. Ministry of Labour and Employment has prepared a preliminary draft on Labour Code on Social Security 2017 by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the 15 existing Central Labour Laws and placed on the website of the Ministry on 16.3.2017, inviting comments of the public/stakeholders. The provisions of the Code on Social Security 2017 are under consideration.

                The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has tied up/entered into agreement with ten banks to collect EPFO dues and to make payments of Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals, pension and insurance to EPFO beneficiaries. These banks are State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Indian Bank, Allahabad Bank, Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

The main objective of the multi banking arrangement is to provide more options to the employers to remit the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contribution directly from their bank accounts. This will not only make the transactions cost effective but also ensure real time transfer of funds through net banking.

The nine-judge Bench Supreme Court judgement has today pronounced in the “Privacy Case” by upholding the Right to Privacy as one protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Government welcomes the view of the Supreme Court, which is consistent with all the necessary safeguards that the Government has been ensuring in its legislative proposals which had been approved by Parliament. 

The issue of personal liberty had a chequered history during the previous Congress Governments. Immediately after the Constitution was framed, the Congress Government at the Center had consistently maintained that personal liberty could be denied to an individual by any legislation irrespective of the reasonableness of that legislation. The Congress Governments had consistently argued that privacy was not a part of any constitutional guarantees. In fact, during the internal emergency when Article 21 was suspended, the Central Government had argued before the Supreme Court that a person could be killed and deprived even his life (let alone liberty) and he would still be remediless. 

The UPA Government had introduced AADHAR scheme without any legislative support. It was in that context that the question of the UPA’s AADHAR scheme was challenged before the judiciary. The NDA Government ensured that necessary legislation was approved by Parliament. Adequate safeguards were also introduced. On 16.3.2016, while speaking on the AADHAR Bill in the Rajya Sabha, the Government through the Finance Minister, had clearly stated – “Is privacy a fundamental right or not? The present Bill pre-supposes and is based on the premise and that it is too late in date to contend that privacy is not a fundamental right. So, I do except that probably privacy is a fundamental right. Now, where do you fit privacy as a fundamental right? And that is where I want to clear the misconception due to which these amendments which have been proposed. It is contended and broadly it is now accepted that privacy is a part of the individual liberty. So when Article 21 says, “no person shall be deprived of his Right to Life and Liberty without procedure established by law”. Then let us assume that privacy is a part of liberty and no person shall be deprived of his privacy without procedure as established by law. The underlying point is that privacy is not an absolute right. It is a right even in our Constitution. If it is a Fundamental Right under Article 21, which is subject to restriction that it can be restricted by a procedure established by law, that procedure established by law obviously has to be fair, just and reasonable procedure. The case before the Supreme court is you have no law, you have not legislated, you have not laid down any guidelines and you have by an executive fiat created authority where all personal data and biometric information will go. What will that be used for? Is this a fair, just and reasonable procedure?” 

The Finance Minister was referring to the situation where the UPA Government created an AADHAR without any legislative support. The present Government did exactly the opposite. It gave a legislative support to AADHAR and incorporated in law special safeguards with regard to privacy. It has also assured the Supreme Court that it will soon be coming out with a data protection law for which a committee headed by Justice Sri Krishna, a retired judge of the Supreme Court, had already been appointed. 

Today’s judgement of the Supreme Court is a welcome judgement in as much as it strengths the Fundamental Rights and personal liberty. The judgement reads that personal liberty is not an absolute right but liable to the restrictions provided in the Constitution which will be examined on a case to case basis. The Government is of the clear opinion that its legislations are compliant with the tests laid down in the judgement. The Supreme court has stated that ”…requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the State. The legitimate aims of the State would include for instance protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.” The Government is committed to this object.

The Committee has divided its Report in three parts. The first part is devoted to suggest measures to improve the overall quality and performance of arbitral institutions in India and to promote the standing of the country as preferred seat of arbitration. The Committee in this context have inter alia recommended –

(i)                 Setting up an Autonomous Body, styled the Arbitration Promotion Council of India (APCI), having representatives from all stakeholders for grading arbitral institutions in India.

(ii)               The APCI may inter alia recognize professional institutes providing for accreditation of arbitrators

(iii)             The APCI may hold training workshops and interact with law firms and law schools to train advocates with interest in arbitration and with a goal to create a specialist arbitration bar comprising of advocates dedicated to the field.

(iv)             Creation of a specialist Arbitration Bench to deal with such Commercial disputes, in the domain of the Courts.

(v)               Changes have been suggested in various provisions of the 2015 Amendments in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act with a view to make arbitration speedier and more efficacious and incorporate international best practices.

 

The Committee are also of the opinion that the National Litigation Policy (NLP) must promote arbitration in Government Contracts.

 

 

The Committee in Part II of the Report reviewed the working of ICADR working under the aegis of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs. The Institution was set up with the objective of promoting ADR methods and providing requisite facilities for the same. The Committee has preferred for declaring the ICADR as an Institution of national importance and takeover of the Institution by a statute. The Committee are of the view that a revamped ICADR has the potential be a globally competitive institution.

 

As regards the role of arbitrations in matters involving the Union of India, including bilateral investment treaties (BIT) arbitrations, the Committee in Part III of the Report has inter alia recommended for creation of the post of an ‘International Law Adviser’ (ILA) who shall advise the Government and coordinate dispute resolution strategy for the Government in disputes arising out of its international law obligations, particularly disputes arising out of BITs. The Committee has emphasized that ILA may be consulted by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), at the time of negotiating and entering into BITs.

 

The roadmap of suggested reforms after an in depth examination of the issues, by the High Level Committee can result in a paradigm shift from the current perception of delay in resolution of commercial disputes in India to it being viewed as an investor friendly destination. The suggested reforms will not only lessen the burden of the judiciary, but give a fillip to the development agenda of the Government and aid the financial strength of the country  and serve the goal of welfare of the citizens.

In order to streamline the process of application flow and fund flow and to bring in transparency and better financial management and to prevent parking of funds at Nodal bank level an online PMEGP-MIS web portal has been introduced. All applications and fund flow will be processed online in stipulated time frame.

 

       Publicity is being made through print and electronic media, awareness camps at District level and State level are being organized in order to propagate the PMEGP scheme for the development of micro industries.

 

Exhibitions are also conducted at district/state/zone and national level for providing      marketing support to the entrepreneurs/units.

 

 For speedy completion of EDP training, these are being conducted through   Departmental Training Centres as well as RSETIs/RUDSETIs as per MOU executed between KVIC & MCR.

Industries such as Khadi, processing of Pashmina Wool, handloom and power loom units, value added products for tea, coffee, rubber etc. and transport activities are now eligible for funding under PMEGP.

Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) & Parliamentary Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said here that the new Haj policy-2018 will be unveiled this month. 

At a review meeting on Haj 2017 and 22nd annual Haj orientation camp organised for Haj pilgrims at Haj House, Mumbai, Shri Naqvi said that from the next year, Haj will be organised according to the new Haj policy only. 

A high-level committee constituted to frame the new Haj policy is in final stage of shaping the policy and it will be unveiled this month. Shri Naqvi said that the new Haj policy is aimed at making Haj process more transparent and smooth. Providing best facilities to Haj pilgrims is at centre of this new Haj policy. 

Shri Naqvi said that reviving the option of sending Haj pilgrims through sea route also is one of the important part of the new Haj policy. Sending pilgrims through ships will help cut down travel expenses by nearly half as compared to airfares. It will be a revolutionary, pro-poor, pilgrim-friendly decision. The practice of ferrying Haj pilgrims between Mumbai and Jeddah by waterways was stopped from 1995. 

Shri Naqvi said that another advantage with ships available these days is they are modern and well-equipped to ferry 4,000 to 5,000 persons at a time. They can cover the 2,300-odd nautical miles one-side distance between Mumbai and Jeddah within just two-three days. Earlier, the old ships used to take 12 to 15 days to cover this distance. 

Shri Naqvi said that a high-level meeting will be held under the chairmanship of Shipping Minister, Shri Nitin Gadkari at New Delhi on 28th August. Senior officials from Shipping Ministry and Minority Affairs Ministry will be attending the meeting. 

Shri Naqvi said that discussion is going on with Saudi Arabia Government on reviving Haj pilgrimage through sea route also. 

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs, in cooperation with Haj Committee of India and other concerned agencies, had completed preparations for Haj 2017 well before in time to ensure smooth Haj pilgrimage. 

During the review meeting, Shri Naqvi discussed in detail all the issues related to Haj pilgrims with the concerned officials. Shri Naqvi said that facilities given to the Haj pilgrims and their safety is priority of the Central Government. 

At the orientation/training camp, officials of Haj Committee of India and other concerned agencies gave various information to the Haj pilgrims. 

Haj 2017 started with departure of Haj pilgrims from various embarkation points across the country on 24th July. Saudi Arabia has increased annual Haj quota of India by 34,005.

                As provided in the Prime Minister’s New 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a Master Circular dated 01.07.2017 for credit facilities to minority communities that care should be taken to see that minority communities secure, in a fair and adequate measure, the benefits flowing from various Government-sponsored schemes. The Master Circular was issued to all the commercial banks to ensure smooth flow of bank credit and also advised all the scheduled commercial banks to specially monitor the credit flow to minority communities (viz. Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis) in the 121 Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) having at least 25% minority population but excluding those States / UTs where minorities are in majority (Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). This is to ensure that the minority communities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall target of the priority sector. 

Under the Prime Minister’s New 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities (PM’s new 15-PP), an earmarking of 15% of the PSL is targeted for the minority communities. All scheduled commercial banks are required to ensure that within the overall target for PSL and the sub-target of 10% for the weaker sections, sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority communities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. The RBI has advised the lead banks to keep this requirement in view while preparing district credit plans. 

The Union Government has also established National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) in September, 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities for the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body (under Ministry of Minority Affairs, MoMA) and channelizes its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance Corporation of the respective State / Union Territories. 

The names of the Minority Concentration Districts and details of bank-wise (Public Sector Banks) lending to minorities under PSL are available on the website of the Ministry of Minority Affairs at www.minorityaffairs.gov.in. 

This information was given by Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the Minister of State for Minority Affairs (IC), in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.

                Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has issued  the Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects. The Government has notified these Guidelines on 3rd August, 2017 (Link - http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/Guidelines_for_Tariff_Based_Competitive_Bidding_Process.pdf )

These Guidelines have been issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for long term procurement of electricity by the ‘Procurers’ [the distribution licensees, or the Authorized Representative(s), or an Intermediary Procurer] from grid-connected Solar PV Power Projects (‘Projects’), having size of 5 MW and above, through competitive bidding.

Key Reform Initiatives as per these Guidelines are as follows:

 

i.            Generation Compensation for offtake constraints thereby reducing offtake risks: The “Must-run” status for solar projects has been stressed upon. Generation Compensation provided for following off-take constraints:

a)      Back-down     -                      Min.  Compensation 50% of PPA Tariff

b)     Grid unavailability -              Compensation by way of Procurement of  Excess Generation / Outright Compensation

 

ii.          PPA: To ensure lower tariffs, Minimum PPA tenure has been kept at 25 years. Unilateral termination or amendment of PPA is not allowed.

 

iii.        Project preparedness to expedite and facilitate setting up of projects: Issues related to land, connectivity, clearances etc. and the extension in case of delay, have been streamlined.

 

iv.        Event of Default and the consequences thereof clearly defined to ensure optimal risk sharingbetween Developer and Procurer. This has been done by clearly defining the generator and procurer events of default, and describing the consequences thereof.

 

v.          Termination Compensation to increase bankability of projects by securing the investment by the Generator and the lenders against any arbitrary termination of PPA. Quantum and modality for termination compensation in case of both generator default and procurer default has been clearly defined.

 

vi.        Payment Security Mechanism: Risk of generator’s revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment / non- payment by the procurers has been addressed through provision of Payment Security Mechanism through instruments like Letter of Credit (LC), Payment Security Fund, State Guarantee, etc.

 

vii.      Change in Law provision to provide clarity and certainty to generators, procurers, and investors/lenders - Change in Law provision, effective from the date of bid submission and covering any change in law/Tax rate which has a direct effect on the Project (and not just taxes made applicable for supply of power) has been provided.

 

viii.    Early Commissioning & Part-Commissioning for expeditious completion of projects -  Early commissioning and part commissioning have not only been allowed, but incentivised, by way of allowing the PPA for a minimum 25 years from the Scheduled Commissioning Date.

 

ix.        Rationalisation of Penalties: The penalties have been rationalised, so as to reduce the overall cost to the Generator, while at the same time, ensuring compliance with the Commissioning Schedule/Scheme Guidelines

 

x.         Repowering: Generators are free to repower their power plants. However, the procurer will be obliged to buy power only within the CUF range in PPA.

 

xi.        Bid structure and process: Bids have been allowed in both Power (MW) and Energy (kWh) terms. Also, e-bidding has been emphasised to improve transparency.

 

To summarise, new guidelines for tariff based competitive bidding process for procurement of solar power will help enhance transparency and fairness in the procurement process, while protecting consumer interests through affordable power. These guidelines will also provide standardisation and uniformity in processes and a risk-sharing framework between various stakeholders involved in the solar PV power procurement. This will help in reducing off-taker risk and thereby encourage investments, enhance bankability of the Projects and improve profitability for the investors.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, addressed a distinguished gathering of delegates attending the 3-day 8th World Renewable Energy Technology Congress here today. The Minister also gave away Energy and Environment Foundation Global Excellence awards 2017 during the inaugural session of the conference.

The annual conference is visualized and planned in the backdrop of India's vision on achieving ""Energy Independence and Power for all by 2022"". It focusses on new Green Technologies to ensure clean, reliable and affordable Renewable Energy supplies. It provides an opportunity and open forum to exchange information, share experiences and best practices by bringing together experts, investors and other multi stake holders of i.e. Public and Private Sector, Advisory Groups, Governments, NGOs, Non-Profit organizations Environmentalists and Academia.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Goyal noted that the last 10 to 15 years have seen a rapid decline in the quality of the atmosphere due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions globally and it has become probably the largest challenge before humanity today. Fortunately, post the Paris agreement, the world as a whole has recognized that climate change is a serious issue and it needs to be addressed globally in a mission mode, the Minister added.

Shri Goyal informed that India is spearheading a number of engagements on the global platform to address the challenge, which include the International Solar Alliance (ISA), the Mission Innovation, global engagements on rapid de-carbonization of the energy space, the African Renewable Energy Initiative, the G20 Energy Ministers getting together to see what can be done to look at a better future for the world, inter alia.

Further, Shri Goyal talked about the 3Ds, which today's global engagements need to focus their energy upon. These are - a common shared goal of De-carbonization of the energy space; to look at more Decentralization of energy space; and more and more Digitalization of the energy space. “With each passing day we are running out of time and we need to accelerate our efforts in coordination to promote clean energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not address to these 3Ds, I am worried that the World might end up decelerating the global economy”, the Minister said.

Talking about technological advancements in renewable energy sector, Shri Goyal said, “I am sure this advent of Technology will make renewable energy more attractive particularly for emerging and growing economies like India, especially when renewable energy costs are down as compared to other forms of conventional energy sources”.

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri K.S. Popli, CMD, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA), Shri Upendra Tripathy, DG, ISA, along with other National and International stalwarts of the Renewable Energy sector.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh released the Department of Administrative Reforms and Grievances (DARPG)’s Grievance Study Analysis of 20 Ministries here today. 

Addressing on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that under the leadership and encouragement of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, various good governance initiatives have been undertaken. He said that under PM’s awards, young officers are now vying for excellence in implementation of priority programmes. He said that the number of grievances lodged has increased 5 fold in the last three years, from 2 lakh grievances in 2014 to 11 lakh grievances now. He said that this increase is due to the quick response given by the Government to the grievances. He further said that now the average time taken to dispose the grievance has been reduced to one week. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government is sensitive towards the demands of pensioners also. He also talked about the Government’s initiatives for pensioners such as Anubhav and Sankalp. He said that Mobile App for pensioners is an example how the technology is being optimally utilised for good governance initiatives. He said that all ministries/departments will switch over to e-office by the end of this year. The state governments are being persuaded to follow these initiatives, he added. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri C. Viswanath, Secretary, DARPG said that currently 28 ministries/departments are on e-office and steps are being undertaken to bring all ministries/departments on e-office by this year end. He also said that department is also developing Development Goal Manual and Good Governance Index. 

He also said that for the PM awards to be presented on Civil Services Day 2018, the following four priority programmes have been identified: 

• Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana
• Digital payment (digital payment under digitization) 
• Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban and Rural) 
• Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana

He also said that efforts are being made to enlist all districts this year. He said that the focus will be on the quality of implementation of programme. 

Elaborating on the initiatives of the Department of Pensions, Shri C. Viswanath said that GPF rules have been liberalized. He also said that a committee has been constituted to make recommendation on the National Pension System which is applicable to the young officers who joined after the year 2004. He further said the officers will be rewarded under the ‘Anubhav’ initiative. He also talked about setting up of Pensioners Adalat to quickly resolve the issues of pensioners. 

The “Grievance Analysis & Systemic Reforms” Study was conducted for 20 ministries in the year 2015. As a result, 65 reforms have been introduced which has a positive impact on governance. Study has been undertaken for 20 more ministries in 2017 and 180 reforms have been suggested. 

Some key reforms undertaken by the Ministries/Departments are e.g. in Ministry of Petroleum, delay in obtaining LPG connections has been reduced due to introduction of online LPG registration on mylpg.in. In Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, sub-optimal CGHS services due to unavailability of doctors and staff has been addressed by introducing Aadhaar linked biometric in all CGHS units, in Ministry of Urban Development, delay in construction plan approval due to manual process has been reduced by introducing online process to obtain clearance mechanism and in Ministry of Railways, delay in ticket refunds has been reduced by introducing automatic refunds for confirmed/waitlisted e-tickets on cancellation of trains, among others. 

Reforms have been suggested for the next 20 Ministries/Departments e.g. in Department of Rural Development, for poor quality of roads constructed, payment to contractors is based on checklist of quality parameters under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. In Ministry of Women and Child Development, as rape complaints are sometimes overlooked by police, it has been suggested to sensitise male cops on gender equality through training sessions. In Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, to address poor quality of drinking water in rural areas, it has been suggested that all Gram Panchayats are given field testing kits for water quality testing. In Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, for Digital Locker login issue in case of mobile loss, it is suggested that there may be a Provision of 'recovery password' through alternate email (E.g.: GMAIL). 

Steps have been taken to identify focus issues and arrive at the root cause of grievance so as to enable systemic reforms to be put in place to alleviate the root cause. A Project Management Unit has been set up for monitoring these reforms in consultation with concerned Ministries/Departments. A dedicated team has been engaged who conduct intensive deliberations with the concerned Ministries/Departments for identifying the reforms that have been implemented and draw up the monitoring metrics indicating impact of these reforms.

                The Government posts are to be filled in accordance with the recruitment rules. Wherever recruitment rules provide reemployment as a mode of recruitment or in cases of exigencies of work, retired Government servants are reappointed on contractual basis for a specific period.

The Central Civil Services (Fixation of Pay of re-employed Pensioners) orders, 1986 as amended from time to time govern the pay fixation of re-employed pensioners including the persons re-employed on contract basis, unless the contract provides otherwise. The interests of serving employees with regard to promotions/financial upgradations to higher post are taken care of by the respective service rules/regulations applicable to them.

This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Shri M.P.Veerendra Kumar in the Rajya Sabha today.

                The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 came into force w.e.f. 16.01.2014. The Government initiated the process for appointment by convening the Selection Committee meeting on 03.02.2014. The Selection Committee under section 4(1) of the Act, also constituted an eight Member Search Committee on 21.02.2014 in terms of section 4(3) of the Act. Two members of the Search Committee declined the offer of appointment. Looking into such difficulties experienced and to remove certain difficulties in the operationalisation of the Act including issues relating to appointment of Chairperson and Members of Lokpal, etc. in the absence of a Leader of Opposition recognized as such in the Lok Sabha, the Government introduced the Lokpal and Lokayuktas and other related law (Amendment) Bill, 2014 in Lok Sabha on 18.12.2014. The Bill was referred to the Department –related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice for examination and report. The said Committee has submitted its report in the Parliament on 07.12.2015. The recommendations of the said Committee were presented before an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) comprising seven Union Ministers. The recommendations of the IMC are under consideration of the Government.

This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Shri Sanjay Raut in the Rajya Sabha today.

The pledge commits to create a New India that is strong, prosperous and inclusive; an India that will make our freedom fighters proud.

 

On the occasion, presentations were made by Joint Secretary, DoPT, Shri Devesh Chaturvedi on Strategy for Anti-Corruption: Initiatives taken by the Government of India and OSD, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Akshay Rout on Swachh Bharat Mission.

 

Addressing the gathering, Dr. Jitendra Singh said it’s a unique privilege for us all to be part of the 75th Anniversary of the Quit India Movement. He said that the rapid pace of events unfolded from 1942 to 1947, beginning with the Quit India Movement and resulting in India’s Independence five years later. Let us pledge to carry on with the same spirit in the next five years to drive out poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism, casteism and build a Clean and New India by 2022 when the country will mark its 75th Anniversary of Independence, he added.

 

Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Government has lived up to its commitments by acting against corruption and creating a work friendly atmosphere. This day marks our rededication to our commitments, he added.

Instructions were issued by Department of Personnel and Training on 01.06.2017 to all Ministries/Departments to collect information about appointments made on the basis of fake/ false caste certificates and follow up action taken thereon. The Ministries/Departments have been requested to collect information from all Organisations under their administrative control about the cases where the candidates got/alleged to have got appointment against vacancies reserved for Scheduled Cates, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes on the basis of false/fake caste certificate and send a consolidated report to the Department of Personnel and Training by 15.07.2017. In the response received so far from eight Ministries/Departments, no such case has been reported. 

The extant instructions provide that if it is found that a Government servant had furnished false information or produced a false certificate in order to secure appointment, he should not be retained in service. Thus when an appointing authority comes to know that an employee had submitted a false/fake caste certificate, it has to initiate action to remove or dismiss such an employee from service as per the provisions of relevant Service Rules. 

Further, in order to discourage unscrupulous persons getting benefits through false caste certificates, State Governments/Union Territories have also been requested to consider issue of appropriate instructions for initiating disciplinary proceeding against the errant officers who default in timely verifications of caste certificate or issue false certificates. 

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Ram Vichar Netam and Smt. Vijila Sathyananth in the Rajya Sabha today.

                As on 30.06.2017, 1962 complaints alleging various misconducts are under enquiry relating to public servants under the jurisdiction of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Investigation into complaints is an ongoing process and the Commission regularly monitors the pendency with the Chief Vigilance Officers to ensure time-bound completion of the same. The delays are on account of multitude of reasons such as lack of adequate officers in certain offices, complexity of investigations, time taken to follow the laid down procedure, non-cooperation of the suspect officers etc.

In terms of Section 8(2) read with 8(1)(d) of CVC Act, 2003, the Commission can inquire or cause an inquiry or investigation to be made into any complaint against certain categories of officials specified wherein it is alleged that the official has committed offences under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Generally, complaints containing specific allegations of corruption / vigilance overtone are referred by the Commission to the Chief Vigilance Officers of the administrative Ministries / Departments concerned for Inquiry & Report. In an exceptional case, the Commission orders direct inquiry by a team of officers.

The inquiries into various complaints are being pursued as per the laid down procedures and rules.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question by Shri Vijay Kumar Hansdak in the Lok Sabha today.

The candidates, who do not qualify the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination are promoted on the basis of their inter-se-seniority in the feeder grade.

                In implementation of Government's decision on the recommendation of the Seventh Central Pay Commission (7th CPC), orders have been issued vide Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare O.M. No. 38/37/16-P&PW(A) (i) dated 04.08.2016 for revision of provisions regulating pension/gratuity/ commutation of pension/family pension/disability pension/ex-gratia lump-sum compensation, etc. in respect of the employees retiring on or after 01.01.2016.v For revision of pension of pre-2016 civil pensioners, the 7th CPC recommended the following two formulations:

(i) Notional Pay of employees who retired prior to 01.01.2016 may be fixed in the Pay Matrix on the basis of the Pay Band and Grade Pay at which they retired, by adding the number of increments he/ she had earned in that level while in service, to the minimum of the corresponding level in the matrix. Fifty percent of the total amount so arrived at shall be the revised pension.

(ii) The pension, as had been fixed at the time of implementation of the 6th CPC recommendations, may be multiplied by 2.57 to arrive at an alternate value for the revised pension.

7th CPC recommended that the pensioners may be given the option of choosing the formulation which is more beneficial to them. Orders were issued for revision of pension as per Formulation (ii) above vide Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare O.M. No. 38/37/16-P&PW(A) (ii) dated 04.08.2016 and the pension disbursing authorities were advised to make payment of revised pension accordingly without waiting for the revised pension payment authority. A Committee under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare was constituted to examine the feasibility of Formulation (i). The Committee observed that Formulation (i) as recommended by the 7th CPC might be difficult to implement in a large number of cases and this method may also cause anomalies.

In implementation of the recommendations of the aforesaid Committee, orders have been issued vide Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare O.M. No. 38/37/16-P&PW(A) dated 12.05.2017. It has been provided that the revised pension/family pension w.e.f. 01.01.2016 in respect of all Central civil pensioners/family pensioners may be revised by notionally fixing their pay in the pay matrix recommended by the 7th CPC in the level corresponding to the pay in the pay scale/pay band and grade pay at which they retired/died by notional pay fixation under each intervening Pay Commission based on the Formula for revision of pay. 50% of the notional pay as on 01.01.2016 shall be the revised pension and 30% of this notional pay shall be the revised family pension w.e.f. 1.1.2016. Higher of the two Formulations i.e. the pension/family pension already revised in accordance with this Department’s OM dated 04.08.2016 or the revised pension/family pension as worked out by notional pay fixation method, shall be the revised pension/family pension w.e.f. 01.01.2016.

There were around 55.51 lakh pensioners/family pensioners (including defence pensioners/family pensioners) as on 31.03.2016. All Pension Sanctioning Authorities have been advised to accord top priority to the work of revision of pension and issue revised Pension Payment Authority in implementation of the above orders expeditiously.

There is no proposal for creation of any other organisation for pension related issues.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question by Adv. Narendra Keshav Sawaikar and Shri P. Nagarajan in the Lok Sabha today.

                Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG), its attached offices and Oil & Gas CPSEs under the administrative control of MoPNG celebrated Swachhta Pakhwada fortnight with full zeal from 16th July 2017 – 31st July, 2017. 

A kick-off meeting to review the Swachhta Pakhwada action plan of MoPNG, its attached offices and CPSEs under administrative control of MoPNG was held on 12.07.2017 in which it was advised to move beyond symbolism and go to the next level in implementation of Swachhta Pakhwada in 2017 and strive to make it a Jan Andolan. A mid-fortnight review of Swachhta Pakhwada activities undertaken and activities planned for remaining period of Pakhwada fortnight was taken by Secretary (PNG) Shri K.D. Tripathi on 21.07.2017. 

The focus during Swachhta Pakhwada was not only to garner people’s involvement but also to bring about behavioural and attitudinal change through innovative activities so that the ultimate goals of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan could be achieved and sustained. Under Swachhta Pakhwada, a pledge was administered by Secretary (PNG) Shri K.D.

Towards creating awareness, MoPNG organized a painting competition for the families of officers/staff, slogan writing competition on “Cleanliness & me” and an essay writing competition on “Swachhta Shapath Aur Mera Yogdan”. A special drive was undertaken wherein Ministry scanned approximately 17800 files and has migrated around 14681 files to the e-office mode. This was in addition to activities like undertaking cleaning of office premises, toilets & washrooms, providing dustbins in all sections, weeding out of old files/records/un serviceable articles.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production



 

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 

1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during July, 2017 was 1917.53 TMT which is 2.14% lower than the monthly target but 2.66% higher when compared with July, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-July, 2017 was 7559.23 TMT which is 0.70% lower than target for the period but 2.71% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

Ø Offshore: Natural decline/increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore. Less than planned production from Vasai East (closure of well due to safety reason) and NBP field (ESP problem in one well; Rig intervention post-monsoon)

Ø Onshore: Power Shut down/Electrical faults due to heavy rain in Ahmedabad & Mehsana, Power shut-down, increase in water cut in Ankleshwar & Cambay and Power shut-down in Assam.

1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during July, 2017 was 288.31 TMT which is 9.02% lower than monthly target but 5.73% higher than production in July, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-July, 2017 was 1128.33 TMT which is 9.58% lower than target for the period but 5.37% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Less than planned achievement due to higher decline in production potential of wells mainly in Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari areas.

Ø  Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

 

1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2017 was 855.24 TMT which is 5.25% lower than the monthly target and 8.72% lower than July, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2017 was 3396.99 TMT which is 4.38% lower than target for the period and 6.87% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 140 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ and poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari west and Saraswati due to non-availability of tankers in July 2017

Ø Panna-Mukta (BG): Shutdown of PC, PG, PF platforms to resolve integrity issues in IG line at PPA end from 16th July 2017 and natural decline.

Ø CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.

Ø CB-ONN-2004/2 (ONGC): Underperformance of wells.

3.1         CPSE Refineries’ production during July, 2017 was 11964.15 TMT which is 19.01% higher than the target for the month and 1.29% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-July, 2017 was 47654.40 TMT which is 7.04% higher than the target for the period and 4.47% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

 

Ø IOCL, Guwahati: Lower due to deferment shutdown of HGU, HDT & MSQ from Apr'17 to Jun'17.

Ø IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to advancement of M&I shutdown by 5 days in July, 2017.

Ø IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to M&I shutdown of AVU-II from 18th Jul'17 onwards and high VGO/SRGO ISD stocks.

Ø IOCL, Gujarat: Lower due to deferment of M&I shutdown from May-Jun’17 to Jun-Jul'7.

Ø IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to CDU-1 idling due to low crude stock and high DHDT ISD due to HGU and DHDT shutdown.

Ø BPCL, Mumbai:  Lower due to planned outage of CDU3/ Hydrogen / Hydrocracker units for turnaround revamp.

 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during July, 2017 was 762.47 TMT which is 43.31% lower than the target for the month and 45.94% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-July, 2017 was 3357.31 TMT which is 16.71% lower than the target for the period and 42.48% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production from HMEL refinery was planned shutdown during May-Jun’17and Extension of low cost expansion Project.

3.3    Production in private refineries during July, 2017 was 7805.33 TMT which is 1.64% lower than the target for the month and 2.42% lower when compared with July, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-July, 2017 was 30418.62 TMT which is 2.09% higher than the target for the period and 1.25% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.

                A meeting was held between the Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik and Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today in Odisha Bhawan in New Delhi. In the meeting various options available to reach an amicable settlement of the present tax-dispute between Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and Government of Odisha were discussed. The Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, the Chairman, IOCL, The Chief Secretary, Government of Odisha and the Development Commissioner, Odisha were also present in the meeting.

Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan was of the view that though the State had extended the tax concession in 2004, there was a necessity of finding an amicable solution to the present impasse keeping in view the fiscal health of the State and commercial interest of IOCL. He emphasized on the need for finding a middle path, wherein both IOCL and the State Government can work out a mutual acceptable solution by climbing down from their stated positions.

Shri Pradhan was of the opinion that it was important for the State Government to incentivize the expansion plans of IOCL to create petrochemical and downstream industries in the State. Over a period of time, it will enable the State to increase its revenue and also create additional employment avenues for the youth of the State. This will lay foundation of a new industrial ecosystem, facilitating industrialization and fiscal consolidation. This is in keeping with the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister to provide adequate resources for development and industrialization of Eastern India, including Odisha.

It was agreed that the Officers of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, IOCL and the State Government will deliberate various issues and work out an acceptable solution at the earliest.

                Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas celebrated the World Biofuel Day 2017 today.

 

Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that the objective of “World Biofuel Day” is to sensitize youths (school and college going students), farmers and other stakeholders about the benefits of biofuel and seek their involvement in Biofuel programme run by the Government. These efforts should be take up on a public campaign mode, he added.

 

Highlighting the various efforts made by the Government in the BioFuel sector, Shri Pradhan said that The World BioFuel Day will be celebrated across 100 districts of the country in various states to create awareness about the bio fuel programme. These awareness campaigns are scheduled to be held between 11th to 14th August 2017 in partnership with stakeholders of the Bioenergy sector.

 

The Minister highlighted that the energy needs for Transportation and Domestic use in the country requires for 80 percent import of crude. Hon’ble Prime Minister has given a task to cut down the crude import by 10% by 2022. Shri Pradhan said that a roadmap on the use of biofuels will help in achieving this target. Promoting biofuels creates jobs, fosters economic growth, supports farmers and helps improve energy security for country.

 

Shri Pradhan said that the Ministry will be coming out with the BioFuel Policy soon. The policy will taken into consideration various facets like Role of Government, Return on investment, Minimum Assurance etc. Recently Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has been made responsible for BioFuel Policy. The Minister said that both the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will be working towards more utilisation of biofuels.

 

Shri Pradhan said that approx $2 Billion is being invested by the Government Companies by way of R&D on Second Generation (2G) Biofuel Refineries across the country.  Ways are being explored on conversion of urban, rural waste to fuel; use of waste/barren lands for cultivation of feedstock for 2G biofuels. The Minister said that the potential for the bio fuel industry in India would be around Rs 1 Lakh Crore in the next 1 to 2 years.

 

The Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari stressed upon the importance of biofuels as cost effective and environment friendly substitutes to conventional fuels.  He said that besides bringing down pollution, biofuels produced indigenously from agricultural waste, plants like bamboo, non-edible oilseeds, or municipal waste  will help  reduce  the country’s huge import burden. In addition , it will also  generate employment and boost the economy of rural areas, including the North East and the barren wastelands of the country. In this context, Shri Gadkari said, a  Biofuel Policy will be a major milestone in the socio-economic development of the country .

 

Shri Gadkari also announced that he would ask the Finance Minister to reduce the GST on bio-diesel from the current 18 percent to 5 percent.

 

Talking about the  transport sector the Minister said that the automobile growth in the country is an unsustainable 22 percent. So efforts are on in a big way to promote public  transport based on  cheaper and greener biofuels and electricity . India has brought in the necessary regulations for flexi engines. Nagpur city is running  55 buses on 100 percent bio ethanol and another 50  on Bio CNG derived from methane from sewage water. This is in addition to a 200 strong fleet of electric  taxis and autos. The shipping and inland waterways sectors too are gearing up for running ships and barges on methanol.

                The Government of India have been implementing many programmes / schemes for generating jobs like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) and National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM), Startup India, Standup India etc. Programmes such as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Yuva Yojana are enhancing the employability of the labour force to access job opportunities. Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Projects, Housing for All, MGNREGA, Sagar Mala and major reforms like Goods &Services Tax have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. 

Direct intervention schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices enhances employability of the youth to access employment. The Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) incentivizes industry to promote employment generation wherein Government reimburses employer’s contribution of 8.33% EPS made to new employees. 

The Model Land Leasing Act has been prepared to facilitate States for enactment of own land leasing laws to enhance agricultural productivity. The new legal framework is likely to encourage the land owners to lease out land without any fear of losing land rights and enable the tenant farmers to access bank credit, insurance, disaster relief and other support services. The land owners may also lease out land for agricultural purpose and thus help occupational mobility of the rural poor and help in rural poverty reduction. This shall provide opportunity for occupational diversification to land owners to opt for non-farm employment. 

The textile package announced by the Government includes several tax and production incentives. Under the package, the entire employer’s contribution of 12% towards the Employers Provident Fund Scheme, for new employees of garment industry earning less than Rs. 15,000 per month, is met by the Government of India for the first three years. In addition, considering the seasonal nature of the industry, fixed term employment has been introduced for the garment sector. A fixed term workman will be considered at par with permanent workman in terms of working hours, wages, allowances and other statutory dues. The Government has also suggested bringing in flexibility in labour laws to increase productivity.

                In September 2015, 193 countries including India committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as detailed in the United Nations resolution, ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’. There are 17 SDGs, which have 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. The SDG 1 is to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”; SDG 2 is to “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”; and SDG 5 is to “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” The SDGs facilitate the development action for greater human wellbeing. 

India presented a report on Voluntary National Review on the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals in the country to the 2017 High Level Political Forum (HLPF) of the United Nations on 19th July 2017. The India Voluntary National Review report focused on SDG 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere); SDG 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture); SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages); SDG 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls); SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), SDG 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) and SDG 17 (Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development).

                Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. (EESL), under the Ministry of Power, Government of India had put out a mega tender for procurement of 50 lakh smart meters in July, which would help in reducing AT&C losses, power theft and also help in monitoring of round the clock power supply eventually leading to greater efficiency and 24X7 power for all. 

 

A Pre-Bid Meeting was held by EESL on 22nd August 2017 for procurement of 50 lakh smart meters which elicited a stellar response from the smart meter manufacturers, system integrators and has also excited various other stakeholders including World Bank and telecom operators etc. The interest shown by the smart meter fraternity is also evident from the participation of about 100 companies in the pre-bid meeting and is a measure of the potential which smart projects have in India.

 

EESL will be making the entire upfront investment as well as maintain the whole infrastructure for the next ten years. This approach has made the project feasible as most of the state utilities are not in a position for such rollouts due to their financial constraints. EESL will recover its investment from the savings accruing to the DISCOMs in subsequent years.

 

The meters are being procured for implementation of smart grid projects in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. These meters will help these states in not only significantly reducing their AT&C losses way of increased billing efficiency, but will completely change the way in which electrical energy is presently being consumed and paid for by the ordinary consumers.

 

Installation of these smart meters along with its associated communication and IT infrastructure will enable the DISCOMs to obtain real time energy consumption data of each consumer for subsequent analysis and will pave the way for initiating various smart measures by DISCOMs like Time Of Day (TOD)/Time Of Use (TOU) billing, prediction and management of peak demand, providing real time energy consumption data to consumer, prepaid billing facility, remote connection and disconnection of load, accurate billing, etc. Installation of these meters will also obviate the need for the meter reader’s visit to each and every consumer.

 

In order to make the entire project feasible and affordable, EESL has unbundled the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) project into two parts viz. procurement of smart meter and arranging the system integrator. EESL is also planning to issue the tender for selection of system integrator early next month, as second part of the AMI project.

 

Senior officials of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh DISCOMs were present in the pre-bid meeting along with representatives from DISCOMs of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, as well as senior officials from CEA, NSGM etc.

• Over 30 lakh conventional street lights retrofitted with LED lights 
• EESL becomes the world’s largest street light management company

The Government of India’s Street Lighting National programme (SLNP) has illuminated 50,000 KM of Indian roads with installation of 30 lakh LED street lights across the country. With this milestone Energy Efficiency Services Limited, a government of India company under the administration of Ministry of Power, has become the world’s largest street light management company.

The installation of 30 lakh LED street lights has resulted in 39 crore kWh of annual energy savings, avoided capacity of over 104.19 MW to the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Further it has also helped in reduction of 3.29 lakh tonnes of CO2 annually. 

Under SLNP, Rajasthan is leading the country with an installation of 7.85 lakh LED street lights followed by Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat with 6.03 lakhs and 5.4 lakhs respectively. Presently, EESL is retrofitting 15,000 conventional lights with LED street lights every day. Project is near completion in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Tripura and Gujarat. EESL is also implementing a special heritage lighting project in Kashi region of Uttar Pradesh where 4,000 lights are being installed. The programme has also recently commenced in the cities of Chandigarh and Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

Further, the procurement price of the LED Street Lights has been reduced from Rs. 135/watt to Rs. 80/watt due to mass procurement of the lights. EESL makes the entire upfront investment in installation of the Street Lights and no additional budget allocation from the Municipalities is required. Municipalities pay EESL from the savings in energy and maintenance cost over a 7-year period, making the LED lights affordable and accessible. EESL also undertakes social audits in ULBs where the project is under implementation and post the completion of the project. Few of the social audit results give a clear indication that the overall satisfaction level and the perception of safety among the citizens is extremely high from the newly installed LED street lights.

EESL procurements conform to BIS specification & carry a 7-year warranty against technical defects. EESL conducts appropriate quality checks right from the bidding stage to the field level. This has resulted in the LEDs’ overall technical fault being less than 2% in the 30 lakh lights installed by EESL in the country. EESL has maintained an uptime of 97% for all street lights across the country.

EESL has a stringent complaint redressal mechanism wherein consumers can go to the “Register your complaint” section on UJALA dashboard www.ujala.gov.in, or on EESL social media handles - for Twitter @EESL_India and for Facebook @EESLIndia for registering complaints. They can also contact the All-India helpline number 1800 180 3580. The official EESL complaint registration email ID is helpline@eesl.co.in. Consumers can also register their complaints at the EESL complaint logging portal - http://support.eeslindia.org/. Further EESL has also installed Centralised Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) to enable remote operation and monitoring of the street lights. CCMS provides real time information on energy consumption and remote monitoring of the street lights.

                Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), under the Ministry of Power, today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) for distribution of energy efficient appliances under the flagship Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and appliances for All (UJALA) scheme. According to the agreement, Oil Marketing Companies- IOCL, BPCL and HPCL will take up distribution of LED Bulbs, LED Tubelights and energy efficient Fans from select retail outlets across the country. The distribution of these energy efficient appliances will be conducted in a phased manner across these select outlets. In the first phase, distribution will commence from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

 

The MoUs were signed with Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) in the august presence of Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC)  for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, and Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of State (IC) for Petroleum and Natural Gas here.

 

As part of the MoUs with the OMCs, EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by the OMCs barring manpower and space.

 

The consumer can purchase high quality 9W LED Bulbs for Rs 70, 20W LED Tubelight for Rs 220 and Five-Star Rated Ceiling Fan for Rs 1,200/-.

 

Addressing the occasion, Shri. Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, said “It is worth noting that two important ministries of the Government of India have come together to realise Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of every citizen having access to energy efficient appliances. The marketing network of the three oil marketing companies is unparalleled and this tie-up will only accelerate and scale up the distribution of energy efficient appliances across the length and breadth of the country.”

 

In his speech, Shri. Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of State (IC) for Petroleum, and Natural Gas, said “It is the vision of the Government of India to reduce our dependence on import of energy by upto 10%. The petrol pumps owned by the three oil marketing companies can boast of a very high footfall. It is a great opportunity for the two departments to come together and utilise this network for ensuring LED bulbs and tubelights reach every corner of our country. Sh. Pradhan said that the ecosystem of non-fuel retail business around the retail outlets will not only help drive the non-fuel business but will also lead to customer convenience in their own vicinity.”

 

The three Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies, Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum together have a vast network of over 54,500 petroleum Retail Outlets spanning the length and breadth of the country. These Outlets not only meet the growing fuelling needs of our rapidly developing nation but also offer a bouquet of allied services like ATMs, Service Stations, Convenience Stores and PUC facilities to enhance value and convenience to customers across the urban, highway and rural markets. The unmatched network of these mega petroleum companies will significantly boost the distribution and marketing reach of EESL and extend the availability of energy efficient products to all corners of India.

 

Currently, over 25.5 crore LED Bulbs, over 30.6 lakh LED Tubelights and around 11.5 lakh energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme. This is leading to an annual energy savings of over 3,340 crore kWh and resulting in avoidance of over 6,725 MW of peak demand. Through the scheme the estimated cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers annually, is over INR 13,346 crore and is leading to reduction of approximately 2.7 crore tonnes of CO2 every year.

Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) was launched in November, 2015 and has completed more than one year of operation. Participating States of UDAY have taken over the targeted debt of Rs. 2.09 lakh crores of their DISCOMs under borrowing exemption from the FRBM Act given in UDAY for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17.

 The process of States taking over the targeted debts and issuing them as SDL Bonds has now been completed.As of now, the participating DISCOMs have to issue Bonds worth approximately Rs. 37,000 crores, which would be done in due course. Rest of the debt with DISCOMs is mostly in the nature of CAPEX debt, which pays for itself, or Scheme based debt, which converts into grants fully or partially. Thus, they are not required to be taken over by the States.

 



 

As a result of the debt addressed as above, and other operational interventions, the participating DISCOMs have achieved net savings of approximately Rs. 15,000 Crores till March, 2017. Further, in the participating States, the Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realized (ARR) gaps have come down by almost 14 paise per Unit and the AT&C losses have reduced by almost 1% in FY 17.

 As per the provisions of UDAY Scheme, the States would start taking over losses of DISCOMs in a graded manner from now on, starting with taking over 5% of the losses of FY17 from the current financial year. Continued, concerted and coordinated efforts by the Centre, States and DISCOMs, in the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism, would help turn around the Distribution Sector by FY19.

                Considering the fact that majority of the government buildings are old constructions and, therefore, consume large amount of energy, the Ministry of Finance has issued guidelines for mandatory installation of energy efficient appliances in all Central Government buildings across India.

The Ministry, in a statement, has directed that usage of LED based lightings and energy efficient cooling equipment such as fans and air conditioners in government buildings will lead to savings in the long run through reduction in energy consumption. To implement this, Department of Expenditure under Ministry of Finance has decided to take up services of Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of PSUs under the Ministry of Power, on nomination basis to assist various ministries and departments to retrofit energy efficient appliances in all their premises across the country.

Currently, EESL is the implementation agency for the Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme, which was launched in May 2017 by Minister of State (IC) FOR Power , Coal , Mines & New & Renewable Energy , Shri Piyush Goyal. Under the programme, EESL intends to bring in investment of around 1000 crore covering more than 10,000 large government/private buildings by 2020. It is estimated that about one crore LED lights, 15 lakh energy efficient ceiling fans, and 1.5 lakh energy efficient ACs will be retrofitted by EESL in these buildings. Apart from retrofitting, EESL also aims to widen its services in areas like centralized AC system, Energy Audits, and New Generation Energy Management System in buildings.

The Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme has two business models: a) The ESCO (Energy Servicing Company) model, where the entire upfront investment is made by EESL, which is paid back by the building owner out of the resulting energy savings from the intervention, and b) The PMC (Project Management Consultancy) model, where EESL is the project management consultant for implementing the project for the client. The client invests the entire project cost and bears one-time PMC charges of EESL.

With the Buildings Programme, EESL aims to enhance the savings portfolio and ensure energy security for each citizen. EESL has already retrofitted energy efficient appliances in prominent Government buildings such as NITI Aayog, Nirman Bhawan, Sardar Patel Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, J&K Assembly, Jammu Secretariat, Vidyut Bhawan, and Rajiv Chowk Metro station where energy efficient LED lights, energy efficient ceiling fans, and energy efficient air conditioners have been retrofitted. EESL has so far installed about 94,000 LED lights, 3,000 energy efficient air conditioners, and over 400 energy efficient ceiling fans in these buildings. At present, the savings through 28 completed building projects across seven states are estimated to be over 11.03 MU, which is bound to increase with each completed project.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 5th January, 2015 had launched the National LED Programme, to facilitate rapid adoption of LED based home and street lighting across the country. The programme components, Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) and Street Lighting National Programme (SNLP) of EESL are currently under implementation in 29 States and 7 Union Territories.

Shri Goyal stated that EESL’s procurements conform to BIS specification IS 16102 (Part 2): 2012 for performance requirements of self-ballast lamps. Further, these bulbs carry a 3-year free replacement warranty against technical defects. There are stringent quality checks to ensure the quality of LED bulbs. No specific complaints have been received regarding excessive charging and lack of interest by distributing agencies under UJALA scheme. EESL has deployed field monitoring staff to take care of such issues, if any, the Minister added. 

 Shri Goyal also informed that under the UJALA Scheme, EESL aggregates the demand and procures LED bulbs through competitive bidding process to get the lowest price compared to retail market. The consumers, having metered connection, can acquire LED bulbs from designated distribution centres set up at various locations across the country. LED bulbs are being distributed on upfront payment basis and on-bill finance scheme in 36 States and UTs across India under UJALA scheme.

ASHWANI LOHANI

 

Dear Colleagues,

 

          It is with immense pride that I share with you my happiness on assuming the position of Chairman, Railway Board. This is not only an onerous responsibility but also a challenge being the administrative head of this great organization, which is also the lifeline of the nation. At this critical juncture when we are facing a serious issue with the image perception of the railways, I expect all my fellow Railwaymen to pitch in wholeheartedly to set this perception right. I am sure, with your cooperation, we will be able to achieve and re-establish the pristine glory of the brand Indian Railways.

Indian Railways is indeed a great organization. The largest employer in the world under a single management, we are the wheels on which the nation moves. Spreading from Kanyakumari in the South to Baramulla in the North, Dibrugarh in the East to Okha in the West, this great monolith indeed touches almost the entire length and breadth of this great nation and thereby the lives of almost all the citizens of this nation. The sincerity, dedication and professional capability of the railway employees, both officers and staff is indeed unparalleled. It is the men on the field who, regardless of their personal inconveniences and hardships, ensure that the wheels of the Nation keep moving surely and safely.  This is what makes the Indian Railways the most visible symbol of dynamic delivery in our country.

After spending over 41 years with the railways, this appointment as the head of the railway family has touched the inner core of my heart and makes me extremely grateful to the almighty. Besides being a humbling moment, it also strengthens my resolve to put in my life and soul for the welfare and the forward march of this great organization.

The great Indian Railways has suffered a serious dent in the recent past due to certain unfortunate incidents. Such incidents often overshadow the great work that this organization performs day in and day out. Let us, therefore, resolve to bring about an all-round improvement in the working of the railways so that we are able to satisfactorily meet the hopes,  expectations and aspirations of the vast multitude.

SAFETY shall always remain our principal focus area. We have to always be on our guard to ensure the highest level of safety in train operations and instil a renewed sense of confidence in our esteemed passengers.

CLEANLINESS at stations and on trains is another area that is crying for attention and often contributes to our image. Similarly quality of CATERING and LINEN on trains is also an area of serious concern. We have to work in a mission mode to bring about quantitative and qualitative improvements in a very short time frame in these areas, while at the same time not losing sight of the fact that the railways needs an overall improvement to achieve total customer satisfaction.

Our Operating Ratio needs to be brought down considerably, not only by reducing expenditure but by increasing freight loading and also finding other means of non-conventional revenue generation to achieve a spurt in revenues.

I have always believed in the supremacy of the human resource. For me my employees, not the customers, come first.  For, it is my firm conviction, that a contented and happy employee is the prerequisite for the success of any organization. And this great organisation is no exception. I would therefore, expect employee welfare to be the core concern of all railwaymen.

At the same time we also have to deal with the evils of corruption, sexual harassment at work places and alcohol abuse while on duty. These are social evils and need to  be dealt firmly with an iron hand.

I personally believe in avoiding any frills in the form of bouquets, gifts, lavish celebrations, excessive protocol etc. These divert our attention from our primary responsibilities, hard core work and severely damage the organization also. Our focus needs to be on deliverance and deliverance alone. We also have to reform our processes, many of which have, with passage of time, become so complicated that they seriously hamper work. That remaining busy is not deliverance is a thought that also needs to be imbibed.

This is my personal appeal to all my fellow railwaymen to put in their best effort to restore the old glory of the lifeline of the nation – the great Indian Railways.

Jai Hind

 

(Ashwani Lohani)

626 employees of BWEL will be benefitted from the voluntary retirement scheme to be offered at 2007 pay scale. The Government will have to provide one time grant off 151.18 crore towards severance package and for clearing the current liabilities of the company. 

This measure will stop flow of financial support from public funds for carrying on the operations of sick/loss making BWEL resulting in savings for the Government. 

The implementation will be done as per the timelines prescribed in the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) on time bound closure of sick/loss making CPSEs. 

In view of the continues poor physical and financial performance of the company for more than 10 years, in spite of financial assistance and other support provided by Ministry of Railways combined with low probability of its revival in future, Bharat Wagon and Engineering Co. Ltd. is being wound up. 

Background: 

BWEL was incorporated on 4th Dec' 1978 as a CPSE after taking over two sick private sector companies - Arthur Butler & Company, Muzaffarpur and Britannia Engineering Company, Mokama. The Company was referred to BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) in December, 2000 and was declared sick in the year 2002. The Company continues to be a sick Company since then. The administrative control of the company was transferred from Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) to the MoR in August, 2008, as approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. The company is engaged in the manufacture and repair of wagons, and is having two manufacturing units, at Mokama and Muzaffarpur in Bihar.

                  Railways propose to install display screens at foot-over bridges, platforms, waiting rooms etc. at Railway Stations under Railway Display Network (RDN) project.  RailTel Corporation of India Ltd, a Public Sector Undertaking under the administrative control of Ministry of Railways, has been appointed as Nodal Agency to implement and manage Indian Railway’s RDN system.

       Railway Display Network is envisaged to become a unique medium of communication with passengers which will not only provide necessary information and social messages to the passengers but will also become a medium of enriched infotainment.

Along with train information, it is proposed to display advertisement and social messages on the display screens.  Railway Display Network will generate revenue by displaying contextualized advertisements for pre-agreed duration and frequency. Railway Display Network is planned to be built and operated on a self-sustainable model with no capital investment by Indian Railways.

Railway Display Network system will:

i)  Display information related to train arrival, departure, train running status, platform  and other passenger related information round the clock.

ii)  Display information related to passenger amenities, comfort, convenience and safety.

iii) Display emergency messages on SOS basis and messages related to Disaster Management.

iv) Infotainment and social messages for engaging passengers.

v) Self-sustainable model by generating revenue through advertisement or any other related revenue generation opportunities.

 The Proof of Concept (Pilot) of the project has since been completed at 16 stations of Indian Railways and around 500 display screens have been installed for the pilot project.   The Railway Display Network system including installation of Display screens is expected to cover all A1, A, B, C, and D category stations of Indian Railways.

  Railway Display Network system is proposed to be built and operated on a self-sustainable model with no capital investment by Indian Railways.  Roll-out of the Railway Display Network system at various designated stations is expected to be done in a phased manner, starting with deployment at A1 category stations followed by A, C and other category stations.  The complete project is expected to be completed in 4 years.

			Background
			
			
			:
			
			
			The project section is a part of Malda-Guwahati Main line route. For the route connecting to North East region this is the only 51 km patch left for doubling and it is necessary for overall development of the region and to reap the benefits of other doubling projects and gauge conversion projects completed in the section. The line capacity utilization of the section between Raninagar Jalpaiguri to Samuktala Road is 145.70% with maintenance block during 2016-17. At present, 38 trains are running against the sectional capacity of 22 trains. Doubling is therefore absolutely necessary to speed up operation of goods and passenger trains and for overall development of the region.
			
		
		
			
			Strategy and targets
			
			
			:
			
			
			(i)    Anticipated cost of Rs 602.27 crore with completion cost of  Rs 648.19 crore of the project is proposed to be funded through Gross Budgetary Support

Improvement to Passenger amenities on Indian Railways (IR) is a continuous process. Present day passengers expect visible and qualitative improvement in public utilities and amenities provided at the Stations. With a view to meeting the expectations of the passengers, Indian Railways is making all out effort to provide improved facilities at the stations including those located in small cities/towns. Indian Railways has more than 8000 Stations. It has always been the endeavour of the Railways to provide adequate amenities to the passengers at the stations. Certain amenities are provided at the time of construction of new stations based on anticipated volume of traffic. Amenities are further augmented from time to time with growth in passenger traffic handled at stations, based on the felt need, expectations of the travelling public and availability of funds. 

In the recent past Indian Railways has taken various steps to improve the services and facilitate the passengers, some of which are given below.

At stations:


	Lifts and Escalators at the stations for facilitating movement across platforms.
	Battery Operated Vehicles for carrying passengers before/after the train journey, especially senior citizens and persons with disabilities.



	Yatri Mitra Sewa for passengers requiring wheel-chair assistance.



	Well appointed Retiring Rooms, Waiting Halls and Executive Lounges to relax for passengers during transit.
	Wi-fi facility at 127 important stations on IR.


 

In Reservations and travel:


	Introduction of the Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme known as ‘VIKALP’ to give option to waitlisted passengers to shift to alternate train having vacant accommodation.
	Provision of facility to physically handicapped persons to book reserved tickets online.



	Introduction of paperless unreserved ticket booking through mobile phone.



	Automatic refund of confirmed/ Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC)/e-tickets on cancellation of trains.
	Enhancement of Senior Citizen Quota as well as quota earmarked for physically handicapped persons.
	Making provision in the system for automatic preparation of reservation charts at least four hours before the scheduled departure of train.



	Provision of facility to book available accommodation after preparation of first reservation chart through internet as well as across any computerized Passenger Reservation System (PRS) counter upto preparation of second reservation chart.
	Acceptance of all International Credit/Debit cards for booking of e-tickets through Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website.



	The passengers having confirmed/RAC/Waitlisted PRS counter tickets may cancel the same through IRCTC website (irctc.co.in) or through 139 within the prescribed time limit and the refund amount maybe collected across PRS counter on surrendering the original ticket.
	In order to facilitate cancellation of PRS counter tickets at relatively smaller stations, one of the Unreserved Ticketing System(UTS) cum PRS counters (wherever PRS booking facility is available) has been earmarked for granting refund beyond the working hours of PRS counters/Current counters. This facility is available in respect of PRS counter tickets for those trains whose scheduled departure time is within the next 24 hours.
	Establishment of Yatri Ticket Suvidha Kendras for issuing of tickets through public private partnership for establishment and operation of computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS)-cum Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) terminals.



	Facility for booking unreserved ticket including platforms tickets and Season Tickets through mobile phone in the 6 suburban sections of IR in Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Secunderabad and in Delhi – Palwal and Delhi-Ghaziabad sections of Northern Railway
	Commencement of concierge services with facility for online booking of wheelchairs through IRCTC website at New Delhi and 23 other stations.
	Provision of Automatic Ticket Vending Machines to facilitate purchase of unreserved journey tickets.



	Extension of e-ticketing facility to foreign debit/credit cards for foreign tourists and NRIs.



	Commissioning of online booking of retiring room at over 488 Railway stations.


 

Regular inspections are conducted by Officers, Service Improvement Group (SIG), Passenger Amenities Committee (PAC) & Passenger Services Committee (PSC) to monitor the availability and maintenance of passenger facilities at stations and remedial measures are taken as and when deficiencies are noted.

            In the first phase of 23 stations, bids for Jammu Tawi and Kozhikode Railway Stations have been opened on 12.07.2017 and 24.07.2017 respectively.

            Further, a dedicated organization viz. Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) has been set up to undertake redevelopment of stations to international standards. 12 stations viz. Amritsar (Punjab), Anand Vihar (Delhi), Bijwasan (Delhi), Baiyappanahalli (Karnataka), Chandigarh (Punjab), Gandhinagar (Gujarat), Gandhinagar (Rajasthan), Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh), Habibganj (Madhya Pradesh), Nagpur (Maharashtra), Surat (Gujarat) and Shivajinagar (Maharashtra) have been entrusted to IRSDC for redevelopment.

The work of Habibganj Railway Station has been started. A contract of civil engineering works for redevelopment of Gandhinagar Railway Station along with construction of a 300-room hotel on the air space of the station has also been awarded and ground-breaking done. The work is in progress. Bids for Surat Railway Station have been opened on 05.06.2017.

These projects are new to Railways and complex in nature. These require detailed techno-economic feasibility studies, hence no time frame has been presently set for completion of these projects.

The cost of station redevelopment is to be met by leveraging commercial development of vacant land/air space in and around the stations. Therefore, railway funds are not required for station redevelopment projects. Such projects shall generally be cost neutral to Railway.

Indian Railways for first time build partnership with multifold agencies for execution of Railway Electrification projects by entrusting 1735 rkm of RE projects to IRCON, RITES & PGCIL. Minister of  Railways  further emphasized that cumulative saving due to electric traction bill will be about Rs 26,000 crore in a decade which will be in addition to saving of  Rs 41,000 crore planned to be achieved due to reduction in cost of power to Railways. Mission Electrification shall also make Indian Railways more environment friendly.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Railways Shri Manoj Sinha said, “Under the leadership of Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, Indian Railways has accomplished significantly. The speedy implementation of projects is appreciated. Mission Electrification is one such initiative to transform Railways. Mission Electrification will reduce the traction bill & help Indian Railways make the operation cost better & save significantly. The ambitious plan to electrify 4000 rkm will make Indian Railways more environment friendly by reducing the emission.”

Shri Ghanshyam Singh, Member Traction, Railway Board said, “Indian Railways, as part of broader policy of GoI, to reduce Carbon footprint, increase energy security by reducing import bill, has taken up this mega effort to electrify almost all Railway broad gauge (BG) tracks in next 5 years. It is expected that electrification of 90% of BG network of Indian Railway will result into reduction in fuel bill by Rs  3,300 crores per annum from 2020-21 onward with this will provide cumulative savings of Rs 26,000 crores in next 10 years.”

 

BACKGROUNDER:-

 

Indian Railways had launched Mission Electrification on 3rd Nov’16 under the guidance of Minister of Railways  Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, for electrification of 24,400 route kilometre (rkm) of BG network in next five years i.e. almost equal to what has been done from introduction of electric traction since 3rdFeb’1925. In order to make this ambitious project successful, Indian Railways for the first time has changed from Business as usual (BAU) approach and entrusted new electrification works not only to Railway PSUs like Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) and Rail India Techno Economic Service (RITES) but also to Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL), a well known transmission sector PSU under Ministry of Power (MoP). As part of Mission Electrification, in recent past 10 different electrification projects covering 2516 route kilometer at a cost of about Rs 2797 Cr. have been finalized in a short duration.

Indian Railways also for the first time for effective management and fast execution of project has awarded Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts for Electrification of Delhi Sarai Rohilla – Rewari and Alwr – Bandikui – Jaipur – Phulera – Ajmer (353 RKM) section at a cost of Rs 594 crore and Roha – Verna (428 RKM) of Konkan Railway at a cost of Rs 456 crore to M/s L&T.  For faster execution of Railway Electrification projects, BAU approach has been changed. Emphasis has been put on mechanized execution of OHE construction works. It has been planned to introduce Self Propelled type Wiring Train for faster and efficient wiring of both catenary and contact wires and Self propelled type Multi Utility Vehicles for faster mast erection within shorter block period. Similarly, pre cast cylindrical foundation (cast in-situ) and prefabricated foundation is also being introduced for mast erection. In addition the project approval/ sanctioning process period has been streamlined and normal 24 months has been reduced to about six months only.  For fast track execution of projects adequate and timely funding of the projects is being ensured Extra Budgetary Resources (Institutional Financing).

In this regard in an event for “Exchanging of Agreement with Stakeholders as part of “Mission Electrification” & ‘First EPC’ contract of Indian Railways” was held today i.e. 04th August 2017 at Rail Bhawan, New Delhi. Indian Railway brought out

●       First EPC (Engineering Procurement Construction) based contract of Indian Railways valuing Rs 1050 Cr. for 781 rkm with M/s L&T. The contract has been awarded by CORE and Konkan Railway for major electrification projects.

●        In this event additionally eight agreements were exchanged between Zonal Railways and Public Sector Undertakings for 1735 rkm of electrification projects valuing Rs 1746 Cr.

                Provision of enhanced passenger amenities in train coaches is a continual endeavor of the Indian Railways.

Some of the policy decisions taken in this regard are:

1. Provision of cushioned seats in General Second class coaches.

2. Provision of bottle holder and snack table in Non-AC Sleeper Class coaches.

3. Provision of dust bins in Non-AC coaches.

4. Provision of mugs with chain in Non-AC coaches.

5. Provision of Health Faucets in AC as well as Non-AC Sleeper class coaches, etc.

 

Besides, new trains having better passenger amenities, such as Tejas, Humsafar and Antyodaya have already been introduced. It has also been decided to carry out the work of upgradation of the coach interiors and exteriors and to provide additional amenities in the identified coaches, that have a certain balance residual life. The upgradation of coaches would result in an improvement in the overall ambience and furnishing and enhanced passenger comfort. It has been decided to carry out the work in a phased manner depending upon the availability of capacities and funds.

Cleaning of coaches including toilets is done at both ends in all trains. Some of the major initiatives taken by Indian Railways towards improvement of cleanliness in trains are as follows:-

(i) Cleaning of coaches of trains at both ends including mechanized cleaning.

(ii) On Board House Keeping Service (OBHS) has been provided in nearly 900 trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, and other important long distance Mail/Express trains for cleaning of coach toilets, doorways, aisles and passenger compartments during the run of the trains.

(iii) ‘Clean My Coach’ service is provided on demand in nearly 880 important Superfast/ Mail/Express long distance trains having “On Board Housekeeping Service”.

(iv) Clean Train Station (CTS) scheme has also been prescribed for limited mechanized cleaning attention to identified trains including cleaning of toilets during their scheduled stoppages enroute at nominated stations. 40 Clean Train Stations are presently working.

In its endeavour to provide quality and hygienic food to the passengers, Indian Railways have developed and operationalized an institutionalized mechanism for monitoring of quality and hygiene of catering services through regular inspections at various levels to address catering complaints. Further, to improve the standard of food being provided to passengers in trains, new Catering Policy has been issued on 27th February, 2017 wherein inter-alia Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has been mandated to carry out the unbundling by creating a distinction primarily between food preparation and food distribution. In order to upgrade quality of food preparation, IRCTC is to set up new kitchens and upgrade existing ones. Further, a pilot project on optional catering service will be provided to passengers booking tickets from 01.08.2017 onwards for the journeys to commence on 01.08.2017 and onwards shall be introduced on 31 Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto under the management of IRCTC w.e.f. 01.08.2017. This scheme shall be implemented for an initial period of 6 months subject to mid-term review of the scheme after 3 months.

Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli has been planned to have an installed capacity of 1000 coaches per year. In addition, a factory has been set up at Haldia, West Bengal, for furnishing of 100 Diesel Electrical Multiple Unit (DEMU) coaches every year. However both, Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli, and DEMU Coach Factory, Haldia, are still in the stabilization phase and their outturn is planned to increase gradually.

The demand for rail service is dynamic and decreases/increases depending upon seasonal variations, growth of passenger traffic, etc. The requirement of the coaches is based on these factors and gets included in the annual Coach Production Programme. The production of coaches is normally commensurate with the requirement.

The Indian Railways have procured Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU)/ Alternating Current Electrical Multiple Unit (ACEMU) coaches from private manufacturers in the past, but no such order has been placed on private manufacturers during the last three years.

                ●       Major benefit to farmers due to reduction in spoilages by 35%.

 

       Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, Minister of Railways & Shri Devendra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra laid the  foundation stone for the cold storage on 30th July, 2017 at Lasalgaon near Nashik in Maharashtra. Indian Railways’ PSU CONCOR (Container Corporation of India ltd.) is developing a cold store at Lasalgaon near Nashik for storage of onions and other perishable produce.  This cold storage will have a total capacity of 2500 MT out of which 1500 MT will be exclusively utilised for onion storage and remaining for other perishable commodities such as fruits & vegetables like Onion, Pomegranate, Grapes, Banana, Tomato, Citrus. Indian Railways has now steered into the areas of providing storage facility to the farmers and the cold storage at Lasalgaon will be a boon to the farmers of not only Nashik & Lasalgaon, but also of nearby areas of Jalgaon, Manmad, Dhule,etc.

          The cold storage is being set up on CSR model by CONCOR at a cost of Rs. 5 crores.  The cold storage will be maintained by M/s Lasalgaon Vibhag Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh Ltd. Railways is a major transporter for onion and plays a key role in timely transportation of onion to various consumer market from producer states.  To reduce the spoilages, Indian Railways allots the rakes/ wagons on priority basis wherever possible for carriage of onion.  

         The climatic conditions largely affect the onion growing areas thereby leading to fluctuations in farm produce. The bumper production needs to be properly stored to stabilise supply during scarcity. The conventional methods lead to losses exceeding 35% depending on the weather conditions.  The losses are thus national loss as the input cost increases. The cold storage will help in increasing the post storage life of onions & they can be even sent to remote locations. The labour cost is reduced to a great extent as there is no need for turning around the onions as required in conventional storage.  There is direct saving of material cost and farming cost due to saving in weight and spoilage losses. Maharashtra being 33% contributor to the national onion production needs quality storage options.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed between India and Nepal for laying down implementation arrangement on Cost sharing, Schedules and Safeguard issues for starting construction of a new Bridge over Mechi River at Indo-Nepal border.

The estimated cost of construction of the bridge is Rs. 158.65 crore, which would be funded by Government of India through ADB loan. The new bridge is part of up-gradation of the Kakarvitta (Nepal) to Panitanki Bypass (India) on NH 327B covering a length of 1500 meters including a 6 lane approach road of 825 meters. Mechi Bridge is the ending point of Asian Highway 02 in India leading to Nepal and provides critical connectivity to Nepal.

The construction of the bridge will improve regional connectivity and has potential to strengthen cross border trade between both the countries and cementing ties by strengthening industrial, social and cultural exchanges.

National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) under Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has been designated as the implementing agency for this project. DPR for this project has been prepared and alignment of bridge has been finalized in consultation with Government of Nepal.

			भारतीय राजमार्ग प्राधिकरण ने आज नई दिल्ली में  दो मोबाइल ऐप्स -  माइ फास्ट टैग और फास्टैग पार्टनर का शुभारंभ किया जो इलेक्ट्रॉनिक टोल संग्रह के लिए फास्टैग की उपलब्धता प्रदान करेंगे। इस अवसर पर एनएचएआई के अध्यक्ष श्री दीपक कुमार ने कहा कि ईटीसी परियोजना के लिए फास्टैग की खरीद और रिचार्ज के बोझल तरीके प्रमुख चुनौती रहे हैं। आज शुरू किए किए गए मोबाइल इस प्रक्रिया को सरल बनाएंगे और इनसे मोबाइल बटन के क्लिक पर फास्टैग्स की खरीदारी या रीचार्ज कराना संभव होगा।

			मायफ़ास्टैग एक उपभोक्ता ऐप है जिसे एंड्रॉइड और आईओएस सिस्टम दोनों के लिए डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है। उपभोक्ता इस ऐप से फास्टैग की खरीदारी या रिचार्ज कर सकता है। ऐप लेनदेन करने में मदद करने के अलावा ऑनलाइन शिकायत निवारण में सहायता प्रदान करता है।

			फास्टैग पार्टनर एक व्यापारी ऐप है। कॉमन सर्विसेज सेंटर, बैंकिंग भागीदार और वाहन डीलर जैसी एजेंसियां इस ऐप के माध्यम से बिक्री और फास्टैग लगा सकती हैं। इसके अलावा ऐप आरएफआईडी टैग को सक्रिय करने में प्रयुक्त किया जा सकता है जो इस संबंध में 2013 में जारी राजपत्र अधिसूचना के अनुकरण में देश की लगभग 74 लाख कारों में इनबिल्ट है। ये आरएफआईडी टैग पहले से ही कारों में लगे हैं लेकिन निष्क्रिय हैं। यह ऐप इन आरएफआईडी टैग को ईटीसी टैग यानि (फास्टैग) में बदल देगा।

			श्री दीपक कुमार ने यह भी सूचित किया कि 1 अक्टूबर, 2017 से देश के सभी 371 एनएचएआई टोल प्लाजा की सभी लेन फास्टैग से युक्त हो जाएंगी। हर एक टोल प्लाज़ा की एक लेन समर्पित फास्टैग लेन होगी, जहां कोई अन्य भुगतान स्वीकार नहीं होगा। अन्य लेन यद्यपि फास्टैग युक्त होंगी लेकिन वे भुगतान का अन्य तरीका भी स्वीकार करेंगी। सभी 371 एनएचएआई टोल प्लाजा में समर्पित फास्टैग लेन1 सितंबर, 2017 से शुरू हो जाएंगे।

			उपरोक्त के अलावा, एनएचएआई सभी टोल प्लाजा के पास सामान्य सेवा केंद्र (सीएससी) के माध्यम से फास्टैग की ऑनलाइन बिक्री करेगा। अब फास्टैग जारीकर्ता बैंक वेबसाइटों/एनएचएआई वेबसाइट/आईएचएमसीएल वेबसाइट से ऑनलाइन की जा सकता है और इन्हें क्रयकर्ता के घर कोरियर द्वारा भेजा जाएगा। कल यानि 18 अगस्त, 2017 से शुरू हो रहे फास्टैग की खरीदारी सभी टोल प्लाजा के पास स्थापित सामान्य सेवा केन्द्र बिक्री केंद्रों से भी की जा सकती है। सीएससी का 20 करोड़ आधार कार्ड बनाने और कम अवधि में ही अपने बड़े नेटवर्क के कारण डिजीटल इंडिया के अन्य लक्ष्य अर्जित करने में पूर्व रिकॉर्ड बहुत अच्छा है। अनुमान है कि सीएससी के साथ भागीदारी ईटीसी पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र को और बढ़ावा मिलेगा।

			अभी तक 6 लाख से अभी फास्टैग बेचे जा चुके हैं। अनुमान है कि फास्टैग की उपलब्धता और पहुंच में सुधार करने की इन पहलों से अधिक से अधिक लोग इन्हें खरीदने के लिए प्रोस्ताहिस होंगे। इससे ईटीसी परियोजना को बहुप्रतीक्षित बढ़ावा मिलेगा जिनका उद्देश्य यात्रा को अधिक सुविधाजनक त्वरित और जनता के लिए पर्यावरण अनुकूल बनाना है।

National Highways Authority of India launched two mobile Apps – MyFASTag and FASTag Partner in New Delhi today, to facilitate the availability of FASTags for Electronic Toll Collection.  Speaking on the occasion the NHAI Chairman Shri Deepak Kumar said the cumbersome method of purchase and recharge of FASTags has been one of the major challenges with the ETC project. The mobile Apps launched today will ease the process, making it possible to buy or recharge FASTags at the click of a mobile button.

MyFASTag is a consumer App that can be downloaded from the App Store for both Android and iOS systems. A consumer can purchase or recharge FASTags on this App. The App also helps to keep track of transactions and provides for online grievance redressal. 

FASTag Partner is a merchant App. Agencies like Common Services Centre, banking partners and vehicle dealers can sell and enroll  FASTag through this App. In addition to this, the App can also be used to activate the RFID tags that came built in with around 74 lakh cars in the country following the 2013 Gazette Notification in this regard. These RFID tags are already fixed on the cars but are dormant. This App will convert these RFID tags into ETC Tag (FASTag).

Shri Deepak Kumar also informed that from 1st October 2017, all lanes of all 371 NHAI toll plazas in the country will become FASTag enabled.  One lane in every toll plaza will be a dedicated FASTag lane where no other form of payment will be accepted.  The other lanes, though FASTag enabled, can accept other forms of payment too. The dedicated FASTag lanes will become operational on all 371 NHAI toll plazas from 1stSeptember 2017, he said.

In addition to the above, NHAI has also come up with Online sale of FASTags and offline sale through Common Services Centre (CSC) near toll plazas. FASTag can now be purchased online from Issuer Banks websites / NHAI website / IHMCL website and will be delivered by courier at the door step of the purchaser. Beginning tomorrow, 18th August, 2017, FASTags can also be bought from sale points of Common Services Centre (CSC) to be set up near toll plazas. CSC has a proven track record of making 20 crore Adhar Cards and achieving many other milestones of Digital India in short duration due to their vast network. It is expected that the association with CSC will give the ETC ecosystem a further boost.

More than 6 lakh FASTags have been sold so far. It is expected that these initiatives for improving the availability and access to FASTags will encourage more and more people to buy them. This will give the much needed push to the ETC project that aims to make travel more convenient, faster and environment friendly for people.

In order to facilitate the availability of FASTags for Electronic Toll Collection, NHAI has taken two revolutionary steps in consultation with RBI and NPCI . These include Online sale of FASTags and offline sale through  Common Services Centre (CSC) near toll plazas. 

FASTag can also be purchased online from Issuer Banks websites / NHAI website / IHMCL website and will be delivered by courier at the door step of the purchaser. It is expected that this move will increase the sale of FASTags by improving availability and access. 

Apart from the online sale,  from tomorrow, 18th August, 2017, FASTags can also be bought from sale points of  Common Services Centre (CSC) to be set up near toll plazas. CSC has a proven track record of making 20 crore Adhar Cards and achieving many other milestones of Digital India in short duration due to their vast network. It is expected that the association with CSC will give the  ETC ecosystem a further boost. 

Hybrid ETC work that involves installation & integration of RFID readers in all the Toll Plaza lanes is already under progress and is likely to be completed by 31st October, 2017.  Out of all Hybrid Lanes, at least one shall be exclusively dedicated for FASTag vehicles where no other mode of Toll Payment shall be accepted .  This exclusive one lane for FASTag vehicles will be operational with effect from 1 September, 2017. 

In pursuance of PM Modi’s drive for a cashless economy, NHAI has been working on installation and efficient execution of ETC infrastructure at all the toll plazas under its jurisdiction.               The work being done by NHAI in this direction, will provide safe, smooth and seem less journey to commuters on National Highways.

The provision of ‘Make’ Procedure is a vital pillar for realising the vision behind ‘Make’ in India’ initiative. During the past one year, the Indian Army has carried out a series of detailed interactions with private industry and academia to identify their existing potential towards defence technology, R & D and production. 

A similar seminar was held in Aug 16 to acquaint the industry of MAKE projects as approved in 2016 by MoD. The process has since been in motion and outcomes have been extremely encouraging. 

As a step in this direction, second Seminar on ‘MAKE’ projects for Indian Army was held on 12 Aug 17 at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi jointly under aegis of Indian Army and Cll. 

During the course of the seminar, a round table interaction of various Directorates of Integrated Headquarters of MoD (Army) with industry reps was also held at the same venue. The seminar was attended by Senior Officers of the Army as well as from Ministry of Defence. The seminar had notable representation from Industry and Academia alike.

In order to make National Highways green, clean and pollution free, the National Highways Authority of India has planted 2.59 lakh plants in last one year. It has also been decided to institutionalize plantation as an integral part of highway development. A PMIS portal is also being developed for monitoring of the plantation progress.

Chairman, NHAI Shri Deepak Kumar has directed all Regional Officers to ensure plantation of at least 1 lakh plants during the current monsoon season. They have been advised to involve concessionaires, contractors, civil society, Forest Department and other stakeholders. The Green Highways Division of NHAI has circulated the list of suitable species to be planted in the monsoon season.

NHAI is committed to make national highways green, clean and pollution free. This plantation drive will continue as a regular activity during monsoons and even after that with watering and maintenance thereon.

Three hundred ninety seven National Highways, projects amounting to Rs. 1,29,704 Crore, and having length of 14974 km are ongoing in Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Delhi, connecting districts and major cities. 

There have been delays in some of these projects mainly due to problems in land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil or aggregates, poor performance of contractors, environment, forest or wildlife clearance, ROB & RUB issue with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. In this regard, regular meetings are held with project developers, State Governments and contractors in headquarter as well as in Regional Office. To expedite completion of these projects various steps are also taken which include streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances, exit for equity investors, premium re-schedulement, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent reviews at various levels etc.

                Shri Gadkari unveils logos of NHAI’s wayside amenities: 

Highways Village and Highways Nest 
 



The National Highways Authority of India has started the process of developing wayside amenities at land acquired at 183 locations along national highways.  The amenities will provide rest and refreshment for highway commuters during their journey.  There would be parking for cars, buses and trucks, restaurant/food court, dhaba, fuel station, minor repair shop, rest rooms for passengers, dormitories for drivers, kiosks for sale of miscellaneous sundry items etc at these sites. The facilities having an area more than 5 acres will be developed under the brand name “HIGHWAY VILLAGE” and facilities on smaller area less than 5 Acres will  be developed with brand name “ HIGHWAY NEST”

The Minister of Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari unveiled the logo for “HIGHWAY VILLAGE” and “ HIGHWAY NEST”in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion he informed that the ministry plans to develop a network of  amenities at every 50 km distance on the national highways. So more than 1000 such amenities would need to be developed across the country.

Shri Gadkari further informed that out of the 183 sites available with NHAI, bids have already been invited for 34 sites. The  due date of receipt of bids for these  sites is 21.08.2017 and 27.09.2017. He said  NHAI is also in the process of inviting bids for 30 more sites by the end of August 2017, and for the remaining   sites by end of September 2017.

NHAI has called for private participation on franchise basis. Private land owners/ persons having minimum land area of more than 1 hectare abutting the national highways can join hands with NHAI under the brand name “HIGHWAY NEST” to develop  wayside amenities as a franchise of the authority.  The persons will  develop the facilities as per standard layouts and designs of NHAI . For this NHAI has developed three-customizable proto-types of these facilities. These are  Type-1 - comprehensive facility for passengers and heavy vehicle drivers;  Type-2 -facility targeting passengers only and Type-3 facility targeting truck drivers only.

The private entity will   be assisted in getting free access permission to the facility, assistance in land use conversion etc. along with co-branding, logo and signage, and will be  required to sign a service level agreement with NHAI.

Shri Gadkari called on individuals owning land along national highways to come forward and participate in the endeavour.  The Minister said that these wayside amenities would not only benefit the highway commuters, but also the local population. The sites will promote local handloom and handicrafts by having shops selling these items. Local cuisine can be made available at the eateries in these sites. Green plantations at the sites can be developed with the help of the local people. About 20 lakh people will get direct and indirect employment from these sites. All in all, the development of these sites will bring economic development to the villages along the highways.

Also speaking on the occasion Chairman NHAI Shri Deepak Kumar said that expression of interest from persons having land parcel more than 1 Ha. abutting national highways  for development of wayside amenities is being invited by NHAI on 04.08.2017 onwards with due date of receipt of the bids on 21.09.2017 in the office of the respective Regional Offices of NHAI.  The document is being uploaded on NHAI website; www.nhai.org and e-tender portal; etenders.gov.in and the same can be downloaded by the interested applicants and may be submitted in the office of the concerned Regional Officer of NHAI of the concerned state by 20.09.2017.  However, any suggestions/ queries may be communicated by 30.08.2017 to the officials of NHAI . The pre-bid meeting with the interested applicants has been scheduled on 31.08.2017.

Secretary Road Transport and Highways Shri Y.S Malik said that the development of the wayside amenities would go a long way in making highway travel convenient for people. He said these wayside amenities will henceforth form an integral part of highways.

In a separate written reply, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya informed the House that at present, 1457 number of Highway development projects covering a length of 45,830 km with an estimated cost of Rs. 4,03,249 crores are under execution in the country. 

There are delays in some of the projects mainly due to problems in land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of Soil/Aggregates, Poor performance of contractors, Environment/ Forest/Wildlife Clearance, ROB & RUB issue with Railways, Public agitation for additional facilities, Arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. 

In this regard, regular meetings are held with project developers, state governments and contractors in Head Quarter as well as in Regional Office. To expedite completion of these projects various steps are also taken which include streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances, exit for equity investors, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent reviews at various levels .

                The Government of India has decided to launch a new sub-scheme named “Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY)” as part of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). The Self Help Groups under DAY-NRLM will operate road transport service in backward areas. This will help to provide safe, affordable and community monitored rural transport services to connect remote villages with key services and amenities (such as access to markets, education and health) for the overall economic development of backward rural areas. This will also provide an additional avenue of livelihood for SHGs. The basic outline of AGEY was discussed in a meeting of State Transport Ministers of 13 States held in June 2016 at Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh and all the Transport Ministers had expressed their appreciation of this initiative.

The Community Investment Fund (CIF) provided to Community Based Organization (CBOs) under DAY-NRLM will be utilized to support the SHG members in this new livelihoods initiative. The beneficiary SHG member will be provided an interest free loan by the CBO from its Community Investment Fund upto Rs.6.50 lakh for purchase of the vehicle. Alternative, CBO will own the vehicle and lease it to an SHG member to operate the vehicle and pay lease rental to the CBO

AGEY will be initially implemented in 250 Blocks in the country on pilot basis with each Block provided upto 6 vehicles to operate the transport services. During the current year implementation of the scheme has been so far approved for 52 Blocks in 8 States namely Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand and West Bengal with a total provision of Rs.16.06 Crore of which the Government of India share would be Rs.10.16 Crore. The balance funding would be provided by the respective States.

The Blocks will be selected by States from among the Blocks where NRLM is being implemented intensively and where mature CBOs are already functioning. Backwardness, lack of transportation links and sustainability of service would be the guiding factors in the selection of Blocks and routes.

The State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) will do a feasibility study and traffic survey in the selected blocks to identity the routes and the number and capacity of vehicles which can be operated on sustainable basis. The study will be conducted by technically sound organizations with expertise in transport network planning. The choice of vehicle could be either e-riksha, 3 wheeler or 4 wheeler within a cost ceiling of Rs.6.50 lakh.

The SRLMs will be co-ordinating with State Transport Department for issue of permit for the vehicle. The SHG member operating the vehicle shall ensure that all necessary legal and statutory requirement such as valid permit, road tax permit, valid insurance policy etc. are met.

The SHG member shall run the vehicle on approved routes at pre-determined frequency as jointly agreed between the CBO and the SHG operator based on financial viability and the need for transport link.

All vehicles under the scheme shall have a defined colour code and carry AGEY branding to ensure their identity and avoid diversion to other routes.

The State Rural Livelihood Mission will arrange capacity building for their staff at State, District and Block levels for operating the Scheme. The members of the CBO and the beneficiary SHG member shall also be provided adequate training in the Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) and other partner organizations.

Mahatma Gandhi NREGS has seen a significant demand for wage labour specially for water conservation works. About 106 Crore person days have been generated in Financial Year 2017-18 (so far) with 80 lakh to 1 crore persons working every day. Over 84% of the workers are paid within 15 days, a remarkable improvement compared to earlier years. 98% payments are through the electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS). The Central Government has ensured timely release of funds and States have responded by strengthening the implementation machinery to provide timely payments.

The thrust on agriculture and allied activities, is visible at the field level with more than 70% expenditure on these works. Under Mission Water Conservation, 2264 water stressed Blocks have received special attention for Natural Resource Management including water harvesting and water conservation. Nearly 30 lakh individual beneficiary schemes like support for housing, construction of IHHLs, construction of goat shed, poultry shed and dairy shed, land development, etc. have been completed since 2015-16. Solid and Liquid Resource Management works have been taken up on a very large scale.

Over the last 28 months, 30.69 Lakh water related schemes have been completed including 9.70 lakh farm ponds. With a focus on production of organic manure to support agriculture, about 5.5 lakh Vermi/ NADEP Compost units have been completed during this period. MGNREGS has created over 93 lakh hectares irrigation potential in the last 2 years which is currently being evaluated by the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), New Delhi. The Report will be public by 30 November 2017.  

1.71 crore assets of MGNREGS have been geo-tagged so far and are in the public domain. 5.5 crore workers are already on the Aadhaar-based Payment System (ABPS) and the Aadhaar numbers of 9.23 crore workers have been seeded so far in NREGASoft MIS. 90% Job Cards have been verified and 1.18 crore Job Cards have been deleted so far after proper verification. There has been a registration of 1.02 crore new Job Cards to ensure that deprived households get work.

Independent Social Audit Units have been set up in 24 States and 3100 State Resource Persons have been trained to conduct social audit as per auditing standards finalized in consultation with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Large scale training of Self-Help Group women as Village Resource Persons for social audit is being undertaken. 5,547 Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) have been trained so far in 19 States to provide technical support at field level. The Ministry is trying to impress upon the States, the need to go for more BFTs in order to strengthen the technical resource pool. 

The Ministry has updated the technical training modules with inclusion of Natural Resource Management perspective. 65000 technical persons supervising MGNREGS works across States/ UTs will be trained under cascading (training of trainers) model. The training has started and so far, 80 State Technical Resource Trainers have been trained.

There is an emphasis on information dissemination through various means including Citizen Information Boards at all worksites, wall writing at prominent places, mobile application, publications, etc. Record maintenance has been made easy and over 90% Gram Panchayats have already adopted the simplified 7 Registers. There is stress on standardization of case record/ Work file. A Public Information Campaign and a Janata Information System will be organized from 1-15 October 2017 at every Gram Panchayat level under the Gram Samriddhi and Swachchata Pakhwada.

The Minister of State for Rural Development Shri Ram Kripal Yadav today informed the Lok Sabha that according to the Socio Economic and Caste Census, 2011 (SECC, 2011), out of 17.97 crore rural households 5.40 crore households have been identified as landless deriving major part of their income from manual and casual labour. Replying to a written question on hoses being provided to rural poor, he said that Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G), restructured from erstwhile Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) w.e.f 1st April, 2016, aims at providing a pucca house with basic amenities to all in rural areas of the country. The beneficiaries under PMAY-G comprise all houseless households and households living in zero/ one or two kutcha wall and kutcha roof houses as per SECC, 2011 data, and as verified by the Gram Sabha. He said that the scheme is being implemented by the States/UTs as per the programme guideline/framework for Implementation. Some instances of irregularities in scheme implementation have been reported which are mainly related to misappropriation of funds, allotment of houses to ineligible persons, release of funds to some other person’s account, bribe seeking and non-release of instalments in time etc. 

The Minister said that with regard to the complaints received in the Ministry of Rural Development through CPGRAMS or otherwise, the same are forwarded to the respective State Government for their redressal and furnish the Action Taken Report to the Ministry under intimation to the complainant within one month of receipt of the complaint. States can also use the services of Ombudsman under MGNREGA to dispose of the grievances and reported incidents of irregularities under PMAY-G.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Israel on ""India-Israel Industrial R&D and Technological Innovation Fund (I4F)"". The MoU was concluded in July, 2017

India and Israel will make an contribution of four million US Dollars each for the Fund, both equivalent amount, annually for five years. The Innovation Fund will be governed by a joint Board which will consist of four members from each country.

The MoU envisages promotion of bilateral Industrial R&D and Innovation cooperation in the fields of science and technology by extending support to joint projects for innovative or technology-driven new or improved products, services or processes. Such projects will lead to affordable technological innovations in focus areas of mutual interest such as water, agriculture, energy and digital technologies. Institutional support in building up consortia including private industry, enterprises and R&D institutions from India and Israel will be enabled through these collaborative projects.

The activities supported by the Joint Fund would increase the techno-economic collaboration between the two countries by investing in jointly developed technology projects and collaborations based on technological innovation. It would leverage the complementary strengths of Israel and India to encourage Israel-Indian joint projects that capitalize on both the national and global marketplace. It would provide a comprehensive set of support tools to encourage joint projects that convert ""know-how"" into ""show-how"". It is expected that this will foster and strengthen the eco-system of innovation and techno-entrepreneurship in India and will contribute directly to the Start-up India programme.

Keeping in line with the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India for “the need for effective decision making in agriculture that integrates science, technology, innovation and the farm ecosystem by asking for an ‘Evergreen Revolution’ the need is to modernise all aspects of agriculture to this purpose by bringing to bear quality analysis of the ecosystem, well-thought decisions and an efficient use of cutting-edge science technology to the very complex Indian farm environment”, Department of Bio-Technology(DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, is holding a ‘Smart Agriculture Conclave’ on 30th  - 31stAugust, 2017.

 

The expected outcome of the Conclave is to provide a roadmap for setting up a cloud-service “FarmerZone” where the right kind of agri data is collated leading to maximum impact, vis-a-vis farmer needs and make this data useful for the farmer, ( data related to weather, disease and pest surveillance and control, soil, market etc ). The Department is collaborating with different stake holders: international, national and industry to set up a “FarmerZone”.

 

The ""FarmerZone” would be a multi-purpose window for solutions and will be available for farmers anywhere in the world. Solutions will provided at the farm, similar to that done by e-commerce companies at the doorstep. The farmer can access the service directly or through an intermediate structure such as local co-operatives. The FarmerZone will include a MarketZone where farmers can directly sell their produce which can be picked up by directly from the farm.

 

Partners:

 

International: Research Councils, United Kingdom and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)

 

Industry: Infosys, Microsoft Research and Jain Irrigations

 

NGOs : GODAN, Ekgaon, FARMER

 

Participants: Experts from UK, USA and India

 

 

Conclave will focus on small and marginal land-hold farmers who constitute a major component of Indian agriculture and challenges faced by them in context of soil, diseases, weather, impact of climate change and market supply chain.

 

Smart Agriculture conclave aims to underpin the challenges faced by farmers and discuss the possible cloud based solutions accessible to the remotest farmer to see as to:

 

 

How existing farm- related data can be accessed, collated, curated and translated into information useful for the farmer

Identification of technological gaps in data acquisition and transfer from farm to cloud and vice versa.

Creating an interface for the usage of advanced cyber-physical systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence, to collect- and analyse- data and create a service for the farmer, which will cater to the farmer’s needs and requirements (disease and pest surveillance, climate change: biotic and abiotic stress etc and advice thereof)

 

Data availability for algorithm development is the key and how best to use AI, cloud computing and drone/phone mapping etc for creating a viable, usable FarmerZone are all expected to be discussed at the two-day Conclave.

 

The Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences will attend the concluding session to review the outcomes of the Conclave.

Following is the text of statement regarding upcoming momentous programmes of the Ministry of Science & Technology, laid on the table by the Union Science & Technology Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan in Rajya Sabha today:

 

“I stand before the house to present about an upcoming momentous programme of the Ministry of Science and Technology and Earth Sciences: The India International Science Festival, popularly known as ‘IISF’, which is all set to enter its third edition in October 2017. This festival of science is organised by the Ministry in association with Vijnana Bharati (VIBHA). The First IISF was held at IIT Delhi and the second edition was held at CSIR – National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi. Both were successful events and my Ministry had succeeded in its objective of ‘Propagation of science to the general masses’.

 

Honourable Chairman Sir, The India International Science Festival is a serious attempt to inculcate scientific temper in the general public, particularly through the participation of the youth and children, to fast-track India’s march towards technological self-reliance and scientific advancement. This festival of science highlight the government flagship programmes such as “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan”, “Swasth Bharat Abhiyan”, “Make in India”, “Digital India”, “Smart Villages”  “Smart Cities” etc.

 

In the 1st edition, we achieved the ‘Guinness world record for the largest science practical session’ which is now inscribed in India’s name. IISF 2015 also provided a vibrant platform to young students, scientists and technocrats from across

India for exchange of scientific knowledge and ideas. 
 

In the second edition of the ‘Festival of Science’ in 2016, several events like the Young Scientists Conclave, DST – INSPIRE National Camp, Science Film Festival, NGO meet, Industry-Academia Interaction were held at National Physical Laboratory , Delhi. A footfall of over 5 lakh people were recorded at the IISF 2016 with active participation of over 10,000 delegates from R and D institutions and Science organisations. The Science and technology expo showcased the achievements of over 300 institutions belonging to R and D, academics, industries and PSUs.  Apart from this a very unique event for our budding citizens from rural India was the ‘Science Village’ programme, which required our Hon’ble Members of both the houses to send 5 students and 1 teacher from their respective adopted village under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna’. I had the wonderful experience of interacting with many students from the rural India who had come to the Science Village. In fact it was very highly appreciated by many of our Hon’ble members as it imparted very effective scientific knowledge to the over 1800 students from the rural countryside. In total, 131 Members participated eagerly in the science village programme. 

 

          Honourable Chairman Sir, last year we chose the theme as “Science for masses” and this year the theme is “Science for New India”! 

 

IISF 2017, this year, will be held at Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Anna University and IIT Madras in Chennai from 13th to 16th October, 2017 in a much grander level with a large participation of common masses. This year’s Science Festival like never before have several activities for the Hon’ble Members of this house scientists, policy makers, teachers, students, S&T Organizations, educational institutions, industry and the general public. Some of the activities are as below:

 


1.   Science & Technology Ministers of Neighbouring Countries Conclave 
2.   Special Thematic Session on ‘Deep Ocean Research’
3.   Sensitizing Youth to Flagship Programmes of Government (SYPOG)
4.  ‘Science Village’: Parliament to Panchayat
5.   National Meet on ‘Social Organizations and Institutions’

6.   Women Scientists and Entrepreneur’s Conclave
7.   National Science Teachers’ Workshop (focusing on North East States)
8.   Industry Academia Interaction
9.   Mega Science, Technology & Industry Expo
10. India International Science Film Festival 
11. Grassroots Innovators Summit
12.  National Start-up Summit
13.  Round Table Meet on ‘Mass Communication’
14.  Attempt of Student in Guinness Book of World Records
15.  National Level Competitions
16.  Outreach Programme (Open Days) in R & D Labs
17.  Satellite Seminars 
18.  Cultural Events

 

Through these events the festival will be highlighting government flagship programmes and missions and would reach out to over 5 lakh citizens directly. 

 

Honourable Chairman Sir, I am confident that the Science Festival would impart the ‘spirit of enquiry’ to the public masses which would in return benefit the nation through advanced scientific research. As I mentioned, this year also Science Village will be there and henceforth would urge all the honourable members to send the prescribed number of students from their adopted villages. An invitation letter to all the members have already been sent, to which I hope serious considerations will be made by all esteemed members of the house. 

 

Members may avail more information about the science festival from the website: www.scienceindiafest.org. “

                Plastic can be converted into petrol, diesel and other hydrocarbons. CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad has developed a catalyst that can be used for conversion of waste plastics to fuel oils. CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun in collaboration with GAIL (India) Ltd. has developed a process by which waste polyethylene and polypropylene type plastics can be converted into petrol and diesel. One kilogram of waste polyethylene and polypropylene can be converted to either about 600-650 ml of petrol or 700-750 ml of diesel along with LPG. The process has been developed at the bench scale.

There are certain plants operating in foreign countries which claim to convert waste plastics into plastic oil/fuel oil/diesel.

CSIR laboratories are involved in R&D of converting waste plastics into fuel oil by appropriate processes.

                Under the Government of India’s Sagarmala Programme to promote port-led development, a master plan has been formulated for the 12 Major Ports. 142 port capacity expansion projects with an estimated cost of  Rs. 91,434 Crore and capacity creation of 884 MMTPA have been identified in this master plan for implementation over the next 20 years.  Out of these, 58 projects with project cost  of approximately Rs. 28,767 Crore  have been approved.

In 2015, an international benchmarking consultant conducted a study of the Major Ports which recommended 116 initiatives to enhance their efficiency and productivity to international benchmarks and unlock their capacity. Of the 116 initiatives, 85 initiatives have already been implemented.

          

In order to strengthen the shipping and ports sector and make it internationally competitive, the Government of India has taken various steps which include the following :

(i)      Exemption of Customs and Excise Duty leviable on bunker fuels used in Indian flag vessels for transportation of mix of EXIM, domestic and empty containers between two or more ports in India.  

(ii)     Abatement of service tax of 70% for transportation of goods by Coastal shipping and Inland Waterways transportation.

(iii)    In April 13, 2016, the Ministry of Finance notified inclusion of stand-alone shipyards undertaking activities such as shipbuilding and ship-repair in the Harmonized List of Infrastructure sectors.

(iv)    To promote manufacture of sea-going vessels by Indian shipyards, Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy was approved for contracts signed during a ten year period, viz. 2016-2026.

(v)     Customs and Central Excise duty exemption on inputs used in manufacture of ships to provide a level playing field between indigenously built ships vis-à-vis imported ships.

(vi)    Shipping enterprises based in India have been permitted to acquire ships abroad and also flag them in the country of their convenience.  This policy initiative of “Indian Controlled Tonnage (ICT)” has facilitated Indian ship-owners to gain access to cheaper funds abroad and also save on costs of setting up subsidiaries abroad to acquire and maintain such tonnage.

The Shipping and Road Transport and Highways Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that the government is committed to creating the right environment for promoting cruise tourism in the country. Speaking at Dawn of Cruise Tourism in India - an international conference organized by the Shipping Ministry at Mumbai Port today, he said that India has a huge potential of hosting nearly 40 lakh cruise tourists. Given the right impetus, the number of tourist ships visiting India can go up from the present 158 to about 955 per year.

The Union Minister expressed confidence that the cruise tourism sector would be a game-changer for domestic as well as international travellers. The sector is estimated to have a revenue potential close to Rs. 35,000 crore, and is expected to create over 2,50,000 jobs .Shri Gadkari also released three reports - “Road Map for Sea Cruise Tourism”, “Mumbai Port SOP for Cruise Operations” and “Cruise Terminals in India” These are aimed at bringing uniformity in procedural formalities to revolutionize the cruise tourism in India.

Shri Gadkari informed that the Ministry of Shipping has already embarked upon reforms to boost cruise tourism . Absence of world class infrastructure and lack of defined procedures for various government departments/agencies for dealing with cruise vessels and tourists have been identified as major hurdles in the growth of cruise tourism. To address this, a task force comprising all relevant agencies like port, immigration, customs, port health authorities and security agencies was formed to study the present environment and procedures. A global consultant was hired to bring about a holistic approach and suggest the way forward.

The key items that the studies have identified for success of cruise tourism include creating and developing the right market atmosphere, easy immigration process , security procedures that do not impede movement, taxation regime that allows for a platform for growth, Customs & Duties procedures that do not tie the industry, internationally comparable tariffs, port and tourism infrastructure that meets the needs of the cruise lines and visitors today and tomorrow.

To achieve this the studies have recommended single window system for all pre cruise requirements for cruise operators to save time , separate dedicated approach road and entrance to the cruise terminals, uniform and consistent security procedures by CISF at all ports, coordination between immigration and CISF, training all departments dealing with cruise tourism with Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for better handling of passengers, use of technology in clearances, providing passenger manifest to CISF , implementation of green lane/red lane at existing terminals with random custom checking as is done in the airport, declaration of only limited items of inventory of the cruise ships in place of the existing requirement of having the complete inventory for all the stocks in the ship.

Various steps have already been taken for growth of cruise tourism. These include finalization of SoPs for handling cruise vessels and passengers, allowing foreign flag vessels carrying passengers to call at Indian ports without obtaining license from DG (Shipping), Constitution of Port-level Committees to address manpower, coordination and logistics issues . A discount of 40% is being given at Major Ports in Port charges. Additional rebate of 25% for home port cruise vessels in addition to 40% rebate for coastal cruise transportation. E-Visa facility and e- Landing card has been extended to five major ports. Uniformity in port charges for cruise vessels at all Major Ports- About Rs. 1,600 per person as against earlier practice of charging per tonnage of ship . The charges are now comparable to Singapore and other global ports for cruise tourism.

New infrastructure is being created at Mumbai at a cost of Rs. 300 crore. Tender has been awarded for civil construction of terminal building. There are plans to develop more port destinations other than the 5 ports of Mumbai, Goa, New Mangalore, Cochin and Chennai.

Mr. David Dingle, Chairman, Carnival, UK – the biggest cruise line in the world, which has started home port operations from Mumbai Port, presented the Carnival’s plans for India. Shri Ravi Kant, Secretary to GoI, Ministry of Shipping highlighted India’s development initiatives for Cruise Tourism. Smt. Rashmi Verma, Secretary to GoI, Ministry of Tourism spoke on the growth and future of India as an international tourism hub. Shri. J. Rawal, Minister of Tourism, Government of Maharashtra; Shri Arvind Sawant, Member of Parliament, Shri. Sumit Mullick, Chief Secretary to Government of Maharashtra and other senior officials were also present at the event.

The Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that the government is keen on developing Chabahar Port in Iran and is hopeful of starting operations by 2018. Shri Gadkari is in Teheran today, to represent India at the taking over of office by President Hassan Rouhani for the second term. On the eve of his visit to Iran the Minister said that India and Iran have shared special ties historically. 

Shri Gadkari informed that civil construction work has already started at the Chabahar Port .The Indian Government has allocated Rs 6 billion for the development of the port. Out of this, tenders worth Rs 380 Crore for equipment have already been finalized. He said he was hopeful that the Iran Government would accord certain necessary approvals for expediting the work. Shri Gadkari said the Chabahar Port will boost trade and business between the two countries and in the region.

                It is estimated that on an average a cruise tourist spends about US$200-300 and a cruise staff/officer spends about US$100-150 per port visit. Cruise tourism is a high-end luxury tourist segment of tourism sector.  Cruise operations augment local economic activities as business opportunities arise for supply for provisions, transport, hotels, bunkering etc. to cruise ships which generate direct and indirect employment.  The local economy also gains from the spending by cruise tourists during land excursions. 



 

(a)                   To boost cruise industry in the country, the following important actions have been taken:-

 

(i)        All major ports offer a minimum rebate of 30% across the board to cruise ships on all vessel related charges (port dues, pilotage and berth hire) from the notified scale of rates.

(ii)      Major ports do not levy any priority/ousting/shifting charges for berthing the cruise vessel, provided the liner informs port 30 days in advance about the requirement of the berth.

(iii)    To attract cruise liners to make major ports as homeports, the major ports provide rebate of 25% in vessel related charges for coastal cruise movement.  This is in addition to the 40% existing rebate for coastal vessels.  Further, walk-in berthing/preferential berthing is given to cruise vessels at home port without any extra charge.

(iv)    Foreign flag vessels carrying passengers had been allowed to call at Indian ports for a period of 10 years with effect from 6th February, 2009 without obtaining a license from Director General of Shipping.  This has been further extended for a period of five years i.e. upto 5th February, 2024.

(v)      For promoting cruise tourism, a Task Force has been constituted jointly by Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Tourism.  The Task Force is responsible for drawing up strategies for promotion of cruise tourism including development of facilities and related infrastructure as well as facilitation.

(vi)    Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) for handling cruise vessels and      passengers have been implemented.  

(vii)  To address manpower, coordination and logistic issues for handling cruise vessels at ports, Port Level Committees with chairman of the respective Major Port Trust as Chairman, Secretary Tourism of the concerned state as Vice-Chairman and Regional Director of the respective region of Ministry of Tourism as Convener have been constituted.

(viii)     Ministry of Tourism under its Scheme for Assistance to Central Agencies extends financial assistance to the Ports for development of cruise related tourism infrastructure.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been framed in June, 2016 for handling cruise vessels and passengers in the major ports.  These SOPs have been framed in consultation with the concerned stakeholders and contain simplified procedures to be observed by the multiple agencies involved in handling of cruise passengers and ship like Port authorities, customs, immigration, security(CISF), State government, ship agents, cruise lines, tour operators, Port Health Officers(PHO) etc.

 

The five major ports i.e. Mumbai Port, Mormugao Port, New Mangalore Port, Cochin Port and Chennai Port receive cruise ships as per the plan/programme of various cruise companies as a port of call.  During December 2016 to March 2017, cruise ship Costa Neoclassica made Mumbai port its home port for operating a cruise service from Mumbai-New Mangalore-Cochin-Male – Colombo-Goa-Mumbai for seven voyages.  Ferry services are run from Mumbai Port (Gateway of India) to Mandwa & Elephanta, and from Ferry Wharf to Mora, Revas & Karanja.

 

Cruise terminals have been constructed in Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin and Chennai Ports.  It is proposed to construct another cruise terminal facility in the Ernakulum wharf of Cochin Port to cater to the cruise passengers with modern amenities at an estimated cost of Rs.25.72 crores.  The Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned Rs.21.41 crores for this project.  Against this, the first instalment of Rs.10.33 crores has been approved out of which Rs.4.33 crores has been released by the Ministry of Tourism. The project consists of construction of an international cruise terminal building of approximate area of 2253 sq mts.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a proposal for setting up of a Commission under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issue of sub-categorization of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

 

The Commission shall submit its report within 12 weeks from the date of appointment of the Chairperson of the Commission. The Commission shall be known as the Commission to examine the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.

 

The proposed terms of references of the Commission are as follows:

 

(i)      To examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes/ communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list.

(ii)     To work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters, in a scientific approach, for sub-categorization within such OBCs, and,

(iii)    To take up the exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/ sub-castes/ synonyms in the Central List of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

 

The Supreme Court in its order dated 16.11.1992 in WP(C) No. 930/1990 (Indra Sawhney and others vs. Union of India) observed that there is no Constitutional or legal bar to a State categorizing backward classes as backward or more backward and had further observed that if a State chooses to do it (sub-categorization), it is not impermissible in law.

 

Nine States of the country viz., Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have already carried out sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.

                Scheduled Castes are specified under the provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution of India. Government has laid down Modalities for deciding claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the list of Scheduled Castes. As per the extant modalities only such proposals of the State Governments/ Union territory Administrations, which have been agreed to both by the Registrar General of India and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, are processed further for amending legislation as stipulated in clause (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution of India. The criteria for inclusion of a caste in the list of Scheduled Castes is extreme social, educational and economic backwardness arising out of traditional practice of untouchability. During the last three years and current year proposal of Are Katika, Katika caste has been received from the State of Telengana. No proposal has been received from the State of Andhra Pradesh in the aforesaid period.

                The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has constituted an Inter Ministerial Committee to pursue implementation of the Expert Committee's recommendations. So far, four Inter Ministerial Committee meetings have been held. 

The Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time provided three codes i.e. Male-1, Female –2 and others -3 for enumeration. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither '1' nor '2', then enumerator was instructed to record sex as 'other' and give code '3'. Still, it is important to note that the Census on India does not collect any data specifically on 'transgender'. Thus, the category of 'other' would not only include 'transgender' but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of 'other'. It is also possible that some transgenders would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of 'other' as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803. 

The Bill titled ""The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016"" was introduced by the Ministry in the Lok Sabha on 2.8.2016. The Bill was referred to the Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment for examination and report. The Committee has submitted its report on 21.07.2017. 

The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has informed that they are providing employment opportunities to 23 transgenders who work alongside the Kudumbashree women in customer service operations.

In order to remove the difficulty faced by persons belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), who have migrated from one State/ Union Territory (UT) to another, in obtaining caste certificate from the State/ UT to which they have migrated, it had been clarified to all State Governments and UT Administrations, vide Ministry of Home Affairs letters dated 18.11.1982 and 06.08.1984, that the prescribed authority of a State Government/ UT Administration may issue the SC/ ST certificate to a person who has migrated from another State/UT, on the production of a genuine certificate issued to his father/ mother by the prescribed authority of the State/ UT of the father’s/mother’s origin, except where the prescribed authority feels that detailed enquiry is necessary through the State of origin before issue of the certificate. The certificate will be issued irrespective of whether the caste in question is scheduled or not in relation to the State/UT to which the person has migrated.

For OBCs similar instructions were issued to States and UTs in Ministry of Welfare’s letter dated 08.04.1994.

                Union Minister of Statistics and Programme Implementation Shri D V Sadananda Gowda today visited the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS), Shillong and inspected the construction work which is going on at the Institute. He spoke in detail with the authorities, site engineers and officials of the construction company HSCC. Member of Parliament Smt Wansuk Syiem also accompanied the Minister to the institute. The Minister visited the construction site for Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Building, Hostel and Nursing College going on at NEIGRIHMS. The Minister was very categorical when he urged the officials and engineers that quality of construction should not be compromised at any cost. 

The minister also visited various departments of the hospital and interacted with the doctors and patients about the kind of service available at the hospital.

The Minister was intimated by the NEIGRIHMS’ officials of the poor road condition and lack of proper water supply scheme at the hospital. In this regard the Minister requested Smt Syiem to look into the matter for early settlement of the difficulty faced by the Institute.

                 Emphasising the need to strike at the root causes of gender bias in the country, Union Minister for Statistics & Programme Implementation, Shri D.V Sadananda Gowda, highlighted the importance of great movements to bring about behavioural changes in the society.    Delivering the inaugural address at the two-day national consultation on data generation for gender indicators of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in New Delhi today, the Minister said that though the nation has succeeded in fighting many social evils and made significant progress in many sectors, much more needs to be done to ensure that the benefits of development reach all corners of the country.  Shri Gowda also said that the Government is working to ensure that the fruits of development reach all sections of the people, particularly women amongst the disadvantaged sections of the society. 

 The Minister pointed out that India’s demographic dividend is unique, as the growth rate of the working population exceeds that of the total population. He added that this demographic dividend is expected to continue till 2040s.  Shri Gowda said that productive employment plays a key role in transmitting the benefits of economic growth into poverty reduction.   Underlining one of the concerns in the employment market – namely, low level and declining female labour force participation, the Minister said that strategies need to be evolved to address this issue. 

Highlighting some of the important initiatives recently taken by the Government for promoting gender equality and empowerment of women, the Minister referred to “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao”, Stand-up India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with a clean cooking fuel – LPG.  He also mentioned The Right to Education Act, The Minimum Wages Act, The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 that provides equal remuneration to men and women for equal work. Shri Gowda said that the recently enacted ‘Model Shop and Establishment Act’ allows night work by women, conditional to adequate safety and other working arrangement provisions”.

 Underlining the importance of Maternity Benefit Amendment Bill, 2016, passed by Parliament, the Minister said that the Bill increases the paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. “It also provides, for the first time, a 12 weeks paid maternity leave to a 'Commissioning mother' and 'Adopting mother'”, he added.

 The Consultation will provide a platform for the stakeholders to discuss the way forward to address the gaps in gender indicators for SDGs. The Consultation with experts will lead to evolving strategies and for strengthening data systems so that development can be measured and quantified from the Gender perspective. The multi-stakeholder consultation will also promote a common understanding and harmonized approach in generating data for gender indicators of SDGs. 

 Addressing the gathering, Chief Statistician of India and Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Dr.  T. C. A. Anant said that the implementation of SDGs is a much more dynamic exercise and will require a constant exchange between government’s policy-makers, statisticians and civil society.  Dr. Anant said that there is a need to constantly evaluate the progress being made – both in terms of policy and availability of relevant data.  Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Shri Rakesh Srivastava, and Director General (Social Statistics), Central Statistics Office, Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, Dr. Davendra Verma, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and Deputy Executive Director, UN Women, Ms. Lakshmi Puri, also addressed the gathering.

 The inaugural session of two-day Consultation, being held at India Habitat Centre, was well represented by officers/ experts from Central Ministries, State Governments and other national and international organizations.

Background: SDGs and Gender Indicators

India is a signatory to the “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” resolution (2030 Agenda) adopted by the United Nations in 2015. This 2030 Agenda consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 Targets. While Goal 5 is a standalone goal to “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, gender is mainstreamed throughout the agenda. A set of 232 unique Indicators has been globally agreed to, in consultation with the statistical offices and nodal agencies of the UN Member States, and the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), set up by the UN Statistical Commission.

To facilitate the implementation of the global indicator framework, all Indicators are classified by the IAEG-SDGs into three tiers on the basis of their level of methodological development, and the regular production of the data. Data is regularly produced by at least the half the countries for Tier 1 indicators; Tier 2 have an established methodology but data is not regularly produced; and Tier 3 are those indicators where established methodology and standards are not yet available.

Progress in India

For SDG5, the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has been identified as the nodal ministry. Various other ministries, such as Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD, Department of Land Resources), Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoUD), Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), among others have also been identified as playing important roles in achieving gender-related Targets.

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has been contextualizing the global indicator framework for India. The Ministry placed a Draft National Indicator Framework for SDGs in the public domain for wider consultation, which is expected to be finalised shortly.

The MoSPI and MWCD organized a National Workshop on Data Gaps in Gender Statistics, with support from UN Women and UNFPA, in 2015. Identifying the gaps in gender data through this workshop, it was recommended that - a gender analysis of existing Management Information Systems (MIS) of line Ministries needed to be undertaken in order to strengthen them for gender-responsive data. It was also recommended to undertake few new surveys on the themes, on which there continues to be a dearth of data, like, Asset Ownership and Control, Time Use Surveys, Violence Prevalence, etc.  Based on the recommendations of the National Workshop on Data Gaps in Gender Statistics, 2015, UN Women and UNFPA had developed a Framework and Roadmap for Collecting Statistics on the Status of Women in India.

National Consultation on Data Generation for Gender Indicators for Sustainable Development Goals, 2017

The formulation of a roadmap for data generation and data utilization of gender indicators especially for SDGs requires close collaboration between ministries of national and state governments, their statistical counterparts, as well as a wide range of partners. To explore actionable steps in this direction, MoSPI is organizing a two-day National Consultation on Data Generation for Gender Indicators of Sustainable Development Goals in collaboration with UN Women on 21-22 August, 2017 in New Delhi. The consultation will enhance ownership of data generation and data utilization, by providing a platform for the stakeholders to discuss the way forward on how to address the gaps in gender indicators for SDGs. Simultaneously, the multi-stakeholder consultation will promote a common understanding and harmonized approach to enhancing collaboration on gender statistics. While the overall purpose is to gather ideas for a roadmap of action on generating data for gender indicators for SDGs, more specific objectives of the consultation are given below.

Objectives of the National Consultation

1.      To apprise Central social sector ministries and state governments about the need for gender indicators and gender statistics for the Vision 2030 for SDGs

2.      To discuss the way forward with national and state government stakeholders to monitor the national gender indicators for the SDGs

3.      To facilitate collaborative learning and knowledge exchange by sharing the latest best practices on data collection or use or dissemination of gender indicators for SDGs

4.      To seek recommendations for facilitating user-producer dialogues to increase accessibility, quality and demand for gender statistics, through engagements of statistical offices with policy and decision makers

Format of the Consultation

While the National Consultation is being led by MoSPI, it is involving Central Ministries, officers from the State/UT Governments, namely from the Directorate of Economics & Statistics and Department concerned with women’s issues. Other relevant partners will also be brought into this consultation including representatives of the UN in India, research organizations and civil society.

                The United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted by the Government of India are as below:-

Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honor citizens' entitlement to public information.

Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data.

Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics.

Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics.

Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on Respondents.

Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.

Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public.

Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.

Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.

Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries

The principles have been serving as guidelines in developing good practices in the statistical system, prior to and after their adoption. Several strategies and protocols are being developed in the system, from time to time, to ensure professional independence, impartiality, accountability and transparency about methods of collection, compilation and dissemination of statistics, which are enshrined in the principles.

This information was given by Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation, Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

The position of funds released and utilized during 2016-17 and 2017-18 (up to 30.06.2017) under  the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) is as under:-

                                                                                                Rs. in crore

Year                              Released             Utilized           Unspent Balance

2016-17                        3499.50                 3903.13               5029.28

                                                                                             (as on 31.03.2017)

2017-18                        716.00                     691.55               5097.15

(up to 30.06.2017)                                                                  (as on 30.06.2017)

 

Note:  (i) The figures are based on the latest monthly progress reports received from the Nodal District Authorities.

(ii)  There is no incongruity in the figures since the funds are non-lapsable and unspent balances as well as interest are utilized in the subsequent year(s).

(iii) Unspent balance figures are net cumulative amount available with the Nodal Districts as on 31.03.2017 and as on 30.06.2017.

 

The funds under MPLADS are non-lapsable, both at the end of the Union Government and at the end of the District Authority i.e. the unspent balances of a particular year are utilized in the subsequent year (s). In view of the nature and dynamics of the scheme, the unutilized balances, which also include interest accrued, are bound to exist at any given point of time and utilization of MPLADS funds in the same financial year is not feasible.

 

            Implementation of the MPLADS in the field is undertaken by the District Authorities as per the State Government’s technical, administrative and financial rules.

 

The monitoring mechanisms, wherein the roles of the Central Government, State Governments, District Authorities and Implementing Agencies are laid down, have been duly prescribed in the Guidelines on MPLADS. The Guidelines are available in the public domain, including on the official website of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (www.mospi.nic.in).

 

For timely execution of works, time-lines for (i) sanction of eligible works, (ii) rejection of ineligible works and (iii) completion of sanctioned works are prescribed in the Guidelines on MPLADS.

 

Government through the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation continuously monitors and emphasizes on expeditious utilisation of MPLADS funds and where references regarding delay, etc. in the implementation of the works come to notice, the concerned State Government/District Authority are requested to take the appropriate action.

 

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation regularly reviews the implementation of the MPLADS through national-level review meetings with State Government/District officers and visits to States/Districts.

 

The Ministry continuously emphasizes on the qualitative, rule-bound and speedy implementation of the works under the Scheme.

                The Central Schemes concerning various Ministries are administered by the respective Ministry whereas MPLAD Scheme is being administered by Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Implementation of the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) in the field is undertaken by the District Authorities in accordance with the State Government’s technical, administrative and financial rules and as per the provisions of Guidelines on MPLADS.

For timely execution of works, time-lines for (i) sanction of eligible works, (ii) rejection of ineligible works and (iii) completion of sanctioned works are prescribed in the Guidelines on MPLADS.

Para 3.12 of the guidelines inter-alia provides that all recommended eligible works should be sanctioned within 75 days from the date of receipt of the recommendation, after completing all formalities. The District Authority shall, however, inform MPs regarding rejection, if any, within 45 days from the date of receipt of recommendations, with reasons thereof.

Para 3.13 of the guidelines stipulates that the sanction letter/order shall stipulate a time limit for completion of the work to the Implementation Agency. The time limit for completion of the works should generally not exceed one year.

The District Authority is required to review, every month and in any case at least once in every quarter, MPLADS works implementation with the Implementing Agencies. The District Authority should involve the MPs in the inspections of projects to the extent feasible.

The Ministry continuously emphasizes on the qualitative, rule-bound and speedy implementation of the works under the Scheme as per provisions of the Guidelines on MPLADS.

                The estimates of national income (measured as net national income) and per capita income (measured as per capita net national income) of the country during the last three years are as under:

 

Item (at current prices)                                     2014-15                 2015-16              2016-17

Net National Income (Rs. crore)                   10953761             12076882                13408211

Per Capita Net National Income (Rs.)            86454                    94130                      103219

           

           

Annual estimates of net state domestic product (NSDP) and per capita income (measured as per capita NSDP) are compiled by all the States/UTs except UTs of Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep. As per latest reports, data for the 33 States/UTs is available till the year 2014-15. The information is given in the statement at Annexure-I.

 The Government has been implementing several programmes for skill development, self-employment, wage employment and creation of assets that aim to promote inclusive growth and thereby bridge the income gaps.  These include Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA) and various rural development schemes of the Department of Rural Development (DRD), namely,  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Scheme  (MGNREGS), Pradhan  Mantri  Awaas  Yojana Gramin  (PMAYG),  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAYNRLM) and Deen  Dayal  Upadhyaya-Grameen  Kaushalya  Yojana  (DDU-GKY).

 

 The State/UT-wise details of per capita income for the year 1989-90 (before 1991 economic reforms) and for the year 1992-93 (after 1991 economic reforms) are given in the statement at Annexure-II. State/UT-wise per capita income for the year 2014-15 (latest available) is included in the statement given at Annexure-I.

 

Level of inequality is assessed in terms of Lorenz ratios of monthly per capita expenditure distribution using consumer expenditure data of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The NSSO 68th round report for the year 2011-12 noted that there was an increase in inequality (in terms of Lorenz ratio) from 0.297 to 0.307 for the rural sector and from 0.373 to 0.385 for the urban sector, when compared to the data of 61st round for the year 2004-05. Reasons for increase were not surveyed.

 

Comparison of inequality in terms of Lorenz ratios at State level based on NSSO 68th round (2011-12) data and 66th round (2009-10) data indicates that inequality in rural sector increased in all States/ UTs except for Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. During this period, in respect of the urban sector, inequality increased in Manipur, Mizoram, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Haryana and Kerala.

 This information was given by Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha.

                National Statistical Commission (NSC) constituted ‘Committee on Price Statistics’ under the Chairmanship of Dr. Sudipto Mundle in July 2010. The term of reference of the Committee interalia included Integration of data collection machinery. The Committee submitted report on 13th April 2011. The Committee noted that integration of data collection mechanism for all the price indices is desirable for rationalization and consistency of data flow; coordinated and timely revision of the price indices and optimum utilization of manpower for price data collection. Accordingly, the Committee made following recommendations:

(i) Price data collection for CPI-Rural and CPI-Agricultural Labourers /Rural Labourers should be integrated. Suitable technical proposals for adjustment of the data set and sample size should be prepared by the Technical Advisory Committee on Statistics of Prices and Cost of Living (TAC on SPCL).

(ii) The Committee feels that integration of price collection mechanism for all price indices should be accomplished by entrusting the task to a single agency, namely, Field Operation Division (FOD) of National sample Survey Office (NSSO).

(iii) Technical bottlenecks in integrating the datasets for CPI-Urban and CPI-Industrial Workers should be resolved by Prices Unit of National Accounts Division, Central Statistics Office (CSO) in consultation with Labour Bureau. Changes in price collection scheme including, inter alia, the number of markets, centres, items, brands/specifications etc. may be submitted to the TAC on SPCL for approval.

This information was given by Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha.

                An Australian delegation led by Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Australia Mr. Keith Pitt called on Union Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh at Udyog Bhawa today. The meeting was attended by Deputy High Commissioner to India Mr Chris Elstoft, Secretary, Steel Dr. Aruna Sharma and other senior officials from Australia and India.

Shri Birender Singh shared details of National Steel Policy 2017 and other initiatives being implemented by Indian Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He invited Austrlian Government and Businesses to be a part of the ambitious growth and development opportunities available in India. He stated that the New India provided ample scope for strengthening bilateral relations through investments, technology transfer and knowledge sharing. The Minister also highlighted areas of concern for India steel industry like wide fluctuations in prices of coking coal imported from Australia and disadvantage to Indian steel exporters due to concessional tariffs for other countries.

Mr. Keith Pitt remarked that Australia is also keen on widening the scope of relations from Natural Resources to technology sharing and knowledge exchange. Australian investors are excited to witness growth and potential of business in India, he added. Mr . Pitt said that Australia would be happy to help in sharing its expertise in extracting resources efficiently.

Both sides agreed to take the discussions further for working on areas of mutual interest and finding avenues for collaboration and cooperation.

                Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) Chairman, Shri P.K. Singh visited SAIL’s Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), on 18th August and interacted with a cross section of around 700 enthusiastic employees. Throwing light on the current scenario in the steel industry, Shri P. K. Singh said, “In the present circumstances, only the best in the class will survive. At a time of high overcapacities across the world, product differentiation is the requirement of the hour and we have to match the best in quality, variety and standards.” Shri Singh, exhorted the RSP collective that the transformation of SAIL has begun and “Let us all be part of it “. SAIL’s Director (Finance) Shri Anil Chaudhary, Director (Technical) Shri Raman and CEO, RSP Shri Ashwini Kumar were also part of the intensive interaction with the employees during the brainstorming session. Addressing the gathering, Chairman, SAIL, Shri PK Singh further said, “Rourkela has one of the best workforces in the industry where the ramping up after modernization was achieved in one of the shortest times. These interactions are aimed at enthusing the collective to exploit full potential of installed technologies and manpower. In the current challenging times, Company’s targets and priorities have to widely disseminate at all SAIL units.

SAIL’s Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), which boasts of a 4300 mm wide state-of-the-art New Plate Mill, has carved a name for itself as a unique producer of special grades of steels. This mill has the potential to capture demand from niche segments and be the desired choice for top consumers. Stepping decisively in the direction of ‘Make in India,’ the Plant has teamed up with the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) and the Indian Navy to develop special grade DMR-249A steel plates for Indian Naval requirements. Also, the plant will meet the indigenous requirements of various sectors including manufacturing, power etc. and the construction sector. SAIL RSP’s New Plate Mill along with Special Plate Plant have created unique facilities for making of special grades steels for defence applications thereby increasing the capacity of quenched, tempered plates with desired ballistic qualities. The plant also aims at catering to niche markets as well as to reduce the import burden on Nation. Plates with newer specifications (like API 5L X-70 PSL-2 grade), cost effective and quality plates for the construction sector produced using TMCP (Thermo Mechanically Controlled Process) are featuring in the new product basket of SAIL and import substituting products aimed for defence sector are already under development. Besides, the New Plate Mill is rolling boiler quality plates of a thickness of 140 mm in the grade IS 2002 GR-II, which is again an import substitution product.

Union Minister of State, Textiles, Shri Ajay Tamta said that the Government of India is taking various initiatives for the welfare of handloom weavers. Presiding over the main event of the 3rd National Handloom Day celebrations in Guwahati, the Minister said that he not only appreciates but also salutes the handloom weavers for their commitment, dedication and skill. He said that handloom weavers should be able to earn due value for their produce, and that Government is working in this direction. While enlisting various initiatives taken for welfare of weavers, the Minister spoke of Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata Scheme under which Government of India assists the weaver by bearing 90% of the cost of new looms. Shri Tamta also spoke of MUDRA scheme, under which loans ranging from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 10 lakh can be availed by the weavers, with no requirement for any security whatsoever. The Minister also informed the weavers that the Ministry of Textiles has entered into MoUs with Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) whereby children of weavers shall be able to avail school and university education, with 75% of fees being borne by the Government of India. Shri Tamta assured the Chief Minister of Assam that the Centre will do all that is required to support the state in advancing the welfare of weavers of Assam.

Addressing the audience, Chief Guest and Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal thanked the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, for choosing Guwahati as the venue for the main event of 3rd National Handloom Day. He noted that more than 50% of total weaver population of India resides in North Eastern Region, most of whom are women. He said that the prime objective of holding National Handloom Day in Guwahati is to empower women and girls. Shri Sonowal also spoke about the huge potential of Handloom sector in North East. The Textiles Secretary, Shri Anant Kumar Singh said that our weavers work very hard, putting their heart and soul into their creations. He said that we have to find out means through which the income of weavers can be increased and they are given deserving share of the immense worth of their produce.

An MoU was signed on the occasion, between Ministry of Textiles and Common Service Centres, under which weavers will be able to avail a wide array of Government services under one roof - from Weavers’ Service Centres (WSCs). The WSCs will henceforth serve as a one-stop centre for weavers, providing various services, including banking, passport, insurance, PAN card, voter ID and AADHAAR. Weavers will also be able to pay their electricity bills and undertake online courses at WSCs. There are 28 WSCs under the Office of Development Commissioner (Handlooms), Ministry of Textiles, functioning in various parts of the country. Weavers visit these WSCs frequently, in order to avail technical assistance in relation to their profession. Announcing this, the Union Textiles Minister, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani said yesterday that weavers will be able to derive the benefit of these services from WSCs, beginning this year itself.

Another MoU was signed on the occasion, between Ministry of Textiles and designers. Under the MoU, reputed textile designers will work closely with handloom weavers, passing on design assistance and knowledge. This is thereby expected to improve the market potential of the handloom products and improve the earnings of weavers.

The Minister also distributed some educational material to handloom weavers. Study material developed in collaboration with National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was also distributed to children of handloom weavers.

The National Handloom Day was celebrated across the country. The Union Textiles Minister addressed a gathering at Ahmedabad. Various programmes were held in universities, schools and other institutions as well.

Recalling the Prime Minister Shri
Narendra Modi’s words that the development of the North Eastern Region is
imperative for the development of India, the Minister informed the weavers that
the main event of third National Handloom Day will be held in Guwahati.



The Textiles Minister said that
the PM Jan Dhan Yojana has eliminated middlemen and enabled transfer of public
money directly to the bank account of deserving citizens. The Minister said
that around 25 crore citizens have got their bank accounts opened under PMJDY in last three
years. Noting that seven banks are participating in the camp for distribution
of loans today, Smt. Irani asked the woman weavers how often banks come to them
to provide banking services. The Minister expressed her satisfaction that more
than 250 women applied for MUDRA loans in just an hour after the camp started
functioning. She informed the 600-odd woman weavers present, that loans ranging
from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 10 lakh can be availed under MUDRA Yojana with no
requirement for any security whatsoever. She said that this demonstrates the
faith reposed by the Government of India in the ability of its citizens to
contribute to national development by becoming self-reliant. The Minister
highlighted that handloom weavers in Sambalpur, Odisha, were able to improve
their earnings by more than 60% within three months of availing MUDRA loan. Smt.
Irani distributed MUDRA loan sanction letters to 50 weavers on the occasion,
and appealed to all weavers to apply for the loan and improve their incomes.

Noting that loom repair and
upgradation is one reason why many weavers apply for loans, the Textiles
Minister informed the weavers that Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata Scheme addresses this issue. She
said that under this scheme, Government of India assists the weaver by bearing 90%
of the cost of new looms; on distributing the scheme certificates, the Minister
appealed more weavers to join the scheme so that they do not have to bear the heavy
financial burden of buying a new loom.

Speaking of other initiatives
taken by the Ministry for the welfare of handloom weavers, Smt. Irani spoke
about the E-Dhaga app and the ‘Bunkar Mitra’ helpline. She said
that with E-Dhaga, subsidy is just a click away for the weavers. She
said that the app, which enables handloom weavers to order and track the
shipping of yarn, will be a boon for handloom weavers. This would enable them
to transact business anytime, anywhere; weavers can send their indents and
payments online through this app.



The Minister added that on
January 4, 2017 the Ministry launched ‘Bunkar Mitra’, the first ever helpline
for handloom weavers. Available seven days a week, from 10 AM to 6 PM, the
issues faced by weavers are addressed in a time-bound manner through the
helpline. She asked every weaver present to note down the helpline number 1800-208-9988
and to use it extensively for their benefit. 







Stating that education of
children is the primary concern of weavers, the Minister informed the weavers that
the Ministry of Textiles has entered into MoUs with Indira Gandhi National Open
University (IGNOU) and National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) whereby children
of weavers shall be able to avail school and university education, with 75% of
fees being borne by the Government of India.



The Minister requested the
weavers to participate in these schemes of the Government and reap their
benefits, for a better future for them and their families. She also reminded
them that while many other countries earned their freedom through the sword, India
achieved independence through the weapon of non-violence, of which ‘Charkha’
and 'Suta' (thread) were defining symbols.



Besides the big gathering of
600-odd woman weavers, Handloom Minister of Assam, Shri Ranjit Dutta; MLA Shri Pranab Kalita; Development Commissioner (Handlooms), Ministry of Textiles, Shri Shantmanu were
also present on the occasion.



The third National Handloom Day
will be celebrated across the country tomorrow, the main event being in
Guwahati. 



Background



The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the first National Handloom Day on 7th August, 2015, at a national level function in Chennai. The date August 7 has been
chosen due to its special significance in India`s history; it was on this day
that the Swadeshi Movement was launched in 1905. The formal proclamation of
Swadeshi Movement was made on August 7, 1905 in a massive meeting in the
Calcutta Town hall. The movement involved revival of domestic products and
production processes. The Government of India has declared August 7 as National
Handloom Day every year, in memory of this.

Government is also implementing PowerTex India, a comprehensive scheme for Powerloom Sector Development. 

Further, Government is implementing social welfare schemes for weavers/ workers, such as Matatma Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana for Handloom weavers, the Group Insurance Scheme for Powerloom workers, the Aam Admi Bima Yojana for handicrafts artisans and scholarship for children of jute workers. Government of India had introduced the Textile Workers Rehabilitation Fund Scheme (TWRFS) to provide relief to workers rendered jobless due to permanent closure of Non-SSI Textile Mills in private sector. The TWRFS has now been merged with Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojana (RGSKY) which provides an unemployment allowance for the employees covered under ESI Scheme, who are rendered unemployed involuntarily due to retrenchment/closure of factory, etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crore to boost employment generation and exports, particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.

                To create awareness about Beekeeping and uses of its products including Honey, Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED) is celebrating World Honey Bee Day (WHBD) on 19.08.2017 in the Country and on 18.08.2017 at all its Regional Offices and 43 Retails Outlets spread in the country. In Delhi, this would be celebrated in TRIBES India Showrooms at Dilli Haat, Mahadev Road and Baba Karak Singh Marg on 18.08.2017. The main theme of celebrating WHBD is to save Indian honey bee.

Beekeeping has been useful in pollination of crops, thereby, increasing income of the farmers/beekeepers by way of increasing crop yield and providing honey and other beehive products, viz. royal jelly, bee pollen, propolis, bees wax, etc. that serves a source of livelihood for rural poor. Therefore, honeybees/ beekeeping has been recognised as one of the important inputs for sustainable development of agriculture/ horticulture.

TRIFED is an apex organisation at National Level and functioning under the administrative control of Ministry of Tribal Affairs. TRIFED is serving the interests of Tribals, who are engaged in collection of NTFP and making of Tribal Art & Handicraft Products for their livelihood so as to ensure better remunerative price for their products as well as for the socio-economic betterment through Self Help Groups, Empanelled NGOs, State level Tribal Development Corporations, Forest Development Corporations for undertaking marketing development of the tribal products.

Honey, being an important Minor Forest Produce, TRIFED is playing and lead role in protecting, promoting and multiplication of Honey Bees by Scientific, Non-destructive collection practices, thereby increasing the livelihood of tribal people living in various forest areas of the country, contributing to the growth of Honey Bees population and reducing the mortality rate of Honey Bees drastically. About 90% of the Scheduled Tribes of the country live in and around forest areas and the forests provide 60% of the food & medicinal needs of tribals and 40% of their income from Minor Forest Produce (MFP) mostly of which come from Honey.

                While the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for notification of a community as Scheduled Tribe under Article 342 of Constitution of India, the responsibility for issuance and verification of Scheduled Tribe certificates rests with the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Thus, complaints received about fake Scheduled Tribe certificates are referred to the concerned State Government / UT Administration for appropriate action.

As informed by the Department of Personnel and Training, the extant instructions provide that if it is found that a Government servant had furnished false information or produced a false certificate in order to secure appointment, he should not be retained in service. Thus when an appointing authority comes to know that an employee had submitted a false / fake caste certificate, it has to initiate action to remove or dismiss such an employee from service as per the provisions of relevant Service Rules.

The Government has also requested all the States/Union Territories from time to time to streamline the process for verification of claims of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and to issue instructions to District Magistrates / District Collectors / Deputy Commissioners to ensure at their own level the veracity of caste certificates so that unscrupulous non-SC/ST/OBC persons are prevented from securing jobs meant for SCs/STs/OBCs by producing false certificates.

Further, in order to discourage unscrupulous activities, State Governments / Union Territories have also been requested to consider issue of appropriate instructions for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the errant officers who default in timely verification of caste certificates or who issue false certificates.

This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswantsinh Bhabhor in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.

                The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on August 31, 2017 was 86.629 BCM which is 55% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 51 for the week ending on August 24, 2017. The level of August 31, 2017 was 84% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 84% of storage of average of last ten years.  

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 157.799 BCM which is about 62% of the total storage capacity of 253.388 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

 

REGION WISE STORAGE STATUS:-

NORTHERN REGION

The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are 6 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.01 BCM.

                With the purpose of increasing awareness about dam safety measures in the country and finalisation of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) a stakeholders consultation Workshop was organised by Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department in collaboration with Central Water Commission was held recently at Krishnagiri dam site, district Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu. Over 150 delegates representing the stakeholders involved with relief and rescue operations and representatives from National Disaster Management Authority, State Disaster Management Authority, India Meteorological Department, State Health, Fire, Police, Revenue and Road Departments and Railways participated in the Workshop.

Shri NK Mathur, Member, Central Water Commission presided over the Workshop and highlighted the need for the preparation of EAP for each dam and involvement of all agencies in ensuring effective relief and rescue operations. The brief backgrounds of few of the national as well as international dam disasters were also discussed, along with step by step process for evolving a sound and bankable EAP document.

India ranks third globally with 5254 large dams in operation and 447 large dams under construction. About 4% of these large dams (209) are over 100 years old and about 17% (876 dams) are more than 50 years old. Many of these dams are facing varying degrees of inadequacies in meeting the current standards of dam health and safety due to various reasons. The ongoing Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation is facilitating the rehabilitation of about 198 large dam projects in seven States, in addition to the institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies for sustainable dam safety initiatives.

Even though our dams are quite safe, in the rare event of a dam failure, extensive damage to property, environment and sometimes loss of life occurs. Managing the exigencies caused by a failure of a dam requires coordinated efforts of all national and States agencies. The preparation of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for all DRIP dams is one of the important activities under DRIP. This document defines clear roles for all concern agencies as well as Standard Operating Protocols during various stage of exigencies, as well as contains all technical details about the flood waves moving downstream affecting the downstream habitation.

                In the first-of-its-kind success, the creation and maintenance of sewage treatment infrastructure under Hybrid Annuity based PPP model has taken off, with NMCG awarding work to private sector for construction and maintenance of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in two major cities in Ganga river basin - Varanasi and Haridwar. While the work to construct, operate and maintain a 50 MLD STP in Varanasi has been awarded to a consortium led by Indian infrastructure major - Essel Infra Projects Limited at an estimated cost of Rs 153.16 crore, HNB Engineers Private Ltd. has been awarded the work to develop, operate and maintain the total sewage treatment capacity of 82 MLD (68MLD in Jagjeetpur + 14MLD in Sarai) STPs in Haridwar at an estimated cost of Rs 171.53 crore. The awarded projects would ensure that no untreated sewage waste water goes into river Ganga.

Since the inception of Hybrid Annuity-PPP model, many national and international players have shown interest in NMCG projects. The consultative meetings and conferences with market players attracted large number of participants. More than 30 firms showed-up for pre-bid meetings of Varanasi and Haridwar projects. The selection of firms was based on lowest bid project cost for developing and operating the treatment infrastructure for a period of 15 years.

The Government of India had accorded Cabinet approval to Hybrid Annuity-PPP model in January 2016 with 100% central sector funding. Under this model, the development, operation and maintenance of the sewage treatment STPs will be undertaken by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to be created by the winning bidder at the local level. As per this model, 40% of the Capital cost quoted would be paid on completion of construction while the remaining 60% of the cost will be paid over the life of the project as annuities along with operation and maintenance cost (O&M) expenses.

One of the most important features of this model is that both the Annuity and O&M payments are linked to the performance of the STP. This will ensure continued performance of the assets created due to better accountability, ownership and optimal performance. Hybrid Annuity based PPP model has been adopted for the first time in the country in sewage management sector. Such a model has earlier been adopted successfully in highway sector only.

                Rainfall Forecast issued by India Meteorological Department indicate that Heavy to Very Heavy rainfall with extremely heavy fall are very likely to occur in  East Rajasthan (next 48 hrs), West Madhya Pradesh (next 48 hrs), Gujarat, Konkan & Goa (next 72 hrs), Coastal and Ghat areas of South Interior Karnataka (next 48 hrs).      Due to this rainfall, the rivers Mahi, Sabarmati, Banas, Godavari and its tributaries, Krishna & its tributaries, West flowing rivers south of Tapi, Cauvery and its tributaries are likely to rise and create low to moderate flood in few locations.

            The likely impact of these rains as inferred from rainfall runoff model run for 3 days advisory forecast is likely rapid Rise in water levels of rivers as stated above and detailed as under:   

Mahi Basin: River Mahi and its tributaries are likely to observe rise in water levels in districts of Jhabua and Dhar in Madhya Pradesh, Dungarpur, Banswara in Rajasthan, Panchmahal, Mahisagar and Vadodara districts of Gujarat. The inflows into Mahi Bajaj Sagar, Som Kamla Amba Dam, Dhariawad, Jakham, Kadana Dam and Wanakbori weir are likely to rise. Present Storage of Mahi Bajajsagar, Som Kamla Amba dam and Kadana Dam are almost more than 90% full and releases if any due to this heavy rainfall warnings have to be done taking into account the downstream conditions and with prior information to all downstream states and districts.

 

Sabarmati Basin: River Sabarmati and its tributaries in districts of Udaipur, Sirohi, Pali and Dungarpur in Rajasthan Sabarkanta, Mehsana, Ahmadabad Gandhinagar and Kheda districts of Gujarat are likely to observe rapid rise in water levels. Dharoi dam in Mehsana district of Gujarat is having storage of 90% of its capacity as on 28th August 2017. Hence release if any may be done judiciously taking into account rainfall conditions in the downstream reaches.

 

Banas Basin: River Banas and its tributaries are likely to rise rapidly in the districts of Udaipur, Sirohi districts of Rajasthan and in Banaskanta district of Gujarat. Dantiwada dam on river Banas and Sipu Dam in Banaskanta district of Gujarat is having storage of 94% and 86% respectively as on 29th August 2017. Hence release if any may be done judiciously taking into account rainfall conditions in the downstream reaches.

 

There is likelihood of heavy rain in Kutch areas of Gujarat and in Morvi, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar districts of Saurashtra and Kutch also. Since most of the dams in these areas such as Machchhu-I and II, Und etc are very near their full levels. Very strict vigil may please be maintained for the safety of the structure as well as downstream areas in association with the rainfall likely to occur during the next 3 days.

 

Narmada and Tapi Basin: In view of the likely rainfall river levels of Narmada and Tapi are likely to rise in districts of Hoshangabad, Khargone, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Narmada and Bharuch districts of Gujarat in Narmada. River Tapi is likely to rise in Betul district in Madhya Pradesh, Jalgaon district in Maharashtra, Tapi and Surat districts in Gujarat. However, the rivers may not cross the Danger Level in any of its reaches. The storage at Hathnur Dam is around 66% and at Ukai Dam is around 45% as on 29th August 2017 and hence the rainfall may increase the storage in these reservoirs.

 

Damanganga Basin: Due to the expected rainfall, River Damanganga and its tributaries is expected to rise in Nasik district of Maharashtra, Valsad district of Gujarat and Daman district in Daman and Diu Union Territory. The storage at Madhuban Dam in Valsad District is around 67% as on 29th August 2017 and hence the rainfall may increase the storage in the reservoir.

 

Godavari Basin: River Godavari is likely to rise in Upstream reaches in district of Nasik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad district as well as in Parbhani and Nanded districts of Maharashtra. Due to rain in South Chhattisgarh, river Indravathi is flowing in Moderate Flood Situation at Jagdalpur in Bastar district and is likely to rise in Dantewada, Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh. Very near to low flood situation is likely in Nizamabad, Jayashankar and Bhadradri Kothagudem district of Telangana and in East and West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.

 

Krishna Basin: River Krishna and its tributaries are likely to rise in upstream districts of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Sholapur districts as well as in Bagalkote, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi district on Krishna and in Chikmagaluru, Shivamogga and Ballari districts on river Tungabhadra in Karnataka.

 

West Flowing Rivers: Rivers flowing West into Arabian Sea south of Tapi in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka are also likely to rise and inundate areas in Raigad, Thane, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra and in Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. Traffic along the old road and rail bridges along these river reaches have to be strictly regulated.

 

Urban Flooding in Mumbai: Due to very heavy rains and the likelihood of continuing of rain in and around Mumbai, there is likelihood of severe inundation in urban areas of Mumbai City. Necessary precautions to be taken especially in lakes surrounding the city and the releases if any have to be regulated taking into account the downstream conditions.

 

Cauvery Basin: River Cauvery and its tributaries in upstream reaches in Kodagu Chikmagaluru Hassan and Mysuru districts of Karnataka and Wynad district of Kerala are likely to rise in association with the forecasted rainfall. However, as the dams in the basins are having sufficient storage there may not be any immediate threat of high floods in downstream reaches. Dams around Nilgiri and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu on river Bhavani and Moyar are also likely to get sufficient inflows during the next two days. However as there is sufficient storage available there may not be any immediate threat of floods.

 

As the rainfall belt is likely to shift to foot hills of Himalayas from 1st September 2017 onwards except for isolated heavy rainfall warning in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on 1st and 2nd September 2017, there will be general improvement in situation from 1st September onwards in all these basins.

Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Uma Bharti took a high level meeting to review the flood situation in the country and the actions being taken at the national level in New Delhi today. The officers briefed her about the flood situation in various parts of the country and the pro-active actions taken by the concerned organisations under the Ministry in mitigating the effect of floods.

 

            The Minister was briefed that Central Water Commission (CWC) had taken pro-active steps during the floods by way of issuing around 3200 flood forecasts to all concerned user agencies which have been extremely beneficial to the district administration in timely evacuation and saving of lives of millions of people. Further, Ministry has issued seven specific district-wise advisories on anticipated floods and dam-wise advisories for water release wherever applicable to facilitate early NDRF/SDRF deployment and operation of reservoir gates. Another significant step taken by the Ministry, since June 2017 is that three day advance flood advisories based on rainfall-runoff model have been made available for all the 19 river basins online, for the benefit of all stakeholders.

 

            The Minister directed that all the concerned organizations under the Ministry shall extend all possible help to the flood affected people. She directed that CWC, GFCC and Brahmaputra Board, in consultation with the related Central Ministries and State Governments, shall undertake an exercise to identify and map reaches vulnerable to erosion and landslide along the banks of the rivers and suggest possible remedial measures

 

            Sushri Bharti emphasized that long-term solution to mitigate  flood and droughts lies in  the  interlinking of rivers along with building of large storages. She said Ministry has obtained all clearances for Ken-Betwa Link Project in MP and UP. The Minister was pleased to state that Uttar Pradesh Government has conveyed its support to Ken Betwa river interlinking project and the response of  Madhya Pradesh Government is expected to be received soon. The Government of India is eager to implement this first river interlinking project for the benefit of the people of Bundhelkhand region.

 

            The DPR of Damanganga-Pinjal link and Par-Tapi-Narmada interlinking projects are in  advanced stage. Further, the Kosi –Mechi link and Kosi-Ghagra link envisaged in the Himalayan region would greatly attenuate high flood intensity in the Ganga Basin.

 

            The Minister said Government of India is having continuous dialogue with the Government of Nepal at various levels to mitigate devastation caused by the flood from the rivers coming from Nepal through planning of various storage dams jointly viz. Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada; Sapta Kosi High dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum- Diversion scheme are proposed in the Sapta Kosi Basin. In Brahmaputra Basin, a Committee of the Ministry has assessed storage requirements of 9.2 BCM in Siang, 0.6 BCM in Dibang, 1.61 BCM in Lohit and 1.91 BCM in Subansiri sub Basins. A proposal for construction of single-stage Siang Upper Multipurpose Storage is under active consideration of the Ministry.

 

        The Minster will visit Uttar Pradesh on 21st August and Bihar on 25th August for discussions on flood related issues with the State Governments. She is also planning to visit Uttarakhand in connection with India-Nepal Pancheshwar Multipurpose project. Meanwhile,Dr. Amarjit Singh,Secretary, MoWR, RD & GR  is already on a visit to  Assam for the survey of flood affected areas.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) of upto Rs. 9020 crore as per the requirement during 2017-18 by NABARD through issuance of Bonds for ensuring lending rate of 6% per annum (pa) in respect of borrowings for implementation of Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) works of 99 ongoing prioritized irrigation projects along with their command area development (CAD) works under PMKSY. 

A large number of major and medium irrigation projects taken up under Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) were languishing mainly due to inadequate provision of funds. During 2016-17, 99 ongoing projects under PMKSY- AIBP were identified for completion in phases by December-2019. To cater to the large fund requirement and ensure completion of these projects, the Union Finance Minister, during his Budget speech 2016-17, announced creation of dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) in NABARD with an initial corpus of Rs. 20,000 crore for funding of Central and State share for the identified ongoing projects under PMKSY (AIBP and CAD). 

To make the loan from NABARD attractive for states, it was decided that the rate of interest may be kept around 6% by providing requisite cost free funds to NABARD every year during 2016-17 to 2019-20 on which interest cost would be borne by Govt. of India.

During the year 2016-17, NABARD disbursed aggregate amount of Rs. 9086.02 crore under LTIF, out of which Rs. 2414.16 crore was released for Polavaram project (without EBR component) and balance Rs. 6671.86 crore was released to identified projects using EBR. Further, an amount of Rs. 924.9 crore was disbursed as Central Assistance (CA) through budgetary provision. During 2016-17, overall an amount of Rs 2187 crore was raised by NABARD in the form of Government of India fully serviced bond as EBR. 

During 2017-18, it is estimated that an amount of Rs 29,000 Crore may be required through LTIF, for which EBR of Rs 9020 cr would be required. 

As per the status reported by the states and Central Water Commission during various review meeting, 18 projects have been completed/almost completed. Irrigation potential utilization is expected to be more than 14 lakh hectares during 2016-17 from all the 99 projects. During 2017-18, 33 more projects are likely to be completed. The completion of the identified irrigation projects will generate immediate wage and other employment opportunities in good measure during the construction phase. More importantly, on completion of the projects, the utilization of irrigation potential of about 76 lakh hectares will transform the agriculture scenario of the region resulting in generation of substantially more employment opportunities through increase in cropping intensity, change in cropping pattern, agro processing and other ancillary activities.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval to the proposal to complete the balance works of the North Koel Reservoir Project in Jharkhand and Bihar at an estimated expenditure of Rs.1622.27 crore to be incurred during three financial years from the start of the project. 

The Cabinet also approved storage of water in dam restricted at lower level than envisaged earlier to reduce the submergence and to protect Betla National Park and Palamau Tiger Reserve.

 

The project is situated on North Koel river which is a tributary of Sone river finally joining the river Ganga.  The North Koel Reservoir is located in the most backward tribal areas in Palamau and Garhwa districts of Jharkhand State. The construction was originally started in the year 1972 and continued till 1993 when it was stopped by the Forest Department, Govt. of Bihar. Since then, the work on dam is at a standstill. The major components of project are: 67.86 m high and 343.33 m long concrete dam called Mandal dam originally intended to  store 1160 million cubic metre (MCM) water; 819.6 m long barrage at Mohammadganj, 96 km downstream of the dam; and two canals originating from left and right banks of Mohammadganj Barrage with distributaries system for irrigation. With the new lowered elevation level (EL) of 341 metre, the Mandal dam will now have storage of 190 MCM.  The project aims to provide irrigation to 111,521 hectares of land annually in the most backward and drought prone areas of Palamu & Garhwa districts in Jharkhand and Aurangabad & Gaya districts in Bihar. The unfinished project as on date is providing irrigation to 71,720 hectares and completion of this project will provide additional irrigation benefit to the extent of 39,801 hectares. The irrigation potential through this Project in the two States would be as follows:

 

Total irrigation potential:                               1,11, 521 hectares

Irrigation potential in Bihar:                           91,917 hectares

Irrigation potential in Jharkhand:                   19,604 hectares

 

The total cost of the project as assessed on date is Rs 2391.36 crore.  An expenditure amounting to Rs. 769.09 crore has been incurred on the project till date. The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal for completing the balance of the North-Koel reservoir project in Jharkhand & Bihar at an estimated cost of Rs 1622.27 crore during three financial years. 

 

 The common components amounting to Rs.1013.11 crore of balance works would be funded by the Central Government as a grant from PMKSY Fund.  This would include cost of Net Present Value (NPV) and Compensatory Afforestation (CA) which comes to Rs.607 crore and Rs.43 crore respectively.  The Central Government will also fund 60% of the cost of balance works amounting to Rs.365.5 crore (Bihar Rs.318.64 crore and Jharkhand Rs.46.86 crore) from Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) under PMKSY as grant from the States of Bihar and Jharkhand.  The States of Bihar and Jharkhand will arrange 40% of remaining cost of balance works amounting to Rs.243.66 crore (Bihar 212.43 crore and Jharkhand 31.23 crore) as loan from LTIF through NABARD at the rate which is not subsidised and is related to market borrowing cost with no interest subvention. 

 

The Cabinet also approved execution of balance works of the project on turnkey basis by M/S WAPCOS Ltd., a CPSU under MoWR, RD & GR as Project Management Consultant (PMC).  The execution of the project will be monitored by an Empowered Committee of Government of India headed by CEO NITI Aayog.

                The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation, now Ministry of Water Resources, RD & GR for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. The pre-feasibility report of the all 30 links have been prepared and circulated to the concerned State Governments by the NWDA. After survey and investigations, Feasibility Reports of 14 links under Peninsular Component and Feasibility Reports of 2 links and draft Feasibility Reports of 7 links (Indian portion) under Himalayan Component have been completed.

Four priority links under Peninsular Rivers Component have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) viz; Ken-Betwa Link, Phase –I & II, Damanganga-Pinjal Link, Par-Tapi-Narmada link and Mahanadi-Godavari link. The preparation of DPR of a project is taken up only after consent of concerned State Governments. Based on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of Ken-Betwa link project Phase-I & Phase-II, Damanganga-Pinjal link and Par-Tapi-Narmada link have been completed. The techno-economic clearance and various statutory clearances of the Ken-Betwa link project Phase-I have been accorded. The techno-economic clearance of the Damanganga-Pinjal link project has also been accorded subject to statutory clearances. The DPR of Par-Tapi-Narmada link is under technical appraisal in the Central Water Commission.

The implementation of Inter linking of Rivers (ILR) projects involves various steps such as preparation of Pre-feasibility Reports(PFRs) /Feasibility Reports (FRs) of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, agreement with neighboring countries if link involves area lying in those countries, preparation of DPRs of the projects, clearance from appraisal agencies which includes clearance by Ministry of Environment & Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood Control & Multipurpose Projects of MoWR, RD & GR, investment clearance and the construction time required for the completion of the project as per the DPR.

The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained. Thus the implementation of the projects will take varying periods of time.

No State except Kerala is opposing the Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) Programme. Further Kerala Government is opposing only Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar link which concerns the State.

Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) programme has been taken up on high priority. The Government is pursuing the ILR program in a consultative manner.

As directed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its judgment dated 27.02.2012 in the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 512 of 2002 on ‘Networking of Rivers’ alongwith Writ Petition No. 668 of 2002 a committee called “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” vide Gazette Notification dated 23rd September, 2014 has been constituted.

The Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers chaired by Hon’ble Union Minister (WR, RD & GR) as per the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court is expediting the progress and effective implementation in the ILR projects. Thirteen meetings of the Special Committee for ILR have been held so far and the last meeting was held on July 27, 2017 at New Delhi. Views and observations on the ILR programme have been received from various State Govts, experts and other stakeholders in the meetings of the Special Committee for Interlinking of Rivers (ILR). The Special Committee would consider all such observations appropriately while planning and formulating the ILR projects.

The Committee, after considering the views of all the stakeholders, is proceeding ahead to expedite the objectives of the interlinking of rivers as per terms of reference. Vigorous efforts have been taken up for generating consensus with development of alternative plans and also setting out road maps for implementation of mature projects.

                Divisional Flood Control Rooms (DFCRs) at regional level for monitoring flood situation and issuing forecasts have been set up by Central Water Commission (CWC) which work on 24x7 basis during 1st May/ June to 31st October/ December every year. Central Flood Control Room (CFCR) has been set up at CWC HQ in New Delhi which works on 24x7 basis during 1st May to 31st December every year. CFCR monitors the flood situation at national level and also facilitates to generate three days flood advisory.

The remote sensing data (Rainfall, Topography, Land-use/ Land-cover etc.) and Geographical Information System are being used in mathematical modeling for flood forecasting under flood management activity of CWC.Generation of Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) currently used at 146 river-basins of India for assessing the flood inundation scenario by CWC is at par with the global standards.

The said technology is being used for Indus and its tributaries, Ganga & its tributaries, Brahmaputra & its tributaries, Barak system, Subarnarekha, Brahmani & Baitarani, Narmada, Tapi, Mahi, Sabarmati, Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, West flowing rivers Kutch, Saurashtra and Tapi to Tadri, Cauvery and its tributaries, Pennar and East flowing rivers Mahanadi to Pennar and Pennar to Kanyakumari. In order to meet specific requirements of flood forecasting, which is provided by Central Water Commission, India Meteorological Department (IMD) operates Flood Meteorological Offices (FMOs) at thirteen locations viz., Agra, Ahmedabad, Asansol, Bhubaneshwar, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jalpaiguri, Lucknow, New Delhi, Patna, Srinagar, Bangaluru and Chennai. Apart from this, IMD also supports Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) by providing Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) for Damodar river basin areas for their flood forecasting activities. During the flood season, FMOs provide valuable meteorological support to CWC for issuing flood warnings in respect of the 43 rivers of India covering 146 river-basins. CWC is working in close association with IMD and State Governments for timely flood forecast whenever the river water level rises above warning level.

In recent years, IMD has been able to correctly predict several extreme weather and climate events like heavy rainfall etc. which causes floods.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has continued its efforts for the improvement of observing, warning and dissemination systems more vigorously in recent years. The improved services rendered in respect of very short (up to 6 hours), short (up to 3-days in advance), medium (up to 7-10 days in advance), extended (up to 15-days in advance), long (monthly and seasonal) range and severe weather (cyclone, thunderstorms, extreme rainfall) forecasts have been built to meet the demands of the user agencies, disaster managers, emergency response groups and other stakeholders in an organized manner.

                On the complaint made by the State Governments, the Central Government has, so far, set up 08 tribunals to settle water disputes among the States under the Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956.

Government of Bihar sent a request on 27.11.2013 under provision of ISRWD Act, 1956 to this Ministry for constitution of a Tribunal for adjudication of river water disputes related to Sone basin. Negotiations were carried out by the Chairman, Ganga Flood Control Commission and Chairman, Central Water Commission with the States of U.P. and Bihar. It has been agreed that the two States of U.P. and Bihar would meet periodically and try to solve the issue bilaterally. The dispute has since been settled.

State of Odisha has also filed complaint dated 19.11.2017 under Section 3 of ISRWD Act, 1956 with respect to Mahanadi basin. The Central Government constituted a Negotiation Committee comprising members from basin States and concerned Ministries of Central Government, Central Water Commission, India Metrological Department, National Institute of Hydrology for settlement of the dispute through negotiation. The Negotiation Committee held two meetings on 28.02.2017 and 22.05.2017 and submitted its report in which it mentioned that that any further meetings of this Committee would not be fruitful as there had been no participation from complainant State i.e. State of Odisha in both the meetings. Accordingly, the Ministry concluded that the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation and it has been decided to constitute a Tribunal for adjudication of the dispute. Draft Cabinet Note in this regard has been prepared.

The mechanism for settlement of water disputes is already available in the form of ISRWD Act, 1956. The ISRWD Act, 1956 was last amended in 2002 whereby adjudication of the water disputes by tribunals has been made time bound. Further, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation adopted a revised National Water Policy (NWP) in 2012. As per Clause 12.2 of the Policy, a permanent Water Disputes Tribunal at the Centre should be established to resolve the disputes expeditiously in an equitable manner. In this regard, a Bill has been introduced in Lok Sabha on 14.03.2017 to amend the existing ISRWD Act, 1956. The Bill has further been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources by the Hon'ble Speaker vide order dated 14.03.2017 for examination. In this regard, three meetings of the Committee have been held on 16.06.2017, 30.06.2017 and 10.07.2017.

No high level committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of former Planning Commission Member dealing with the subject of Inter-State River Water Sharing Disputes. However, a committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. Mihir Shah, former member, erstwhile Planning Commission to deal with the subject of restructuring of CWC and CGWB. The Committee has submitted its report in July, 2016.

                Central Water Commission (CWC) under Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) carries out techno-economic appraisal of major and medium irrigation projects (Command Area more than 2000 hectare) which are planned on Inter-State river / river basins. 15 projects of Chhattisgarh have been approved and accepted by Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of MoWR, RD & GR.

As per the complaint of Odisha dated 19.11.2016 under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Dispute (ISRWD) Act, 1956, the utilization of water to the extent of 33.89 BCM by Chhattisgarh is for the purposes of existing, ongoing and future irrigation, industrial use and domestic projects of Chhattisgarh. In its complaint dated 19.11.2016 submitted to the Central Government under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act, 1956, the Government of Odisha raised the issues like quantum of minimum flow in Hirakud dam, surplus flow and shares of States in minimum and surplus flows.

The Central Government in accordance with Sec 4(1) of ISRWD Act, 1956 set up a Negotiation Committee on 19.01.2017, which comprised of members from basin States and concerned Ministries of Central Government, Central Water Commission, India Meteorological Department and National Institute of Hydrology for finding a negotiated settlement of the water dispute. The Committee submitted its report to MoWR, RD & GR on 27.6.2017.

In accordance with the provisions of the ISRWD Act, 1956, the Central Government is required to refer the matter to a Tribunal for adjudication within a year from the date of receipt of reference if it is of the opinion that the water dispute cannot be settled by negotiations. Therefore, issues raised in the complaint dated 19.11.2016 of State of Odisha are subject to the outcome of the adjudication process.

Govt. of Odisha has also filed Original Suit No.1/2017 in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Govt. of Odisha prayed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for restraining Govt. of Chhattisgarh from continuing construction and operation of six industrial Barrages and taking up any project from the category of future project. Govt. of Odisha also prayed for constitution of Tribunal for resolution of Mahanadi water dispute. The case was last heard on 25.07.2017 and is pending. Hence, the matter is subjudice in the Court.

                A Committee constituted by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Revejunation on 28.12.2015 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Mihir Shah suggested a draft National Water Framework Bill, 2016 which inter-alia, contains provisions for an overarching national legal framework with principles for protection, conservation, regulation and management of water as a vital and stressed natural resource.

The draft Bill was circulated to all the States/Union Territories and the concerned Central Ministries for obtaining their comments. The nine States Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have furnished their comments on this draft Bill.

Fixing a tentative date for achieving consensus is subject to concurrence/support of the State Governments/UTs. However, Secretary of this Ministry vide D.O. letter dated 20.01.2017, has communicated the benefits of National Water Framework Law (NWFL) to the Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs and requested them to support the Bill. The Minister (WR, RD & GR) vide her letter written on 14th & 21st March, 2017, has also requested Chief Ministers of all States/UTs to pass suitable resolutions in their State Assemblies in support of the draft National Water Framework Bill, 2016.

                The National Water Policy (2012) formulated by Ministry of Water Resources, RD & GR, inter-alia, advocates conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures. The National Water Policy (2012) has been forwarded to all State/UTs and concerned Central Government Ministries/ Departments for adoption.

 

Further, Government of India has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for its regulation and development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting.  So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model bill. Also, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under “The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA has so far notified 162 areas in the Country for the purpose of regulation of ground water. CGWA has also issued advisories to States and UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water / rain water harvesting.  So far, 30 States/UTs have made rain water harvesting mandatory by enacting laws or by formulating rules & regulations or by including provisions in their building bye-laws or through suitable Government Orders. 

 

Other steps taken by the Central Government to control depletion of ground water resources are available at the following URL http://mowr.gov.in/writereaddata/GW_Depletion.pdf.

 

As per CGWA guidelines, any user withdrawing groundwater for industrial/ infrastructure / mining project has to obtain ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’.  Any withdrawal of ground water without valid NOC from CGWA is liable to have penal action under Section 15 of ‘The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’, under which imprisonment for a term which may extend upto five years or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both with provisions for additional fine of Rs.5,000/- per day for continued failure or contravention.

         

Central Ground Water Board conducts and facilitates research in ground water domain by taking up research projects at its Training and Research Institute.

 

Central Government is also encouraging R&D studies to ensure safe ground water.  CGWB under Indian National Committee on Ground Water (INCGW) R&D programme is sponsoring Research Project for groundwater.  Under the R&D scheme of MoWR, RD&GR, budget is allocated for sponsoring research in water resource sector that includes groundwater component and funds are allocated through INCGW.

                The flood forecasting activities of CWC makes use of manual as well as telemetry data. Automatic data acquisition and satellite based data transmission system (telemetry) installation was taken up by CWC during IX Plan under modernization of its flood forecasting services. 510 telemetry stations have been commissioned so far in various plans. 82-83% of the telemetry stations remained functional during 2015-2016. The reasons for breakdown may be technological, natural & man-made. CWC is making all out efforts in restoring the non functional telemetry stations.

The subject of flood management being under purview of the States, the schemes for flood control are formulated and implemented by concerned States as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. A total of 141 works of Assam were included under Flood Management Programme (FMP) with an estimated cost of Rs. 2383.11 crore and an amount of Rs. 813.75 crore was released during XI & XII Plan, which includes Rs.748.86 crore released during XI Plan. The funds are released by MoWR, RD&GR based on the availability of funds and eligible proposals as per XII Plan guidelines.

Preparation of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is the responsibility of respective Dam Authority & concerned State Government. National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS) has time and again reminded State Governments/ Dam owners to prepare EAP. Under World Bank aided Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), CWC provides technical support to the participating States in preparation of EAP.

Flood management measures are broadly classified as Engineering / Structural Measures and Administrative / Non-structural Measures.

Flood forecasting is the most cost-effective non-structural measure of flood management carried out by CWC on State rivers covering 22 States/Union Territories & National Capital Territory of Delhi through a network of 221 forecasting stations. Flood forecasting & Early Warning system based on hydro-meteorological data of rivers flowing from Nepal to India is in place. CWC has started making advisory flood forecasts which provides advance forecast for a period upto 72 hours (3 days).

The High Resolution Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs) of Mahanadi and Sabri sub-basin for carrying out Flood Inundation Modelling has been procured by CWC from National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) recently for initiating inundation forecasting.

The inflow forecasts into the reservoir issued by CWC are utilized by the project authorities in proper operation of reservoirs in order to mitigate flood impact in the downstream areas. The States are normally under compulsion to store water for non-monsoon period and generally do not resort to timely pre-depletion of reservoirs even when required the most. Hence, operation of a set of reservoirs through a unified command is being emphasized.

The Government of India has launched the Flood Management Programme (FMP) for providing central assistance to States for works related to river management, anti-erosion, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion etc. Under this programme, a total of 522 projects have been approved under FMP in XI and XII Plan, out of which 297 projects have been completed till date. These completed projects have provided reasonable protection against floods in 19.593 lakh hectare area and benefited 197.23 lakh people in the country.

                The rivers flowing from Nepal to India are causing floods in India, mainly in the States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The major rivers causing such floods are Sarada, Ghaghra, Gandak, Kosi and Rapti.

The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR) (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India is having continuous dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. Broad outcomes of the dialogues mechanism are given below:

i) Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been set up jointly by India and Nepal for execution, operation and maintenance of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada. The draft final DPR of the project has been prepared by M/s WAPCOS Limited.

ii) Survey and investigation including preparation of DPR of Sapta Kosi High Dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion scheme proposed in the Sapta Kosi basin in Nepal has been undertaken jointly by India and Nepal.

Government of India has withdrawn a cumulative amount of US $ 91.26 million (Rs. 550.48 crore) under this loan till date.

Cleaning of river is a continuous process. Namami Gange Programme has been launched as a holistic approach covering all existing ongoing projects and new initiative. Under Namami Gange project total number of 173 projects for various activities such as sewage infrastructure, river front development, ghat and crematoria, ghat cleaning, river surface cleaning, afforestation and biodiversity conservation and rural sanitation etc. have been sanctioned. Out of 173 projects 41 numbers of projects have been completed so far.

This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Balyan in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.

                The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in its order dated 19th October, 2016 in OA No.200 of 2014 in the matter of M.C. Mehta vs Union of India had directed a joint inspection team to visit the area falling in Segment ‘B’ of Phase-I (Haridwar to Kanpur) and identify the number of drains joining river Ganga or its tributaries and make observations in relation to quantum and quality of effluent that is going to river Ganga or its main tributaries through drains.

The joint inspection team submitted its report to the Hon’ble NGT. 86 major drains have been identified which are directly discharging into River Ganga (30 drains) and its major tributaries namely Ramganga (25 drains), Kali-East (26 drains) and Pandu river (5 drains). Of the 86 drains, 52 drains were found to be carrying domestic sewage, 2 were found to be carrying industrial effluent whereas remaining 32 were found to be carrying mixed effluent.

Namami Gange Programme has been launched as a holistic approach to clean Ganga through various activities such as treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial affluents, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation and biodiversity etc. For checking entry of sewage affluents into river Ganga, sewage infrastructure projects are being sanctioned in towns along the main stem of river Ganga, which includes creation of Sewage Treatment Plants, sewage network projects and interception & diversion network to divert the flow of polluting drain towards treatment plants. To check industrial pollution, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has inventorised 1109 Gross Polluting Industries (GPIs). These GPIs are being inspected and monitored regularly and closure directions are being issued to non-compliant industries.

National Mission for Clean Ganga has approved ten projects in Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to the tune of about Rs 2,033 crore. Eight of the ten projects pertain to sewage infrastructure and treatment, one to river front development and one to Ganga Knowledge Centre. These projects were approved in the 5th meeting of the Executive Committee of National Mission for Clean Ganga. 

In Bihar, three major sewage infrastructure projects with total estimated cost of Rs 1461 crore in Barh, Kankarbagh and Digha have been approved. These projects will create additional sewage treatment capacity of 161 MLD (100 MLD in Digha, 50 MLD in Kankarbagh and 11 MLD in Barh). In Kankarbagh and Digha sewerage zones of Patna, presently there is no STP. It may be recalled that under Namami Gange programme creation of 200 MLD sewage treatment capacities has already been sanctioned in remaining four sewerage zones in Patna – Beur, Saidpur, Karmalichak and Pahari. 

In West Bengal, three projects at an estimated cost of Rs 495.47 crore have been approved. Out  of these two pertain to sewage infrastructure while the third one is for river front development. Pollution abatement and rehabilitation works for river Ganga in Howrah and Tolly’s Nullah (popularly known as Adi Ganga), a tributary of Ganga in Kolkata have been approved with total estimated cost of Rs 492.34 crore. These two projects will create additional sewage treatment capacity of 91 MLD in Kolkata. A detailed project report (DPR) for renovation of Boral ferry and Boral bathing ghats in Nabadwip town of West Bengal has also been approved at an estimated cost of Rs 3.13 crore which would include river bank protection work, construction of waiting rooms, stairs, seating arrangements etc.    

In Uttar Pradesh, sewage infrastructure work in Chunar, district Mirzapur, has also been approved at an estimated cost of Rs 27.98 crore under which an STP of 2 MLD capacity will be created apart from interception and diversion of drains. 

It is also noteworthy that the projects in Kankarbagh and Digha in Bihar and Howrah and Kolkata in West Bengal will be taken up under Hybrid Annuity based PPP model in which 60 per cent of capital cost will be paid to the contractor  over a period of 15 years on the basis of his work performance on the achievement of desired norms of treated waste water.  

A project to establish Ganga Monitoring Centres in five riparian Ganga states has also been approved at an estimated cost of Rs 46.69 crore. The objectives of establishing GMCs are efficient monitoring of wholesomeness of river including pollution levels, flow levels, point and non-point sources of pollution, periodic reporting of monitored parameters to NMCG/SPMG/District Ganga Committee, remedial actions by NMCG on its basis, collation of data sets etc. 

Besides, two pilot demonstrative projects of treatment of drains using bioremediation method were approved. The drains which will be treated with this technology are Danapur drain in Patna and Nehru drain in Allahabad at a total estimated cost of Rs 1.63 crore. All projects will be funded 100 per cent by the Central Government.

Total no of 163 projects have been sanctioned under Namami Gange programme at a cost of Rs. 12892.33 crore for various activities such as sewage infrastructure, river front development, Ghat and crematoria, Ghat cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation biodiversity conservation etc. Efforts are being made to complete Short term and Medium term projects by 2020.

  Assessment of sewage load through major drains discharging into main stem of river Ganga and its major tributaries is carried out under Pollution Inventorisation, Assessment and Surveillance of river Ganga project undertaken by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) under Namami Gange Programme. As per CPCB data of 2016-17, 10705 MLD of flow (which includes sewer as well as non-sewer/natural flow) was estimated from 211 drains outfalling in river Ganga and its tributaries namely Ramganga, Kali (East) and Pandu. As per condition assessment and feasibility study carried out by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), sewage generation from the 108 towns located on the main stem of river Ganga was estimated to be 3078 MLD.

 

            As per the CPCB 2016-17 data, 1109 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) have been identified on the main stem of River Ganga and major Tributaries. Surprise inspection of these GPIs is done on regular basis for compliance verification as per the industry discharge standards and action is taken against the defaulting industries as per the provisions contained in Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

                           Cleaning of river is a continuous process. The Government has launched Namami Gange Programme covering short term, medium term and long term activities. Under Short term activities certain entry level activities which covers development of Ghat crematoria and river surface cleaning activities etc have been taken up.

Under Medium term activities existing sewage treatment plant and Effluent treatment Plant are being upgraded and new Sewage Treatment Plants, (STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) are being established. Beside, rural sanitation has been taken up in the villages on the banks of river Ganga. The long term action plan involves restoration of wholesomeness of river Ganga, and maintaining the ecological and geological integrity of river.

Short term and Medium term projects are likely to be completed by 2020.  Under Namami Gange Programme total 163 projects for various activities such as sewage infrastructure, river front development, ghat and crematoria, ghat cleaning, rural sanitation etc. have been sanctioned. Out of 163 projects 41 numbers of projects have been completed so far.

 Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) has sanctioned two loans for Japanese Yen 11.184 billion for Varanasi Project under Ganga Action Plan-II and Japanese Yen 32.571 billion for Sewage Projects in Delhi under Yamuna Action Plan-III.

           World Bank has sanctioned a loan of US $ 1 billion for funding Institutional Development and for construction of priority infrastructure projects for municipal waste water treatment and solid waste treatment on the main stem of Ganga in the five Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Government of India has withdrawn a cumulative amount of US $ 91.26 million (Rs. 550.48 crore) under this loan till date. 

 Upper surface of river is being cleaned by deploying Trash skimmer. At present 11 trash skimmers have been deployed in city of Kolkata, Nabadwip, Patna, Sahibganj, Delhi, Allahabad, Haridwar, Varanasi, Garhmukteshawar, Kanpur, and Mathura -Vrindawan  under Namami Gange Programme. To prevent the discharge from municipal towns falling into the river, sewage infrastructure projects are being taken up. Discharge of effluents from industrial units are being monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). Actions are being taken by CPCB and SPCBs against non-compliant industries under the provision of Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

                On the complaint made by the State Governments, the Central Government has, so far, set up eight tribunals to settle water disputes among the States under the Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956.

Government of Bihar sent a request on November 27, 2013 under provision of ISRWD Act, 1956 to this Ministry for constitution of a Tribunal for adjudication of river water disputes related to Sone basin. Negotiations were carried out by Chairman, Ganga Flood Control Commission and Chairman, Central Water Commission with the States of U.P. and Bihar. It has been agreed that the two States of U.P. and Bihar would meet periodically and try to solve the issue bilaterally. The dispute has since been settled.

State of Odisha has also filed complaint dated November 19, 2017 under Section 3 of ISRWD Act, 1956 with respect to Mahanadi basin. The Central Government constituted a Negotiation Committee comprising members from basin States and concerned Ministries of Central Government, Central Water Commission, India Metrological Department, National Institute of Hydrology for settlement of the dispute through negotiation. The Negotiation Committee held two meetings on February 28, 2017 and May 22, 2017 and submitted its report in which it mentioned that any further meetings of this Committee would not be fruitful as there had been no participation from complainant State i.e. State of Odisha in both the meetings. Accordingly, the Ministry concluded that the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation and it has been decided to constitute a Tribunal for adjudication of the dispute. Draft Cabinet Note in this regard has been prepared.

The mechanism for settlement of water disputes is already available in the form of ISRWD Act, 1956. The ISRWD Act, 1956 has been last amended in 2002 whereby adjudication of the water disputes by tribunals has been made time bound after consultation with all State Governments. Further, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation adopted a revised National Water Policy (NWP) in 2012. As per Clause 12.2 of the Policy, a permanent Water Disputes Tribunal at the Centre should be established to resolve the disputes expeditiously in an equitable manner. In this regard, the Inter-State River Water Dispute (Amendment) Bill, 2017 has been introduced in Lok Sabha on March 14, 2017 to amend the existing ISRWD Act, 1956. The Bill has further been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources by the Speaker vide order dated March 14, 2017 for examination. In this regard, three meetings of the Standing Committee have been held on June 16, 2017, June 30, 2017 and July 10, 2017.

                   The NGT during the course of hearing in O.A. No. 200/2014 (M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India & Ors.) have made certain adverse observations on efficacy of various schemes and programmes undertaken for cleaning of river Ganga.

 The government has intensified its efforts for pollution abatement of river Ganga. Cleaning of river Ganga is being carried out through various activities including treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluent, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation and bio-diversity etc. The municipal sewage being generated in cities on banks of Ganga is being managed by a mix of Interception and Diversion projects, sewerage network and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) projects. As per condition assessment and feasibility study carried out by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), 3078 Million Litres Per Day (MLD) of sewage is generated by the towns situated on the main stem of river Ganga. As of today, sewage treatment capacity available is 1315 Mld. National Mission for Clean Ganga has already approved projects for creation of additional 1075 Mld and these projects are at various stages of implementation.

 The year-wise quantum of amount allocated and spent for Namami Gange Mission from Financial year 2014-15 to 2017-18 till 30th June, 2017 is tabulated below:

                Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Bharti has said that a joint working group of officials from Indian and Israel should be set up soon to explore the areas of cooperation between both the countries in water resources management. The Minister expressed these views when the Israeli Ambassador to India Mr. Daniel Carmon called on her in New Delhi today. Sushri Bharti said Israel is a pioneer in the field of water management and India can learn a lot from them. She also suggested that use of treated water, PMKSY and mutual cooperation in the field of R&D and training of personnel could be some other areas of cooperation.

The Israeli Ambassador said that a pilot project of waste water treatment can be taken up on Ganga at Varanasi. He also invited the Minister to visit Israel.

It may be recalled that an MoU was signed between India and Israel in November 2016 to strengthen cooperation at the national, regional and international levels in the field of Water Resources Management and Development by collaborating and sharing experience and expertise in the areas mutually agreed upon, including techniques in the efficient use of water resources recycling/re-use of waste water, desalination, aquifer recharge and in-situ water conservation techniques, and water resource management

                The National Nutrition Week will be observed throughout the country from 1st to 7th September. The theme of the National Nutrition Week for 2017 is ""Optimal Infant & Young Child Feeding Practices: Better Child Health"". The basic objective of this annual event is to intensify awareness generation on the importance of nutrition for health which has an impact on development, productivity, economic growth and ultimately National development.

The Food and Nutrition Board of Ministry of Women & Child Development, through its 43 Community Food and Nutrition Extension Units (CFNEUs) located in 30 States/UTs, will coordinate with concerned Department of the State/UT Governments, National Institutions, NGOs and organize State/UT Level Workshops, Orientation Training of Fields Functionaries, Awareness Generation Camps, Community meetings during the week on the specified theme.

Large numbers of State, district and village level activities are being organized during this week. One day workshops will be held to sensitize and for capacity building of State/Districts Level officers on importance of nutrition for better health. There will be lecture cum demonstration on low cost nutritious recipes for grassroots level functionaries like school teachers, anganwadi workers and helpers, village women and mahila samitis. Mini exhibition on nutrition displaying low cost nutritious diets for different age groups will also be organized at grassroots level. Awareness generation on weight management and its importance through Body Mass Index will be held for adolescent boys and girls. Besides there will be large number of activities like quiz competition on nutrition and competition on preparation of nutritious recipes. Awareness programmes will be held at village level through puppet shows, skits, dance & dramma, films, slide shows, AV Spots, nutrition rallies etc.

Nutrition is an issue of survival, health and development for current and succeeding generations. Child born underweight have impaired immune function and increased risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases in their later life. Malnourished children tend to have lower IQ and impaired cognitive ability, thus affecting their school performance and then productivity in their later life. It has to be realized that the nutritional health and all age groups represent say National Economic Asset.

As, improving the nutritional status of the population is imperative for National Development. Under nutrition in young children continues to be a major public health problem in India. The NFHS4 has not shown an encouraging improvement in the nutritional status, especially among women and children. As per NFHS-4 the level of underweight has decreased by 6.8% and is stunting by 9.6%. Level of anaemia has decreased by 11% as compared to NNHS-3 figures.

Malnutrition is not to be viewed merely as an offshoot of poverty having adverse effects on health and development of individuals but as a national problem that results in loss of productivity and economic backwardness. Time has come to create a moment so as to improve nutrition at the individual level. Thus, series of convergent and well coordinated actions in different sectors are required to be undertaken in the mission mode approach to address this big network problem of malnutrition

                The Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi gave away National Level Awards to anganwadi workers to recognize their exemplary voluntary service in the field of child development and related areas under the ICDS Scheme, at New Delhi today. The Awards for the year 2016-17 were given to 51 awardees today. These awards are given annually.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi congratulated the awardees and urged them to keep up their dedication to the cause of child development, community mobilization and awareness generation while delivering the ICDS Services. The functionaries anganwadi workers and anganwadi helpers play a pivotal role in child development since the responsibility of taking care of small children has been given to these frontline workers across the country under the ICDS, the Minister explained.

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that till now, the role of anganwadi workers revolved around mainly distribution and provision of food to children and lactating mothers. However, the Government is now shifting the emphasis to covert anganwadis into centres of pre-school education. As a result, a massive exercise is being launched to train the anganwadi workers to become pre-school teachers, the WCD Minister disclosed. There are currently about 27 lakhs anganwadi workers and helpers at 14 lakhs anganwadi centres across the country.

Earlier addressing the anganwadi workers, Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj said that the anganwadis can contribute to the Swachh Bharat Mission in a big way. This can be done by connecting nutrition to cleanliness i.e. providing nutrition to children and lactating mothers in a clean environment. She urged the awardees to become an example for other functionaries and to motivate them to deliver better quality ICDS Services.

WCD Secretary, Shri Rakesh Srivastav, in his welcome address, said that the WCD Ministry is making all out efforts to improve anganwadi services. Some of the recent initiatives taken up in this regard include pan-India expansion of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, electronic transfer of honorarium of anganwadi workers, guidelines for ECCE, food fortification, e-learning portal of WCD Ministry among many others.

The Award at the National Level comprises a cash prize of Rs.25,000/- and a citation. State Level Award comprises a cash prize of Rs. 5,000/- and a citation. As per guidelines, National Level Awards to AWWs are given to the awardees nominated by States/UTs out of the State/UT level awardees. The number of nominations of AWWs at National Level depends on the size of the State/UT and operational ICDS Projects. The scheme for awarding anganwadi workers at the National and State levels was formulated in the year 2000-01.

The Central Government is executing Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) to implement the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), in which State Governments/UT Administrations have major role to play. The Ministry has been requesting the State Governments/UT Administrations from time to time to identify and register all Child Care Institutions (CCIs) including Observation Homes, Special Homes and Observation cum Special Homes under relevant provisions of JJ Act and set up functional inspection and other Committees to ensure that children in all the CCIs receive the best of care, and are not subject to any kind of abuse and neglect. The State Governments/UT Administrations are also required to ensure, through regular inspection and monitoring, that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the JJ Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rule, 2016 framed there-under.

 

The financial norms under ICPS were revised with effect from 1st April, 2014. Some of the key features of the revised Scheme are, increased maintenance grant for children in homes, from existing Rs. 750 to Rs. 2000 per child per month; enhanced cost of construction from existing provision of Rs. 600 per sq. feet to Rs. 1000 per sq. feet and flexibility in the staffing pattern in service delivery structures, depending on the size and need of the State/UT.

Section 53 of the Act provides for several rehabilitation and re-integration services in institutions such as education, vocational training, mental health interventions, counseling, etc. Under Section 8 of the Act, the Juvenile Justice Board is required to conduct at least one inspection visit every month of residential facilities for children in conflict with law and recommend action for improvement in quality of services to the District Child Protection Unit and the State Government.

                Ministry of Youth Affairs and sports has launched Sports Talent Search Portal to spot the best talent from among the young population of the country. The portal was launched by the Vice President of India Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu at a function at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi. Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel, Secretary Sports Shri Injeti Srinivas, Khel Ratna and Arjuna awardees sports persons and thousands of school children were present on the occasion to witness the path breaking initiative in the field of sports.  School children presented a series of cultural performances on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Venkaiah Naidu said that this kind of initiative will not only help in identifying the best talent, but will also provide a level playing field to all the applicants and create a competitive environment.

 He said sport is an integral part of nation-building process, as it plays an important role in terms of individual development, community development, social inclusiveness and economic development. One of the most important factors that enable a nation to become a sporting power is the identification and development of right talent. As one-seventh of humanity, there is no dearth of talent in our country, especially with more than 450 million youth. Shri Naidu said, in fact, we are overflowing with talent, but in order to harness it we have to put in place a robust system to spot and nurture talent, and develop world champions.

 He said, the platform of National Sports Talent Search Portal will be a game changer and enable the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Sports Authority of India select the best.  congratulating Shri Vijay Goel for the major initiative, the Vice President said, it will go a long way in attracting the best available sporting talent in the country. He said, this platform will be fast, transparent and provide a mechanism for fair selection.

Shri Vijay Goel in his speech said the government is committed for the overall development of sports and sportspersons. He said under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi policies are being framed to provide sportspersons friendly atmosphere in the country. Referring to PM’s address through ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on 27 August, 2017, shri Goel said, our beloved Prime Minister himself took personal interest in the portal so that budding and hidden talent should take advantage and come forward to hone their skills further to bring laurels to the country in future.

He said, Indian players are continuously in the lime light in different sports in the world sports arena and referred to the recently concluded World Badminton Championship at Glasgow where Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu won bronze and silver medals respectively by their hard work, talent and discipline. Shri Goel said, players are doing their best; and now it is the duty and responsibility of the Sports federations to perform in a manner so that best results can be produced by the talented boys and girls in their respective disciplines.  

Any person interested in registration on the portal can visit www.nationalsportstalenthunt.com Or www.nationalsportstalenthunt.in by following the registration procedure to upload their achievements and videos etc.

                The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports is going to establish National Sports Museum, first of its kind, at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi. The decision was taken three months back and after a series of meetings and his personal visits to several locations in the capital, the current venue for museum was finalized by the Sports Minister Shri Vijay Goel himself. 

Shri Vijay Goel said, the Museum will showcase the India’s achievements in sports and also focus on the traditional sports within the country. He said, the aim of the Museum is to popularise the sports as a way of life within the country. Accordingly, the proposed Museum would go beyond the classical approach of a collection of memorabilia to become an interactive venue of interest for all age groups. In addition, Shri Goel said, it will display achievements of the Indian greats in sports and also act as an educational hub and offer opportunity for the young to delve into some sporting activity. 

Shri Vijay Goel has appealed to all past and present sports persons and members of public to contribute any memorabilia held by them for permanent display in the National Sports Museum. He said such contribution will be recognized and acknowledged. 

Shri Goel said that it is proposed that the Museum will have audio-visual display of rules and legacy events pertaining to various sports as part of education for the budding sportspersons, a well-equipped library of sports and physical fitness, painting gallery and amphitheater for screening of legacy matches/ contests/games is also planned.

He said, the Museum will also have a cafeteria, an activity zone, a souvenir/pro shop and a play area. It is proposed that the activities planned in various segments will include sporting activities, sports related computer games and kiosks selling sports memorabilia and sports equipment.

Shri Vijay Goel said the first phase for establishing the museum will commence soon as the idea has been transformed from concept to museum model stage by the experts.

The first three position holders received a prize money of Rs. 21000, Rs. 11000 and Rs. 5000 respectively in each category (Boys and Girls) along with 10 consolation prizes. The Ministry will conduct more Grameen Marathons across Delhi in the weeks to come.

NITI Aayog has developed a Handbook of State Statistics that consolidates key statistics across sectors for every Indian State/UT. While the State data on crucial indicators is currently fragmented across different sources, this handbook provides a one-stop database of important State statistics.

 

Starting with Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), the handbook provides sectorial compositions of State economies from 1980-81 to the latest possible year. Five different GSDP series are available between 1980-81 and now, and this database covers all of them. It covers statistics on State government finances from 1981 to 2017across indicators such as gross fiscal deficits, revenue deficits, social sector expenditure, capital expenditure etc. Labour statistics from the national sample surveys (NSS), statistics on labour force participation rates (LFPR), worker-population ratio (WPR) by industry and unemployment rates are also presented.

 

Data on education covers primary, secondary and tertiary levels including enrolment ratios, schools, enrolment, teachers and performance indicators, among others. Some of the health indicators covered by the handbook include infant mortality rate (IMR), birth rates, life expectancy, sex ratio at birth, immunisation and institutional deliveries among others. For certain indicators such as IMR, TFR, birth rates, data from 1971 onwards to 2015 is available. For other indicators the data series starts in 2005.

 

The infrastructure section provides basic information regarding infrastructure development in States. Data on road length, installed capacity, electricity generation & household electrification amongst other indicators is presented. For most cases, our data series spans the years 2005 to 2015. The final section of the publication provides state-wise estimates of poverty numbers. Data has been presented according to the Lakdawala Methodology (data from 1973-74 to 2004-05) and the Tendulkar Methodology (data from 1993-94 to 2011-12). Please note that this data is not of annual frequency. Rather, it is quinquennial, as estimates for poverty are derived from NSS Household Consumption Surveys.

The document released on Ease of Doing Business report on August 28, 2017 in New Delhi is based on an Enterprise Survey, conducted jointly with the IDFC Institute. The report itself states that it is meant to be a research document and its contents do not represent the views of the Government of India or NITI Aayog.

 

The survey was conducted between April 2015 and April 2016 and does not reflect any changes in the ease of doing business since then. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in easing various processes related to doing business. This has been verified by the World Bank. It is important to note that the enterprise responses are based on their past experiences and perceptions on doing business, dating as far back as 10 years or more. Reforms such as single window clearance systems would not be applicable to many firms covered in the survey.

 

The survey only takes inputs from firms in the formal manufacturing sector. It does not cover unorganized manufacturing and the services sectors that constitute the vast majority in India. Further, it is important to note that the methodology of the present Enterprise Survey differs from that of the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey in the following ways.

·         The World Bank interviews industry leaders while this survey interviews firms along with some experts in large states.

·         The World Bank Survey focuses on Delhi and Mumbai while this survey covers almost all states and Union Territories in India.

·         While the World Bank survey has a standardized survey across 190 countries, this survey is a non-standardized survey only for India.

·         The present survey is meant to be qualitative. It does not rank states in the ease of doing business. Its objective is to provide information for states on their business environment.

·         While the World Bank Survey covers 10 parameters handled by the states and the central government, this survey primarily deals with issues handled by the State Governments

 

The survey finds that firms in many states take considerably less time in obtaining approvals than reported by the World Bank data. On average, firms reported taking far less time in getting construction permits. In some states such as Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, getting a construction permit takes even fewer days. Similarly, on average, it took enterprises about half the time to resolve legal disputes as was reported in the World Bank Survey.

 

The survey indicates that the government’s efforts to improve business environment are showing results on the ground. The experiences of start-ups, or enterprises started during or after 2014, suggest a significant improvement in doing business over time. Newer and younger firms take less time in obtaining approvals, highlighting a favorable business environment. Young firms report that most regulatory processes do not constitute a major obstacle to their doing business.

 

The survey also captures competitive federalism among states in improving the ease of doing business. Enterprises in high-growth states are significantly less likely to report major or very severe obstacles in land and construction related approvals, environmental approvals and water and sanitation availability as compared to enterprises located in low-growth states. Enterprises in high-growth states also report taking less time on average for nearly all aspects of doing business. The specific areas where high-growth states do very well are in getting construction permits, labor renewals, and access to electricity and water connections.

 

Overall, the NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute Ease of Doing Business report shows that many of the actual experiences of enterprises are better than expert perceptions reported in past surveys.

Celebrating the outstanding achievements of women in India, NITI Aayog, in partnership with MyGov and the United Nations, announces winners of the Women Transforming India Awards, 2017. Crowdsourcing thousands of stories of women undertaking phenomenal work to transform societies across India’s cities, towns and villages, the second edition of the Awards, celebrates the critical role of women in empowering themselves and their communities.

“NITI Aayog strongly believes in the power of women to contribute towards the development of the country, and we have instituted these awards precisely to recognize these contributions and encourage many more women to step forward,” says  Dr. Arvind Panagariya, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog.

Today’s awards ceremony recognizes the exceptional work of 12 women in critical areas such as preventing violence against women; bridging the gender gap in education; providing healthcare; building livelihoods and enterprises for women; and promoting inclusion for persons with disabilities.

“This is a very ambitious project to honour unsung women in our society and there is a real need for such initiatives. Such efforts by the Government will go a long way in motivating women working to transform their societies, and in turn the country,” says Indian Olympian and Jury member, P.T Usha. 

 

“Women Transforming India received a record number of entries this year, demonstrating that all over the country, women are championing change. These inspiring stories speak to the tremendous potential of women to build an inclusive future for all and accelerate India’s growth and success story at the same time,” says Yuri Afanasiev, Jury Member and United Nations Resident Coordinator.   

 

The awardees were selected after a rigorous process by an eminent jury comprising P.T. Usha, track and field Olympian; Pooja Thakur, Wing Commander, Indian Air Force; Nirupama Rao, Former Foreign Secretary and Ambassador, Arvind Panagariya, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog; Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog and Yuri Afanasiev, UN Resident Coordinator.

Launched on International Women’s Day on 8 March, the contest aimed to gather lesser-own stories of women leading change. It was hosted on MyGov.in and ran till 1 June and was supported by an extensive outreach campaign to promote equal opportunity for women.

                NITI Aayog  launched today the Ease of Doing Business report based on an Enterprise Survey of 3,500 manufacturing firms across Indian states and union territories. The survey has been conducted, along with the IDFC Institute, to assess the business regulations and enabling environment across India from firms’ perspective.

 

The Survey was released by the Union Minister of Commerce Smt. Nirmala Sitaraman and Minister of Law & Justice and Electronics and Information Technology, Shri Ravishankar Prasad at a function in the capital today. The Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Shri Arvind Panagariya, his successor Rajiv Kumar who assumes office on 1st September,  CEO NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant and the Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy Promotion Shri Ramesh Abhishek along with the representatives from the industry, academia and senior officials of NITI Aayog were present on this occasion. 

 

The Ease of Doing Business report based on an Enterprise Survey of 3,500 manufacturing firms Survey comes in the backdrop of the fact that India needs to create an environment that fosters globally competitive firms, capable of driving and sustaining economic growth.

 

The major findings of this report are as follows:

 

·         Economic Performance and Reforms. A higher level of economic activity and better performance on a range of doing business indicators are strongly correlated.

o   Enterprises in high-growth states are significantly less likely to report major or very severe obstacles in (i) land/ construction re­lated approvals, (ii) environmental approvals and (iii) water and sanitation availability relative to enterprises in low-growth states.

o   Quite remarkably, firms located in high-growth states also report 25% less power shortages in a typical month, compared to firms in low-growth states.

·         Improvements over time. Newer and younger firms re­port a more favorable business environment in that they take less time in obtaining approvals than older firms, suggesting an improvement in the business environment.

o   Newer firms include startups established after 2014.

o   In addition, young firms report that most regulatory processes do not constitute a major obstacle to their doing business.

·         Informational gaps. States need to enhance awareness of the steps being undertaken by them to the improve ease of doing business. The survey data show low awareness among enterprises about single window systems, instituted by states.

o   On aver­age, only about 20% of start-ups, which are of recent origin, report using single window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business.

o   Even among experts, only 41% have any knowledge of the existence of these facilities.

·         Labor regulations are a bigger constraint for labor intensive firms. We find that labor intensive sectors, that create proportionately more jobs per unit of capital investment, feel more constrained by labor related regulations. For example, compared to other enterprises, the enterprises in labor intensive sectors:

o   19% more likely to report that finding skilled work­ers is a major or very severe obstacle.

o   33% more likely to report that hiring contract labor is a major or very severe obstacle.

o   Lose a greater number of days due to strikes and lockouts.

o   Report higher average time for environmental approvals and longer power shortages.

·         Barriers to firm growth. The experience of firms with fewer employees is different from that of larger firms. In some cases, large firms face more regulatory barriers than smaller firms.

o   Firms with more than 100 employees took significantly longer to get necessary approvals than smaller firms with less than 10 employees.

o   Large firms were also more likely to report that regulatory obstacles were a major impediment to doing business and that they incurred higher costs for getting approvals.

 

The Enterprise Survey was conducted in recognition of the importance of monitoring the business environment in India. A follow-up document will also bring out detailed profiles of states.

                NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), Government of India’s flagship program to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, is inviting applications for ‘Mentor India’. Mentor India is as a strategic nation building initiative to engage leaders who can guide and mentor schools students in 900+ Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) established by AIM in schools across India. 

Through Mentor India, AIM is looking to engage leaders who can dedicate 1 – 2 hours every week in one or more such labs and enable school students to experience, learn and practice future skills such as design and computational thinking. Envisaged to be the largest formal volunteer mentor network, it is aimed at maximizing the impact of ATLs. AIM is looking for corporates / professionals / academicians / students etc. who are keen to contribute to this strategic nation building initiative.

ATLs are dedicated works spaces where students (from Class 6th to Class 12th) learn innovation skills and develop ideas that will go on to transform India. The labs are powered to acquaint students with state-of-the-art equipment such as 3D printers, robotics & electronics development tools, IoT & sensors etc. With 900+ labs already identified, AIM will establish 2,000 such labs by end of 2017. The labs are designed to spur the spark of creativity, and go beyond regular curriculum and text book learning. The labs will let students explore skills of future such as design and computational thinking, adaptive learning and artificial intelligence.

Mentor India has already received strong support from Corporate India. More than 30 of India’s top thought leaders have signed up as Brand Ambassadors for the initiative. More than 90 ATLs in schools across India have been adopted and are being supported by various corporations / institutions from multiple sectors. AIM is actively looking to engage with more corporations / institutions to adopt ATLs and enable their employees to join Mentor India as volunteers. Furthermore, AIM has signed a SoI with AICTE to provide mentorship support of affiliated colleges for 366 ATLs.

Possible areas of contribution from mentors include technical knowhow, innovation and design, inspirational, and business and entrepreneurship. Mentors are expected to discuss with students the various problems our Indian society is facing across multiple themes, and motivate students to develop solutions to these community problems. Mentor India program will be further extended to provide support to Atal Incubation Centres and Existing Incubation Centres as well. Proposed recognition for mentors include digital certificate of recognition, honour board for top mentors, meet and greet with prominent dignitaries and invites to Government of India events.

The deadline for submission of applications to join Mentor India is 30 Sep 2017. The applications can be submitted online at: http://aim.gov.in/mentor.php

NITI Aayog will launch the Mentor India Campaign, a strategic nation building initiative to engage leaders who can guide and mentor students at more than 900 Atal Tinkering Labs, established across the country as a part of the Atal Innovation Mission. CEO NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant will unveil the online nationwide initiative in the capital tomorrow on Wednesday, 23rdAugust.

Mentor India is aimed at maximizing the impact of Atal Tinkering Labs, possibly the biggest disruption in formal education globally. The idea is to engage leaders who will nurture and guide students in the Atal Tinkering Labs. These labs are non-prescriptive by nature, and mentors are expected to be enablers rather than instructors.

NITI Aayog is looking for leaders who can spend anywhere between one to two hours every week in one or more such labs to enable students experience, learn and practice future skills such as design and computational thinking.

Atal Tinkering Labs are dedicated works spaces where students from Class 6th to Class 12th learn innovation skills and develop ideas that will go on to transform India. The labs are powered to acquaint students with state-of-the-art equipment such as 3D printers, robotics & electronics development tools, Internet of things & sensors etc.

NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission is among one of the flagship programs of the Government of India to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the country to set up the Atal Tinkering Labs across the country. The Mission has / is in the process of setting up 900+ such labs across India and aims to have 2,000 such labs by end of 2017.

In a major push to competitive, cooperative federalism, NITI Aayog, today, announces partnership with three States each to radically transform their Health and Education sectors.

NITI Aayog has selected Uttar Pradesh, Assam, and Karnataka to improve healthcare delivery and key outcomes in these States. In Education, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Jharkhand have been selected for support to better learning outcomes. The six States have been chosen after a rigorous competitive process based on comprehensive metrics to determine potential for impact and likelihood of success.

States were called to, first, express intent of collaborating with NITI Aayog to better their Health and Education indices. States then made presentations for each sector which was assessed by a committee comprised of senior members of NITI Aayog and Health and Education ministries. The States highlighted the initiatives undertaken by them thus far, their willingness to accelerate improvement and justified why they should be selected for the institutional support being offered by NITI Aayog.

On thorough technical evaluation, the chosen States have committed to time-bound, governance reforms in both sectors. A Program Management Unit to push for efficiency and efficacy in governance structures and service delivery will now be available in the six chosen States for a period of 30 months. It is expected that these three years of focussed attention and support from the premier think tank will lead to a marked transformation and also provide a model for other States to replicate and adapt.

This three-way partnership between NITI, State Governments and a knowledge partner for each of the sectors is part of the Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital (SATH) initiative of NITI Aayog.

NITI Aayog has been working to foster co-operative federalism by ranking states through health, water, education, and agricultural indices. However, SATH has been launched to go beyond ranking states and to handhold them in improving their social sector indicators. SATH is a challenging and ambitious initiative as the baseline of various indicators and parameters of education and health in the States are in public domain. It defines a new dimension for cooperative federalism, where NITI Aayog and its knowledge partner will actively aid implementation of their recommendations, in addition to just policy inputs. All stakeholders will be under pressure from the day of signing of the MOU to initiate reforms or processes which will show improvement in education and learning outcomes.
