                My dear fellow citizens,

Namaskar!

My heartiest greetings in advance to all Indians living in the country and abroad on the eve of the 76th Independence Day. I am delighted to address you on this momentous occasion. India is completing 75 years as an independent nation. Fourteenth August is observed as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ so as to promote social harmony, unity and empowerment of people. Tomorrow marks the day when we had freed ourselves from the shackles of colonial rulers and decided to reshape our destiny. As all of us celebrate the anniversary of that day, we bow to all those men and women who made enormous sacrifices to make it possible for us to live in a free India. 

It is a cause of celebration not only for all of us but also for every advocate of democracy around the world. When India won independence, there were many international leaders and experts who were skeptical about the success of democratic form of government in India. They had their reasons to be doubtful. In those days, democracy was limited to economically advanced nations. India, after so many years of exploitation at the hands of foreign rulers, was marked by poverty and illiteracy. But we Indians proved the skeptics wrong. Democracy not only grew roots in this soil, it was enriched too. 

In most other well-established democracies, women had to wage long-drawn struggles to get the right to vote. But India adopted universal adult franchise right since the beginning of the Republic. Thus, the makers of modern India enabled each and every adult citizen to participate in the collective process of nation-building. Thus, India can be credited to have helped the world discover the true potential of democracy. 

I believe this was not a coincidence. At the beginning of civilisation, saints and seers of this land had developed a vision of humanity that was defined by equality of all; indeed, oneness of all. The great Freedom Struggle and its leaders like Mahatma Gandhi re-discovered our ancient values for modern times. Then, it is no wonder our democracy has Indian characteristics. Gandhiji advocated decentralisation and power to the people. 

For 75 weeks now, the nation has been commemorating these noble ideals that won us freedom. In March 2021, we began the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ with the re-enactment of the Dandi March. This way, our celebrations began with a tribute to that watershed event which had put our struggle on the world map. This festival is dedicated to the people of India. Based on the success achieved by the people, the resolve to build 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' is also a part of this Mahotsav. Citizens from all age-groups have keenly participated in a series of events held across the country. This grand festival is going ahead with the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga Abhiyan’. The Indian tricolours are fluttering in every nook and corner of the country. Great martyrs would have been thrilled to see the spirit of the Independence Movement coming alive again on such a massive scale. 

Our glorious Freedom Struggle was waged bravely across the vast territory of our country. Many great freedom fighters did their duty and passed on the torch of awakening leaving little trace of their heroic deeds. Forgotten for long were many heroes and their struggles, especially among the peasant and tribal populations. The government’s decision last year to observe 15th November as ‘Janajatiya Gaurav Divas’ is welcome because our tribal heroes are not merely local or regional icons but they inspire the entire nation. 

Dear Citizens,

For a nation, particularly an ancient one such as India, the passage of 75 years is merely a blink of an eye. But for us as individuals, it is a lifetime. Senior citizens among us have witnessed a dramatic change in their lifetime. They have seen how, after Independence, all the generations have toiled hard; how we met great challenges and how we have taken charge of our destiny. The lessons learnt in the process will prove useful as we move towards the next milestone in the journey of the nation – the Amrit Kaal, the 25 years to the celebration of the centenary of our Independence. 

By the year 2047, we will have fully realised the dreams of our freedom fighters. We will have given a concrete shape to the vision of those who, led by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, drafted the Constitution. We are already on course to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat, an India that would have realised its true potential.

The world has seen a new India rising in recent years, more so after the outbreak of COVID-19. Our response to the pandemic has been appreciated everywhere. We launched the biggest vaccination drive in human history with vaccines manufactured in the country itself. Last month we crossed the 200-crore mark in cumulative vaccine coverage. In combating the pandemic, our achievements have been better than those of many developed countries. For this feat, we are grateful to our scientists, doctors, nurses, paramedics and the staff associated with vaccination.   

The pandemic has uprooted lives and also economies in the entire world. When the world has been battling the economic consequences of the great crisis, India got its act together and is now moving forward. India is among the fastest growing major economies in the world. India's start-up eco-system ranks high in the world. The success of start-ups in our country, especially the growing number of unicorns is a shining example of our industrial progress. The government and policy-makers deserve credit for beating the global trend and helping the economy flourish. During the last few years, unprecedented progress has been made in the development of physical and digital infrastructure. Through the Pradhan Mantri Gati-Shakti Yojana, all the modes of connectivity based on water, land, air etc. are being integrated in the whole country to enable seamless transportation across the country. For the vibrancy of growth visible in our country, credit must also be given to workers and farmers whose hard work has made it possible and entrepreneurs whose business acumen has created wealth. What is all the more heartening is that the growth is becoming more inclusive and regional disparities too are reducing. 

But this is only the beginning. A series of economic reforms and policy initiatives have been preparing the ground for a long term. Digital India, for example, is creating the bedrock of a knowledge economy. The ‘National Education Policy’ is aimed at preparing the future generation for the next stage of industrial revolution while also reconnecting it with our heritage. 

Economic success is leading to an ease in living too. Economic reforms are rightly accompanied by innovative welfare initiatives. A home of one’s own is no longer a dream for the poor, but a reality for more and more people, thanks to the ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’. Similarly, under the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’, tap water connection is being provided to every household since the launch of the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme. 

The aim of these and many other similar efforts is to provide basic amenities to all, particularly the poor. The keyword for India today is compassion; for the downtrodden, for the needy and for those on the margins. Some of our national values have been incorporated in our Constitution as the Fundamental Duties of the citizens. I appeal to every citizen to know about their Fundamental Duties and follow them in letter and spirit so that our nation reaches new heights.

Dear Citizens,

At the core of the transformation, we have been witnessing in healthcare, education, economy as well as a number of related areas is the stress on good governance. When work is done with the spirit of ‘Nation First’, it is bound to reflect in every decision and every sector. This is also reflected in India’s standing in the world.

India’s new-found confidence stems from the spirit of its youth, its farmers, and above all, its women. Gender inequalities are reducing and women are moving ahead, breaking many glass ceilings. Their increasing participation in social and political processes will prove decisive. At the grassroots level, we have more than 14 lakh elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions.   

Our daughters are the biggest hope for the nation. Some of them brought laurels for the country at the recently held Commonwealth Games. Of course, India’s sportspersons have been making the country proud by their performance in international competitions. A large number of our winners come from underprivileged segments of society. From becoming fighter pilots to space scientists, our daughters are scaling great heights. 

Dear Citizens, 

In celebrating Independence Day, we are celebrating our ‘Bharatiyata’. Our country is full of diversity. But, at the same time, we all have something in common. It is this common thread which binds all of us together and inspires us to walk together with the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat. 

India is a very beautiful country, also because of its mountains, rivers, lakes and forests and the animals and birds that live in such landscapes. When the environment is facing new challenges, we must remain determined to preserve all that makes India beautiful. Conserving water, soil and bio-diversity is our duty towards our children. Caring for Mother Nature has been part and parcel of Indian culture. With our traditional life style, we Indians can show the way to the rest of the world. Yoga and Ayurveda are India's invaluable gifts to the world. Their popularity is on the rise all over the globe.

Dear fellow citizens, 

Our beloved country has given us everything we have in our life. We should pledge to give everything we can for the sake of safety, security, progress and prosperity of our country. Our existence will become meaningful only in building a glorious India. The great nationalist poet Kuvempu, who enriched Indian literature through Kannada language, had written: 

 

Naanu aliwe, Neenu aliwe

Namma elubugal mele

Mooduvudu – Mooduvudu

Navabharatda leele

 

Which means:

‘I will pass

So will you

But on our bones will arise

The great tale of a new India’

This is a clarion call of the nationalist poet for making total sacrifice for the motherland and upliftment of fellow citizens. To follow these ideals is my special appeal to the youth of the country who are going to build the India of 2047.  

Before I conclude, I would like to extend Independence Day greetings to the armed forces, to the members of Indian missions abroad, and to the Indian diaspora who continue to make their motherland proud. My best wishes to all of you.

 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

Your Excellency, Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic of Cyprus, 

Distinguished members of the Cypriot delegation,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

 

It is a great pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President and the distinguished members of your delegation on your first State Visit to India. 

 

2.India attaches great value to her excellent relations with Cyprus. As young nations that are simultaneously ancient civilizations, we enjoy, today, a bilateral discourse that is historic, broad-based and multi-dimensional, based on our long-standing economic and cultural exchanges. Throughout your country’s struggle against colonialism, India was happy to offer her wholehearted and substantive support. The illustrious Archbishop Makarios, first President of the Republic of Cyprus, and the Founding Fathers of independent India, Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru regarded each other with high esteem. India has consistently stood for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus and peaceful resolution of the Cyprus problem - and we shall continue to do so. Excellency, the efforts made by you in finding a lasting solution to the Cyprus issue are indeed  commendable. India is firmly committed to extending our unequivocal support to the Cyprus talks for finding a viable and just solution. Our good wishes are with the Government and the people of Cyprus. 

 

Excellency,  

 

3.As modern, independent and democratic nations with many shared values, India and Cyprus have many convergences on regional and global issues. We have been working well together to achieve common objectives in various international fora. India appreciates the consistent support of Cyprus for her legitimate claim to permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council. India is also thankful for the efforts of Cyprus in support of her entry, as a member, into the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group. 

 

4.Both our countries have been supportive of each other’s efforts for peace and progress in our regions and the world. Having suffered invasions, occupation, conflict and adversity throughout our history, we both desire peace and stability for our respective peoples to achieve their developmental aspirations. India condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believes that responsible nations such as ours must continue efforts, with a sense of urgency, to collectively and comprehensively address the dark forces of extremism, terrorism and radicalisation which attempt to weaken the very fabric of democratic, pluralistic and open societies. 

 

5.Your visit, Excellency, is thus opportune in many ways – primarily as it is taking place at a time when our nations are engaged in intensifying our bilateral co-operation in diverse areas of our common interest. 

 

6.India lauds the economic recovery of Cyprus under your leadership, particularly its return to a positive rate of growth – among the fastest in the European Union.  In recent years, India has, fortunately, seen rapid economic progress - despite the global slowdown - and achieved a steady growth rate of about 7%. We welcome friends to take advantage of our flagship programmes like ‘Make in India’ and ‘Skill India’ - and join India’s growth story. Our information technology sector as also our renewable energy, natural gas and hydrocarbons, sustainable tourism, infrastructure and health and wellness sectors are open for partnerships and foreign investment.  The recent signing of the revised Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement is a good step in this direction. I am confident, Excellency, that your State Visit will result in new initiatives in all these areas of immense potential. 

 

7.With these words, I once again thank you for your warm gesture in conferring upon me the Grand Collar of the Order of Makarios-III which I had the honour to accept in the name of the people of India.  It shall long be valued as a symbol of the enduring friendship between India and Cyprus. 

8. I wish you, Mr. President and the members of your delegation a very  successful visit to India. 

9.With these words, Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you to join me in raising a toast to:-

-the health and well-being of President Anastasiades, President of the Republic of Cyprus;

-to the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Cyprus; and 

-to ever-lasting friendship between India and Cyprus.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee conferred the 52nd Jnanpith Award on Prof. Sankha Ghosh in New Delhi today (April 27, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that a poet and critique par excellence, a teacher of reputation, a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi award, way back in 1977, Padma Bhushan Prof. Sankha Ghosh is indeed the most deserving recipient of this award. A professor of Bengali and an authority in his own right on the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, Prof. Sankha Ghosh represents the fluid brilliance that characterizes India’s multifarious literary genius. It is indeed an example of his brilliant fluidity that an author who strove to master Bengali academically, expressed himself in perhaps the most difficult literary genre of poetry. 

The President said that in conferring the award on Prof. Sankha Ghosh the selection board noted that his poetic idiom and experiments with various poetic forms mark his greatness as a creative talent. They also observed that Prof. Ghosh’s poetry, while conveying messages, have remained free from polemics. One look at his works, be it Adim Lata- Gulmomay, Murkho Baro Samajik Noy or Baborer Prarthana, to name a few, and one would be left in no doubt about every word of the observations mentioned by the selection board to be to the point and correct. 

The President said an ardent writer of Bengali poetry, his literary works reflect a rare poetic style that encompasses not only a lyrical style but also a deep reflection of the social milieu. His poetry often takes on superficiality in our society and are indeed a candid commentary on contemporary issues. He said that he was sure that as a teacher, Prof. Ghosh would have positively influenced the impressionable minds of his students, as much as enriching the readers of his literary works.

            It gives me immense pleasure to be presenting the 52nd Jnanpith Award to Prof. Sankha Ghosh, the 6threcipient in the Bengali language.

2.         It is indeed a matter of satisfaction that the Jnanpith Award, in the institution of which the Presidency, under the first President Dr Rajendra Prasad was closely involved, has reached its 52nd edition.  In the process it has encouraged and enhanced Indian literature, like never before. 

3.         After Dr. Chandrasekhra Kambar for Kannada, Dr. Pratibha Ray for Odia, Dr Kedarnath Singh for Hindi and Dr Raghuveer Chaudhary for Gujarati, it is my pleasure and honour to be conferring the 52nd Jnanpith Award for Bengali, my own mother tongue, on Sankha Ghosh.

4.         A poet and critique par excellence, a teacher of reputation, a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi award, way back in 1977, Padma Bhushan Prof. Sankha Ghosh is indeed the most deserving recipient of this award.

5.         A professor of Bengali and an authority in his own right on the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, Sankha Ghosh represents the fluid brilliance that characterizes India’s multifarious literary genius.  It is indeed an example of his brilliant fluidity that an author who strove to master Bengali academically, expressed himself in perhaps the most difficult literary genre of poetry.

6.         In conferring the award on Prof. Sankha Ghosh the selection board noted that his poetic idiom and experiments with various poetic forms mark his greatness as a creative talent. They also observed that Ghosh’s poetry, while conveying messages, have remained free from polemics. One look at his works, be it Adim Lata- Gulmomay, Murkho Baro Samajik Noy or Baborer Prarthana, to name a few, and one would be left in no doubt about every word of the observations mentioned by the selection board to be to the point and correct.

7.         An ardent writer of Bengali poetry, his literary works reflect a rare poetic style that encompasses not only a lyrical style but also a deep reflection of the social milieu. His poetry often takes on superficiality in our society and are indeed a candid commentary on contemporary issues. I am sure that as a teacher, he would have positively influenced the impressionable minds of his students, as much as enriching the readers of his literary works.

8.         As a writer, who has explored existentialism in his works, analysed the functional aspect of human life and profoundly expressed his thoughts in his poetry through images and symbols, Prof. Sankha Ghosh has rightfully joined the stellar constellation of his predecessor awardees.

9.         One look at the stars in this constellation, gives us a shining view of the linguistic diversity inherent in the ancient artistic and linguistic unitary heritage of India.  The authors in this list have each, excelled in celebrating this diversity and at the same time strengthened the essential cultural unity.

10.       This occasion also gives us an opportunity to recall the contributions of Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain and Late Smt Rama Jain, whose efforts in promoting Indian languages and literature and establishing the Bhartiya Jnanpith remain exemplary.  I have said in the past and I repeat that, efforts merely on part of governments alone can never be sufficient in preserving, promoting and propagating art and literature.  Society, as a whole, will have to rise up to this task and it is only logical that philanthropists and the Corporate Sector takes the leadership role in doing so. Such efforts are indeed a part of Corporate Social Responsibility and I exhort the Captains of Industry to take a keen interest in this aspect of literary advocacy.

11.       The French, the Russian, the Chinese, the Japanese or the Spanish establish beyond doubt that Societies over-whelmed by non indigenous languages seldom achieve greatness.  Our nation is many notches above in this aspect since it has, over the centuries, had the capacity of not only surviving but assimilating the foreign into the indigenous. 

 

12.       It is therefore, necessary that while we keep our minds open to all linguistic influences, we continuously strive to promote and perpetuate our indigenous linguistic and literary heritage.

 

13.       Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore’s Geetanjali enthralled the world.  There is a need to take the creative genius of Indian languages to the world audience.  There is a vast international audience that awaits exposure to our vernacular literature and it will be only natural for us to respond to their urge.

 

14.       I remain hopeful that we will leave no stone unturned and the Bhartiya Jnanpith will play a leading role in achieving that. 

15.       I once again take this opportunity to congratulate Prof. Sankha Ghosh and wish him many more years of good health and literary expressions.  I hope that the replica of Vag Devi that he has received today will ensure that Devi Saraswati forever guides his thoughts and pen.

A multi-faceted personality, Shri Vinod Khanna was an iconic film actor, Parliamentarian, Minister of State for External Affairs and Union Minister for Culture and Tourism.

He shall be remembered also for his contribution to the welfare of the people whom he served with commitment and sincerity in his various capacities in the Government of India. 

Please accept my heartfelt condolences and convey the same to the members of your family. May you all have the strength to bear this irreparable loss with courage and fortitude”.

I am delighted to be amidst you, particularly for this special event. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has been closely partnering government and industry in boosting economic and industrial growth in the country. I compliment you for conceptualising the CII Awards which provide an opportunity for recognising outstanding performers and achievers in industry and women entrepreneurs.

 

2.         I would like to congratulate all the awardees – Mr. Rahul Bajaj, Chairman, Bajaj Auto Ltd who has been selected for this year’s CII President’s Award for Lifetime Achievement; Ms. Jayamma Bandari from Telangana for Education & Literacy; Ms. Monika Majumdar from West Bengal for Health and Ms. Kamal Kumbhar from Maharashtra for Micro Enterprise. The institution of the CII Foundation Woman Exemplar Award in 2005 is a welcome initiative to promote women’s empowerment at the community level by discovering and recognizing those who have, against all odds, excelled and contributed significantly to the development process in India. I am sure that this will be a great encouragement for the countless number of women who are contributing in different ways to strengthening our nation and its economy.

 

3.         I am aware that Indian industry has displayed tremendous zeal and initiative in contributing to the betterment of this country. The reach of industry in India touches lives of our citizens through different ways such as jobs, entrepreneurship, consumer goods or social development goods including education and healthcare. An inclusive growth process requires Indian industry to assume the mantle of responsibility and corporate citizenship. Our country needs visionary business leaders to manage India’s transition to a knowledge economy and catalyse the growth process.  The CII awardees exemplify this conviction and I congratulate all of them once again for their very valuable contribution. I hope they will  ignite the minds of others.

 

4.         With the CSR legislation, the scale and scope of social programmes that can be undertaken by Industry has been further enhanced. I am given to understand, that as per data maintained by CII, about 1270 companies have spent more than Rs. 8000 crores on CSR activities over the last year which is as much as 27% higher compared to the previous year. The range of CSR programs is extensive and includes education, healthcare, and rural development, amongst others. Special outreach is made for gender empowerment, differently abled citizens, and children’s issues. This is indeed satisfying and I look forward to more such engagements from Indian corporate sector.

 

5.         I would like to remind Industry that just as much as the funds, the country also needs your ideas, energy and drive. I urge you to leverage CSR to re-imagine interventions and transformative solutions to address the higher developmental challenges in India. I would also request you to have a pan-Indian outlook and not limit yourself to a few geographies for CSR development. Given the magnitude of the challenges before our country and the relatively short time available to address them, partnerships will play a very crucial role. It is important to collaborate for achieving scale, developing solutions to complex social problems and for technology development.

 

6.         To herald a new dawn in our nation, we must leverage the strengths of all sectors: the resolve, resources, and convening power of governments; the compassion, will and outreach of non-profits; the innovation, know-how, and capabilities of the private sector; and the determination and aspiration of communities as a whole. I expect CII as an industry association to reinforce and converge the initiatives of corporates in this sector. I am delighted that this is being undertaken through a dedicated CII Foundation set up for this purpose.

 

7.         I compliment CII and the CII Foundation in their efforts aimed at inclusive development. I am delighted to have presented the CII Foundation Woman Exemplar Awards to the extraordinary women transformers. My compliments to the women leaders – both the winners and the finalists amongst us today. They represent the true power of India, having overcome extraordinary challenging circumstances and becoming real leaders in transforming their lives as well as that of others.  I cannot overstate the singular stellar contribution of Mr. Rahul Bajaj who has played a major role not only in the development of Indian Industry but also in the overall development of the country. I know him for decades and congratulate him for this unique distinction conferred on him.

 

8.         With these few words, I wish all of you the very best and Godspeed in your endeavours.

 

Thank You!!

Jai Hind!!

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee addressed the first convocation of the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad in Hyderabad today (April 26, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said on the august occasion of the first convocation of the English and Foreign Languages University, as we celebrate the impressive achievements of this University, he wanted to share with them some enduring reflections that ought to guide us in advancing our vision of education. He stated that to his mind, knowledge must pave the path of life; and living must essentially encompass pursue the path of learning. From times immemorial the continent of Asia, and South East Asia in particular, opened up novel paths of learning. Wherever the Buddha traversed - seeds of knowledge sprouted and flourished. Nalanda, after Takshashila, held the beacon of light very high for over a millennium across lands and seas and welcomed drifting seekers of knowledge and provided them a lasting resting place. 

The President said that today sustaining and reinvigorating higher education, in India as well as in other parts of the world, has become a major challenge, especially so in public institutions. Challenges exist for such institutions, both from outside and inside. Atleast four distinct factors impinge from outside as well as inside on the administration of an institution of higher learning. According to him, these are a) escalation of costs of learning; b) narrow pragmatics, i.e. market-oriented fast-track skill acquisition, as the sole goal of learning; c) the allure of invasive dominant communication systems depleting attention span; and d) corrosion of trust. He stressed that any attempt to build or re-orient higher education in such a situation requires administrative acumen. Administrative strength and sensitivity removes hurdles in the path of learning, and allows academics to thrive, as this University has displayed.

  It is indeed a pleasure to be here today for the first convocation of the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU).  It is a young university although with a rich history of teaching and teacher training since its inception as the Central Institute of English, which was established as part of the vision of our first Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru for new India in 1958 and later as Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages in 1972. 

2        Regional campuses were established in Shillong and Lucknow to extend its reach; before it became a Central University in 2007. It is indeed a matter of satisfaction that it has been dedicated to finding solutions to big challenges in language education and preparing students for leadership in a complex world.

3        This University bears six decades of experience in envisioning and materializing an educational model for a new India from this renowned city of Hyderabad, a city that stands apart as a city of poets, painters, artists and creative minds.  A smaller India in itself, it throbs with multiple languages & cultures, cuisine and crafts of its own. It is a multifaceted city with much cherished historical legacies and futuristic vision.

4        Out of the harmonious symphony of the old and modern in the city of Hyderabad, this University of international repute emerged due to hard work and collective energies of people with international reputation. Today EFLU stands out among the Universities of South Asia with specialized competencies in the areas of language, literary and cultural pedagogies, language sciences, teacher education and research.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

5        I am happy to know that the University has built a significant research profile in language and literary studies, cultural and inter-disciplinary studies. The university’s extensive and intensive explorations in research range  from natural language processing, classical and bhasha  literatures  and  cinema studies to philosophical studies on one hand and new experimental researches in cultural  theory, performance studies and media analysis on the other.  I am informed that in addition,  upcoming domains of research at the University are –

forensic linguistics using speech recognition for forensic purposes; 

digital humanities archiving and documenting digital databases for cultural memories and cultural creations of the country;  and

cognitive science research with focus in acoustic phonetics, language disorders and language processing.

6        With its expanding research profile EFLU can play a significant role in reorienting higher education in the country as well as in other emerging nations.  It should  be possible to develop educational packages from school to University level for training and for collaborative  teaching and research.

7        Recognizing the seminal role played by the University and assisting productive expansion of its founding vision, the Government of India has entrusted EFLU with several groundbreaking and important projects such as National University Students Skill Development, National Literacy Mission Authority and Massive Open Online Courses.

8        Acknowledging the eminent role that the University evinces in Teacher training and education, the Ministry of External Affairs entrusted the university with international responsibility for training diplomats and for designing trainer training programmes.  I am told that in this regard centres for English Language training have been set up in ASEAN countries and five new centres are coming up in African countries.

9        I am happy to know that the University has initiated outreach programs such as university – industry interface and mutually beneficial dialogue with public sector undertakings, social welfare organizations, government agencies, media houses and private educational institutions.

10      On this august occasion, as we celebrate the impressive achievements of this University, let me share with you some enduring reflections that ought to guide us in advancing our vision of education.  To my mind, knowledge must pave the path of life; and living must essentially encompass pursuit of the path of learning.  From times immemorial the continent of Asia, and South East Asia in particular, opened up novel paths of learning. Wherever the Buddha traversed - seeds of knowledge sprouted and flourished. Nalanda, after Takshashila, held the beacon of light very high for over a millennium across lands and seas and welcomed drifting seekers of knowledge and provided them a lasting resting place.

11      Today sustaining and reinvigorating higher education, in India as well as in other parts of the world, has become a major challenge, especially so in public institutions.  Challenges exist for such institutions, both from outside and inside.  At least four distinct factors impinge from outside as well as inside on the administration of an institution of higher learning; According to me, these are a) escalation of costs of learning; b) narrow pragmatics, i.e. market-oriented fast-track skill acquisition, as the sole goal of learning; c) the allure of invasive dominant communication systems depleting attention span; and d) corrosion of trust.

12      Any attempt to build or re-orient higher education in such a situation requires administrative acumen.  Administrative strength and sensitivity removes hurdles in the path of learning, and allows academics to thrive, as this University has displayed.

Friends,

13      Cynicism is an easy alibi to evade responsibility.  Any institutional future is dependent upon enabling the faculty, students and the staff to overcome cynicism.  One way of achieving this is making everyone a stakeholder in collaborative institution-building.  Immersive teaching supplemented by intensive research alone can advance the vision of the University in generating new knowledge and sharing it with everyone.

14      It is important to recall that the singular feature of  vidya-dana (gifting learning) that this country has extended on a planetary scale was aimed at attaining happiness for everyone. Sarve Jana Sukhino Bhavantu says the age old mantra from Upanishad.  This shloka should be the driving impulse of any conception of education in any period or place. Kennedy inspired graduates to strive for the one of the biggest goal: that is world peace.  He said; and I quote,

Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many of us think it is unreal. But that is a dangerous defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable – that mankind is doomed – that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.

While strongly advocating for peace he said and I quote, “Our job is not to accept that. Our problems are manmade – therefore they can be solved by man.  And Man can be as big as he wants.” Unquote

15      On this celebratory occasion, I wish all those who leave the portals of this prestigious University and carry its legacy as they move on – to attain a happy prosperous and meaningful life. I wish them Godspeed and all success in their future endeavours.

Thank you.

Jai Hind.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee addressed the inaugural function of centenary celebrations of Osmania University in Hyderabad today (April 26, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that we should develop Universities as temples of higher learning. They should be places for creating learning environment, where free exchange of ideas will take place and where mighty minds in the form of students and teachers would exchange ideas. Osmania University was also established with this dream that it will be an institution of excellence where free minds will meet freely, interact and exchange ideas and live in peaceful co-existence.  In ancient India, India played a leading role in the field of higher learning. Universities such as Taxila, Nalanda, Vikramshila etc. had attracted mighty minds in the form of students and teachers. 

The President said that today, there is no doubt that there has been huge development of educational infrastructure in the field of higher learning.  However, there are some areas of concern.  As Visitor to more than 100 Central Institutions of higher learning, he had been continuously emphasizing that these Institutions in India should occupy their rightful place in the international ranking process.  He said that apart from looking into this aspect, attention also needs to be laid on basic research and education.  There should be interface and effective inter-linkages between industry and academia. We cannot live in isolation. There is need for investment in research and innovation so that we can occupy our rightful place in the international community.  The President emphasized that these ideas must be translated into practical action.

India and South Africa share common values and strong historical linkages that form the bedrock of our close friendship. This year, we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the historic signing of the Red Fort Declaration that elevated the relationship between our two countries to a strategic partnership. Our partnership is nurtured by our multifaceted and vibrant engagement in diverse sectors of our mutual interest. Our cooperation in the frame work of IBSA, BRICS and BASIC respectively have added value and substance to our engagement. The visit of Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi to South Africa in July, 2016 and Your Excellency’s participation in the ninth BRICS Summit in Goa in October, 2016 have contributed substantially to our joint efforts to strengthen and deepen our cooperation and will serve to reinforce the ties between India and South Africa in the coming years. I look forward to working with you to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation for the benefit of our two nations. 

Please accept, Excellency, my good wishes for your personal well-being, as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of South Africa”.

 Despite the geographical distance between our countries, the peoples of India and Togo have always enjoyed close and warm relations.  It is our endeavour to continuously strive to ensure that our bilateral partnership is strengthened in the years to come.

I take this opportunity to convey heartfelt thanks to Your Excellency for the release of five Indian nationals from a Togolese jail in February, 2017.

Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your good health and well-being as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Republic of Togo”.

I take this opportunity to convey our good wishes for Your Excellency’s good health and well-being as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Republic of Sierra Leone”.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that to prepare graduates for a competitive global economy, we have to impart quality education in our institutions. This will call for adoption of global best practices for world-class academic management. Our institutions have to work relentlessly towards excellence. They have to provide the best of amenities to their academic community. Models of teaching have to be adaptive to the latest trends and also the changing learner profile. There has to be an alliance between the IT-enabled platforms like MOOCs and knowledge networks, and pedagogy. As concepts and understanding evolve, our faculty has to be better prepared with up-dated knowledge. A strong research eco-system has to be built on the plank of institutional collaborations, research parks, and talented researchers. There also have to be close link between Indian universities and industries. 

The President said that recognizing that no institution can excel in isolation, they have to provide students and faculty international exposure, introduce industry relevant matter in course work, and share academic resources. A mechanism is needed in our higher education system that promotes competitiveness. NIRF is a valuable initiative and he was sure that with greater and more involved participation, this indicator will provide impetus to our institutions to do better in the coming years. 

The President said that our centres of higher learning are social institutions too. They have to carry out their responsibilities as a social entity. A strong connection with the society will provide the edifice for value-oriented learning in them. This will instill in the students a sensitivity that will inspire them to search for solutions to vexed socio-economic problems in the environment in which they are living. The onus is on our institutions to produce men and women of substance and character, not merely competent professionals.

                1.           At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude and deep appreciation for conferring on me the Honorary D. Litt. Degree. I deeply appreciate this gesture shown to me and accept this distinction with all humility.  I take this opportunity to congratulate degree holders and award winners for their hard work and toil over the years. 



 

2.           Convocation is always an important landmark in the life of students and their parents.  It recognizes their hard work.  Dear students, when you leave the portals of your alma mater, you may feel a little nervous as you would no longer have the support of your guides and friends.  But, you have no reason to be nervous, since I know that the skills you have acquired will help you in facing all troubles and challenges.  I wish you all success.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

3.           Goa University was set up in 1985 in this lush environment, which is conducive to the pursuit of knowledge and research. Over the last three decades, Goa University has grown from strength to strength to make its mark in the national and global landscape. This, it has been able to do so without losing sight of its local ethos, is a notable achievement. To my mind, it is a model worth emulating for any knowledge hub set in a distinctive environment.

 

4.           Goa has a unique position in India’s unfolding tryst with destiny. It is a shining example of our cultural pluralism and co-existence, and a symbol of a Cosmopolitanism which is essential for a modernizing society. While writing on the objectives of university in a free country Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru once observed and I quote: “A university stands for humanism; for tolerance; for reason; for the adventure of ideas, and for the search of truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards ever higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties adequately, then it is well with the nation and the people” (unquote). I am happy to note that Goa University has imbibed this basic principle and is in consonance with the heritage of our country. In ancient times, India was the leader in education.  Universities like Taxila, Nalanda, Vikramshila etc. attracted mighty minds in the form of students, teachers and researchers.  A university should be a laboratory of various ideas. 

 

Friends:

5.           It is heartening to know that Goa University has taken unique initiatives to provide a platform for interaction between achievers in different fields like classical music, history, language, political economy, arts, and its students. The Visiting Research Professorship Programme of this university has brought some of India’s brightest minds here during its last four years. It has made the knowledge and wisdom of these experts available to the students as well as members of the public. I wish the programme great success in the years ahead.

 

6.           I am also happy to learn that women comprise a high percentage of the student population in Goa University. I was also happy to see that girl students outshone the boys when prizes were being distributed.  It is important that young women particularly those belonging to marginal sections gain increased access to the portals of colleges and universities. Women’s empowerment through education will have a positive impact on our future generation. It is rightly said that if we educate a man, we educate an individual but if we educate a women, we educate an entire family. 

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

7.           India is presently at a very challenging phase of its socio-economic transition. We are in the midst of global changes that are both complex and unpredictable. Indian expertise and talent has much demand worldwide. The prospects in a liberal economic environment are immense. Yet, to take advantage of the unfolding opportunities in a globalized market, we have to galvanize our demographic strength.

 

8.           The youthful character of our nation - 600 million people in the age group of 25 years and below – has to become our asset in our surge for advancement. For that, we need to provide sound training to our youth to build capacity for undertaking skilled work. It will help prepare them for challenging job roles in the global economic community. They have to be inculcated with the aptitude to think ahead. For, lot of ideas capable of making an impact transmits faster than ever before today.

 

9.           Universities, no doubt, have to take the lead in this regard. But this is a task that can hardly be accomplished by the public institutions alone. It will require a new paradigm of partnership between the various stakeholders such as industry, voluntary sector, central and state agencies. All stakeholders have to be involved in these efforts. 

 

10.       To prepare graduates for a competitive global economy, we have to impart quality education in our institutions. This will call for adoption of global best practices for world-class academic management. Our institutions have to work relentlessly towards excellence.  They have to provide the best of amenities to their academic community. Models of teaching have to be adaptive to the latest trends and also the changing learner profile. There has to be an alliance between the IT-enabled platforms like MOOCs and knowledge networks, and pedagogy. As concepts and understanding evolve, our faculty has to be better prepared with up-dated knowledge. A strong research eco-system has to be built on the plank of institutional collaborations, research parks, and talented researchers. There also have to be close link between Indian universities and industries. 

 

Dear friends:

11.       Recognizing that no institution can excel in isolation, they have to provide students and faculty international exposure, introduce industry relevant matter in course work, and share academic resources. A mechanism is needed in our higher education system that promotes competitiveness. NIRF is a valuable initiative, and I am sure, with greater and more involved participation, this indicator will provide impetus to our institutions to do better in the coming years.

 

12.       Our centres of higher learning are social institutions too. They have to carry out their responsibilities as a social entity. A strong connection with the society will provide the edifice for value-oriented learning in them. This will instill in the students a sensitivity that will inspire them to search for solutions to vexed socio-economic problems in the environment in which they are living. The onus is on our institutions to produce men and women of substance and character, not merely competent professionals.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

13.       The first university education commission, headed by Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, nearly seven decades ago had made some vital recommendations. Many of them were accepted. University Grant Commission was established. Over the years, many recommendations bore good results. They are relevant even today.

14.       I call upon the academic leadership of Goa University to rededicate themselves to the ideals which the makers of our nation had espoused. The learning environment in our educational institutions should nurture scholarship in the students in a way that the aspirations of their self, family, society, nation and the world are met with a seamless endeavour. It should facilitate the acquisition of greater knowledge and the application of that knowledge in solving the riddles facing our times like environmental degradation, resource conflict and identity crisis.

 

Friends:

15.       India is uniquely placed to offer its own symbol of peace, democracy and concord to the world. I am confident that the graduates and researchers who will leave the portals of this august institution after obtaining their degrees today will contribute brilliantly to realize the potential of this nation.

 

16.       I wish you every success and an exciting journey ahead in future. Go ahead.  Whole world is yours.  Be confident and you will able to conquer the world. 

Thank you.

Jai Hind.

Please accept, Your Majesty, our sincere wishes for your good health and well-being. I take this opportunity to also convey the greetings of the people of India to the friendly people of the United Kingdom on the occasion of ‘Queen’s Day’.”

                It is indeed a privilege for me to be present at the Inaugural Session of the 3rd Global Exhibition on Services. I compliment the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, along with the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Services Export Promotion Council, for developing this powerful business platform aimed at deepening engagement of the international community in the global services export domain.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


2.   Services trade is increasingly viewed as an instrument to create jobs, drive national growth and foster exchange of ideas, knowledge and technology. The services sector also contributes significantly to trade in goods including through supply chains and e-commerce. At a time when global merchandise trade is slowing down, trade in services can bring new benefits to the global economy even as technology, connectivity and knowledge drive its growth.


3.   In this respect, India enjoys a special role. A country which can place 104 satellites in space from a single launch vehicle, provide successful medical surgeries at a fraction of the cost in advanced nations, win global awards for creativity in advertising, and emerge as the largest film producer in the world, has the potential to offer immense value to international services consumers across a spectrum of areas.


4.   The services sector contributes the lion’s share of India’s GDP, and represents its fastest growing sector with an estimated growth rate of 7.1 per cent in 2016-17. While India has emerged as the fastest growing large economy in the world, its services sector outpaces its GDP growth rate and has been its key growth driver. India’s share in global services exports has increased to 3.3 per cent in 2015. Our services exports are helping global businesses build their productivity and competitiveness, and are supporting jobs across the world.


5.   It is noteworthy that the pattern of India’s services exports is somewhat different from the global profile of services exports, reflecting its inherent advantages in knowledge based subsectors. While travel and transport services account for half of the world’s total services exports of almost $5 trillion, India’s overseas services engagement is dominated by ICT and other business services which constitute about two-thirds of its total services exports.


6.   Regarding India’s services imports, it is transport, other business services and travel that are the most in demand, with financial services and payments for intellectual property also contributing significantly. The composition of imports indicates India’s growing aspiration to leverage services from overseas for its growth and development, and also points to its strength as a growing market for the world.


7.   The government has recently unfurled a range of key developmental campaigns aimed at unleashing new growth vectors that are further driving India’s services sub sectors. Make in India targets the creation of an advanced manufacturing base, increasingly built on embedded services such as R&D and design, retail and marketing, and logistics. The Digital India campaign serves to connect all remote corners of the country through efficient digital infrastructure, while also increasing manufacturing of electronics and offering key public services online. With digital infrastructure in place, technology will reach down to the farthest hamlets, placing markets at the fingertips of citizens and driving services growth. Startup India and Skill India enhance the capabilities of our youth for livelihood opportunities, both as job providers and job seekers in the services markets. The Jan Dhan Yojana for financial inclusion and the strong push for fintech to propel less use of cash in the economy are shaping a new services dimension in the country and boosting sectors such as banking and finance, cyber security and e-commerce.


8.   I am happy to note that the Global Exhibition on Services embraces as many as twenty vital services sectors for special focus. While some of the services are traditional ones such as tourism and hospitality and retail, many of the focus sectors are new to India and the world, including space services, sports services and wellness services.


9.   India can also be a key partner for emerging services such as facilities management, event and exhibition, urban infrastructure and environmental services. Many of these services can be delivered from India to offshore locations, helping large cities manage their facilities optimally, facilitating hospitals in maintaining medical records or providing geospatial information.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


10. The global services trade is far less than the global merchandise trade; however, it has an equal potential given that most economies today are dominated by services sectors in terms of output and employment. Global services trade is, however, challenged by multiple issues relating to legal, economic and political spheres. Encouraging greater trade in services globally requires us to address policy matters such as access and facilitation through trade negotiations, transparency, dispute resolution and capacity building. Recognizing the overwhelming role of services trade in the overall trade agenda, India has acted to evolve solutions for resolving barriers to trade. Accordingly, in March this year, India tabled a paper at the WTO on trade facilitation in services to increase the volume of trade in the sector.


11. Exchange of services represents the way forward for global trade. It is a matter of satisfaction that the 3rd Global Exhibition on Services brings together more than 70 countries and 500 exhibitors to showcase the best products for such exchanges. I would request industry members present here to leverage the opportunities provided by the many knowledge sessions, sectoral engagements, and international participation to provide an impetus to the trade of services across the board. I am sure that the outcomes of the GES would reverberate positively into the future.


I wish you all an engaging and productive interaction and Godspeed in your endeavors. 

Thank you

                                                                                                                                        Jai Hind!!

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated 3rd edition of the Global Exhibition on Services (GES-2017) today (April 17, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India can be a key partner for emerging services such as facilities management, event and exhibition, urban infrastructure and environmental services. Many of these services can be delivered from India to offshore locations, helping large cities manage their facilities optimally, facilitating hospitals in maintaining medical records or providing geospatial information. 

The President said that the services sector contributes the lion’s share of India’s GDP, and represents its fastest growing sector with an estimated growth rate of 7.1 per cent in 2016-17. While India has emerged as the fastest growing large economy in the world, its services sector outpaces its GDP growth rate and has been its key growth driver. India’s share in global services exports has increased to 3.3 per cent in 2015. Our services exports are helping global businesses build their productivity and competitiveness, and are supporting jobs across the world. 

The President was happy to note that the Global Exhibition on Services embraces as many as twenty vital services sectors for special focus. While some of the services are traditional ones such as tourism and hospitality and retail, many of the focus sectors are new to India and the world, including space services, sports services and wellness services. 

The President said that services trade is increasingly viewed as an instrument to create jobs, drive national growth and foster exchange of ideas, knowledge and technology. The services sector also contributes significantly to trade in goods including through supply chains and e-commerce. At a time when global merchandise trade is slowing down, trade in services can bring new benefits to the global economy even as technology, connectivity and knowledge drive its growth.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee attended an event to commemorate the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha, at Patna today (April 17, 2017) where he honoured freedom fighters.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that we are today commemorating the hundred years of Champaran Satyagraha. Champaran in Bihar served as the laboratory of Satyagraha and National Freedom Movement. He said that the symbolic significance of Champaran Satyagraha was much greater than what actually happened in Champaran. Along with the Kheda Satyagraha of 1917-1918, the Champaran Satyagraha was the movement responsible for putting Gandhi on the front seat of the Indian nationalist movement and making satyagraha a powerful tool of civilian resistance.

The President said that the Government of Bihar deserves appreciation for commemorating the centenary of the Champaran movement and for organising the event to felicitate the freedom fighters of India. It is a true homage to our roots – the freedom fighters, who under the able and inspiring leadership of Gandhiji laid the foundation of a resilient Indian freedom movement. The event is not only to recognize the contribution of our freedom fighters but was also important because it is necessary that we know our history and are acquainted with our roots. He said that we must celebrate our diversity and should make efforts to ensure that India reaches at rightful place in the comity of nations.

                Ladies and Gentlemen.

 

 

2.       It is indeed a very pleasant occasion for me to be present here today at Ahmednagar, as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, to award my Standard to Armoured Corps Centre and School, on this glorious and memorable day.

 

3.       I compliment the brave men of the Armoured Corps Centre and School for their impeccable turnout and outstanding precision in the parade they displayed today.  This distinguished Establishment has a glorious past, and rich tradition of professionalism and excellence in imparting training to the men of the Armoured Corps, the Indian Army and Friendly Foreign Countries.  Since its inception in 1948, the Armoured Corps Centre and School has distinguished itself in service of the Nation.  In recognition of its selfless devotion, professionalism and dedication to service the Nation honours it today, with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation.

 

4.       Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, any Nation draws it strength from all elements of National Power, and the capabilities of its Armed Forces are a major source of National power.  Although we are a peace loving Nation, we will use all instruments of National power in order to protect our sovereignty.  I am confident that our brave soldiers will rise to the occasion, as they have done so in the past, to meet the challenges and emerge victorious. 

 

5.       Armoured Corps Centre and School completes 69 years of glorious service to the Nation and Armoured Corps.  The Heroes of Armoured Corps whom we read of in Battles of Zoji La Pass, Khem Karan, Asal Uttar, Chawinda etc all got their basic and advanced training in this splendid Establishment. There is a famous saying that “It is the Men behind the Machine that matters most”, and it was proved time and again in all wars fought by India, that the superior training of our tank men enabled them to destroy our enemy in their sophisticated tanks.  These victories would not have been ours, had the dedicated men of Armoured Corps Centre and School, which makes tankmen from boys, not done their task of training these heroes with utmost dedication and sincerity.  It is due to the untiring and relentless hard work of the men of Armoured Corps Centre and School, that the Establishment is deemed to be a “Centre of Excellence” in imparting quality training to the Indian Army. I also take this opportunity to pay my homage to the gallant soldiers of the Armoured Corps, who made the supreme sacrifice in service of the Nation. The majestic War Memorial on far side of the Parade Ground, stands in mute testimony of our homage for the brave soldiers.

   

6.       The Cavalry have evolved, and so have our Cavalry men. May your Sword always remain sharp and your morale sky high. In acknowledgement and recognition of its outstanding performance over decades, I am pleased to award “Standard” to Armoured Corps Centre and School.  I am confident that the Centre and School will continue to strive for excellence with professional zeal and serve the Nation in the years to come. I also take the opportunity to compliment the men and families of Armoured Corps Centre and School, past and present.  I wish you the very best for a glorious future.

 

Jai Hind

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee presented the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE) Awards at the 8th Public Sector Day function held in New Delhi today (April 11, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that celebrating this Day is an acknowledgement of the invaluable contribution made by our Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) since independence when PSEs had been chosen as the vehicle of industrialization in our country. He said that he was a firm believer in the continued relevance and importance of the Public Sector in our economy. He was confident that CPSEs will continue to do well in the future and meet new challenges.

The President said that in our country we started with only five PSEs with an investment of 29 crore. However, their growth over the years is very substantial. Their overall net profit increased by 12.5 percent during 2015-16. This is appreciable since they have continued to perform well despite the fact that the global fiscal and economic scenario and industrial climate is not very encouraging. He said that India is a fast growing economy and many more glorious chapters will be added to the credit of PSEs in the future too.

The President said that he had been associated with SCOPE functions on many occasions. He congratulated the awardees and wished them further success.

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Anant G Geete, Union Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises; Shri Babul Supriyo, Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises; Smt. Seema Bahuguna, Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises and Shri Ved Prakash, Chairman, SCOPE.

                HE the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, MP the Prime Minister of Australia called on President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee at RashtrapatiBhavan yesterday (April 10, 2017).
 
Welcoming the Australian Prime Minister to India, the President said India values its growing cooperation with Australia.  Bilateral relations between India and Australia have become multi-faceted and grown considerably in the last few years.  Our fruitful cooperation in multilateral fora reflects the growing mutual understanding and closer cooperation between the two countries. 

The President said it is a matter of satisfaction that our people have a regular dialogue on the challenges of terrorism.  India has been consistent in its position that terrorism cannot be justified under any circumstances and that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations needs to be rooted out by urgent and comprehensive action by peace loving nations in all parts of the world.

The President said India could be an attractive option for long term investment.  The ‘Make in India Conference’ and ‘Invest in India Conference’ programmes have been designed for enhancing economic cooperation and investments. 

The President said India is keen to ramp up the nuclear energy component of our total energy mix plans as part of our efforts to enhance the use of clean energy and save fossil fuels.  India sees a key role for Australian uranium supplies in this process.  India appreciates Australia’s efforts in this direction.

The President said there are more than 60,000 Indian students studying in Australia.  There is huge potential for cooperation in the education sector.  Our institutional frameworks have the potential to broaden bilateral cooperation in this sector.

HE Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh called on President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan yesterday (April 9, 2017). 

Welcoming the Bangladeshi Prime Minister to India, the President fondly remembered his visit to Bangladesh in March 2013. He also appreciated the Prime Minister’s visit in August 2015 to attend the last rites of his late wife. 

The President said Government of Bangladesh’s gesture of honouring the Indian soldiers martyred during the 1971 Liberation War is highly appreciated in India. India considers it a demonstration of solidarity and a symbol of the unique history of bilateral ties. There is much that unites the two countries - a shared history and common heritage, linguistic and cultural ties, passion for music, literature and the arts. 

The President said India deeply appreciates Bangladeshi Prime Minister’s role in giving a new direction to the India-Bangladesh relationship and making it what it is today – a strong, vibrant and exemplary partnership between two neighbours. He said that under the leadership of the Bangladesh Prime Minister, the country has made tremendous progress. 

The President said Bangladesh’s commitment to strengthening democracy, rule of law, pluralism and human dignity and to ensuring peace, security and stability in the country is commendable. He congratulated Bangladesh on successfully hosting the 136th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Dhaka last week and also the 9th Global Forum on Migration and Development in December 2016. 

The President said India-Bangladesh relations are growing from strength to strength. Cooperation is the field of connectivity, power, energy, trade, capacity building and infrastructure development is especially praiseworthy. India is fully committed to be a partner in Bangladesh’s economic development. Geographical proximity and connectivity are advantages that must be leveraged to mutual benefit. He hoped that the announcement of over USD 5 billion of Indian concessionary financing for infrastructure projects in Bangladesh over the next couple of years will usher in more development for Bangladesh.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee released the India Rankings 2017 report today (April 10, 2017) at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also presented awards to top-ranked institutions i.e. top 10 in overall category and toppers in the stream-wise categories -Engineering, Management, Universities, Colleges and Pharmacy.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in his capacity as Visitor to institutions of higher learning, he has been repeatedly emphasizing on their actively participating in the international rating system and focusing attention on the rankings process.  He was happy that during the last two years, two Indian institutions have figured in the top 200 in international rankings.  He said that he believed that our institutions have all the qualities necessary for being ranked high. He said that the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) started by the Ministry of HRD and now in its second year is a laudable initiative and will help our institutions to realize their potential and emerge as world class institutions.

 

The President said that the higher education sector in India has seen massive expansion during the last two decades.  The number of Universities, Degree Colleges, IITs, NITs, etc has increased but certain issues remain to be addressed.  The first issue was regarding the lack of availability of quality teachers.  The second was the problem of retaining our talents in our country.  Bright students every year go abroad as they consider that the facilities, environment and opportunities abroad are superior.  In ancient times, the situation was reverse when our Universities attracted the brightest students as well as teachers from all over the world. 

 

The President said that we must take full advantage of the technological developments which have taken place. Through the use of technology, students in India can have access to top class teachers in Universities abroad.   Constant interaction of teachers and students with their counterparts in other parts of the world can be useful.  Use of technology does pose challenges too but they have to be addressed and we have to move forward.  Our students and teachers have to be competitive.  He said that we must have inspired teachers whose services need to be utilized.  He stated that if India is to occupy its rightful place in the comity of nations it was important to build a knowledge economy.  The constant cultivation of knowledge, sharing of views and exchange of ideas will contribute to enriching both students and teachers.  He said that another imperative to quality education is the rapidly emerging youthful character of our population.  We are a nation having a significant young population: about 600 million in the age group of 25 years and below. In order to ensure that this demographic dividend does not turn into a demographic liability, we need to equip our youth with necessary skills to enhance their employability. 

 

The President congratulated all the awardees and institutions of repute and hoped that this feather in their cap would inspire others to follow in their footsteps. 

 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister of Human Resource Development; Dr. MahendraNath Pandey, Minister of State for Human Resource Development; Smt. Omita Paul, Secretary to the President and Shri Kewal Kumar Sharma, Secretary (Higher Education), Ministry of Human Resource Development.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee urged all citizens to extend their unstinted support to the mission of a less cash India. He stated that all efforts of the Government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them pro-actively. 

The President was speaking on the occasion of the 100th mega draw of lots for Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 9, 2017). 

The President said India is on the cusp of a digital revolution. More than one billion Indians have a unique identity number with a biometric identifier which is unique in its own way. Even countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place. The Aadhaar card initiative is a watershed event in the development story of India. 

The President complemented the Government on its bold initiatives for promoting the culture of digital payment in the country. He said it was in line with such bold initiatives that the Parliament made a new beginning in Financial Management through passage of Annual Budget by March 31, 2017.

I am happy today to be a part of the digital payment movement that India has embarked upon. I congratulate each one of you who has contributed in this mission to make India a less cash society. This will help ensure financial inclusion where every Indian, irrespective of her socio-economic status, is empowered with necessary digital tools to participate in the new age economy. 

2. I also congratulate all those who have won mega and other prizes today and over the past three months. On this occasion, I will also like to recognize the efforts of all citizens who have participated in this digital payment mission. 

3. India has a long way to go to become a cash less society. Presently, we remain primarily a cash based economy with about 95% of the personal consumption and 86% of all transactions being in cash. The initiatives of the Government are a good beginning and we need to sustain and nurture these with active participation from all segments of the society. It is necessary to reduce cash in circulation and impart greater urgency to promoting secure digital payment methods to ensure greater transparency. 

4. India is on the cusp of a digital revolution. More than one billion Indians have a unique identity number with a biometric identifier which is unique in its own way. Even countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place. The Aadhaar card initiative is a watershed event in the development story of India. 

5. Aadhaar enabled payment system has made digital payments possible for even those section of the population who may not have mobile phones. 

6. The Government has enabled development of new modes of digital payments with the goal to make their use easy and seamless across providers. Launch of BHIM has demystified the digital payments and brought it within the grasp of every citizen. 

7. Finance Minister in his Union Budget for 2017-18 has announced several important initiatives which will help in promoting digital payments. 

8. I complement the Government on its bold initiatives for promoting the culture of digital payment in the country. It was in line with such bold initiatives that the Parliament made a new beginning in Financial Management through passage of Annual Budget by March 31, 2017. 

9. I urge all citizens to extend their unstinted support to the mission of a less cash India. All efforts of the Government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them proactively. Thank you. Jai Hind.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated an All India Seminar on “Economic Reforms With Reference to Electoral Issues” organised by the Confederation of the Indian Bar today (April 8, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that a strong electoral system is necessary to strengthen the democratic structure of India. Timely reforms are necessary which not only would give justice to the people but also to the ideals enshrined in the Constitution of India. Hence it is necessary to undertake a dispassionate analysis of the way in which our electoral process is functioning with a view to address the shortcomings in the system. 

The President said that generally in the past, coalition governments at the Centre contributed to unstable governments necessitating frequent elections. Fragile coalitions did not last. He also referred to the issue of responsibility to the electorate and said that Parliament is not merely a deliberative body but a decision making body. 

The President said that the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act 1976 imposed a freeze on the population figure for readjustment at the 1971 census and has been extended by the Constitution (Eighty-fourth Amendment) Act 2001 till 2026. As a result the House of the People today represents the population figure of 1971 census whereas our population has increased manifold in the recent decades. This gives rise to an anomalous situation wherein today, India has over 800 million voters and 543 Lok Sabha Constituencies represent 1.28 billion people. To give true expression to the will of the people, it is time that we look at the legal provisions on the delimitation of the Parliamentary constituencies with a view to increase their number. If Great Britain can have more than 600 Parliamentary constituencies, why can’t India, with a much higher population, have more number of seats, the President asked. 

The President congratulated the Confederation of the Indian Bar for organizing this Seminar and expressed hope that the Seminar will deliberate at length electoral reforms and substantive and concrete suggestions will come out of the deliberations.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the first NIMCARE World Health Day Summit 2017 today (April 7, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was happy that NIMCARE has taken the lead in organizing this Conference on World Health Day. The slogan of the first NIMCARE World Health Day Summit is, ‘Unite for a Healthy Mind’. He stated that lack of mental well-being contributes significantly to the total disability and morbidity burden across the world. Productivity of human beings, whether in workforce or in family situations, gets reduced significantly if one has any mental disorder. Mental health disorders span a very wide range from simple disorders to very complex situations. It is often seen that simpler disorders, if not managed in time, tend to become more complex putting the patient at higher risk of morbidity. Such patients often become a bigger burden on the families. 

The President said that out of all the mental health disorders, depression is probably the most common. Depression affects people of all ages from all walks of life and in all countries. As per the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 conducted by NIMHANS, 5.2% of the Indian adult population suffers from depression in some form or the other. The problem of depression often gets ignored due to lack of understanding on the part of family members. The social stigma attached to a mental disorder, even if it is easily treatable, is also a major problem in India. However, people have now started talking about this issue leading to greater awareness in this respect. He pointed out that traditional Indian values along with our family system, can be good mechanisms to support those who suffer from mental health disorders. He urged medical practitioners to focus on the social support systems, spiritual beliefs and practices as well as the system of Yoga in their quest for providing well-being to all. 

The President said that there is a severe shortage of mental health professionals in India and this service gap can be bridged effectively by telemedicine. The World Health Day Summit has begun in the right direction by launching the eCAP & SOL’s Telepsychiatry application for the rural and urban population in need of mental health consultation. He urged all to strive to make even greater progress in the efforts to create awareness about depression and focus on further strengthening our health care delivery systems.

                I am indeed happy to be amidst you on the occasion of the First NIMCARE World Health Day - Global Summit. Celebrated on April 7 every year to mark the anniversary of the founding of the World Health Organization, the World Health Day provides a unique opportunity to mobilize action around a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world. The theme of the 2017 W.H.O. Day campaign is “Depression: Let’s Talk”. 

2. I am happy that NIMCARE has taken the lead in organizing this Conference on World Health Day. The slogan of the first NIMCARE World Health Day Summit is, ‘Unite for a Healthy Mind’. Some time ago, the entire world made a commitment in the form of Sustainable Development Goals in which mental health and well-being figure prominently. With these, we have committed ourselves to achieve quantified targets by 2030. Looking at the scale of the problem and limited time available, our task is indeed quite challenging. 

Ladies and gentlemen, 

3. Lack of mental well-being contributes significantly to the total disability and morbidity burden across the world. Productivity of human beings, whether in workforce or in family situations, gets reduced significantly if one has any mental disorder. Mental health disorders span a very wide range from simple disorders to very complex situations. It is often seen that simpler disorders, if not managed in time, tend to become more complex putting the patient at higher risk of morbidity. Such patients often become a bigger burden on the families. 

4. Out of all the mental health disorders, depression is probably the most common. Depression affects people of all ages from all walks of life and in all countries. As per the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 conducted by NIMHANS, 5.2% of the Indian adult population suffers from depression in some form or the other. The problem of depression often gets ignored due to lack of understanding on the part of family members. The social stigma attached to a mental disorder, even if it is easily treatable, is also a major problem in India. However, people have now started talking about this issue leading to greater awareness in this respect. I would like to point out that traditional Indian values along with our family system, can be good mechanisms to support those who suffer from mental health disorders. I would like to urge medical practitioners here to focus on the social support systems, spiritual beliefs and practices as well as the system of Yoga in their quest for providing well-being to all. 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

5. There is a severe shortage of mental health professionals in India and this service gap can be bridged effectively by telemedicine. The World Health Day Summit has begun in the right direction by launching the eCAP & SOL’s Telepsychiatry application for the rural and urban population in need of mental health consultation. I am happy to know that the International Society for Telemedicine and e-Health, USA has now recognized Telemedicine Society of India as the official National society presenting telemedicine activities in India. Telepsychiatry will help in reducing the mortality rate considerably, with the advent of mobile apps which are being developed. This will be of immense importance in giving consultation services to the unreached patients. 

6. I am particularly happy to have received the first copy of a CD on “Guidelines & Resource Materials for Telemedicine Centers of Armed Forces”. Telemedicine application in Armed Force’s health care delivery and the health monitoring of defence force personnel and their dependents is of paramount importance. With the introduction of new NODES for implementation of Telemedicine for the Army, accessibility to quality healthcare especially in hilly areas of the north east will be enriched. I have no doubt that, Telemedicine will play a very important role in saving the lives of our Army jawans and provide them advance updates on health related issues. Telemedicine is well suited for Armed Forces and will significantly improve the health care delivery system. 

Ladies and Gentleman:

7. I am glad that the organizers of this World Health Day Summit have planned strategic follow up conclaves in different cities of the world to create a broad framework for collective action. I appeal to all of you, to THINK GLOBALLY and ACT LOCALLY. I also urge all relevant stakeholders to come together in meeting the challenges of depression. 

8. I am indeed happy to have conferred the NIMCARE Life Time Achievement Award on Dr. N M Veeraiyan, Chancellor, Saveetha University, Chennai who has transformed Saveetha University into one of the leading universities in the country through his dedication, commitment and hard work. It is also my privilege to have presented the NIMCARE World Health Day Awards of Excellence to outstanding citizens of our nation in recognition of their outstanding services to the people. 

Ladies and Gentleman:

9. Before I conclude, I applaud the efforts of Dr Vijay G Prabhakar a renowned public health practitioner from Chicago, USA for taking this initiative to conduct the first NIMCARE World Health Summit here in India and also congratulate the co-host organisations who have united with NIMCARE to form a broad framework to create awareness about depression and combating it. I welcome the co-host organisations from overseas to this Summit. 

10. Let us strive to make even greater progress in our efforts to create awareness about depression and focus on further strengthening our health care delivery systems. I am confident that this NIMCARE World Health Day Summit will provide all of you an opportunity to get inspired, challenged and make meaningful partnerships for your continued growth. I hope all the participants here go back better equipped to handle mental health care situations that warrant urgent attention. Let us all unite for addressing the issue of mental health care and to prevent and combat depression. I wish you Godspeed and success in all your endeavours. 

Thank You. 

Jai Hind.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee congratulated the Parliament for making a new beginning in Financial Management through passage of Annual Budget by March 31, 2017. He was referring to the decision of the Government to club the Rail Budget with the General Budget. He said the Government also preponed the date of presenting the Budget from last working day of February to the First of February. All these are historic decisions. He stated that both the Finance and Appropriation Bills have been passed after scrutiny by the relevant Standing Committees, thus setting a benchmark in legislative history.

The President made the above remarks while addressing a group of probationers of IRAS, IRPS, IRSS and IRSE of the Indian Railway Services and Indian Postal Service who had called on the President today (April 5, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

The President said both the Railway and Postal Services are today facing the challenge of keeping pace with technological advancements. Over the last few decades, telegrams have ceased to exist. Emails have to a large extent replaced letters. To survive in this competitive world, one has to keep pace with the fast changing tools of Information and Communication Technology. The Railways is also facing the challenge of competition from cheap and fast airlines as well as improving their services.

The President said the Departments of Posts and Railways have been serving the country for more than 160 years. At the time of independence, there were 23,344 Post Offices, which were primarily in urban areas. Now India has more than 1.5 lakh post offices. On an average, a Post Office serves an area of 21.22 sq. km and a population of more than 8000 people. Similarly, Indian Railways has a network of more than 66,000 kilometers of rail lines; 10,000 locomotives; 68,000 passenger coaches; 2.5 lakh wagons and 13,000 passenger trains operating every day.

The President congratulated the probationers for successfully qualifying in the Civil Services Examination, which is considered one of the toughest competitive examinations of the world. He said it gave him satisfaction to note that despite having acquired high technical and academic qualifications, they have decided to join the Civil Service and serve the people of India. He said that life is full of challenges. He said that he had no doubt the young officers would face all challenges successfully and contribute to improving services in their respective sectors.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee laid the foundation stone of Rabindra Bhawan and Haj House today (April 2, 2017) in Ranchi, Jharkhand. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was happy to be present in Ranchi on the occasion of laying of foundation stone for the Rabindra Bhavan and Haj House. It is indeed a matter of pleasure that Gurudev and his family who left a long lasting impression in the state will be commemorated through the construction of Rabindra Bhavan. 

The President said that his association with Jharkhand, as indeed the entire Eastern region goes back many a decades with the neighbouring West Bengal being his home state. Indeed Bihar, undivided Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Assam were part of the same Bengal Presidency for a long period in the earlier part of the last century. The area has a shared past and heritage and its shaping in the post Independence era has also been similar. 

The President said that for our Muslim brethren a travel to Mecca for Haj is a life time dream. It is indeed commendable that the Government of Jharkhand has come up with the project of establishing a “Haj House” to facilitate Haj pilgrimage. He was sure that this will provide much needed relief to the pilgrims from the State and the area.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Jharkhand played a key role in India’s freedom struggle. The pain and sacrifices of Sidho Murmu, Kanho Murmu, Tilka Manjhi and Birsa Munda are always remembered. The state has made progress on many fronts since attaining statehood in 2000. Its rich deposits of mineral resources, forests and industrial infrastructure etc. have laid down the foundation for all-round development. 

The President said that he comes from Bengal.

The area has a shared past and heritage and its shaping in the post Independence era has also been similar. 

The President said that the problem of job creation cannot be solved unless people are imparted skills to increase their employability. India has a huge workforce and skill development can help in economic development of this vast country. 

The President said that he believes that initiatives launched today such as Deoghar - Basukinath Solar Street Light Project; Software Technology Parks of India Centre; Employees State Insurance Corporation Hospital and Driver's Training Centres will transform the employment landscape of this region.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that terrorism has become a pandemic and affects every society. He was addressing the Media onboard Air India One Special Aircraft while returning to India concluding five-day visit to Armenia and Poland, today. The Minister of State for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Shri Giriraj Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that both Armenia and Poland were very friendly countries and we were able to regenerate interest in mutual cooperation. Though Armenia is a small country, it has traditionally been very friendly to us, he added. 

Referring to Poland, the Vice President said that it is the biggest economy in Central Europe and we have an expanding trade with them. He further said that there are Indian investments in Poland and Polish investments in India and during the course of discussions, with both the Polish President and the Prime Minister, we were able to identify some specific areas where cooperation between these two countries is either starting or can start very soon. We were able to focus on three particular areas of interest; clean coal mining technology, agricultural products and techniques and defence cooperation, he added. 

The Vice President said that he had suggested to the Polish leadership for Poland to join the Make in India Programmes and instead of being a seller only, they could become an India based seller, which will give them a much additional advantages. He further said that the Polish side reacted very positively to the suggestion and there will be substantial progress in coming day when the Polish President visits India. All in all, the discussions were very focused and very positive and in both countries, the results have been satisfactory, he added. 

Reacting to a question on exploring potential with Armenian innovation and Indian efforts coming together for mutual benefit, the Vice President said that Armenian innovation is good and Indian effort is right in its place. We need to see where and what the innovation is and where it will fit in to our requirements, he added. 

On a question about the road ahead in our relationship with Poland, the Vice President said that Poland has done its own homework in identifying India's rising profile to become a major trading partner and a major political entity in its own right. He further said that the Poles have identified a few markets in Asia as priority markets and India is one of them. We both look forward and expect several initiatives in furthering this process, he added. 

Answering a question on adopting Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), the Vice President said that every country is facing the problem of terrorism in a lesser or greater degree and the problem is understood by everyone. He referred to the time when he was the permanent representative of India to UN in New York in 1994, when India had introduced a proposal on CCIT and it was struck because there was a difference in perception with regard to defining a terrorist. He further said that while making an international agreement, all kinds of legal problems come up and those who do not want this to make progress, come up with legal technicalities. It is an excuse on part of some countries to try to avoid committing themselves, he added. 

Reacting to a question on image of India in foreign countries, the Vice President said that India's image outside, or image within the country is on different planes and multiple images are a fact of life. He referred to India, through ISRO, sending Mars mission and launching satellites of several countries. He further said that a common man looks at our strengths in Information Technology and Indian IT professionals are present all over the world and as long as the picture is a faithful one, we have to take note what ISRO is doing, what IT is doing and what Indian scientific research is doing. Along with it, there is poverty, there is inequality, but despite all this is also the fact that we have been able, for seven decades, to run a democratic system on a monumental scale, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the solution to addressing the gaps and failings of democracy is indeed more democracy. He was delivering a lecture on 'Seven Decades of Indian Democracy' at the University of Warsaw, Poland, today. The Minister of State for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Shri Giriraj Singh, the Rector of the Warsaw University, Prof. Marcin Palsy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that the people of India are the best guarantee for our democratic future. As long as the ordinary Indian holds true the values of democracy and cultural practices of syncretism, as long as our people are resistant to usurpation of their rights and do not succumb to sectarian and communal thought, there remains great hope that our democracy will continue to thrive and inspire others, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:

 

""An Indian, with some awareness of the recent and not-so-recent past, comes to Warsaw with a deep sense of the vicissitudes of history. Having the misfortune of being located at geographic crossroads, Poland’s frontiers have waxed and waned over centuries, buffeted by the forces of regional history.

 

In early and mid 16th century, Poland was a large and powerful state, only to be visited by interventions and partitions by neighbouring empires. The subsequent Polish struggles for freedom, and restoration of democracy, is therefore admirable and a visitor from the world’s largest democracy cannot but salute the indomitable Polish spirit reflected in a Republic that has dedicated itself “for the common good of all its citizens” and is desirous of guaranteeing their rights “for all times”.

 

I am happy to be in this historic city and feel humbled by your invitation to address you. Given your own attachment to the concept, I propose to share with you some thoughts on our experiences with democracy and to shed light on its (a) principles, (b) mechanisms, and (c) challenges that have emerged from time to time.

 

Some three decades ago an eminent sociologist called Indian democracy ""a secular miracle of the modern world and a model for other developing countries"". Seven decades after independence, the miracle of Indian democracy continues to shine like a beacon of hope for those who cherish freedom with its foundations in basic human values.

 

India has long defied the proposition—held with near-canonical certitude by those who make their living studying comparative politics—that predicts unstable democratic politics at low levels of economic development, high levels of inequality and high levels of social diversity. To those who know India well, however, it was “hard to imagine that if India’s multicultural diversity was to be organized as an enduring single state, it could be organized as anything else but a democratic polity.”

 

It is a truism that each country and people shape their destiny in their own unique way, informed by their historical experience. In our case, it dates back to at least the fifth century BC. This long ‘argumentative tradition’ and toleration of heterodoxy has provided a fertile ground for the flourishing of our democracy.

 

In a contemporary sense, the democratic consciousness of independent India is a reflection of the legacy of our struggle for independence from colonial rule. Much of the gains of our National Movement are enshrined in our Constitution and continue to enlighten the political and judicial discourse in India. Our people have used this legacy as the yardstick to judge the subsequent performance of governments, political parties and institutions.

 

Our Constitution provides the framework for a bicameral parliamentary democracy in a quasi-federal framework. Its objective is an equitable society to be achieved through a socio-economic transformation using constitutional institutions and the principle of Rule of Law.

 

The Constitution granted Universal Adult Suffrage to all the citizens at a time when it was not even conceded in many older democracies. It proclaims a charter of rights and of duties. It enunciates certain directive principles for state policy to ensure social, economic and political justice for the people. It also delineates the legislative jurisdiction of the Union and State legislatures.

 

Thus, it is through the Constitution that ‘a diverse collection of individuals and groups became the people of a single book, one that reflects their commitment to protect their mutual rights and which articulates a collective identity.’

 

An eminent British political scientist of the last century put the Preamble of the Constitution of India on the first page of his last book published in August 1950 because, as he wrote, it stated ‘in a brief and pithy form the argument of much of the book.’ 

 

The Constitutional mechanisms have upheld and maintained the democratic form. Periodic elections, an independent Election Commission and an independent judiciary having sweeping powers of judicial review, has helped foster a culture of democracy.

 

The magnitude of the conduct of elections in India is a challenge to any institutional framework. The first general election was held in 1951 when the size of the electorate was 173 million. The 16th general election in 2014 saw a total electorate of 814.4 million, 66 per cent of whom cast their votes to elect 543 members to the Lower House of the Parliament from among 8251 candidates belonging to some 464 different political parties. The election was conducted through 930,000 voting centres and electronic voting machines. Over 6 million personnel were mobilized for various electoral duties. It has been rightly called the largest exercise in democracy ever.

 

Given our federal structure, periodic elections are held for State legislative assemblies, who also elect, through a prescribed procedure, members of Council of States of the Union Parliament. Both in Parliament and in State Assemblies, special representation is given to the historically under-privileged segments of society.

 

Mandatory representation was given to women in village councils and municipalities through Constitutional amendments in 1992. A similar step in State Assemblies, and in Union Parliament, is yet to be taken.

 

Measured against universally accepted norms and practices, Indian democracy has been a success and the democratic consciousness has seeped into the psyche of our public.

 

All democracies contain within them tensions between societal constraints and individual liberties, imperatives of state security and citizen’s freedom, as well as between the divergent political, social and economic approaches. In our case social justice, acceptance and implementation of diversity, and prevention and correctives to social discord, remain perennial challenges.

 

India is a plural society of immense diversity with different social, religious, cultural and linguistic expressions. It has almost as many ethnic groups as the entire African continent. The Constitution recognises 22 languages and over a hundred dialects. The value of currency units is written in 17 different scripts. Adherents of all major religions of the world are present in our citizen body. Religious minorities constitute 19.4 percent of our people.

 

Containment of social discord remains a recurring challenge. All segments of our society, regardless of faith, are stratified in socio-economic categories with deep roots in the past. In such diversity - regional, social, linguistic and religious - tensions are unavoidable, and at times they escalate into conflict. These are often local and transitory and the same allegedly democratic process that generates them also helps resolution in good measure. Public awareness, avoidance of extremist postures, and prompt corrective action by the administration assists the process; absence of these, for whatever reason, aggravates them and cause damage to the social fabric.

 

Democracy in India has taken equality and social inclusion as one of its objectives. Institutions of democracy have served as a medium by which communities and peoples have come to assert their dignity and demand social and economic equality.

 

Democracy has also been a harbinger of social empowerment. As a result of the system of institutionalized open political competition, the historically marginalized segments have been mobilized to challenge the societal status-quo. This mobilization has resulted in a substantive deepening of Indian democracy.

 

There has also been a spatial expansion of democracy in India. A federal political structure process, both at independence and more recently in the passing of the Seventy-Third Constitutional Amendment, has helped ensure the accommodation of regional aspirations. After this Amendment, democratic institutions at grass-roots, or what we call the Panchayati Raj Institutions, have been energised. They have led to decentralised planning, and have created “new arenas for the people to negotiate with the furniture of Government”.

 

Our democratic framework has provided the required space for associative activism, and in a benevolent cycle, the development of civil society has also contributed to India’s democratic deepening and invigorated a norm of vibrant civic engagement with the state. Two of the most liberal and empowering pieces of legislation that India has adopted in recent times -  giving the citizens the Right to Information and the Right to free basic education - were both spearheaded by the civil society organizations in India.

 

Operation of democracy also ensures that we have financial inclusion schemes, and are universalising education, social health and insurance programs. We are modernizing our agriculture, manufacturing and services and are trying to adopt digital transactions. Our human development index, modest as yet, is rising and in some more developed regions like Kerala, approximates those of developed nations.

 

New economic policies, including the liberalization programme, were fostered in a democratic and deliberative environment.  India is now getting used to its much higher rate of growth. It is noteworthy that India’s principal success has come not in traditional areas of exports but largely on newer industries, with a large component of high-tech, such as the information technology industry, which has rapidly grown to be a giant from a very modest beginning.

 

Another such area is that of pharmaceuticals, where Indian ingenuity has brought huge reductions–sometimes a cut of 80 per cent or so in the price for many essential drugs, like AIDS medicines. Such growth has allowed us to lift millions of Indians out of abject poverty and to offer them a better quality of life.

 

India’s GDP now is almost US $ 2.4 trillion from just about $ 273 billion in 1991, an increase of almost nine times. Our per capita income, in the same period, increased almost 15 times in terms of current and 12 times in constant prices. The growing Indian middle class is now a market of global significance. Despite the general global slowdown, the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects 2017 Report projects that Indian economy will grow by 7.7 per cent in 2017 and 7.6 per cent in 2018, benefiting from strong private consumption, making it the fastest growing large economy in the world.

 

While the net effect of economic growth has been an improvement in the quality of life of an average Indian citizen, these benefits have been unevenly distributed. And yet, it is a testament to the democratic deepening in India that the losers from market-led reforms have not challenged the democratic system itself.

 

Well before India proceeded on its democratic journey, our founding fathers had understood that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. A democratic India, therefore, stood in solidarity with the people of Africa and other Asian countries who were struggling to take charge of their own destiny by overthrowing the chains of colonial power. India remained a strong partner as they sought independence and self-sufficiency.

 

India sees democratic and peaceful means not only as means to resolve the differences within countries, but also supports the democratisation of international relations and global governance. The largest challenges that face humanity today, be it the impact of climate change or the rising tide of extremism and terrorism, require cooperation and collaboration between all nations of the world for their resolution.

 

In India, the “many discontents are manageable precisely because there is a democratic framework”. For the last 70 years we have worked democracy to the best of our capacity, not yet to the best of our ability. It is a receding horizon. Operating a democracy is always work in progress. Despite the success of democracy in India there still remain a number of challenges to deepening and consolidation of democracy.

 

Democracy is a self-correcting and self-improving mechanism. The solution to addressing the gaps and failings of democracy is indeed more democracy. It is when democracy stops working, when conflicts are not peacefully resolved that violent separatist movements and religious conflicts emerge. It is when the system is not inclusive and people do not have the chance to express their demands; when their rights are trampled and pluralism is suffocated, that they look for other alternatives for advancing their interests.

 

A majority, no matter how overwhelming, does not invalidate opposition.  The one crucial test of a true democracy is how it protects and respects the rights of minorities, be they religious, or political, especially in face of populist currents. A democracy only flourishes when divergent voices can be freely heard without fear of an official or populist backlash.

 

Democracy, in the end, is about people. The people of India, the masses, are the best guarantee for our democratic future. As long as the ordinary Indian holds true the values of democracy and cultural practices of syncretism, as long as our people are resistant to usurpation of their rights and do not succumb to sectarian and communal thought, there remains great hope that our democracy will continue to thrive and inspire others.

 

Thank You.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that Polish business looks for markets and business opportunities beyond Europe, India is a natural destination. He was addressing the Business Summit at the Ministry of Economic Development, Poland, today. The Prime Minister of Poland, Ms. Beata Szydło, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Development and Finance, Mr. Jerzy Kwiecinski, the Minister of State for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Shri Giriraj Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that India’s 29 states now offer a climate of both cooperative and competitive federalism, with quantum improvements in investment conditions in different Indian states. The new policy initiatives taken by the Union government, such as Make in India, Skill India and Digital India schemes, present new business opportunities for Polish companies in areas such as defence, food processing, coal and mining, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, bio-technology and renewable energy.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to have this opportunity to address this business summit, which is aimed at furthering economic cooperation between India and Poland. India sees Poland as an important emerging economic partner, not just in Europe but in the world. Poland’s transformation over the last two decades has been remarkable; the growth of its economy impressive. This change is visible all around us.

 

Today, Poland is India’s largest economic partner in Central Europe with bilateral trade that has grown to US $ 2.8 billion in 2016. I understand that this marked a growth of nearly 25% over the level of trade in the previous year. Investments are growing rapidly in both directions. This strong economic interaction between India and Poland is an indicator of the growing economic strengths of our countries. As Polish business looks for markets and business opportunities beyond Europe, India is a natural destination.

 

With a growth rate of over 7%, despite the general global downturn, India today is not just the fastest growing major economy in the world, it is also one of the most open and welcoming destination for investments and technologies. A vibrant democracy of 1.3 billion people with a young, skilled workforce, India offers an aspirational middle class market of over 400 million people. The constant reforms in fiscal and investment facilitation policies are transforming the economic scenario in India. A landmark Goods and Services Tax reform, for instance, is aimed at making India a unified market, with all 29 states offering an identical and predictable tax environment. Increasing transparency and a liberalised investment climate now allows the smooth flow of FDI in sectors like defence, railways, civil aviation and pharmaceuticals. We have seen a strong global confidence in the India story, with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments, which reached over US $ 50 billion in 2016.

 

India’s 29 states now offer a climate of both cooperative and competitive federalism, with quantum improvements in investment conditions in different Indian states. Some Polish regions are already availing of the business opportunities that Indian states offer. The new policy initiatives taken by the Union government, such as Make in India, Skill India and Digital India schemes,  present new business opportunities for Polish companies in areas such as defence, food processing, coal and mining, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, bio-technology and renewable energy.

 

Cooperation in the education sector can become an important area of cooperation for us. India’s young are eager to seek educational opportunities that Poland offers. We already have some 2500 Indian students in Poland. These students add to the resources of Poland’s distinguished universities and will act as bridgeheads for our future engagements.

 

I understand that the delegation led by the Deputy Prime Minister, His Excellency Prof. Piotr Glinski that visited India in January for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit, had useful interactions with our political leadership and our business community. We have identified possible opportunities in sectors like food processing, mining, aerospace and defence. I am sure that the genius of our businessmen, on both sides, with their sense of adventure and innovation, will result in a many more mutually beneficial ventures. I wish this business summit all success.

 

Thank You.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the countries that have invested in educating their populations, built strong consumer economies, and have democratic institutions that can deal with social change will benefit. He was delivering the Lecture at the Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia today. The Minister of Education and Science, Armenia, Mr. Levon Mkrtchyan, the Vice-Rector of Yerevan State University, Mr. Gegham Gevorgyan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that some of the newer technologies that would impact on human progress relate to energy, cyber technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, gene-editing and space exploration. All of these have geopolitical implications in the future, he added.

In recognition of his outstanding public and political achievements and his contribution to development of India-Armenia relations, the Vice President was awarded with a degree of Honorary Doctor of the Yerevan State University.

Following is the text of Vice President's Lecture:

"" I am happy to be in this enchanting city and grateful to the Rector and the faculty of the Yerevan State University for inviting me today.
I have come to a land some distance from India but not far from the individual and collective memory of Indians. I myself was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), and spent many years in the city. Amongst its historic features are Armenian churches and other signs of its Armenian inhabitants.   Father Michael Chamich’s History of Armenia was translated and published in Calcutta in 1827. More recently, historians like Mesrovb Jacob Seth and George Bournoutian have recorded the Armenian contribution in India to trade and commerce as to various cultural and charitable activities.

Less known but nevertheless a part of spiritual history of my land is the personality of Armenian descent known in medieval chronicles as Sarmad, a mystic of who travelled from somewhere in this region to India, led an unconventional life and was executed for blasphemy in 1660 because he espoused a creed that distinguished between states of ‘negation and affirmation’. One of the leaders of our freedom movement and a close aide of Mahatma Gandhi, Abul Kalam Azad, was deeply influenced by Sarmad’s free thinking and humanitarianism.

It is thus evident that well before modern times; the flow of people, trade and ideas was not an unusual occurrence. My purpose today, however, is to talk about the future, not the past.

The older generation in this audience knows and the younger ones have been told that the 20th century was a period of organized insanity characterized by metamyths and megadeaths. These led an eminent historian to conclude that ‘our world risks both explosion and implosion;’ hence ‘it must change’.

The expectation that the changes in the last decade of the century would bring forth a more harmonious world in which international cooperation in solving international problems would be addressed by peaceful means in conformity with the principles of justice and international law did not materialize. On the contrary, older patterns of thought and practice persisted and, aided by newer technologies, resulted in explosions as well as implosions in different parts of our world. The promise of globalization also showed its limitations; the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated, in the words of one analyst, a ‘systemic vulnerability to unregulated greed.’ Both, in the final analysis, exhibited failures of governance at national and global levels.

Nor was the crisis limited to matters strategic and financial. Climatic catastrophes and pandemics demonstrated the vulnerability of human existence to forces beyond its control despite the immensity of scientific advances.

The conclusion is unavoidable that individuals, societies, and the global community as a collective, need to re-think the parameters of their future. In this endeavour, the first step necessarily is to identify the likely challenges; the next is to assess the impact that scientific and technological advancement would have in resolving them; and the third would be to assess their impact on our lives and patterns of behavior. Our focus has to be on the possible and the probable; however, the possibility cannot be excluded of delving into the preferable and the undesirable.

I hasten to add that there is nothing unique about such speculative ventures. All through recorded history, the human mind has sought to visualize both utopias and doomsday scenarios. I am nevertheless emboldened to venture down this path today in the presence of a youthful audience eager to dream of a better world.      
                                                   
A general categorization of challenges to our world of today is premised on a normal desire to live, live well, live in peace, live without human or natural threats. The devil, as always, is in details. The right to live, universally conceded as a basic human right, implies the right to breathe, to food and water, to health. These, together, necessitate sustainable development and the need to address the totality of challenges of climate change. Alongside are the problems of population, disease, energy and resources.

Supplementary to these, but inseparable from them, are all the requirements that humankind, by virtue of being both social and political creatures, need for living in society, be it local, national or global and the growing realization that these challenges transcend national boundaries and can only be addressed through global cooperation in which burden sharing is equitable. Consequently, the old doctrines and dogmas of national decision-making, and state sovereignty stand abridged in good measure.

These emerging imperatives have two-fold implications: technological and socio-political.

Today, more than ever before, there is a general realization in all societies that solutions have to be sought through science and technology. The prospects are fascinating in some respects, disturbing in others.

Some of the newer technologies that would impact on human progress relate to energy, cyber technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, gene-editing and space exploration. All of these have geopolitical implications in the future.

Allow me to dilate on the implications of some of these.

Human civilization, as it has developed, is energy-centric and newer technologies would increase our demands of energy. The 20th century was the century of hydrocarbons. Towards the end of the century it was realized that hydrocarbon resources were finite and this had political implications in terms of global tussles.

The big shock to the energy industry came with ‘fracking’, a new set of techniques and technologies for extracting more hydrocarbons from the ground. Though there are concerns about environmental damage, these increased the outputs of oil and gas, caused the usurpation of old-line coal-fired power plants, and dramatically reduced dependence of some countries on foreign oil. 

Scientists also came forth with other sources, principally nuclear. It has its benefits and challenges.
The demand for clean energy is growing. Solar and wind are now advancing on an exponential curves. Every two years, for example, solar installation rates are doubling, and photovoltaic-module costs are falling by about 20 percent. Even without the subsidies that governments are phasing out, present costs of solar installations will, by 2022, halve, reducing returns on investments, to less than four years. By 2030, solar power will be able to provide 100 percent of today’s energy needs; by 2035, it will seem almost free — just as cell-phone calls are today.
A tantalizing prospect emerged when men of science looked beyond the planet Earth. Many years ago Soviet astronomer Nokolai Kardashev propounded the theory of stages of civilization in terms of sources of energy and categorized the present, based on fossil sources, as sub-zero type, to be followed by Type I that would harness power of an entire planet, Type II from a star and Type III from a galaxy.   
As futurist Ray Kurzweil says, when an exponential technology is at one percent, you are halfway to 100 percent, and that is where solar and wind energies are now. Another surge of growth would spell the imminent extinction of the fossil-fuel industry, and with it the geo-strategic significance that hydrocarbon rich states have enjoyed. This will have a cascading impact on the regional security architectures in many parts of the world as well as pan-global ramifications.
Cyber technology has overwhelmed us and its impact on every level of human organization is evident. It is not threatening in itself but most societies are already beginning to cope with threats emanating from it. The very benefits of its use in social, financial, industrial and military sectors have, as one strategic thinker has observed, ‘revolutionized vulnerabilities.’ 

Robotics and digital manufacturing are no longer on distant horizon and have implications for countries and economies. The outsourced world manufacturing to Asia, which fuelled the economic revival in Asia and created massive demands for energy and other material resources, will likely diminish as robotic factories and other disruptive manufacturing techniques like 3-D printing become cheaper and widely available.  Foxconn has already announced that it would replace most of its workers with robots. A newer generation of robots such as ABB’s Yumi and Rethink Robotics’ Sawyer are dexterous enough to thread a needle and cost as much as a car does. Robots are also uniformly productive irrespective of geography. As manufacturing centres will shift closer to consumption centres, the geostrategic significance of trade routes and demand for transportation will also diminish.

These changes can create long term downward wage pressure on the present day manufacturing led economies.  It will also drive down commodity and energy prices, and could result in destabilization of some economies. This can have a cascading effect, as strong, global deflationary force will impact all economies. Some governments may attempt to impose reactionary Protectionism. They may increase human wages which in the end may just increase the rate at which cheaper machines permanently replace human workers.

Technological developments will have a deep impact on the socio-economic structure of society. Greater automation can free a larger number of people from the drudgery of repetitive tasks, providing more leisure. Introduction of measures like universal basic income and taxation of machines may demand a very different fiscal mechanism from that what we have today. On a positive note, greater leisure time can open the possibility of a larger number of people taking to creative pursuits, searching for new knowledge and to the deepening of our understanding of the universe. On the other hand, more leisure can also lead to greater hedonism and pursuit of more selfish goals. To ensure that humanity treads the path of positive, we may require a universal set of values and belief system.
The geopolitical implications of these changes are far reaching. The US economy will reinvent itself just as does every 30-40 years; it is, after all, leading the technology boom. Yet, others are not far behind. The Economist magazine indicated last month that in the field of quantum computing and quantum cryptography, the list of patent pending applications is headed by China, not the United Sates. Economic historians have also drawn attention to the fact that in the span of world history, the distinction between industrialized and developing countries, or rich and poor countries, is relatively recent. It is not a constant and has been changing in recent decades.  
Technology and its applications is one aspect of the matter; the human response to it is another. This galloping new world has already demonstrated that traditional frontiers of thought and action are no longer sacrosanct. At the same time, it is evident that the impact of new techniques and technologies would not be uniform in all societies since they are at different levels of development and do not have equal capacities of absorption.

How then do these societies and their state structures respond to them?

It is evident that countries that have invested in educating their populations, built strong consumer economies, and have democratic institutions that can deal with social change will benefit — because their people will have had their basic needs met and can figure out how to take advantage of the advances in technology.

At the same time, domestic correctives would be most productive if they are accompanied by a genuinely reformed world that is global, structural and juridical, an order that transcends the perspective and requirements of any one region or nation. Only then would actions of countries be harmonized in the attainment of common ends.

It is a distant horizon towards which we must continue to walk. As young people, you have the will and capacity to do so, for your own good and for humanity at large.

Thank You.""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the objective of his visit to Armenia and Poland is to further the friendship and cooperation. He was addressing the Media onboard Air India One Special Aircraft on his way to Armenia, today. The Minister of State for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Shri Giriraj Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Armenia has old cultural links with India. He further said that it is a friendly country to India and India helped them in capacity building. The Armenian community in Kolkata had strong cultural presence, including the famous Armenian Church, he added. He further said that his visit would build on the excellent political relations and good-will the two countries shared. 

The Vice President said that Poland is a strong trading partner for India in Central Europe and many Indian companies have a presence there and have made substantive investments. He further said that Poland has some useful technology, including in areas such s clean coal and India is keen to work with them. Poland is an important member of NATO and they have been politically supportive of India in forums like NSG, he added. 

Reacting to a question on bilateral trade with Armenia, the Vice President said that the geographic location and small market size in Armenia limits the size of our bilateral trade. Armenians are known for their trading acumen and are culturally very advanced. India has supported Armenia in the field of Information Technology, he added. 

In reply to a question on enhancing economic ties with Poland, the Vice President said that India-Poland trade has been growing and given the potential, it could be expanded further. He further said that some core areas including coal technology and agriculture had been identified. There is much possibility and our business community is showing a lot of interest in Poland, he added. 

On a question on Poland's support for India's membership in expanded UN Security Council, the Vice President said that while the rules are being reworked and Poland has been supportive of India, even under the old rules. 

On a question about India's defence ties with Poland, the Vice President said that with Poland we have specific areas of defence cooperation and two sides are working to expand the ties.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that given the dynamic nature of the industry requirements, our policies would need constant revision to keep them relevant and effective for skilling our people at scale with speed and quality. He was addressing the National Conference on ‘Skilling India for Global Competiveness’ organized by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industries, here today.

 

The Vice President said that the key to reaping our demographic dividend would be in adequately skilling our people. If we are able to provide quality skills to our people, we can make India into a human resources powerhouse of the world, he added.

 

The Vice President listed three major challenges before us in the task of providing adequate skill building opportunities for our people; Quality, Numbers and Perception. He further said that in all our endeavours, quality needs to be central, whether it is our primary schools or institutions of higher learning. To become, and remain competitive, we need not just skills for our requirements today, but skills of tomorrow, he added.

 

The Vice President said that skilled workers are required to successfully implement the Government initiatives such as digital India, Swachh Bharat, Make in India and Smart Cities, etc., as only skilled workers can make the most of opportunities being created by such schemes. The launch of new initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna (PMKVY) and the very ambitious 'Skill India' initiative, that aims to train about 30 crore people by the year 2020, are much needed efforts, he added.

 

Following is the Text of Vice President’s address:

 

“By 2020, almost 60 percent of India’s population of 1.3 billion will be in the working age group of 15-59 years. Of these, 144 million will be in the 18-23 age bracket. It is also predicted that the ageing in developed would create a shortfall of some 56 million workers by the year 2030.

 

The key to reaping our demographic dividend would be in adequately skilling our people. We need to bear in mind that presently, only 2.3% of the Indian workforce has undergone formal skill training, as compared to 68% in UK and 52% in the US.

 

If we are able to provide quality skills to our people, we can make India into a human resources powerhouse of the world, if we fail in this task, then we are looking at unprecedented high rates of unemployment, and a host of attendant problems.

 

I see three major challenges before us in the task of providing adequate skill building opportunities for our people.

 

First, is the challenge of quality.

 

It is said that “the society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.”

 

We need to promote excellence in all spheres of our lives if India is to be a global leader and play a pivotal role in the world affairs and economy. In all our endeavours, quality needs to be central, whether it is our primary schools or institutions of higher learning. A substandard primary phase later metastasises into a stream of graduates who do not have the required talent levels and skill sets. So even before we focus on enhancing our capacities and quality in vocational training or higher education, we need to ensure that our primary education system is robust and imparts quality education.

 

Second, is the challenge of numbers.

 

Even as the number of people seeking skills has increased exponentially, we are looking at increasingly inadequate numbers of trainers. In an answer to the Lok Sabha on February 24, 2016, the Government had informed that there is a shortage of 100,000 trainers to implement skill-development programmes across the country. Such shortages create bottlenecks for dispersal of skills.

 

In addition, the required skill sets are very dynamic, as the nature of industry and manufacturing- as well as the demands of the services sector change. In face of increasing automation, that may render several employment streams irrelevant, there is a requirement for re-skilling our works, in addition to training new workers on new and emerging skill sets. This renders the skill-sets of the trainers obsolete, unless the trainers keep re-orienting themselves. To become, and remain competitive, we need not just skills for our requirements today, but skills of tomorrow.

 

The third challenge is of perception.

 

The general perception of our people about vocational training continues to be low.  Gaining a vocational skill is still seen as a means of last resort or a choice of those who have not been able to progress in the formal academic system. This mental block exacerbates the gap between what the industry requires and what is currently available.

 

A society needs a broad spectrum of skills. It needs engineers, scientists, and doctors as much as it needs the sanitation workers or plumbers or electricians. We need to groom a reservoir of young talent that is well educated and equipped with the latest breakthroughs in knowledge. But, we also need to equip millions who still fall outside the pale of formal higher education. We have to provide avenues to engage them productively by skilling them appropriately. It is, therefore, important to educate our youth on the dignity of labour, and to align the vocation seeker’s aspirations with industry expectations, both on the wages as well as the work profile.

 

Skilled workers are required to successfully implement the Government initiatives such as digital India, Swachh Bharat, Make in India and Smart Cities, etc., as only skilled workers can make the most of opportunities being created by such schemes. We also need to convince employers to hire the skilled force rather than look for cheaper, unskilled or poorly skilled resources, this when the primary challenge faced by over 75 percent of Indian businesses is the shortage of technical or specific skills.  Our approach should be aimed at bridging the skill gaps and addressing the problem of unemployability of our youth.

 

The Government of India is conscious of the need to impart skill training to our people. Prime Minister Modi, in his address to the nation from Red Fort on 15th August 2014, had said that “skilling is building a better India. If we have to move India towards development, then skill development should be our mission.”

 

Initiatives like formation of sector skill councils and formulation of the national skills qualification frameworks, among others, came about between 2009 and 2014. The National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 2015 takes those initiatives forward.  The launch of new initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna (PMKVY) and the very ambitious 'Skill India' initiative, that aims to train about 30 crore people by the year 2020, are much needed efforts. These initiatives would, however, need an inclusive approach to succeed, with special focus on the 800 million or so citizens who remain at the bottom of the pyramid.

 

Given the dynamic nature of the industry requirements, our policies would need constant revision to keep them relevant and effective for skilling our people at scale with speed and quality.

 

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been proactive in promoting skill development infrastructure in the country to address the skill-gaps. It has worked at the grass-root level, and leveraging its strong national and international linkages, has played an important advocacy role in this direction.

 

The present seminar is a positive step on the path of skilling India. I wish you successful deliberation.

 

Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that educating our youth about the value of our pluralistic heritage is the best way to ensure that our heritage is preserved. He was addressing an event to mark the celebration of World Heritage Day, organized by the Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development, here today. The former Chief Minister of Delhi, Smt. Sheila Dikshit and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that Indian culture is distinguished from others in respect of its continuity and heterogeneity, its accommodating ethos and its composite, plural character. He further said that India has played host to cultural streams from different parts of the world. In the course of time they were assimilated and adapted to life in India, he added.

 

The Vice President said that few people celebrate diversity and plurality the way India does and despite this diversity, people in India have lived in harmony for centuries and will continue to do so. He further said that the diversity of Indian cultural landscape is a result of not just toleration of newer and different elements, but of its acceptance. There may be reason to believe that the current tide of globalization would not submerge the Indian cultural identity but would add an Indian dimension to a globalizing culture, he added.

 

Following is the Text of Vice President’s address:

 

“Culture is more than just song and dance or architecture. It is the cumulative deposit of knowledge, experience, beliefs, values, attitudes, meanings, hierarchies, religion, notions of time, roles, spatial relations, concepts of the universe, and material objects and possessions acquired by a group of people in the course of generations through individual and group striving.

 

Cultures cannot be separated from the societies in which they emerge, develop and, at times, decline and are subsumed by other cultures or fade away altogether. Cultural boundaries are diffuse but the term “tradition” or “culture” can easily lend itself to idea of a single society and its temporal, linear extant. Tradition, and culture, linked as they are to the idea of identity can also be construed to denote exclusivity, which can be troublesome.

 

Every culture evolves certain unique features of its own which, in their entirety and inter-relatedness, constitute its dominant configuration and differentiate it from other cultures. Indian culture is distinguished from others in respect of its continuity and heterogeneity, its accommodating ethos and its composite, plural character.

 

India has played host to cultural streams from different parts of the world. In the course of time they were assimilated and adapted to life in India. The process of adaptation and interaction among the various groups brought about, on the one hand, India’s characteristic diversity and, on the other, our composite cultural tradition.

 

The development of our multi-coloured cultural tapestry was succinctly summed up by the poet Raghupati Rai Firaq:

 

Sar zamin-e- Hind par aqwam-e-alam ke Firaq

Karwaan aate gaye Hindostan banta gaya.

 

Almost a century ago, Dr. Tara Chand had observed that;

 

“Indian culture is synthetic in character. It comprehends ideas of different orders. It embraces in its orbit beliefs, customs, rites, institutions, arts, religions and philosophies belonging to strata of society in different stages of development. It eternally seeks to find a unity for the heterogeneous elements which make up its totality. At worst its attempts end in mechanical juxtaposition, at best they succeed in evolving an organic system.”

 

Few people celebrate diversity and plurality the way India does. All the religions in the world are equally revered here, and linguistic and cultural diversity of our country is unparalleled. Despite this diversity, people in India have lived in harmony for centuries and will continue to do so.

 

As the great litterateur Rabindranath Tagore said,

 

“In spite of our great difficulty, however, India has done something. She has tried to make an adjustment of races, to acknowledge the real differences between them where these exist, and yet seek for some basis of unity.”

 

The unity of India is often assumed and taken for granted; it is seldom subjected to a critical examination in a diachronic framework. This is perhaps because the sense of unity which pervades the fabric of Indian society is intangible. Yet it is alive inside every Indian and follows from the day to day living in a composite and divergent milieu.

 

Our society has, for centuries, provided a unique social and intellectual environment in which many distinct cultural streams have not only co-existed peacefully but have also enriched each other. The Indian approach to cultural change has been one of seamless accommodation. The diversity of Indian cultural landscape is a result of not just toleration of newer and different elements, but of its acceptance.

 

This is to be witnessed in all aspects of our daily life. There may be reason to believe, therefore, that the current tide of globalization would not submerge the Indian cultural identity but would add an Indian dimension to a globalizing culture.

 

Our right to enjoy the cultural artifacts, and to participate in the cultural life of the community, is reflected in UN’s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This prohibits illicit trafficking of artefacts and cultural objects; pillaging of archaeological sites; and destruction of historical buildings and monuments since it cause irreparable damage to the cultural heritage of a community. These principles have been amplified in UNESCO’s various international conventions on the protection of cultural heritage. In our Constitution, Article 49 provides the Directive to the State to protect monuments and objects of artistic and historic interest from spoliation and destruction. In addition, Article 51 A (f) makes it a duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.

 

Laws and regulations can provide the framework for our action, but educating our youth about the value of our pluralistic heritage is perhaps the best way to ensure that our heritage is preserved. I commend the Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development for their initiative in preserving our cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, in the rural areas, including by educating youth and generating awareness about the issue. I wish them success in their future endeavors and wish you all a very happy World Heritage Day.

 

Jai Hind.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has delivered the first Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah Memorial Lecture of the Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU), Hyderabad today. The Governor of Telangana, Shri E. S. L. Narasimhan, the Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali, the Vice Chancellor of MANUU, Dr. Mohammad Aslam Parvaiz and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

Following is the Text of Vice President’s Lecture:

 

“The Regional Legacy of a Rich History

 

Aasma baare amanat na twanast kasheed

Qurra-e-faal ba nam-e man-e-diwana zadand

 

I deem it a privilege to be asked to deliver the first Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah Memorial Lecture of the Maulana Azad National Urdu University. I thank the Vice Chancellor, Professor Aslam Pervaiz for inviting me today.

 

There could not have been a more appropriate venue. Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah was the founder of this city designed to be ‘a replica of the paradise itself.’ An early 17th century English traveler praised it ‘for its sweetness of air, convenience of water and fertility of soil’ and ranked it higher than any in the realm of the Moghul emperor or other princes.

 

One other reason should make the subject inseparable from the venue. Dakhani Urdu has its own pedigree and was the court language of Bijapur and Golkonda kingdoms. Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah composed verses, on his own admission, every day ‘just like waves in a rippling river’ and is credited as being the first person to have compiled a diwan. He was the first translator of Hafiz and his efforts ‘led to the birth of a Persian poetic style and usage in the Dabistan-e-Golkonda.’

 

History records that he was epicurean by disposition with ‘amorous propensities’ and this is amply reflected in his poetry. ‘A contemporary of Tulsidas, Mirabai and surdas, his poetry is bound to earth and revels in the universality of love and mystic experiences.’ It ‘is intensely Indian and secular in its moods.’ The seventeenth century historian Mohammad Qasim Ferishta depicted his temperament as ‘forgiving and gentle.’

 

Work on the construction of Hyderabad commenced in 1590-91. One couplet of the founder of Hyderabad expressed his wish for the new city:

 

Mora shehr logaan se mamoor kar

Rakhyan jun tun darya main min ya samei

 

Whatever be veracity of the impulse leading to the building of the new city, a poet of our times did sum up the popular sentiment relating to it:

 

Sheher baqi hai, muhabbat ka nishan baqi hai

Tu nahin hai teri chashm-e-nigaran baqi hai.

 

Hyderabadis like ancient Athenians, look upon their city and fall in love with it. Much has been written about its charms. Professor Agha Haider Hasan Mirza’s collection of essays Hyderabad ki Sair bears witness to it; so does Allama Aijaz Farrukh’s Hyderabad: Shehr-e-Nigaran. Sibte Hasan referred to it as the place ‘where my consciousness became aware of the beauty of life and where I learnt to love human beings.’  Narendra Luther has dwelt upon the history of the city, Vasant Bawa on the last phase of the old order and Syeda Imam has put together 38 writing by admirers of different generations and in different walks of life.

 

It is important to consider the context of the times and the place in history of the Qutbshahi dynasty that lasted a mere 164 years - from 1523 to 1687, when its last incumbent, Abu`l Hasan, surrendered to a Moghul general. In this short span, it witnessed a blossoming of architecture, poetry, music, art, dance and cuisine and became a byword for culture apart from being a vibrant centre of international trade.

 

An existential reality of the Indian landmass for three centuries in the medieval period of our history was the preponderance of a central power based in north India. Writing about the Moghul emperor Akbar’s approach to the Deccan, a biographer observed that ‘Akbar hovered like an eagle over the northern horizon and watched the fighting cocks of the southern states, rending and wearing each other until his own time should come to pray on them.’ As a result, in the words of another historian, ‘the Deccan has no master narrative of its own (but) it did have intense interaction with the peoples, cultures, and states of northern India which did during our period become a sort of alter-ego for societies south of the Narbada. Individuals, communities, and whole states defined their identity with respect to this colossus of the north, sometimes in opposition to it and sometime in imitation of it.’ These independent or quasi-independent entities survived the imperial onslaught for varying periods by acknowledging some form of suzerainty. In the process, they developed their own style of governance. They ‘detached religion from statecraft’ and culture from territorial boundaries and thereby gave themselves ‘an enormously elastic and transnational character.’

 

Nor is the role of the mystics in forging ties between different segments of society to be ignored. This led to eventual reconciliation of religions and culture.

 

Two aspects of the statecraft of the Deccan states can be discerned and are worthy of mention. The first was the philosophy of governance and the necessity of a pragmatic approach towards the subjects of the state. The second pertained to the geopolitical considerations that confronted them in relation to the dominant power in the Indian sub-continent.

 

The Qutb-shahis were of Iranian origin and had strong religious affiliations arising from of their relationship with Iran particularly after the year 1501 when Shah Ismail resorted to strident sectarianism. Notwithstanding this, their approach to governance was pragmatic and secular. Writing about the administrative system in the reign of Ibrahim, father of Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah, the historian Haroon Khan Sherwani has noted that ‘very little differentiation was made between the Hindus and the Muslims so far as the affairs of the state were concerned.’ This was also the case in Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah’s period when ‘a characteristic of the epoch was a spirit of camaraderie which existed between the Hindu and the Muslim sections of the population’ and ‘the whole policy of the Government seems to have been that of equality of opportunity for both the Hindus and the Muslims for practically all the officers of the state.’ His court, continues the same historian, ‘represented the culture of the Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and while he seems prejudiced in his enunciation of the inferiority of the non-Shi`ah sects of the Muslims he is culturally at one with the Hindus and the Parsis as well as the man in the street so far as his appreciation of their way of life is concerned.’ As a result, ‘the whole outlook of the state as centered in the person of the Sultan was non-communal.’

 

Another aspect of this catholicity of approach was the Sultan’s approach to Telugu. His father, who spent seven years as an honoured guest in Vijayanagar, imbibed a passion for the language and the same was the case with Mohammad Quli to whom Telugu was ‘like a mother tongue’ and who used Telugu words in his Dakhni-Urdu poems, offered patronage to its literary personages and whose firmans and official announcements were bilingual.

 

The Sultan thus made ‘a deliberate attempt to synthesize cultures in the Deccan imbibing in the people of Hyderabad a relish of tolerance, love of spectacle, and mildness of nature.’ It is not altogether accidental that one of his successors became a patron of the kuchipudi dance form.

 

Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah occupies a place in our history and his personality and contributions are studied with much benefit by any one interested in the evolution of architecture, language and culture. His policy of peace and diplomacy ‘had warded off Moghul political influence as much as lay in his power’ and his passing away on January 31, 1626, after a rule of 31 years, left the door open for Emperor Shah Jahan to pursue his program of subjugating the Deccan kingdoms.

 

In the vocabulary of statecraft attempts at preponderance between political entities takes the shape of primacy, dominance, or hegemony. The principal feature of political geography of peninsular India in early 16th century was the primacy of the Vijayanagra Empire and (after the fall of the Bahmani kingdom) five smaller entities in the shape of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar, Birar and Golkonda. This persisted till the battle of Talikota in 1565 in which four of the northern entities combined and inflicted a crippling defeat on Vijayanagra.

 

Another aspect of the region in that period was the quickening pace of its commercial and cultural interaction with the Iranian plateau that ‘had the effect of drawing the whole Deccan into the orbit of Persian culture.’ This included sectarian affiliation and the mention of the Persian king in the Friday khutba as a conscious act to demonstrate a degree of political affiliation.

 

The regional state system of the Deccan also developed its own rules of inter-state conduct and in the face of Moghul incursions into Berar and Ahmadnagar, regional frictions were put aside and Bijapur and Golconda ‘stood like one in the face of invaders and forgot their quarrels.’

 

Thus the Mughal designs on the Deccan entities, and the latter’s close affinity to Persia, inevitably resulted in clash of interests and perceptions. A study of the bilateral relations in that period concluded that ‘the distance between Persia and the Deccan, and the fact that the former was not a naval power, precluded the possibility of her providing material assistance to the latter, though a powerful ruler like Shah Abbas I could offer diplomatic support. The diplomatic relations between Persia and the Deccan kingdoms and the recitation of the Shah’s name in the khutba in Golkonda were irritating to the Mughals, especially, to a strong emperor like Shah Jahan. Equally objectionable would have been Shah Abbas II’s attempt to incite the Deccan kings against the Moghul Empire during the War of Succession.’

 

Despite this, or on account of it, Moghul attempts at dominance persisted. Thus, in the reign of Shah Jahan, the Deccan entities were forced to sign Inqiyad Namas or Deeds of Submission. Their details make interesting reading. The document, in the case of Golkonda, stipulated acceptance to be designated as ‘hereditary disciple’ of the Mughal Emperor and undertook to (1) replace the names of the twelve Imams and of the Shah of Persia and replace them with those of the four Caliphs and the Moghul Emperor (2) gold and silver coins to be struck with the formula passed by the Emperor (3) specified amounts of annual tributes to be sent (4) consider the Emperor’s friends as friends as friends and his enemies as enemies (5) swear on the Qur`an that he would abide by each of these commitments and that ‘if he were to stray from the right path then the Emperor would be justified in ordering his servants to conquer the kingdom’ and (6) if a neighbour committed aggression and occupied Golkonda territory, necessary assistance would be provided and the loss compensated.

 

The formal transition from ‘sultan’ to ‘hereditary disciple’ thus made clear the vassal status. Despite this, the wider diplomatic game between the Safavids and the Moghuls, of seeking and restricting influence, continued. So did the devise of equipping Iranian traders coming to Golkonda with letters from the Shah to the local ruler; it was strongly objected to by the Moghul court. Similar efforts at, cultivating local influence through officials of Iranian descent, were made by Iranian rulers. The most famous amongst the latter was the rich and resourceful diamond merchant Muhammad Said, better known by his official title of Mir Jumla, who was in correspondence with Shah Abbas II. This brought Moghul retribution on the city of Hyderabad and, in turn, propelled the Abdullah Qutb Shah to make a desperate appeal to the Shah ‘to deploy some Persian contingents on the Moghul frontiers and offers to pay the expenses of the expedition.’

 

Similarly, in the War of Succession after Shah Jahan‘s death, there was clear evidence of Safavid intervention on the side of Dara Shikoh. In a counter move, Aurangzeb contemplated but did not pursue an invasion of Persia in alliance with the Uzbegs. In the meantime, the final incorporation into the empire of Golkonda and other Deccan entities, and a succession of weak successors of Shah Abbas II in Persia, did away with the necessity of diplomatic and military pressures emanating from Delhi.

 

In the final analysis, the Moghul Empire was able to beat off the threat and prevail. It is different matter that effective dominance did not last very long since by the beginning of the eighteenth century signs of weakness and eventual disintegration were visible. In 1713 Aurangzeb’s grandson Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah as the Viceroy of Deccan. The latter ‘realized his limitations and never claimed to be king.’ His successors in the dynasty followed this practice.

 

To a historian, or a student of geopolitics, the power equation of the Moghuls and the Qutbshahis on the one hand, and of the Moghuls and the Safavids on the other, sheds interesting light on the rules of the game of political chess that have an abiding quality and transcend limitations of time and geography. Equally evident is the persisting nature of instrumentalities – threat or use of force, interference on pretexts of faith, use and misuse of trade and traders, and attempts to seek ‘fifth columns’ based on affinities of race or origin – that were used to further policy objectives.

 

Another set of historians, even normal citizens, would search for the perennial rather than the transitory in the legacy of the Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah and his successors and perhaps raise two questions: ‘What kind of political and socio-economic culture did the successor states of Hyderabad inherit? Was there anything of value left by the state of Hyderabad and can it still contribute to the Indian polity?’

 

Contemporary Hyderabad has crafted with skill and success a place for itself in the new world of the 21st century. One can only hope that its inherited tradition of tolerance, co-existence, inclusiveness and cultural effervescence would continue to signal its uniqueness and remain an example for the country.

 

Hum ko mita sake yeh zamane main dum nahin

Hum se zamana khud hai zamane se hum nahin

 

Jai Hind.”

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार | हर ‘मन की बात’ से पहले, देश के हर कोने से, हर आयु वर्ग के लोगों से, ‘मन की बात’ को ले करके ढ़ेर सारे सुझाव आते हैं | आकाशवाणी पर आते हैं, NarendraModiApp पर आते हैं, MyGov के माध्यम से आते हैं, फ़ोन के द्वारा आते हैं, recorded message के द्वारा आते हैं | और जब कभी-कभी मैं उसे समय निकाल करके देखता हूँ तो मेरे लिये एक सुखद अनुभव होता है | इतनी विविधताओं से भरी हुई जानकारियाँ मिलती हैं | देश के हर कोने में शक्तियों का अम्बार पड़ा है | साधक की तरह समाज में खपे हुए लोगों का अनगिनत योगदान, दूसरी तरफ़ शायद सरकार की नज़र भी नहीं जाती होगी, ऐसी समस्याओं का भी अम्बार नज़र आता है | शायद व्यवस्था भी आदी हो गयी होगी, लोग भी आदी हो गए होंगे | और मैंने पाया है कि बच्चों की जिज्ञासायें, युवाओं की महत्वाकांक्षायें, बड़ों के अनुभव का निचोड़, भाँति-भाँति की बातें सामने आती हैं | हर बार जितने inputs ‘मन की बात’ के लिये आते हैं, सरकार में उसका detail analysis होता है | सुझाव किस प्रकार के हैं, शिकायतें क्या हैं, लोगों के अनुभव क्या हैं | आमतौर पर यह देखा गया है कि मनुष्य का स्वभाव होता है दूसरे को सलाह देने का | ट्रेन में, बस में जाते और किसी को खांसी आ गयी तो तुरंत दूसरा आकर के कहता कि ऐसा करो | सलाह देना, सुझाव देना, ये जैसा मानो हमारे यहाँ स्वभाव में है | शुरू में ‘मन की बात’ को लेकर के भी जब सुझाव आते थे, सलाह के शब्द सुनाई देते थे, पढ़ने को मिलते थे, तो हमारी टीम को भी यही लगता था कि ये बहुत सारे लोगों को शायद ये आदत होगी, लेकिन हमने ज़रा बारीकी से देखने की कोशिश की तो मैं सचमुच में इतना भाव-विभोर हो गया | ज़्यादातर सुझाव देने वाले लोग वो हैं, मुझ तक पहुँचने का प्रयास करने वाले लोग वो हैं, जो सचमुच में अपने जीवन में कुछ-न-कुछ करते हैं | कुछ अच्छा हो उस पर वो अपनी बुद्धि, शक्ति, सामर्थ्य, परिस्थिति के अनुसार प्रयत्नरत हैं | और ये चीजें जब ध्यान में आयी तो मुझे लगा कि ये सुझाव सामान्य नहीं हैं | ये अनुभव के निचोड़ से निकले हुए हैं | कुछ लोग सुझाव इसलिये भी देतें हैं कि उनको लगता है कि अगर यही विचार वहाँ, जहाँ काम कर रहे हैं, वो विचार अगर और लोग सुनें और उसका एक व्यापक रूप मिल जाए तो बहुत लोगों को फायदा हो सकता है | और इसलिये उनकी स्वाभाविक इच्छा रहती है कि ‘मन की बात’ में अगर इसका ज़िक्र हो जाए | ये सभी बातें मेरी दृष्टि से अत्यंत सकारात्मक हैं | मैं सबसे पहले तो अधिकतम सुझाव जो कि कर्मयोगियों के हैं, समाज के लिये कुछ-न-कुछ कर गुज़रने वाले लोगों के हैं | मैं उनके प्रति आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ | इतना ही नहीं मैं किसी बात को जब मैं उल्लेख करता हूँ तो, ऐसी-ऐसी चीजें ध्यान में आती हैं, तो बड़ा ही आनंद होता है | पिछली बात ‘मन की बात’ में कुछ लोगों ने मुझे सुझाव दिया था food waste हो रहा है, उसके संबंध में चिंता जताई थी और मैंने उल्लेख किया | और जब उल्लेख किया तो उसके बाद NarendraModiApp पर, MyGov पर देश के अनेक कोने में से अनेक लोगों ने, कैसे-कैसे innovative ideas के साथ food waste को बचाने के लिये क्या-क्या प्रयोग किये हैं | मैंने भी कभी सोचा नहीं था आज हमारे देश में खासकर के युवा-पीढ़ी, लम्बे अरसे से इस काम को कर रही है | कुछ सामाजिक संस्थायें करती हैं, ये तो हम कई वर्षों से जानते आए हैं, लेकिन मेरे देश के युवा इसमें लगे हुए हैं - ये तो मुझे बाद में पता चला | कइयों ने मुझे videos भेजे हैं | कई स्थान हैं जहाँ रोटी बैंक चल रही हैं | लोग रोटी बैंक में, अपने यहाँ से रोटी जमा करवाते हैं, सब्जी जमा करवाते हैं और जो needy लोग हैं वे वहाँ उसे प्राप्त भी कर लेते हैं | देने वाले को भी संतोष होता है, लेने वाले को भी कभी नीचा नहीं देखना पड़ता है | समाज के सहयोग से कैसे काम होते हैं, इसका ये उदाहरण है | 

आज अप्रैल महीना पूर्ण हो रहा है, आखिरी दिवस है | 1 मई को गुजरात और महाराष्ट्र का स्थापना दिवस है | इस अवसर पर दोनों राज्यों के नागरिकों को मेरी तरफ़ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें | दोनों राज्यों ने विकास की नयी-नयी ऊँचाइयों को पार करने का लगातार प्रयास किया है | देश की उन्नति में योगदान दिया है | और दोनों राज्यों में महापुरुषों की अविरत श्रंखला और समाज के हर क्षेत्र में उनका जीवन हमें प्रेरणा देता रहता है | और इन महापुरुषों को याद करते हुए राज्य के स्थापना दिवस पर 2022, आज़ादी के 75 साल, हम अपने राज्य को, अपने देश को, अपने समाज को, अपने नगर को, अपने परिवार को कहाँ पहुँचाएँगे इसका संकल्प लेना चाहिये | उस संकल्प को सिद्ध करने के लिये योजना बनानी चाहिये और सभी नागरिकों के सहयोग से आगे बढ़ना चाहिये | मेरी इन दोनों राज्यों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें हैं | 

एक ज़माना था जब climate change ये academic world का विषय रहता था, seminar का विषय रहता था | लेकिन आज, हम लोगों की रोज़मर्रा की ज़िंदगी में, हम अनुभव भी करते हैं, अचरज़ भी करते हैं | कुदरत ने भी, खेल के सारे नियम बदल दिये हैं | हमारे देश में मई-जून में जो गर्मी होती है, वो इस बार मार्च-अप्रैल में अनुभव करने की नौबत आ गयी | और मुझे ‘मन की बात’ पर जब मैं लोगों के सुझाव ले रहा था, तो ज़्यादातर सुझाव इन गर्मी के समय में क्या करना चाहिये, उस पर लोगों ने मुझे दिये हैं | वैसे सारी बातें प्रचलित हैं | नया नहीं होता है लेकिन फिर भी समय पर उसका पुनःस्मरण बहुत काम आता है | 

कोई श्रीमान प्रशांत कुमार मिश्र, टी.एस. कार्तिक ऐसे अनेक मित्रों ने पक्षियों की चिंता की है | उन्होंने कहा कि बालकनी में, छत पर, पानी रखना चाहिये | और मैंने देखा है कि परिवार के छोटे-छोटे बालक इस बात को बखूबी करते हैं | एक बार उनको ध्यान में आ जाए कि ये पानी क्यों भरना चाहिये तो वो दिन में 10 बार देखने जाते हैं कि जो बर्तन रखा है उसमें पानी है कि नहीं है | और देखते रहते हैं कि पक्षी आये कि नहीं आये | हमें तो लगता है कि ये खेल चल रहा है लेकिन सचमुच में, बालक मन में ये संवेदनायें जगाने का एक अद्भुत अनुभव होता है | आप भी कभी देखिये पशु-पक्षी के साथ थोड़ा सा भी लगाव एक नये आनंद की अनुभूति कराता है | 

कुछ दिन पहले मुझे गुजरात से श्रीमान जगत भाई ने अपनी एक किताब भेजी है ‘Save The Sparrows’ और जिसमें उन्होंने गौरैया की संख्या जो कम हो रही है उसकी चिंता तो की है लेकिन स्वयं ने mission mode में उसके संरक्षण के लिये क्या प्रयोग किये हैं, क्या प्रयास किये हैं, बहुत अच्छा वर्णन उस किताब में है | वैसे हमारे देश में तो पशु-पक्षी, प्रकृति उसके साथ सह-जीवन की बात, उस रंग से हम रंगे हुए हैं लेकिन फिर भी ये आवश्यक है कि सामूहिक रूप से ऐसे प्रयासों को बल देना चाहिये | जब मैं गुजरात में मुख्यमंत्री था तो ‘दाऊदी बोहरा समाज’ के धर्मगुरु सैयदना साहब को सौ साल हुए थे | वे 103 साल तक जीवित रहे थे | और उनके सौ साल निमित्त बोहरा समाज ने Burhani foundation के द्वारा sparrow को बचाने के लिये एक बहुत बड़ा अभियान चलाया था | इसका शुभारम्भ करने का मुझे अवसर मिला था | क़रीब 52 हज़ार bird feeders उन्होंने दुनिया के कोने-कोने में वितरित किये थे | Guinness book of World Records में भी उसको स्थान मिला था | 

कभी-कभी हम इतने व्यस्त होते हैं तो, अखबार देने वाला, दूध देने, सब्जी देने वाला, पोस्टमैन, कोई भी हमारे घर के दरवाजे से आता है, लेकिन हम भूल जाते हैं कि गर्मी के दिन हैं ज़रा पहले उसको पानी का तो पूछें ! 

नौजवान दोस्तो, कुछ बातें आपके साथ भी तो मैं करना चाहता हूँ | मुझे कभी-कभी चिंता हो रही है कि हमारी युवा पीढ़ी में कई लोगों को comfort zone में ही ज़िंदगी गुज़ारने में मज़ा आती है | माँ-बाप भी बड़े एक रक्षात्मक अवस्था में ही उनका लालन-पालन करते हैं | कुछ दूसरे extreme भी होते हैं लेकिन ज़्यादातर comfort zone वाला नज़र आता है | अब परीक्षायें समाप्त हो चुकी हैं | Vacation का मज़ा लेने के लिये योजनायें बन चुकी होंगी | Summer vacation गर्मियां होने के बाद भी ज़रा अच्छा लगता है | लेकिन मैं एक मित्र के रूप में आपका vacation कैसा जाए, कुछ बातें करना चाहता हूँ | मुझे विश्वास है कुछ लोग ज़रूर प्रयोग करेंगे और मुझे बतायेंगे भी | क्या आप vacation के इस समय का उपयोग, मैं तीन सुझाव देता हूँ उसमें से तीनों करें तो बहुत अच्छी बात है लेकिन तीन में से एक करने का प्रयास करें | ये देखें कि new experience हो, प्रयास करें कि new skill का अवसर लें, कोशिश करें कि जिसके विषय में न कभी सुना है, न देखा है, न सोचा है, न जानते हैं फिर भी वहाँ जाने का मन करता है और चले जायें | New places, new experiences, new skills | कभी-कभार किसी चीज को टी.वी. पर देखना या किताब में पढ़ना या परिचितों से सुनना और उसी चीज़ को स्वयं अनुभव करना तो दोनों में आसमान-ज़मीन का अंतर होता है | मैं आपसे आग्रह करूँगा इस vacation में जहाँ भी आपकी जिज्ञासा है उसे जानने के लिये कोशिश कीजिये, नया experiment कीजिये | Experiment positive हो, थोड़ा comfort zone से बाहर ले जाने वाला हो | हम मध्यम-वर्गीय परिवार के हैं, सुखी परिवार के हैं | क्या दोस्तो कभी मन करता है कि reservation किये बिना रेलवे के second class में ticket लेकर के चढ़ जाएँ, कम-से-कम 24 घंटे का सफ़र करें | क्या अनुभव आता है | उन पैसेंजरों की बातें क्या हैं, वो स्टेशन पर उतर कर क्या करते हैं, शायद सालभर में जो सीख नहीं पाते हैं उस 24 घंटे की without reservation वाली, भीड़-भाड़ वाली ट्रेन में सोने को भी न मिले, खड़े-खड़े जाना पड़े | कभी तो अनुभव कीजिये | मैं ये नहीं कहता हूँ बार-बार करिये, एक-आध बार तो करिये | शाम का समय हो अपना football ले करके, volleyball ले करके या कोई भी खेल-कूद का साधन ले करके तद्दन ग़रीब बस्ती में चले जाएँ | उन ग़रीब बालकों के साथ ख़ुद खेलिये, आप देखिये, शायद् ज़िंदगी में खेल का आनंद पहले कभी नहीं मिला होगा - ऐसा आपको मिलेगा | समाज में इस प्रकार की ज़िंदगी गुज़ारने वाले बच्चों को जब आपके साथ खेलने का अवसर मिलेगा, आपने सोचा है उनके जीवन में कितना बड़ा बदलाव आएगा | और मैं विश्वास करता हूँ एक बार जायेंगे, बार-बार जाने का मन कर जाएगा | ये अनुभव आपको बहुत कुछ सिखाएगा | कई volunteer organisations सेवा के काम करते रहते हैं | आप तो Google गुरु से जुड़े हुए हैं उस पर ढूँढिए | किसी ऐसे organisation के साथ 15 दिन, 20 दिन के लिये जुड़ जाइये, चले जाइये, जंगलों में चले जाइये | कभी-कभी बहुत summer camp लगते हैं, personality development के लगते हैं, कई प्रकार के विकास के लिये लगते हैं उसमें शरीक़ हो सकते हैं | लेकिन साथ-साथ कभी आपको लगता है कि आपने ऐसे summer camp किये हों, personality development का course किया हो | आप बिना पैसे लिये समाज के उन लोगों के पास पहुँचे जिनको ऐसा अवसर नहीं है और जो आपने सीखा है, उनको सिखायें | कैसे किया जा सकता है, आप उनको सिखा सकते हैं | मुझे इस बात की भी चिंता सता रही है कि technology दूरियाँ कम करने के लिये आयी, technology सीमायें समाप्त करने के लिये आयी | लेकिन उसका दुष्परिणाम ये हुआ है कि एक ही घर में छः लोग एक ही कमरे में बैठें हों लेकिन दूरियाँ इतनी हों कि कल्पना ही नहीं कर सकते | क्यों ? हर कोई technology से कहीं और busy हो गया है | सामूहिकता भी एक संस्कार है, सामूहिकता एक शक्ति है | दूसरा मैंने कहा कि skill | क्या आपका मन नहीं करता कि आप कुछ नया सीखें ! आज स्पर्द्धा का युग है | Examination में इतने डूबे हुए रहते हैं | उत्तम से उत्तम अंक पाने के लिये खप जाते हैं, खो जाते हैं | Vacation में भी कोई न कोई coaching class लगा रहता है, अगली exam की चिंता रहती है | कभी-कभी डर लगता है कि robot तो नहीं हो रही हमारी युवा-पीढ़ी | मशीन की तरह ज़िंदगी नहीं गुज़ार रही | 

दोस्तो, जीवन में बहुत-कुछ बनने के सपने, अच्छी बात है, कुछ कर गुज़रने के इरादे अच्छी बात है, और करना भी चाहिये | लेकिन ये भी देखिये कि अपने भीतर जो human element है वो तो कहीं कुंठित नहीं हो रहा है, हम मानवीय गुणों से कहीं दूर तो नहीं चले जा रहे हैं ! Skill development में इस पहलू पर थोड़ा बल दिया जा सकता है क्या ! Technology से दूर, ख़ुद के साथ समय गुज़ारने का प्रयास | संगीत का कोई वाद्य सीख रहे हैं, कोई नई भाषा के 5-50 वाक्य सीख रहे हैं, तमिल हो, तेलुगु हो, असमिया हो, बांगला हो, मलयालम हो, गुजराती हो, मराठी हो, पंजाबी हो | कितनी विविधताओं से भरा हुआ देश है और नज़र करें तो हमारे अगल-बगल में ही कोई न कोई सिखाने वाला मिल सकता है | Swimming नहीं आता तो swimming सीखें, drawing करें, भले उत्तम drawing नहीं आएगा लेकिन कुछ तो कागज़ पर हाथ लगाने की कोशिश करें | आपका भीतर की जो संवेदना है वो प्रकट होने लग जायेगी | कभी-कभी छोटे-छोटे काम जिसको हम कहते हैं – हमें, क्यों न मन करे, हम सीखें ! आपको car driving तो सीखने का मन करता है ! क्या कभी auto-rickshaw सीखने का मन करता है क्या ! आप cycle तो चला लेते हैं, लेकिन three-wheeler वाली cycle जो लोगों को ले कर के जाते हैं - कभी चलाने की कोशिश की है क्या ! आप देखें ये सारे नये प्रयोग ये skill ऐसी है आपको आनंद भी देगी और जीवन को एक दायरे में जो बाँध दिया है न उससे आपको बाहर निकाल देगी | Out of box कुछ करिये दोस्तो | ज़िंदगी बनाने का यही तो अवसर होता है | और आप सोचते होंगे कि सारी exam, समाप्त हो जाए, Career के नये पड़ाव पर जाऊँगा तब सीखूँगा तो वो तो मौका नहीं आएगा | फिर आप दूसरी झंझट में पड़ जायेंगे और इसलिये मैं आपसे कहूँगा, अगर आपको जादू सीखने का शौक हो तो ताश के पत्तों की जादू सीखिए | अपने यार-दोस्तों को जादू दिखाते रहिये | कुछ-न-कुछ ऐसी चीज़ें जो आप नहीं जानते हैं उसको जानने का प्रयास कीजिये, उससे आपको ज़रूर लाभ होगा | आपके भीतर की मानवीय शक्तियों को चेतना मिलेगी | विकास के लिये बहुत अच्छा अवसर बनेगा | मैं अपने अनुभव से कहता हूँ दुनिया को देखने से जितना सीखने-समझने को मिलता है जिसकी हम कल्पना नहीं कर सकते | नये-नये स्थान, नये-नये शहर, नये-नये नगर, नये-नये गाँव, नये-नये इलाके | लेकिन जाने से पहले कहाँ जा रहें - उसका अभ्यास और जा करके एक जिज्ञासु की तरह उसे देखना, समझना, लोगों से चर्चा करना, उनसे पूछना ये अगर प्रयास किया तो उसे देखने का आनंद कुछ और होगा | आप ज़रूर कोशिश कीजिये और तय कीजिये travelling ज्यादा न करें I एक स्थान पर जाकर कर के तीन दिन, चार दिन लगाइये I फिर दूसरे स्थान पर जाइये वहाँ तीन दिन - चार दिन लगाइये I इससे आपको बहुत कुछ सीखने को मिलेगा I मैं चाहूँगा और ये भी सही है कि आप जब जा रहे हैं तो मुझे तस्वीर भी share कीजिये I क्या नया देखा ? कहाँ गए थे ? आप Hash tag Incredible India इसका उपयोग कर के अपने इन अनुभवों को share कीजिये I 

दोस्तो, इस बार भारत सरकार ने भी आपके लिये बड़ा अच्छा अवसर दिया है I नई पीढ़ी तो नकद से करीब-करीब मुक्त ही हो रही है I उसको cash की ज़रूरत नहीं है I वो Digital Currency में विश्वास करने लग गई है I आप तो करते हैं लेकिन इसी योजना से आप कमाई भी कर सकते हैं - आपने सोचा है I भारत सरकार की एक योजना है I अगर BHIM App जो कि आप download करते होंगे I आप उपयोग भी करते होंगे I लेकिन किसी और को refer करें I किसी और को जोड़ें और वो नया व्यक्ति अगर तीन transaction करे, आर्थिक कारोबार तीन बार करे, तो इस काम को करने के लिये आपको 10 रुपये की कमाई होती है I आपके खाते में सरकार की तरफ से 10 रुपये जमा हो जायेगा I अगर दिन में आपने 20 लोगों से करवा लिया तो आप शाम होते-होते 200 रुपये कमा लेंगे I व्यापारियों को भी कमाई हो सकती है, विद्यार्थियों को भी कमाई हो सकती है I और ये योजना 14 अक्टूबर तक है I Digital India बनाने में आपका योगदान होगा I New India के आप एक प्रहरी बन जाएँगे, तो vacation का vacation और कमाई की कमाई I refer & earn I 

आमतौर पर हमारे देश में VIP culture के प्रति एक नफ़रत का माहौल है लेकिन ये इतना गहरा है - ये मुझे अभी-अभी अनुभव हुआ I जब सरकार ने तय कर दिया कि अब हिंदुस्तान में कितना ही बड़ा व्यक्ति क्यों न हो, वो अपनी गाड़ी पर लाल बत्ती लगा कर के नहीं घूमेगा I वो एक प्रकार से VIP culture का symbol बन गया था लेकिन अनुभव ये कहता था कि लाल बत्ती तो vehicle पर लगती थी, गाड़ी पर लगती थी, लेकिन धीरे-धीरे-धीरे वो दिमाग में घुस जाती थी और दिमागी तौर पर VIP culture पनप चुका है I अभी तो लाल बत्ती गई है इसके लिये कोई ये तो दावा नहीं कर पायेगा कि दिमाग़ में जो लाल बत्ती घुस गई है वो निकल गई होगी I मुझे बड़ा interesting एक phone call आया I ख़ैर उस phone में उन्होंने आशंका भी व्यक्त की है लेकिन इस समय इतना अंदाज आता है इस phone call से कि सामान्य मानवी ये चीजें पसंद नहीं करता है I उसे दूरी महसूस होती है I 

“नमस्कार प्रधामंत्री जी मैं शिवा चौबे बोल रही हूँ, जबलपुर मध्य प्रदेश से I मैं Government के red beacon light ban के बारे में कुछ बोलना चाहती हूँ I मैंने एक लाइन पढ़ी न्यूज़पेपर में जिसमें लिखा था “every Indian is a VIP on a road” ये सुन के मुझे बहुत गर्व महसूस हुआ और खुशी भी हुई कि आज मेरा टाइम भी उतना ही ज़रूरी है I मुझे ट्रैफिक जाम में नहीं फंसना है और मुझे किसी के लिये रुकना भी नहीं है I तो मैं आपको दिल से बहुत धन्यवाद देना चाहती हूँ इस decision के लिये I और ये जो आपने स्वच्छ भारत अभियान चलाया है इसमें हमारा देश ही नहीं साफ़ हो रहा है, हमारी रोडो से VIP की दादागिरी भी साफ हो रही है - तो उसके लिये धन्यवाद I” 

सरकारी निर्णय से लाल बत्ती का जाना वो तो एक व्यवस्था का हिस्सा है I लेकिन मन से भी हमें प्रयत्नपूर्वक इसे निकालना है I हम सब मिल कर के जागरूक प्रयास करेंगे तो निकल सकता है I New India का हमारा concept यही है कि देश में VIP की जगह पर EPI का महत्व बढ़े | और जब मैं VIP के स्थान पर EPI कह रहा हूँ तो मेरा भाव स्पष्ट है - Every Person is Important | हर व्यक्ति का महत्व है, हर व्यक्ति का माहात्म्य है I सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का महत्व हम स्वीकार करें, सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का माहात्म्य स्वीकार करें तो महान सपनों को पूरा करने के लिये कितनी बड़ी शक्ति एकजुट हो जाएगी I हम सबने मिलकर के करना है I 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं हमेशा कहता हूँ कि हम इतिहास को, हमारी संस्कृतियों को, हमारी परम्पराओं को, बार-बार याद करते रहें I उससे हमें ऊर्जा मिलती है, प्रेरणा मिलती है I इस वर्ष हम सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासी संत रामानुजाचार्य जी की 1000वीं जयंती मना रहे हैं I किसी-न-किसी कारणवश हम इतने बंध गये, इतने छोटे हो गये कि ज्यादा-ज्यादा शताब्दियों तक का ही विचार करते रहे I दुनिया के अन्य देशों के लिये तो शताब्दी का बड़ा महत्व होगा I लेकिन भारत इतना पुरातन राष्ट्र है कि उसके नसीब में हज़ार साल और हज़ार साल से भी पुरानी यादों को मनाने का अवसर हमें मिला है I एक हज़ार साल पहले का समाज कैसा होगा ? सोच कैसी होगी ? थोड़ी कल्पना तो कीजिये I आज भी सामाजिक रुढियों को तोड़ कर के निकलना हो तो कितनी दिक्कत होती है I एक हज़ार साल पहले कैसा होता होगा ? बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा कि रामानुजाचार्य जी ने समाज में जो बुराइयाँ थी, ऊँच-नीच का भाव था, छूत-अछूत का भाव था, जातिवाद का भाव था, इसके खिलाफ़ बहुत बड़ी लड़ाई लड़ी थी I स्वयं ने अपने आचरण द्वारा समाज जिनको अछूत मानता था उनको गले लगाया था I हज़ार साल पहले उनके मंदिर प्रवेश के लिये उन्होंने आंदोलन किये थे और सफलतापूर्वक मंदिर प्रवेश करवाये थे I हम कितने भाग्यवान हैं कि हर युग में हमारे समाज की बुराइयों को खत्म करने के लिये हमारे समाज में से ही महापुरुष पैदा हुए हैं I संत रामानुजाचार्य जी की 1000वीं जयंती मना रहे हैं तब, सामाजिक एकता के लिये, संगठन में शक्ति है - इस भाव को जगाने के लिये उनसे हम प्रेरणा लें I 

भारत सरकार भी कल 1 मई को ‘संत रामानुजाचार्य’ जी की स्मृति में एक stamp release करने जा रही है I मैं संत रामानुजाचार्य जी को आदर पूर्वक नमन करता हूँ, श्रृद्धा-सुमन अर्पित करता हूँ I 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, कल 1 मई का एक और भी महत्व है | दुनिया के कई भागों में उसे ‘श्रमिक दिवस’ के रूप में भी मनाया जाता है I और जब ‘श्रमिक दिवस’ की बात आती है, Labour की चर्चा होती है, Labourers की चर्चा होती है तो मुझे बाबा साहब अम्बेडकर की याद आना बहुत स्वाभाविक है I और बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा कि आज श्रमिकों को जो सहुलियतें मिली हैं, जो आदर मिला है, उसके लिये हम बाबा साहब के आभारी हैं I श्रमिकों के कल्याण के लिये बाबा साहब का योगदान अविस्मरणीय है I आज जब मैं बाबा साहब की बात करता हूँ, संत रामानुजाचार्य जी की बात करता हूँ तो 12वीं सदी के कर्नाटक के महान संत और सामाजिक सुधारक ‘जगत गुरु बसवेश्वर’ जी की भी याद आती है I कल ही मुझे एक समारोह में जाने का अवसर मिला I उनके वचनामृत के संग्रह को लोकार्पण का वो अवसर था I 12वीं शताब्दी में कन्नड़ भाषा में उन्होंने श्रम, श्रमिक उस पर गहन विचार रखे हैं I कन्नड़ भाषा में उन्होंने कहा था - “काय कवे कैलास”, उसका अर्थ होता है - आप अपने परिश्रम से ही भगवान शिव के घर कैलाश की प्राप्ति कर सकते हैं यानि कि कर्म करने से ही स्वर्ग की प्राप्ति होती है | दूसरे शब्दों में कहें तो श्रम ही शिव है I मैं बार-बार ‘श्रमेव-जयते’ की बात करता हूँ | ‘Dignity of labour’ की बात करता हूँ I मुझे बराबर याद है भारतीय मज़दूर संघ के जनक और चिन्तक जिन्होंने श्रमिकों के लिए बहुत चिंतन किया ऐसे श्रीमान दत्तोपन्त ठेंगड़ी कहा करते थे - एक तरफ़ माओवाद से प्रेरित विचार था कि “दुनिया के मज़दूर एक हो जाओ” और दत्तोपन्त ठेंगड़ी कहते थे “मज़दूरों आओ दुनिया को एक करें” I एक तरफ़ कहा जाता था- ‘Workers of the world unite’ I भारतीय चिंतन से निकली हुई विचारधारा को ले करके दत्तोपन्त ठेंगड़ी कहा करते थे - ‘Workers unite the world’ I आज जब श्रमिकों की बात करता हूँ तो दत्तोपन्त ठेंगड़ी जी को याद करना बहुत स्वाभाविक है I 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, कुछ दिन के बाद हम बुद्ध पूर्णिमा मनायेंगे I विश्वभर में भगवान बुद्ध से जुड़े हुए लोग उत्सव मनाते हैं I विश्व आज जिन समस्याओं से गुज़र रहा है हिंसा, युद्ध, विनाशलीला, शस्त्रों की स्पर्द्धा, जब ये वातावरण देखते हैं तो तब, बुद्ध के विचार बहुत ही relevant लगते हैं I और भारत में तो अशोक का जीवन युद्ध से बुद्ध की यात्रा का उत्तम प्रतीक है I मेरा सौभाग्य है कि बुद्ध पूर्णिमा के इस महान पर्व पर United Nations के द्वारा vesak day मनाया जाता है I इस वर्ष ये श्रीलंका में हो रहा है I इस पवित्र पर्व पर मुझे श्रीलंका में भगवान बुद्ध को श्रद्धा-सुमन अर्पित करने का एक अवसर मिलेगा I उनकी यादों को ताज़ा करने का अवसर मिलेगा I 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, भारत में हमेशा ‘सबका साथ-सबका विकास’ इसी मंत्र को ले करके आगे बढ़ने का प्रयास किया है | और जब हम सबका साथ-सबका विकास कहते हैं, तो वो सिर्फ़ भारत के अन्दर ही नहीं - वैश्विक परिवेश में भी है | और ख़ास करके हमारे अड़ोस-पड़ोस देशों के लिए भी है | हमारे अड़ोस-पड़ोस के देशों का साथ भी हो, हमारे अड़ोस-पड़ोस के देशों का विकास भी हो | अनेक प्रकल्प चलते हैं | 5 मई को भारत दक्षिण-एशिया satellite launch करेगा | इस satellite की क्षमता तथा इससे जुड़ी सुविधायें दक्षिण-एशिया के आर्थिक तथा developmental प्राथमिकताओं को पूरा करने में काफ़ी मदद करेगीं | चाहे natural resources mapping करने की बात हो, tele-medicine की बात हो, education का क्षेत्र हो या अधिक गहरी IT connectivity हो, people to people संपर्क का प्रयास हो | South Asia का यह उपग्रह हमारे पूरे क्षेत्र को आगे बढ़ने में पूरा सहायक होगा | पूरे दक्षिण-एशिया के साथ सहयोग बढ़ाने के लिये भारत का एक महत्वपूर्ण कदम है - अनमोल नज़राना है | दक्षिण-एशिया के प्रति हमारी प्रतिबद्धता का ये एक उपयुक्त उदाहरण है | दक्षिण एशियाई देशों जो कि South Asia Satellite से जुड़े हैं मैं उन सबका इस महत्वपूर्ण प्रयास के लिये स्वागत करता हूँ, शुभकामनायें देता हूँ| 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो गर्मी बहुत है, अपनों को भी संभालिये, अपने को भी संभालिये | बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें | धन्यवाद |

My dearest countrymen namaskar. Before each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat, ’suggestions pour in Aakashvani, on NarendraModiApp, come through on MyGov, by the phone and come by the means of recorded messages from every corner of the country and people of every age group, And sometimes when I take the time to view them, for me it becomes an extremely pleasant experience. 

One comes across such a wide spectrum of information, one finds that every corner of the country is filled with talented people. Like a selfless seeker, these countless people are consumed by desire to contribute something to the society, on the other hand there are mounds of problems that perhaps even the government does not notice! Maybe the system has also become accustomed in dealing with these problems, and so do have the people become accustomed to them. I have come across the inquisitiveness of children, the ambitions of the youth, and the gist of the experience of elders! Myriad kind of facts emerges. Every time the inputs that come in response to every episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, are analyzed in detail by the government. 

What are the kinds of suggestions, what are the kinds of complaints and what are the experiences of the people? It is an inherent human nature to advise others. While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure. To offer advice or suggest a solution, are part of our nature. In the beginning, when suggestions came in response to a certain episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ , one could discern words of advice, and you could read them too, so our team always felt that many people might have had this particular habit of proffering advice. But when we analyzed the suggestions minutely, I really became quite emotional. 

Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives. They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen. And when these things came to my notice I felt that these suggestions are extraordinary. These are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of life’s experiences. Some people also give suggestions thinking that if an idea has the potential to work then more people would listen to it if it is heard on a wider platform and hence many people can benefit. And therefore it is their natural desire that it gets a mention in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ 

According to me all of these things are extremely positive steps. First of all, I express my gratitude to the Karma yogis and those people who have offered some or the other service to the society and recommend maximum suggestions. And not only this, when I mention something positive, such memories come to recall, it is very much a pleasant experience. In the previous ‘Mann Ki Baat’, some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted; not only had I expressed my concern but mentioned it too. And upon my mention, there were mentions of many innovative ideas to save food from being wasted that are being put into practice employed in many corners of the country on NarendraModiApp and also on MyGov. 

I had never even imagined that in our country especially the young generation has been doing this kind of work from a long time. Some social institutions have been involved in this activity for many years was common knowledge, but the youth of my country are engaged in this task, I only came to know later. Many have sent me the videos of their work in this field. There are many places where ‘Roti Banks’ are operating. In the Roti Banks, the leftover rotis are deposited by people, they also deposit the leftover vegetables and the needy can obtain food from these banks. The person who donates rotis feels a sense of satisfaction also, the recipient also does not feel humiliated. These are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society. 

Today is the last day of month of April. 1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf. Both states have made constant strides to scale newer heights of development and have contributed toward the advancement of the country. And both the states had a steady stream of great men whose lives and sterling contributions in every sphere of society is a source of inspiration for us.. In remembrance of these great men, on the foundation day of these two states, we should take the pledge of taking our state, our country, our society, our city, and our family to glorious heights in 2022, when we celebrate 75 years of independence. 

Plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens. I wish the very best to these two states. 

There used to be a time when climate change was a subject confined to the domain of the academic world, it used to be the topic for seminars, but today, we experience it in our everyday life and it also astounds us. Nature has also changed the rules of the game. The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year. So, when I was taking suggestions for ‘Mann Ki Baat’, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time. Most of the suggestions or practices to beat summer are not new but are prevalent for a long time, however it is very useful to remember them from time to time. 

Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, Shri T. S. Kartik and many such friends have expressed their concern about birds during the summer. They’ve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace. I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically. Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray. And also watch if the birds came or not. We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child's mind. You can also experience for yourself that a little attachment to an animal or a bird makes you feel very happy. 

Some time back, Shri Mr. Jagat Bhai from Gujarat, had sent his book, 'Save the Sparrows' in which he not only expressed concern about the continuously declining number of sparrows, but also what steps he has taken in a mission mode for the conservation of the sparrow which is very nicely described in that book. In our country, we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co-existence with animals, birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized. 

When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat, Syedna Sahib the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community had completed his hundred years. He lived till 103 years. As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation. I had the opportunity to inaugurate it. Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world. This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records. 

Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days. 

Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too. I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones. Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner. True there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome . Now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation. 

Summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat. But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation. I believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too. Would you like to use this time of vacation gainfully, I offer three suggestions, it will be good if you follow all of the three but then try to do atleast one of the three. See that you gain a new experience. Try to take the opportunity of acquiring a new skill. Try to experience something that you have neither heard before , nor seen, nor thought of and yet there is a curiosity in your mind. You must try new places, new experiences and new skills. 

There is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself. I will urge you to try to experience and satiate your curiosity on any subject during this vacation. Try a new experiment. The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone. We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families. Friends have you ever thought of travelling in a Second Class railway Compartment without a reservation, and going for atleast a 24 hours ride? 

What great experience it will be? How are the lives of your co- passengers, what do they do at the station when they alight from the train? What you cannot learn in a year, you will learn in that crowded train travelling without any reservation for 24 hours! You might not get to sleep and have to travel standing. Try it, just experience it once, I am not asking you to try it again and again, do it once. In the evening, take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people. Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-that’s the kind of joy you’ll experience! 

Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you. And I believe that if you go there once, your heart will tell you to go back again and again. This experience will teach you a lot. Many volunteer organizations are engaged in this kind of work. You are connected to Google Guru, try searching on it and get associated with any such organization for 15 days or 20 days. Go, explore, go to the jungles. Sometimes there are summer camps, for development of different facets of your personality. You can participate in these camps. 

But at the same time, don’t you feel that after you’ve attended such summer camps, you have participated in the courses for development of personality and you reach out to those people who have no such opportunity and teach them what you have learned without taking any money. It is possible that you can teach them. I am also worried that technology evolved to reduce the distance, technology came in to being to end the boundaries. But the end result of this is that six people in the same house are sitting in the same room but they are separated by unimaginable distances! Why? Everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way. Collectivity is also a way of life, collectivity is power in itself. Secondly I had mentioned about skill acquisition, don’t you feel that you should learn something new! 

Today is the era of competition. You get so submerged in the preparation for the examinations, get so consumed to obtain the best grades, there are coaching classes going on even in vacations and you’re worrying about the next exam! Sometimes you feel scared that our youth have become robot like, living life like a machine. 

Friends, dreams of making it big in life is a good thing, it is good to have some purpose in life, and you must achieve your goals. But also self-evaluate whether the human element within yourself is getting frustrated, are we not moving away from our human qualities. 

Can’t a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development? Get away from technology, and try to spend some time with yourself. Learn a musical instrument or learn a few sentences of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi. This is a country full of diversity and if you look, then there can be someone who can teach us something new is just around the corner. If you don’t know how to swim, then learn swimming, try doing some drawing, even if you do not end up making the best drawing, try to practice putting hand to the paper! 

The empathy within you will begin to appear. Sometimes if our heart desires to learn the trade of so called ‘small people’ then let us learn it, why not? You want to learn to drive a car but then do you ever want to learn how to drive an auto-rickshaw? You’re able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three-wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people? You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which you’re tied down! 

Do something out of the box, my Friends. This is the only time to make something of your life. And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you won’t get a chance. At that time you will be tangled into other things and therefore I tell you if you have a passion to learn magic then learn the card tricks! Keep showing the tricks to your friends. Try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge, it will definitely benefit you. Your inner human potential will awaken and this will provide a great opportunity for development. I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine. New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas. But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else! 

Do try to do it; of course do not travel too much in one go. Go to a destination and spend three to four days there. Then go to the next and spend a like duration there. You will get to learn a lot that way. I wish you share your travel photographs with me, it will be nice. What new did you see ! Where did you travel to ! Make good use of the hash tag Incredible India and share your experiences. 

Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity. The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash. It does not need cash. It has begun adopting digital currency. I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme? It is a scheme of the Government of India. You must be downloading the BHIM App and using it. But do refer it to others; make others join you in that. 

If the new member does three transactions, performs financial business thrice, you stand to earn ten rupees for that. Ten rupees will be credited to your account from the government. If you involve twenty persons in a day, by evening, you would’ve earned two hundred rupees. The traders can earn, so can students. And this scheme is valid till the 14th of October. It will be your contribution towards making of a digital India. You’ll become a sentinel of New India. The joy of a vacation coupled with income ! Refer and earn. 

Generally speaking, in our country there exists an atmosphere of disdain towards the VIP culture. But that it runs so very deep, I just experienced, when the government recently decided that no person in India, whatsoever his status might be, will not move with a red beacon atop his vehicle. In a way it had become a symbol of the VIP culture. Experience tells us that whereas the red beacon used to be fixed atop the vehicle, atop the car, slowly & steadily it permeated into the psyche and got firmly entrenched in the mindset. The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared. I have received a very interesting phone call. Though the caller has expressed the same apprehension. One can discern from this phone call that common men detest these tendencies. They feel distanced. 

“Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivaa Choubey calling from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. I wish to say something on the government’s ban on red beacons. I read a line in a newspaper, ‘Every Indian is a VIP on the road’. It made me feel very proud. I am glad that today, even my time is equally important. I don’t have to be caught in a traffic jam and I don’t have to stop for anyone as well. I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision. And the Swachch Bharat Campaign that you have launched will not only clean our country, it will get rid of the VIP hegemony from our roads. Many thanks for that.” 

The exit of the red beacon through a government decision is part of a system. But we have to make efforts to cleanse it out of our minds. If we collectively strive to do it with eternal vigilance , it surely can be flushed out. Our concept of New India precisely is that in place of VIP, more priority should be accorded to EPI. And when I’m saying EPI in place of VIP, the essence of my sentiment is clear – every person is important. Every person has his or her own importance, every person possesses a sagacious aura, Mahaatmya, in a unique manner. Let us warmly accept the importance of a hundred & twenty five crore countrymen, let us respectfully embrace the Mahaatmya, the divine greatness of a hundred & twenty five crore Indians and we’ll garner strength of immense magnitude. We have to do this together. 

My dear countrymen, I maintain time & again that we should keep re - visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture. That lends us energy and inspiration. This year, we the hundred & twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya. For one reason or the other, we confine ourselves to celebrating and observing centenaries of events mostly. For other countries of the world, a century may be of immense significance. But India is such an ancient Nation that we are the proud inheritors of thousands and thousands of years of heritage, knowledge and civilized existence and have an opportunity to observe and celebrate a memorial heritage of over thousand years. Just try and imagine it. Even today breaking the shackles Social orthodoxy is so difficult. How would society be a thousand years ago? What kind of a mindset would be prevalent then? Not many would know that Ramanujacharya relentlessly struggled against rampant social evils such as the class divide, the chasm between touchable and untouchables and the caste system. Through his own conduct, he embraced those who were ostracized by society. A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same. We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself. Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage ‘unity is strength’. 

In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May. I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him. 

My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance. In many parts of the world, it is observed as ‘Labour Day’. And when ‘Labour Day’ is referred to, labour is discussed, labourers are discussed, it is but natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar. You would be aware that for the facilities and respect that workers have earned, we are grateful to Babasaheb. One can never forget the contribution of Babasaheb towards the welfare of the working class. Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, I’m also reminded of the great 12th century saint & social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar. Yesterday I got the opportunity to be part of a function. It was the occasion of dedication to the nation of his collection of Vachana Amrit, the elixir of his spoken words. In the 12th century, he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour & workers. He had mentioned in Kannada “Kaay Kave Kailas”… it means, it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain Kailash, the abode of Shiva. This means, it is only endeavour or Karma that leads you to attain Swarga, or heaven. In other words, labour, hard work is Shiva. I repeatedly mention ‘Shrameva Jayate’, and Dignity of Labour. I distinctly remember the words of Shriman Dattopant Thengdi, the founder of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the thinker, who deliberated a lot on the working class. He used to remark, on the one hand, inspired by Maoism, ‘Workers of the world unite’, on the other he would say, workers, come, unite the world. Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi. 

My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima. Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival. The world today is undergoing a plethora of problems such as violence, war, annihilation, the arms race et al. Amidst this atmosphere, the philosophy of Buddha comes across as extremely relevant. And in India, Ashok’s life perfectly epitomizes the transformation from war to enlightenment. I feel fortunate that the occasion of the great festival of Budha Purnima is celebrated as Vesak day by the United Nations. This year it will take place in Sri Lanka. On this holy event I shall get an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Budha in Sri Lanka. It will be an opportune moment to re-visit his ideals. 

My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas… inclusive development for all. And when we say Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, it is not limited to the confines of India. It applies to the global context too. And very specially to our neighbouring countries. May our neighbouring countries be with us in our journey, may they develop equally. There are many projects under way. On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite. The capacities of this satellite and the facilities it provides will go a long way in addressing South Asia’s economic and developmental priorities. Natural resources mapping, tele medicine, the field of education, deeper IT connectivity or fostering people to people contact - this satellite will prove to be a boon in the progress of the entire region. It is an important step by India to enhance co-operation with the entire South Asia… it is an invaluable gift. This is an appropriate example of our commitment towards South Asia. I welcome all the South Asian countries who have joined us on the South Asia Satellite in this momentous endeavour…. My best wishes to them. 

My dear countrymen, the weather is too hot and inhospitable , take care of your loved ones and take care of yourselves. 

Wish you all the best. 

Thank you

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the holy Vachanas of Basavanna, translated into 23 languages, and addressed an event to mark the inauguration of Basava Jayanthi 2017, and Golden Jubilee Celebration of Basava Samithi, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said India's history is not only about defeat, poverty or colonialism. India gave the message of good governance, non-violence and Satyagraha, he added.

Paying homage to Lord Basaveshwara, he said Basaveshwara had envisioned a democratic arrangement, several centuries ago. He said our land has been blessed with great individuals who have transformed our society. He said reform has always come to our society from within, whenever required. He expressed confidence that reformers would emerge from within the Muslim community itself, to put an end to the pain suffered by some Muslim women, because of the practice of “triple talaq.” He urged the Muslim community not to look at this issue through a political lens.

Describing Lord Basaveshwara’s Vachanas as a basis for good governance, the Prime Minister said the fruits of development such as housing, electricity and roads should reach one and all, without distinction. He said this is the true essence of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.”

The Prime Minister recalled the occasion in November 2015 in London, when he had unveiled the bust of Lord Basaveshwara.

After the event, the Prime Minister walked to the audience to meet the family members of the great Kannada scholar Late Shri M.M. Kalburgi.

                आप सभी को भगवान बसेश्वर की जयंती पर अनेक अनेक शुभ कामनाएं। बसावा समिति भी अपने 50 वर्ष पूरे कर एक उत्तम कार्य के द्वारा भगवान बसेश्वर के वचनों का प्रसार करने में एक अहम भूमिका निभाई है। मैं हृदय से उनका अभिनन्दन करता हूं। 

मैं हमारे पूर्व उपराष्ट्रपति श्रीमान जती साहब को भी इस समय आदर पूर्वक स्मरण करना चाहूंगा। उन्होंने इस पवित्र कार्य को आरंभ किया आगे बढ़ाया। मैं आज विशेष रूप से इसके मुख्य संपादक रहे और आज हमारे बीच नहीं हैं। ऐसे कलबुर्गी जी को भी नमन करता हूं। जिन्होंने इस कार्य के लिये अपने आपको खपा दिया था। आज वो जहां होंगे उनको सबसे ज्यादा संतोष होता होगा। जिस काम को उन्होंने किया था। वो आज पूर्णता पर पहुंच चुका है। हम सब लोग राजनीति से आए दलदल में डूबे हुए लोग हैं। कुर्सी के इर्द-गिर्द हमारी दुनिया चलती है। और अक्सर हमनें देखा है कि जब कोई राजनेता जब कोई रापुरुष उनका स्वर्गवास होता है बिदाई लेता है, तो बड़ी गंभीर चेहरे के साथ उनके परिवारजन जनता जनार्दन के सामने कहते हैं कि मैं अपने पिताजी के अधूरे काम पूरा करूंगा। अब आप भी जानते हैं मैं भी जानता हूं जब राजनेता का बेटा कहता है कि उनके अधूरा काम पूरा करूंगा मतलब क्या करूंगा। राजनीतिक दल के लोग भी जानते हैं कि इसने जब कह दिया कि अधूरा काम पूरा करूंगा, तो इसका मतलब क्या होता है। लेकिन मैं अरविंद जी को बधाई देता हूं की सच्चे अर्थ में ऐस काम कैसे पूरे किये जाते हैं। इस देश के उपराष्ट्रपति पद पर गौर्वपूर्ण जिसने जीवन बिताया, देश जिनको याद करता है। उनका बेटा पिता के अधूरे काम पूरा करने का मतलब होता है। भगवान बसवाराज की बात को जन जन तक पहुंचाना। हिन्दुस्तान के कोने कोने तक पहुंचाना। आने वाली पीढ़ियों के पास पहुंचाना। जति साहब स्वयं तो हमारे सामने बहुत आदर्श की बातें रख कर गए हैं। लेकिन भाई अरविंद भी अपने इस उत्तम कार्य के द्वारा खासकर के राजनीतिक परिवारों के लिये। एक उत्तम आदर्श प्रस्तुत किया है। मैं इसके लिये उनका अभिनन्दन करता हूं। 

समिति के 50 वर्ष पूरे होने पर इस काम में दो दो पीढ़ी खप गई होगी। अनेक लोगों ने अपना समय दिया होगा। शक्ति लगाई होगी। 50 साल दरमियान जिन जिन लोगों ने जो जो योगदान दिया है। उन सबका भी मैं आज हृदय से अभिनन्दन करना चाहता हूं। उनको बधाई देना चाहता हूं। 

मेरे प्यारे भाइयों बहनों भारत का इतिहास सिर्फ हार का इतिहास नहीं है प्राजय का इतिहास नहीं है। सिर्फ गुलामी का इतिहास नहीं है। सिर्फ जुल्म अत्याचार झेलने वालों का इतिहास नहीं है। सिर्फ गरीबी, भुखमरी और अशिक्षा और सांप और नेवले की लड़ाई का इतिहास नहीं भी नहीं है। समय के साथ अलग अलग कालखंडों में देश में कुछ चुनौतियां आती हैं। कुछ यहीं पैर जमा कर बैठ भी गईं। लेकिन ये समस्याएं ये कमियां ये बुराइयां ये हमारी पहचान नहीं हैं। हमारी पहचान है इन समस्याओं से निपटने का हमारा तरीका हमारा Approach भारत वो देश है, जिसने पूरे विश्व को मनवता का, लोकतंत्र का, Good Governance का, अहिंसा का, सत्याग्रह का संदेश दिया है। अलग अलग समय पर हमारे देश में ऐसी महान आत्माएं अवतरित होती रहीं, जिन्होंने सम्पूर्ण मानवता को, अपने विचारों से अपने जीवन से दिशा दिखाई। जब दुनिया के बड़े बड़े देशों ने पश्चिम के बड़े बड़े जानकारों ने लोकतंत्र को, सबको बराबरी के अधिकार को एक नए नजरिये के तौर पर देखना शुरू किया उससे भी सदियों पहले और कोई भी हिन्दुस्तानी इस बात को गर्व के साथ कह सकता है। उससे भी सदियों पहले भारत ने इन मूल्यों का न सिर्फ आत्मसार किया बल्कि अपनी शासन पद्धति में शामिल भी किया था। 11वीं शताब्दि में भगवान बसेश्वसर ने भी एक लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था का सृजन किया। उन्होंने अनुभव मंडप नाम की एक ऐसी व्यवस्था विकसित की जिनमें हर तरह के लोग गरीब हो, दलित हो, पीड़ित हो, शोषित हो, वंचित हो वहां आकर के सबके सामने अपने विचार रख सकते हैं। ये तो लोकतंत्र कि कितनी बड़ी अद्भुत शक्ति थी। एक तरह से यह देश की पहली संसद थी। यहां हर कोई बराबर के थे। कोई ऊंच नहीं भेदभाव नहीं मेरा तेरा कुछ नहीं। भगवान बसवेश्वर का वचन। वो कहते थे, जब विचारों का आदान प्रदान न हो, जब तर्क के साथ बहस न हो, तब अनुभव गोष्टी भी प्रासंगिक नहीं रह जाती और जहां ऐसा होता है, वहां ईश्वर का वास भी नहीं होता है। यानी उन्होंने विचारों के इस मंथन को ईश्वर की तरह शक्तिशाली और ईश्वर की तरह ही आवश्यक बताया था। इससे बड़े ज्ञान की कल्पना कोई कर सकता है। यानी सैकड़ों साल पहले विचार का सामर्थ ज्ञान का सामर्थ ईश्वर की बराबरी का है। ये कल्पना आज शायद दुनिया के लिये अजूबा है। अनुभव मंडप में अपने विचारों के साथ महिलाओं को खुल कर के बोलने की स्वतंत्रता थी। आज जब ये दुनिया हमें woman empowerment के लिये पाठ पढ़ाती है। भारत को नीचा दिखाने के लिये ऐसी ऐसी कल्पना विश्व में प्रचारित की जाती है। लेकिन ये सैंकड़ों साल पुराना इतिहास हमारे सामने मौजूद है कि भगवान बसवेश्वर ने woman empowerment equal partnership कितनी उत्तम व्यवस्था साकार की सिर्फ कहा नहीं व्यवस्था साकार की। समाज के हर वर्ग से आई महिलाएँ अपने विचार व्यक्त करती थीं। कई महिलाएं ऐसी भी होती थीं जिन्हें सामान्य समाज की बुराइयों के तहत तृस्कृत समझा जाता था। जिनसे अपेक्षा नहीं जाती थी। जो उस समय के तथाकथित सभ्य समाज बीच में आए। कुछ बुराइयां थी हमारे यहां। वैसी महिलाओं को भी आकर के अनुभव मंडप में अपनी बात रखने का पूरा पूरा अधिकार था। महिला सशक्तिकरण को लेकर उस दौर में कितना बड़ा प्रयास था, कितना बड़ा आंदोलन था हम अंदाजा लगा सकते हैं। और हमारे देश की विशेषता रही है। हजारों साल पुराना हमारी परम्परा है, तो बुराइयां आई हैं। नहीं आनी चाहिए। आई, लेकिन उन बुराइयों के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ने का माददा भी हमारे भीतर ही पैदा हुआ है। जिस समय राजाराम मोहन राय ने विध्वा विवाह की बात रखी होगी। उस समय के समाज ने कितना उनकी आलोचना की होगी। कितनी कठिनाइयां आई होगी। लेकिन वो अड़े रहे। माताओं बहनों के साथ ये घोर अन्याय है। अपराध है समाज का ये जाना चाहिए। कर के दिखाया। 

और इसलिये मैं कभी कभी सोचता हूं। तीन तलाक को लेकर के आज इतनी बड़ी बहस चल रही है। मैं भारत की महान परम्परा को देखते हुए। मेरे भीतर एक आशा का संचार हो रहा है। मेरे मन में एक आशा जगती है कि इस देश में समाज के भीतर से ही ताकतवर लोग निकलते हैं। जो कानबाह्य परम्पराओं को तोड़ते हैं। नष्ट करते हैं। आधुनिक व्यवस्थाओं को विकसित करते हैं। मुसलमान समाज में से भी ऐसे प्रबुद्ध लोग पैदा होंगे। आगे आएंगे और मुस्लिम बेटियों को उनके साथ जो गुजर रही है जो बीत रही है। उसके खिलाफ वो खुद लड़ाई लड़ेंगे और कभी न कबी रास्ता निकालेंगे। और हिन्दुस्तान के ही प्रबुद्ध मुसलमान निकलेंगे जो दुनिया के मुसलमानों को रास्ता दिखाने की ताकत रखते हैं। इस धरती की ये ताकत है। और तभी तो उस कालखंड में ऊंच नीच, छूत अछूत चलता होगा। तब भी भगवान बसवेश्वर कहते थे नहीं उस अनुभव मंडप में आकर के उस महिला को भी अपनी बात कहने का हक है। सदियों पहले ये भारत की मिट्टी की ताकत है कि तीन तलाक के संकट से गुजर रहे हमारी माता बहनों को भी बचाने के लिये उसी समाज से लोग आएंगे। और मैं मुसलमान समाज के लोगों से भी आग्रह करूंगा कि इस मसले को राजनीति के दायरे में मत जाने दीजिये। आप आगे आइये इस समस्या का समाधान कीजिए। और वो समाधान का आनन्द कुछ और होगा आने वाले पीढ़ियां तक उससे ताकत लेगी। 

साथियों भगवान बसवेश्वर के वचनों से उनकी सिक्षाओं से बने सात सिद्धांत इंद्रधनुष के सात रंगों की तरह आज भी इस जगह को एक छोर से दूसरे छोर तक जोड़े हुए है। आस्था किसी के भी प्रति हो किसी की भी हो हर किसी का सम्मान हो। जाती प्रथा, छू अछूत जैसी बुराइयां न हों सबको बराबरी का अधिकार मिले इसका वे पुरजोर समर्थन करते रहते थे। उन्होंने हर मानव में भगवान को देखा था। उन्होंने कहा था। देह वे एकल, अर्थात ये शरीर एक मंदिर है। जिसमें आत्मा ही भगवान है। समाज में ऊंच नीच का भेद भाव खत्म हो। सब का सम्मान हो। तर्क और वैज्ञानिक आधार पर समाज की सोच विकसित की जाए। और ये हर व्यक्ति का सशक्तिकरण हो। ये सिद्धांत किसी भी लोकतंत्र किसी भी समाज के लिये एक मजबूत Foundation की तरह है मजबूत नीव की तरह है। वो कहते हैं ये मत पूछो कि आदमी किस जात मत का है इब या रब ये कहो कि यूं नमव। ये आदमी हमारा है। हम सभी के बीच में से एक है। इसी नीव पर एक मजबूत राष्ट्र का निर्माण हो रहा है। यही सिद्धांत एक राष्ट्र के लिये नीति निर्देशन का काम करते हैं। हमारे लिये ये बहुत ही गौरव का विषय है की भारत की धरती पर 800 वर्ष पहले इन विचारों को भगवान बसवेश्वर ने जन भावना और जनतंत्र का आधार बनाया था। सभी को साथ लेकर चलने की उनके वचनों ने वही प्रतिध्वनि है जो इस सरकार के सबका साथ सबका विकास का मंत्र है। बिना भेद भाव कोई भेद भाव नहीं बिना भेद भाव इस देस के हर व्यक्ति को अपना घर होना चाहिए। भेदभाव नहीं होना चाहिए। बिना भेद भाव हर किसी को 24 घंटे बिजली मिलनी चाहीए। बिना भेद भाव हर गांव में गांव तक सड़क होना चाहिए। बिना भेद भाव हर किसान को सींचाई को लिये पानी मिलना चाहिए। खाद मिलना चाहिए, फसल का बीमा मिलना चाहिए। यही तो है सबका साथ सबका विकास। सबको सात लेकर और ये देश में बहुत आवश्यक है। सबको सात लेकर के सब के प्रयास से सबके प्रयत्न से सबका विकास किया जा सकता है। 

आप सबने भारत सरकार की मुद्रा योजना के बारे में सुना होगा। यह योजना देश के नौजवानों को बिना भेदभाव बिना बैंक गारंटी अपने पैरों पर खड़े होने के लिये अपने रोजगार के लिये कर्ज देने के लिये शुरु की गई है। without guaranty, अब तक, अब तक देश के साढ़े तीन करोड़ो लोगों को इस योजना के तहत तीन लाख करोड़ से ज्यादा कर्ज दिया जा चुका है। आप ये जानकर के हैरान हो जाएंगे कि इस योजना के तहत कर्ज लेने वालों में और आज 800 साल के बाद भगवान बसवेश्वर को खुशी होती होगी कि ये कर्ज लेने वालों में 76% महिलाएं हैं। सच कहूं तो जब ये योजना शुरू की गई थी, तो हम सबको भी ये उम्मीद नहीं थी कि महिलाएं इतनी बड़ी संख्या में आगे आएंगी इससे जुड़ेंगी। और स्वयं entrepreneur बनने की दिशा में काम करेंगी। आज ये योजना महिला सशक्तिकरण में एक बहुत अहम भूमिका निभा रही है। गांव में, गलियों में छोटे छोटे कस्बों में मुद्रा योजना महिला उद्यमियों का एक प्रकार से बड़ा तांता लग रहा है। भाइयों बहनों भगवान बसवेशर का वचन सिर्फ जीवन का ही सत्य नहीं है। ये सुशासन, गवर्नेन्स, राजकर्ताओं के लिये भी ये उतने ही उपयोगी है। वो कहते थे कि ज्ञान के बल से अज्ञान का नाश है। ज्योति के बल से अंधकार का नाश है। सत्य के बल से असत्य का नाश है। पारस के बल से लोहत्व का नाश है। व्यवस्था से असत्य को ही दूर करना है तो सुशासन होता है वही तो गुड गवर्नेन्स है। जब गरीब व्यक्ति को मूल्य वाली सब्सिडी सही हाथों में जाती है, जब गरीब व्यक्ति का राशन उसी के पास पहुंचता है, जब नियुक्तियों में सिफारिशें बंद होती हैं। जब गरीब व्यक्ति को भ्रष्टाचार और काले धन से मुक्ति के प्रयास किये जाते हैं, तो व्यवस्था में सत्यता का ही मार्ग बढ़ता है और वही तो भगवान बसवेश्वर ने बताया है। जो झूठा ह गलत है, उसे हटाना पारदर्शिता लाना Transparency वही तो good governance है। 

भगवान बसवेश्वर कहते थे, मनुष्य जीवन निस्वार्थ कर्म योग से ही प्रकाशित होता है। निस्वार्थ कर्मयोग। शिक्षामंत्री जी। वे मानते थे समाज में निस्वार्थ कर्मयोग जितना बढ़ेगा उतना समाज से भ्रष्ट आचरण भी कम होगा। भ्रष्ट आचरण एक ऐसा दीमक है, जो हमारे लोकतंत्र को हमारी सामाजिक व्यवस्था को भीतर से खोखला कर रहा है। ये मनुष्य से बराबरी का अधिकार छीन लेता है। एक व्यक्ति जो मेहनत करके ईमानदारी से कमा रहा है, जब वो देखता है कि भ्रष्टाचार करके कम मेहनत से दूसरे ने अपने लिये जिन्दगी आसान कर ली है। तो एक पल के लिये एक पल ही क्यों न हो लेकिन वो ठिठक कर सोचता जरूर है शायद वो रास्ता तो सही नहीं है। सच्चाई का मार्ग छोड़ने के लिये कभी कभी मजबूर हो जाता है। गैर बराबरी के इस एहसास को मिटाना हम सभी का कर्तव्य है। और इसलिये अब सरकार की नीतियों को निर्णयों को भली भांति देख सकते हैं कि निस्वार्थ कर्मयोग को ही हमारी यहां प्राथमिकता है और निस्वार्थ पाएंगे। हर पल अनुभव करेंगे। आज बसवाचार्यजी के ये वचन उनके विचारों का प्रवाह कर्नाटक की सीमाओं से बाहर लंदन की Thames नदी तक दिखाई दे रहा है।

मेरा सौभाग्य है कि मुझे लंदन में बसवाचार्य जी की प्रतिमा का अनावर्ण करने का अवसर मिला जिस देश के बारे में कहा जाता था कि इसमें कभी सूर्यास्त नहीं होता। वहां की संसद के सामने लोकतंत्र को संकल्पित करने वाली बसवाचार्यजी की प्रतिमा किसी तीर्थस्थल से कम नहीं है। मुझे आज भी याद है। उस समय कितनी बारिश हो रही था और जब बसवाचार्य जी की प्रतिमा लगाई जा रही थी, तो स्वयं मेघराजा भी अमृत बरसा रहे थे। और ठंड भी थी। लेकिन उसके बाद भी इतने मनोयोग से लोग भगवान बसवेश्वर के बारे में सुन रहे थे उनको कौतुक हो रहा था कि सदियों पहले हमारे देश में लोकतंत्र, woman empowerment, equality इसके विषय में कितनी चर्चा थी। मैं समझता हूं उनके लिये बड़ा अजूबा था। साथियों अब ये हमारी शिक्षा व्यवस्था की खामियां मानिये या फिर अपने ही इतिहास को भुला देने की कमजोरी मानिये। लेकिन आज भी हमारे देश में लाखों करोड़ों युवाओं को इस बारे में पता नहीं होगा कि 800 – 900 साल पहले हजार साल पहले हमारे देश में सामाजिक मूल्यों की पुनर्स्थापना के लिये जन जागरती का कैसा दौर चला था। कैसा आंदोलन चला था हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में कैसे चला था। समाज में व्याप्त बुराइयों को खत्म करने के लिये उस काल खंड में 800 हजार साल पहले की बात कर रहा हूं। गुलामी के वो दिन थे। हमारे ऋषियों ने संत आत्माओं ने जन आंदोलन की नीव रखी थी । उन्होंने जन आंदोलन को भक्ति से जोड़ा था। भक्ति ईश्वर के प्रति और भक्ति समाज के प्रति दक्षिण से शूरू होकर भक्ति आंदोलन का विस्तार महाराष्ट्र और गुजरात होते हुए उत्तर भारत तक हो गया। इस दौरान अलग अलग भाषाओं में अलग वर्गों के लोगों ने समाज में चेतना जगाने का प्रयास किया। इन्होंने समाज के लिये एक आईने की तरह काम किया। जो अच्छाइयां थी जो बुराइयां थी वो न सिर्फ शीशे की तरह लोगों के सामने रखीं बल्कि बुराइयों से भक्ति का रास्ता भी दिखाया। मुक्ति के मार्ग में भक्ति का मार्ग अपनाया। कितने ही नाम हम सुनते हैं। रामानुजा कार्य, मधवाचार्य, निम्बकाचार्य, संत तुका राम, मीरा बाई, नरसिंह मेहता, कबीरा, कबीर दास, संत रैय दास, गुरुनानक देव, चैतन्य महाप्रभु अनेक अनेक महान व्यक्तियों के समागम से। भक्ति आंदोलन मजबूत हुआ। इन्हीं के प्रभाव से देश एक लंबे कालखंड में अपनी चेतना को स्थिर रखता है। अपनी आत्मा को बचा पाया। सारी विपत्तियां गुलामी के कालखंड के बीच में हम अपने आप को बचा पाए थे, बढ़ पाए थे। एक बात और आप ध्यान देंगे, तो आप पाएंगे कि सभी ने बहुत ही सरल सहज भाषा में समाज तक अपनी बात पहुंचाने का प्रयास किया। भक्ति आंदोलन के दौरान धर्म, दर्शन, साहित्य की ऐसी त्रिवेणी स्थापित हुई जौ आज भी हम सभी को प्रेरणा देती है। उनके दोहे उनके वचन उनकी चौपई उनकी कविताएं, उनके गीत, आज भी हमारे समाज के लिये उतने ही मूल्यवान है। उनका दर्शन उनकी फ्लोशॉफी, किसी भी समय की कसौटी पर पूरी तरह फिट बैठती है। 800 साल पहले बसवेश्वर जी ने जो कहा, आज भी सही लगता है कि नहीं लगता है।

साथियों आज भक्ति आंदोलन के उस भाव को उस दर्शन को पूरे विश्व में प्रचारित किये जाने की आवश्यकता है। मुझे खुशी है कि 23 भाषाओं में भगवान बसवेश्वर के वचनों का कार्य आज पूरा किया गया है। अनुवाद के कार्य में जुटे सभी लोगों का मैं अभिनन्दन करता हूं। आपके प्रयास से भगवान बसवेश्वर के वचन अब घर-घर पहुंचेंगे। आज इस अवसर पर मैं बसवा समिति से भी कुछ आग्रह करूंगा। करुं न, लोकतंत्र में जनता को पूछ कर के करना अच्छा रहता है। एक काम हम कर सकते हैं क्या इन वचनों के आधार पर एक quiz bank बनाई जाए। questions और सारे वचन डिजीटली ऑनलाइन हो और हर वर्ष अलग अलग आयु के लोग इस quiz कॉम्पीटीशन में ऑनलाइन हिस्सा लें। तहसील पर डिस्टिक लेवल पे स्टेट इन्टरस्टेट, इन्टरनेशनल लेवल पर एक कॉम्पीटीशन साल भर चलता रहे। कोशिश करें पचास लाख एक करोड़ लोग आएं। quiz competition में भाग लें। उसके लिये उसको वचनामृत का एक स्टूडेंट की तरह अध्ययन करना पड़ेगा। quiz competition में हिस्सा लेना पड़ेगा। और मैं मानता हूं अरविंद जी, इस काम को आप अवश्य कर सकते हैं। वरना क्या होगा इन चीजों को हम भूल जाएंगे। मैं जिस दिन पार्लियामेंट में मेरी मुलाकात हुई। जैसा उन्होंने कहा कि उन दिनों नोट बंदी को लेकर चर्चा थी। लोग जेब में हाथ लगाकर घूम रहे थे। जो पहले दूसरों के जेब में हाथ डालते थे, उस दिन अपने जेब में हाथ डालकर। और उस समय अरविंदजी ने मुझे बसवाचार्य जी का एक कोटेशन मुझे सुनाया था। इतना परफेक्ट था। अगर वो मुझे 7 तारीख को मिल गया होता तो मेरे आठ तारीख को जो बोला जरूर उसका उल्लेख करता। और फिर कर्नाटक में क्या क्या कुछ बाहर आता आप अंदाजा लगा सकते हैं। और इसलिये मैं चाहूंगा कि इस काम को आगे बढ़ाया जाए। इसे यहां रोका ना जाए। और आज जो नई जनरेशन है जो इनका तो गूगल गुरू है। तो उनके लिये रास्ता सही है उनको, बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में इसको, दूसरा ये भी कर सकते हैं कि इस वचन अमृत और आज के विचार दोनों के सार्थकता के quiz competition हो सकता है। तो लोगों को लगेगा कि विश्व के किसी भी बड़े महापुरुषों के वाक्य के बराबरी से भी ज्यादा शार्पनेश 800-900 पहले हमारी धरती के संतान में थी। हम इस पर सोच सकते हैं। और एक काम मैं यहां सदन में जो लोग हैं वो जो देश दुनिया में जो भी इस कार्यक्रम को देख रहे हैं वो भी। 2022 हमारे देश की आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं। 75 साल जैसे बीत गए क्या वैसे ही उस वर्ष को भी बिता देना है। एक और साल एक और समारोह ऐसा ही करना है क्या। जी नहीं, आज से ही हम तय करेंगे। 2022 तक कहां पहुंचना है। व्यक्ति हो संस्था हो, परिवार हो, अपना गांव हो, नगर हो, शहर हो, हर किसी का संकल्प होना चाहिए। देश की आजादी के लिये जिन्होंने अपनी जान की बाजी लगा दी, जेलों में अपनी जिन्दगी बिता दी देश के लिये अर्पित कर दी। उनके सपने अधूरे हैं उन्हें पूरा करना हम सबका दायित्व बनता है अगर सवा सौ करोड़ देश वासी 2022 को देश को यहां ले जाना है मेरे अपने प्रयत्न से ले जाना है। वरना सलाह देने वाले तो बहुत मिलेंगे। हां सरकार को ये करना चाहिए सरकार को ये नहीं करना चाहिए। जी नहीं सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी क्या करेगा। और तय करे और तय करके चल पड़े कौन कहता है दुनिया में बसवाचार्य जी का सपने वाला जो देश है , दुनिया है वो बनाने में हम कम रह सकते हैं, वो ताकत लेकर के हम साथ चलें। और इसलिये मैं आपसे आग्रह कर रहा हूं कि आप इस समिति के द्वारा जिन्होंने इन विचारों को लेकर काम बहुत उत्तम किया है आज मुझे उन सभी सरस्वती के पुत्रों से भी मिलने का दर्शन करने का सौभाग्य मिला। जिन्होंने इसको पूर्ण करने में उन्होंने रात दिन खपाई हैं। कनड भाषा सीखी होगी उसमें से किसी ने गुजराती किया होगा, किसी ने सनिया किया होगा, उर्दू किया होगा, उन सबको मुझे आज मिलने का अवसर मिला मैं उन सबका भी हृदय से बहुत बहुत अभिनन्दन करता हूं। इस काम को उन्होंने परिपूर्ण करने के लिये अपना समय दिया, शक्ति दिया, अपना ज्ञान का अर्चन उस काम के लिये किया। मैं फिर एक बार इस पवित्र समारोह में आपके बीच आने का मुझे सौभाग्य मिला। उन महान वचनों को सुनने का अवसर मिला और इस बहाने मुझे इसकी ओर जाने का मौका मिला। मैं भी धन्य हो गया, मुझे मिलने का सौभाग्य मिला मैं फिर आप सबका एक बार धन्यवाद करता हूं बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

                My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of birth anniversary of Lord Basveshwar. I heartily congratulate the Basava committee  which played an important role in spreading the noble teachings of Lord Basveshwara during the past 50 years of its existence.

I would like to gratefully remember former vice president of India, Mr. Jatti who carried forward this noble work. I offer my special regards to Mr. Kalburgi, who was the Chief Editor of this. Unfortunately he is not amongst us today. He dedicated his life for this work. Wherever they may be now they must be feeling happy that the work started by them achieved its goal. We all are politicians, stuck in political swamp. Our world revolves around power. And we have seen that whenever a political person passes away their family members solemnly appear before the public and commit that they would fulfill the incomplete work of their father. You know it very well, what it means when a political person’s son promises to fulfill his father’s incomplete work. Political people also know what it means. However, I congratulate Arvind Ji for fulfilling such duties in the true sense of the word. The person who discharged the glorious duty of vice president of India, who is remembered by the nation, his son showed how to fulfill the incomplete work of his father, to convey the message of Lord Basavaraj to the people, to every nook and corner of this country, to convey it to future generations. Mr. Jatti himself showed many ideals to us but brother Arvind has also set a remarkable example, particularly for political families by his noble deeds and I offer my regards to him for this.  

Two generations have dedicated themselves to this work in the fifty years of the committee’s existence. Many people would have contributed to this work, many would have spent their energy. I congratulate to all those who contributed to this cause in these fifty years.  

My dear brothers and sisters, India’s history is not only of defeats, setbacks and slavery. Neither is it the history of bearing with the atrocities and oppression. Our history is not only of poverty, starvation, illiteracy and of snake charmers. The country faced several problems in the course of history, some of which remained with us. But, these problems, shortcomings, and social evils are not our identity. Our identity is how we dealt with these problems, how we approached these shortcomings. India is the country that gave the world the message of humanity, democracy, good governance, non-violence and passion for truth (passive resistance). Down the ages, our country have given birth to many great men who set up dazzling  examples for mankind through their life, their work, their ideas. Centuries before top western thinkers began talking about democracy and equal human rights ordinary Indians  observed them as a way of life. These values were not only adopted by Indians at that time but they were also included in the system of governance then. Lord Basveshwar too created a democratic set up in the 11th century AD. He developed a system that was called Anubhav Mandap, in which anyone who was a Dalit, who was  poor, who was oppressed or deprived, could come there and express his feelings before everyone. This was the unique power of democracy. In a way, this was the first senate of the country. Everybody was equal there, there was no discrimination, no hierarchy, this was the word of Lord Basveshwar. He used to say that where there is no exchange of ideas, where there is no debate based on logic or reason, then even the Aunbhav Mandap becomes irrelevant; and God does not dwell in such a place. It means that he considered the exchange of ideas as powerful and as essential as God itself. Could anybody imagine a more enlightened thought? It means that hundreds of years ago the power of an idea, the power of knowledge was considered equal to God. This may surprise the modern world, however, women were allowed to freely discuss the issues at Anubhav Mandap. Today, when this world lectures us on woman empowerment, these things are done with the aim to lower the dignity of India in the world. However, this hundreds of years old history is before us that Lord Basveshwar implemented the system for woman empowerment and equal partnership; he just did not discuss it but he implemented it too. Women from every section of the society used to express their ideas. Some of them were looked down upon due to social evils of that time. These women were not expected to speak among the so called elite of that period. These social evils were there in our society. Even those women had full rights to come in the Anubhav Mandap and express their ideas. We can see that in that period how important that effort was, that movement was for woman empowerment. And this is the uniqueness of our country; it’s thousands of years old civilization for social evils to creep in; it happened, however, we also developed capacity to fight those social evils. When Raja Ram Mohan Roy mooted the idea of widow marriage, the society of that time would have vehemently criticized him, but he remained steadfast despite plenty of hurdles. Raja Ram Mohan Roy showed that this was a collective sin of the society on the mothers and sisters and it must go and he saw it through.   

And that is why sometimes I think; today this big debate is going on over the  Triple Talaq issue. However, given the great tradition of India, I’m hopeful that this country has produced many great men who broke obsolete customs and developed modern systems. There could be many wise men in the Muslim community who would come forward and fight against the injustice perpetrated against the Muslim women. These Indian Muslims will give guidance to the Muslims world over. This is the power of this soil. That’s why despite untouchability and social  order prevalent at that time, Lord Basveshwar used to say that even the women from the lowest class could and speak at the Anubhav Mandap.  That was the power of Indian soil that wise people would come up from the Muslim community to protect their mothers and sisters facing the dangers of Triple Talaq. And I will urge upon members of the Muslim community not to look at this issue from the prism of politics, please come forward and resolve the problem. And that resolution of the issue will give you immense satisfaction and future generations will benefit from this.  

Friends, the seven principles derived from the teachings of Lord Basaveshwara still cover this place from one end to the other like the seven colours of a rainbow. It could be anybody’s faith, faith could be for anyone but everyone must be respected. He vehemently supported equal rights for everyone and elimination of social evils like caste system and untouchability.

He saw God in every human being. He said this human body is like a temple and your soul is God’s spirit residing in it; and this discrimination of upper caste, lower caste must end from the society and everyone should be respected. And society’s thought process must be developed on scientific and logical basis. And everyone should be empowered. These principles are like a solid foundation for any democratic society. He used to say that don’t ask the caste of someone, instead you say that this person is ours, he is one from amongst us. And a strong country is developed on this foundation. These principles work like the directive principles for a nation. It’s a matter of great pride for us that 800 years ago Lord Basaveshwara used these ideas as a foundation for public opinion and democracy in India. His message of taking everyone along is reflected in this government’s policy of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas (Support for everyone, development for everyone). Everyone in this country must have his home without any discrimination. There should be no discrimination; everyone should get round the clock electricity without any discrimination, roads must be laid to every village without any discrimination, without any discrimination every farmer should get water for irrigation, and also fertilizer and crop insurance. This is precisely Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas (Support for everyone, development for everyone) and this is essential for this country. Everybody can be developed by taking everyone’s support, due to everyone’s efforts.

You must have heard of Mudra scheme of the Government of India. This scheme was launched  to provide loan to the youth to start enterprises  to make them self reliant. Under this scheme, over three lakh crore rupees have been advanced to nearly 3.5 crore people without any guarantee. And you will be surprised to know that, even 800 years after his demise, Lord Basaveshwara would also be happy to note that under this scheme 76% beneficiaries were women. To be honest with you, when this scheme was started we had no inkling that women would come forward in such a large number to associate with this scheme and develop themselves as entrepreneurs. This scheme is playing very important role in women empowerment. Mudra Scheme has created large number of women entrepreneurs across the villages, across the streets and across the small towns. Brothers and sisters, Lord Basveshara’s word are not only a true philosophy of life but they are equally useful in good governance, equally useful for political class. He used to say that the power of knowledge can destroy ignorance. Power of light can destroy darkness. Power of truth destroys falsehood. Power of Midas stone converts the properties of iron. If the falsehood is removed from the system then that is the good governance. When the subsidy meant for poor reaches him, when the ration meant for poor reaches him, when recommendations don’t work for appointments, when efforts are made to set the poor free from corruption and black money then the truth within the system flourishes; and the message of Lord Basveshawar is the same. Good governance is removing the unfairness and falsehood from the system.

Lord Basweshwar used to say that a man’s life can attain glory only through selfless service of others, selfless service. Mr. Education Minister, if the selfless service gains prominence in the society then corrupt practices will be reduced in equal measure. Corrupt practices are like a termite that is weakening our social system from inside. It snatches the right of equality from man. If a man, who has been working hard to earn his bread, if he sees that the other person has made his life comfortable by corrupt means then for a moment he might think that the path chosen by him was not correct. He might be compelled to abandon the path of honesty. It’s our duty to eliminate this feeling of inequality. That’s why anyone can see this thing in the policies of the government that selfless service has been given the preference, you will find selfless service and will experience it all the time. Today, one can see that the power of Lord Basveshwara’s ideas flowing out of the boundaries of state of Karnataka and has reached to the banks of Thames river in London.

I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Lord Basveshwara in London. In a country, where the sun never used to set in its empire, installation of a statue of Basvacharya Ji who conceptualized the democracy, is no less than a pilgrim. I still remember that there was incessant rain when the statue of Basvacharya Ji was installed and the rain God himself was showering his blessings and it was very cold, but despite bad weather people were listening about Lord Basaveshwara with curiosity, they were curious that hundreds of years ago there was so much discussion about democracy, woman empowerment and equality in our country. I think that it was surprising for them. Friends, you see it was either the shortcomings of our education system or it was our ignorance towards our history but millions and millions of youth in our country still do not know about the movement that was launched 800-900 years ago for generating public awareness in our country, for the establishment of social values. What kind of movement it was, it touched every corner of the country. That was 800 years ago, it was a period of slavery when it was started to eradicate social evils from the society. Our sages, our saints started the foundation for people’s movement. They linked that people’s movement with devotion to God. Devotion to God and devotion to the society started from south further expanded to Maharastra and Gujarat and then it touched North India. During this period, people from different classes, people speaking different languages tried to enlighten the society. The acted like a mirror to the society; they not only showed what was good and bad in the society but they also showed the path to get rid of those evils. They adopted the path of devotion for salvation. Today we hear a lot of names, Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Nimbakacharya, Saint Tukaram, Meera Bai, Narsingh Mehta, Kabira, Kabir Das, Saint Raidas, Guru Nanak Dev, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Bhakti Marg was strengthened due contribution of many great saints. And due to their influence the country can remain steadfast in its spirit, could save its soul. We could develop; we could save ourselves despite all the dangers, despite the period of slavery. If you notice, you’d find that all of them tried to convey their message in a very simple, very easily understandable language. During the Bhakti period, a confluence of religion, philosophy was established, that trinity still inspires us. Their couplets, their poems, their songs are still invaluable to our society. Their philosophy is still totally relevant in this modern time. Whatever, Lord Basaveshara said 800 years ago that still feels right. Does it feel right or not?

Friends, today there is a need to spread Bhakti Movement, its feeling throughout the world. I’m happy to note that the work to translate Lord Basveshwara’s words in 23 languages has been completed today; I express my gratitude to all those people associated with the work of translation. Lord Basaveshwara’s word would reach every household due to your efforts. I’d also request Basava Samiti for something on this occasion. Shall I? It’s better to ask people in a democratic set up. Can we do one thing, can we prepare a quiz bank on the basis of these teachings? All the questions and teachings must be digitally available online; every year people from different age groups should participate in this competition online. The competition should be conducted at Tehsil level, at district level, state, interstate and then at international level throughout the year. You should target participation of fifty lakh to one crore people, they should participate in the quiz competition. They will have to study Vachnamrita, his teachings, as a student. I believe, Arvind Ji, you can certainly do this. Otherwise, we’d forget these things. When we met in the parliament, at that time the note ban decision was talk of the town. People were walking with their hands in their pockets. People who used to eye others’ pocket were saving their own pockets that day. Then Arvind Ji narrated a quote of Basvacharya Ji. That was so perfect that had I got that quotation on the seventh October then I’d have certainly mentioned that quote in my address to the nation on 8th October. And then you can guess what would have happened in Karnataka. Therefore it’s my wish that we must organise this quiz competition. And we should not stop there, today’s new generation considers Google as its Guru. Therefore this is the right way for them, second, we can also organize a quiz competition on the relevance of Vachan Amrit and today’s ideas. Then the people will realize that there was more sharpness in our people 800-900 years ago than the words spoken by the greatest philosopher of the world. One more thing, the people present here in this hall and also those who are watching this programme world over, we’re completing 75 years of our independence in 2022. Shall we waste that year the way we wasted 75 years? Do you want to just organize one more programme like this on that occasion? No. We’d decide today itself.  Every individual, every institution, every family, every village, every city, they all must set their target of what they want to achieve by 2022. The people who risked their lives for India’s independence, spent their lifetime in jails, sacrificed their lives for the country; their dreams are not fulfilled and it is our duty to fulfill them. If 1.25 billion Indians decide that by 2022 the country must achieve these things, and this must be accomplished due to our own efforts. Otherwise, there is no dearth of people offering their advice that the government must do this or that; it should be like this and not like that. What will the 1.25 billion people of this country do?  They must march ahead towards  their target and we should march ahead with strength. And therefore I urge you through this committee which has done very good work on Lord Basweshwar’s  ideas to march ahead.  Today I am fortunate to meet those knowledge workers who worked tirelessly to finish this noble task; those who learnt Kannada, those who  translated his teachings in Gujarati, others who translated them in Sania, in Urdu.  I am fortunate to meet all of them and I offer my kind regards to all of them who spent their day and night to fulfill this noble work, applied their knowledge, their strength to fulfill this work. I am fortunate to join you in this holy work and listen to those noble words. I also got oriented to these teachings through this program. I am thankful to you and lucky to meet you. Once again I thank all of you and convey my best wishes to you.

                Your Excellency, the President of Cyprus, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Friends from the Media,   
 

I am delighted to welcome you, Excellency, on your first State Visit to India. I know that India has enjoyed a special place in the heart of every Cypriot President. Almost all of them have visited India. So, it is indeed an honour for me to welcome such a great friend and strong supporter of India. Cyprus and India share rich legacies of ancient civilizations and, our civilizations have influenced each other through millennia. In modern times, our relationship goes back to the pre-independence era, when our founding fathers supported the freedom struggle of Cyprus. And, Cyprus too has always reciprocated with its warmth and friendship. India has always stood by Cyprus on all crucial issues. In 1974, India took a firm stand in support of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus . India has contributed personnel to the UN Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus. Three force commanders from India served in this capacity, and it is heartening for me to know that all of them are fondly remembered in Cyprus.  

 

Excellency, 

I am aware of your initiative for resolving the Cyprus issue. You have led from the front in trying to bring a new era of peace, development and security. Not just for Cyprus, but for the whole region. We wish you every success in your efforts. Under your leadership, Cyprus has successfully overcome its recent financial and banking challenges. And, recorded one of the highest growth rates in the Euro zone in 2016. Excellency, we commend your vision and leadership for taking your country out of this crisis and on to the path of economic prosperity. 

 

Friends, 

Today, the President and I have had detailed discussions. Our conversation covered the full range of bilateral relationship. We also exchanged perspectives on important global and regional issues of mutual concern. Cyprus and India enjoy close economic ties. Cyprus is the 8th largest investor in India. Last year, to boost our capital and investment linkages, we have revised the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. The President and I agreed that India offers excellent investment opportunities for Cypriot entrepreneurs. The industry and business in our two economies can shape attractive partnerships through the flagship programmes launched by my Government. The beautiful landscapes of Cyprus and the wide horizons of ‘Incredible India’ can be a source of tourism promotion in both our countries.  


Friends, 

India and Cyprus share the common objective of bringing about an early reform of the United Nations Security Council. Both of us believe that a reformed Security Council, reflective of the world as it is, and not as it was, is necessary to address the range of complex challenges facing the world today. Excellency, in this context, I deeply appreciate your support for India’s claim for a permanent seat in an expanded UN Security Council. The President and I also discussed ways to strengthen our partnership in other inter-governmental organizations and regimes.  

 

Friends, 

Given its location, Cyprus appreciates the threat that terrorism poses to the global peace and stability. India itself has been battling cross border terrorism for decades. We agreed that there is an urgent need for all countries to decisively act against those states who generate, support, shelter and sustain these factories of violence in our regions. The President and I discussed the need for creating a comprehensive global legal framework, particularly through early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. 

 

Excellency, 

I share with you the strong commitment to take our bilateral engagement to a new level. I am confident that our discussion and decisions today will give a new direction and depth to our partnership. Let me welcome you once again to India, and wish you a fruitful and productive stay.  

Thank you.  

Thank you very much.

                मेरे प्‍यारे देश वासियों बहुत तेजी से भारत के मध्‍यमवर्गीय जीवन में एक नये expressions नये सपने नये संकल्‍प और कुछ करने की हिम्‍मत देश महसूस कर रहा है। एक ऐसा वर्ग है जिन्‍हें अगर अवसर मिले तो देश को विकास की नई ऊंचाइयों को ले जाने में कल्‍पना बहार के उत्‍तम परिणाम दे सकते हैं। 

विशेषकर इस जो युवा है 1st generation रिस्क टेकिंग capacity जिसकी सबसे ज्‍यादा है ये बहुत बड़ा वर्ग है। अगर इन युवाओं को अवसर मिलेगा तो वो देश की तकदीर भी बदल देंगें, देश की तस्‍वीर भी बदल देंगें। पूरा विश्‍व ये मानता है कि भारत में हवाई यात्रा के लिए Aviation के लिए विश्‍व में सबसे ज्‍यादा अवसर कहीं है तो भारत में है। बहुत पहले ये हमारी सोच ये बनी थी, हवाई यात्रा , ये राजाओं महाराजाओं का ही विषय है और इसलिए हमारी Airlines के साथ जो logo जुड़ा था वो भी महाराजा का जुडा़ था और जब अटल जी सरकार थी वो हमारे राजीव प्रताप रूड़ी Aviation Ministry में थे तो मैंने एक दिन तब तो मैं पार्टी का काम करता था और हिमाचल में ही रहता था तो मैं एक बार उनसे मिला मैंने कहा भाई क्‍या ये logo नहीं बदल सकते क्‍या? पूछे क्‍या? मैंनें कहा कि इससे लग रहा है कि हवाई जहाज और हवाई यात्रा ये एक ही वर्ग के लोगों के लिए है तो उन्‍होंने कहा कि क्‍या करें मैंने कहा कुछ मत करिए cartoonist Laxman का जो common man है उसी logo में लगा लीजिए उसकी permission ले लीजिए और मुझे खुशी है कि अटल जी की सरकार के समय उस common man को भी समाविष्‍ट किया गया था | 

उस समय जबकि मैं किसी राजनीतिक पद पर नहीं था मैं संगठन का काम करता था लेकिन उस समय मेरी समझ में आता था कि ये जो सोच है राजा महाराजाओं के साथ जुड़ी हुई है उसको बदलना है और उसमें से हमारे विभाग से मैंने आग्रह किया कि एक तो देश में एक सबसे बड़ी कमी है कि हमारी कोई Aviation Policy नहीं है। इतना बड़ा देश है, इतनी संभावनाए है, विश्‍व का ध्‍यान है एक Aviation Policy बनाएं, कसौटी पर कसे। सारे स्‍टेट होल्‍डर को उसमें विश्‍वास में लें और नीति के आधार पर इसके expansion की एक design तैयार करें। मुझे खुशी है कि आजादी के बाद पहली बार देश में Aviation Policy बनाने का सौभाग्‍य हमारी सरकार को मिला। अब उस समय मैंने पहली मिटिंग में कहा था कि Aviation को मैं किस रूप में देखता हूं हमारे देश में गरीब व्‍यक्ति की एक पहचान है कि वो हवाई चप्‍पल पहनता है और मैंने उस मिटिंग में कहा था कि मैं चाहता हूं कि हवाई जहाज में हवाई चप्‍पल वाले लोग दिखाई दें। और आज ये संभव हो रहा है ...आज शिमला और दिल्‍ली को हवाई यात्रा से नांदेड़ और हैदराबाद को, हमारे नड्डा जी यहां है वो यहां हिमाचल के हैं , शिमला से जुड़ने का आनंद उनको विशेष है। और मैं दिल्‍ली से आया हूं तो मुझे और ज्‍यादा आनंद है। 

आज हम टैक्‍सी में जाएं by road एक किलोमीटर का किराया आठ से दस रुपया होता है। दिल्‍ली-शिमला की हवाई यात्रा ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा एक घंटे में अगर रोड पर मैं यात्रा करके आता है तो कम से कम नौ घेंटे, अगर रोड मार्ग से आया मैं तो किलोमीटर का हिसाब लगाऊं और दस रुपया हिसाब लगाऊं मैं, और पहाड़ पर दस से तो ज्‍यादा हो जाता है। ये सफर ऐसी है जो समय भी बचाएगी और इसका खर्च टैक्‍सी में अगर किलोमीटर का दस रुपया लगता है तो नई पालिसी के तहत हवाई यात्रा का किलोमीटर का खर्चा सिर्फ छ: या सात रुपया लगेगा। नांदेड़ से आज हैदाराबाद शुरू हो रहा है लेकिन नांदेड़ से मुंबई सबसे पहले इसके बाद शुरू होने वाली व्‍यवस्‍था है और मैं Aviation कंपनियों को एक सीख देना चाहता हूँ और ये जो मैं उनको advice दे रहा हूं इसके लिए मेरी तरफ से कोई Royalty charge नहीं करूंगा। मैं मुफ्त में उनको advice दे रहा हूं अगर Aviation कंपनियां व्‍यापरिक दृष्टि से सोचते है तो सोचे कि नांदेड़ साहिब, अमृतसर साहिब और पटना साहिब अगर हवाई circular route बनाएगें दुनिया भर के सिख यात्री इस हवाई यात्रा का सबसे ज्‍यादा लाभ उठाएगें। 

बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम हागा कि जब द्वितीय विश्‍व युद्ध हुआ तो ज्‍यादातर eastern part में बहुत सारी हवाई पट्टियां बनी, सीमावर्ती क्षेत्रों में भी बहुत सारी हवाई पट्टियां बनी लेकिन कभी उसका अभी उपयोग नहीं हुआ। कुछ तो ऐसी हवाई पट्टिया होंगी जहां से लोग सामान उखाड़ कर के ले गए होंगे। देश आजाद होने के बाद आज हम सत्‍तर साल आजादी के पूरे हो गए लेकिन सिर्फ सत्‍तर-पच्‍चतहर ही एयरपोर्ट ऐसे हैं जो commercial purpose के लिए काम आ रहे हैं। सत्‍तर साल में सत्‍तर-पच्‍चतहर एयरपोर्ट इस नई पालिसी के द्वारा एक साल के भीतर-भीतर इससे ज्‍यादा नये एयरपोर्ट commercial activity के लिए जोड़ दिये जाएगें। भारत के टायर टू cites growth engine बन रहे हैं। विकास के अंदर ऊर्जा भरने की ताकत टायर टू टायर थ्री cites में आ रहे हैं अगर वहां पर air connectivity मिल जाती है तो पूंजी निवेशक Management Experts, Education के लिए quality Man power इन सबको अगर सुविधा connectivity की मिलती है तो उस जगह पर ये भी विकास की संभावनाए बढ़ जाती हैं। दुनिया में सबसे तेज गति से विकास हो रहा है Tourism का लेकिन Tourism में destination पर पहुंचने के बाद यात्री कष्‍ट झेलने को तैयार होता है, उसको पसंद भी आता है मेहनत करना पसंद आता है, पहाड़ चढ़ना पसंद आता है, पसीना बहाना पसंद आता है लेकिन पहुंचने तक वो सबसे ज्‍यादा अच्‍छी सुविधा पसंद करता है उसे अगर air connectivity मिलती है, अगर उसे internet connectivity मिलती है, उसको अगर वाईफाई सुविधा मिलती है तो वो उस destination को पहले पसंद करता है।

वहां जाने के बाद वो कष्‍ट झेलने को तैयार है, risk लेने को तैयार है लेकिन जाने और आने की सुविधा वो पहले पसंद करता है। शिमला में अब ये व्‍यवस्‍था अब फिर से आरंभ हो रही है, बहुत सालों तक ये अटका पडा रहा। मुझे विश्‍वास है कि हिमाचल के Tourism को बहुत बड़ा बल मिलेगा इससे। 2500 रुपया सबसे ज्‍यादा है ऐसी टिकट की व्‍यवस्‍था 2500 और 2500 से कम करना है।

North-East भारत का एक ऐसा भू-भाग है देखते ही बनता है एक बार जो गया उसको बार-बार जाने का मन कर जाये ऐसा हमारा North-East है| प्रकृति का वहां ऐसा वास्तव्य मिलता है जो शायद कहीं और मिलता हो। लेकिन connectivity के अभाव से हिंदुस्‍तान का सामान्‍य नागरिक वहां जुड़ नहीं पाता है ये देश के integration के लिए भी बहुत बढ़ा उत्‍सव होने वाला है। इससे सिर्फ यात्रा की सुविधाएं नहीं, दो भू-भाग, दो कल्‍चर, दो परंपराए बड़ी सहजता से जुड़ जाती हैं। मुझे खुशी है कि देश में हवाई यात्रा की दृष्टि से सामान्‍य नागरिक को और इसका जो उड़ान (UDAN ) नाम है वो उड़े देश का आम नागरिक उस से उड़ान शब्‍द बना है। और जैसा मैंने कहा कि हवाई यात्रा में हवाई चप्‍पल वाला नजर आना चाहिए, और सब उड़ें...सब जुड़ें । 

देश के एक कोने से दूसरे कोने को जोड़ने को एक महा‍अभियान इससे हो रहा है। मेरे लिए खुशी की बात है कि यहां एक दूसरे कार्यक्रम का भी launching हो रहा है उसका शिलान्‍यास हो रहा है। Human Resource development जितना area specific होता है फोकस होता है उतनी हमारे देश की क्षमता बढ़ती है। भारत के पास Hydro Power की बहुत संभावना है अनुमा‍नित कल्‍पना है कि करीब-करीब डेढ़ लाख से ज्‍यादा मेगावाट बिजली हम Hydro से कर सकते हैं उसके लिए human resource चाहिए Man Power चाहिए और उसके लिए dedicated institutions चाहिए। हिमाचल प्रदेश और पूरा हिमालयन प्‍लेट जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर से लेकर के पूरा वहां पर hydro power project की बहुत संभावना है अगर यहां के नौजवानों को hydro से संबंधित engineering की शिक्षा मिलती है specialize subject उसका तैयार होते हैं र्मैं समझता हूं ये बहुत बड़ी सेवा होगी और इसलिए Mechanical Engineering बाकी सारे विषय भी होंगे। लेकिन special focus hydro power से संबंधित होगा उसकी शिक्षा का एक बहुत बड़ा काम बिलासपुर में होने वाला है उसके शिलान्‍यास का आज अवसर मुझे मिला है। मैं हिमाचल वासियों को और देश की युवा पीढ़ी को ये नजराना देते हुए बड़ा गर्व अनुभव कर रहा हूं और एक प्रकार से आज देश हिमाचल की धरती से air power का भी अनुभव कर रहा है और hydro power का भी अनुभव कर रहा है।

वायु शक्ति और जल शक्ति आज के विकास के अंदर बहुत बड़ी ताकत बनते हैं और जो हम New India का सपना देख रहे हें जिसमें जन-धन का सामर्थ्‍य है, वन-धन का सामर्थ्‍य है, जल-धन का भी उतना ही सामर्थ्‍य है उस सामर्थ्‍य को लेकर के हमें आगे बढ़ना है। मैं फिर एक बार भारत सरकार के इस विभाग को aviation department को उनके सभी अधिकारियो को उनके तमाम मंत्री श्री और उनके नेतृत्‍व को ह्दय से बहुत बधाई देता हूं कि बहुत ही महत्‍वाकांक्षी ये योजना का आरंभ हो रहा है जो बहुत ही कम समय में हिंदुस्‍तान के नये growth center की हवाई उड़ान भरने की ताकत उससे मिलने वाली हैं मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं,

धन्‍यवाद

Reviewing Mission Indradhanush for universal immunization of children, the Prime Minister asked for targeted attention in strict timeframes for the 100 worst performing districts in this regard. He said youth organizations such as NCC and Nehru Yuva Kendra could be involved in the outreach effort to ensure that no child was left without the benefit of immunization. 

Reviewing the implementation of Swachhta Action Plans, the Prime Minister said that events such as Swachhta fortnights should be converted into movements towards permanent solutions. On the AMRUT Mission, the Prime Minister asked officials to quantify and document the gains achieved through the use of latest technology, such as LED bulbs, so that the benefits could be better appreciated by one and all. 

The Prime Minister urged all Secretaries of the Government of India, and all Chief Secretaries of States, to come up with concrete plans and objectives for transformative change, to be achieved by the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022. With regard to cleanliness, he urged for maximum efforts ahead of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary by 2019.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Tuesday reviewed progress of key infrastructure sectors including roads, railways, airports, ports, digital, and coal. The review meeting, which lasted for about four and a half hours, was attended by top officials from PMO, NITI Aayog and all infrastructure Ministries of the Government of India. 

In course of the presentation made by CEO NITI Aayog, it was noted that remarkable progress has been made in several areas and infrastructure sectors. In a broad overview of the progress in the roads and railways sectors, the Prime Minister called for a consolidated approach to existing projects, and working towards their completion within strict timelines. 

The highest ever average daily construction rate of 130 km, has been achieved for rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. This has led to an addition of 47,400 km of PMGSY roads in 2016-17. 11,641 additional habitations have been connected with roads in the same period. 

Over 4000 km of rural roads have been constructed using green technology in FY17. The use of non-conventional materials such as waste plastic, cold mix, geo-textiles, fly ash, iron and copper slag is being pushed aggressively. 

The Prime Minister directed efficient and stringent monitoring of rural roads construction and their quality. For this, he emphasized on use of space technology in addition to the technologies already being used, such as the “Meri Sadak” App. He called for expeditious completion of vital links which will connect the remaining unconnected habitations at the earliest. 

The Prime Minister directed the use of new technologies in road construction also. He asked NITI Aayog to examine global standards in the application of technology for infrastructure creation, and their feasibility in India. 

In the highways sector, over 26,000 km of 4 or 6 lane national highways have been built in FY17, and the pace is improving. 

In the railways sector, 953 km of new lines were laid in 2016-17, as against the target of 400 km. Track electrification of over 2000 km, and gauge conversion of over 1000 km was achieved in the same period. More than 1500 unmanned level crossings have been eliminated in 2016-17. Among measures to enhance customer experience, Wi-Fi access was enabled in 115 railway stations, and 34,000 bio-toilets added. The Prime Minister called for speeding up of work related to redevelopment of Railway Stations, and greater creativity in the generation of non-fare revenue. 

Progress of important projects in the roads and railways sectors, such as the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, Char Dham Project, the Quazigund-Banihal Tunnel, the Chenab railway bridge, and the Jiribam-Imphal project was also reviewed. In the aviation sector, the Regional Connectivity Scheme will connect 43 destinations, including 31 unserved destinations. The passenger capacity in the aviation sector has reached 282 million passengers per annum. 

In the ports sector, under the Sagarmala project, 415 projects have been identified with investment of Rs. 8 lakh crore, and projects worth 1.37 lakh crore rupees have been taken up for implementation. The Prime Minister stressed on better outcomes for turnaround time of ships and clearance for Exim cargo. The highest ever capacity addition of 100.4 MTPA in major ports has been recorded in 2016-17. All 193 lighthouses are now powered by solar energy. Digitization of land records has been completed in all major ports. 

In the digital infrastructure sector, 2187 mobile towers have been installed in districts affected by Left Wing Extremists, in 2016-17. Progress of the National Optical Fibre Network was reviewed. The Prime Minister emphasized that the emerging digital connectivity network, which will connect thousands of Gram Panchayats within the next few months, should be backed up by appropriate governance steps, so that it can lead to better quality of life, and greater empowerment of people in the rural areas. 

In the coal sector, rationalization of coal linkages and movement yielded an annual saving of over Rs 2500 crore in 2016-17. Noting the decline in coal imports in the last year, the Prime Minister asked for even more vigorous efforts towards coal import substitution, and application of new coal technologies including gasification technology.

आप लोग इतने अनुभवी हैं। मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि आपको अपनी शक्ति का एहसास नहीं है और न ही आपको चुनौतियों का अंदाज है, ऐसा नहीं है। शक्ति का भी पता है, चुनौतियों का भी पता है, जिम्‍मेदारियों का भी पता है। और हमने देखा है कि यही उपलब्‍ध व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत देश को उत्‍तम परिणाम भी मिले हैं। लेकिन आज से 15-20 साल पहले और आज की स्थिति में बहुत अंतर है और आज से पांच साल की स्थिति में शायद बहुत ही अंतर होगा। क्‍योंकि 15-20 साल पहले हम ही हम थे, जो कुछ थे हम ही थे। सामान्‍य मानव की जिंदगी की सारी आवश्‍यकताएं हमारे रास्‍ते से ही गुजरती थी। उसको पढ़ना था तो सरकार के पास ही आना पढ़ता था, वो बीमार होता था तो सरकार के पास ही आना पड़ता था। उसको सीमेंट चाहिए, लोहा चाहिए तो भी सरकार के पास आना पड़ता था। यानी जीवन का वो कालखंड था, जिसमें सरकार ही सबकुछ थी। और जब सरकार ही सब कुछ थी तो हम ही हम सब कुछ थे और जब हम ही हम सब कुछ होते हैं तो बुराईयां आने की स्‍वाभाविक प्रवृति रहती है। कमियां नजरअंदाज करने की आदत भी बन जाती है, लेकिन पिछले 15-20 साल एक competition का कालखंड शुरू हुआ है। और उसके कारण सामान्‍य मानव भी यह comparison करता है कि भई सरकार का हवाई जहाज तो ऐसे जाता है, private हवाई जहाज ऐसे जाता है। और उसको तुरंत लगता है सरकार बेकार है। सरकार वाले बेकार है, क्‍यों उसको यह alternate देखने को मिला है। 

पहले उसको सरकारी अस्‍पताल में डॉक्‍टर प्‍यार से भी आ जाए कुछ न करे, ऐसे ही BP नाप ले, तो भी उसको लगता है मेरी त‍बियत ठीक हो रही है, डॉक्‍टर ने मेरी सेवा की है। आज दस बार भी डॉक्‍टर आ जाए, तो यह सरकारी है, private में गया होता तो अच्‍छा होता। यानी सामान्‍य मानव के जीवन में 10-15-20 साल में एक alternate उपलब्‍ध हुआ है। अब alternate उपलब्‍ध होने के कारण सरकार नाम की व्‍यव्‍सथा की और सरकार में बैठे हुए लोगों की और विशेषकर सिविल सर्विस से जुड़े हुए लोगों की जिम्‍मेदारी आज से 20 साल पहले थी उससे ज्‍यादा बढ़ गई है। कार्य बोझ नहीं बढ़ा है। चुनौती बढ़ी है। कार्य के बोझ के कारण कठिनाइयां नहीं पैदा हुई है। चुनौतियों की तुलना में खड़े रहने में कमी पा रहे हैं। कोई भी व्‍यवस्‍था स्‍पर्धा में होनी ही चाहिए और वही qualitative change लाने के लिए बहुत बड़ा role play करती है। अगर स्‍थगितता है, aspirations नहीं है, तुलानात्‍मक कोई व्‍यवस्‍था नहीं है तो लगता है जो है सब अच्‍छा है। लेकिन जब तुलनात्‍मक स्थिति आती हमें भी लगता है कि हमें आगे बढ़ना है। अब उसका उपाय यह नहीं है कि यार उसे नीचे गिराओ, हम आगे दिखने चाहिए, नहीं जो भी बढ़ सकते हैं उनको बढ़ाते रहना और अच्‍छा यह होगा कि जितना जल्‍दी हम हमारी कार्यशैली को बदलें, हम हमारे सोचने के तरीके को बदले। जितना जल्‍दी हम regulator के मिजाज से निकल करके एक enabling entity के रूप में develop होंगे। तो यह चुनौती अवसर में पलट जाएगी। जो आज हमें चुनौती लग रही है, वो अवसर बन जाएगी और इसलिए बदलते हुए समय में सरकार के बिना कमी महसूस हो, लेकिन सरकार के रहते बोझ अनुभव न हो। ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था कैसे विकसित करें। और यह व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित तब होगी, जब हम चीजों को उस तरीके से देखना शुरू करेंगे। 

अब यहां पर कुछ प्रयास चल रहा है। आप सिर्फ इस Civil Service Day को ही याद कीजिए कि पहले ऐसा था, अब ऐसा है क्‍यों? इसका जवाब यह तो नहीं होना चाहिए कि प्रधानमंत्री ने सोचा और हमने कर दिया, जी नहीं। सोचने का तरीका यह होना चाहिए कि इतना बड़ा अच्‍छा अवसर होता था हमने इसको ritual बना दिया था। अगर प्राणवाण बनाते हैं, उसमें प्राण भर देते हैं, अपने आप को जोड़ देते हैं, आने वाले दिनों की सोच रखते हैं तो वही अवसर हमें एक नई ताकत दे देता है। इस एक अवसर में जो बदलाव नजर आ रहा है और अगर आपको यह सही लगता है, तो आपके हर काम में यही संभावनाएं अंतरनिहित है, inherent हैं। सिर्फ उसको एक बार स्‍पर्श करने की आवश्‍यकता होती है, अनुभूति होने लग जाएगी। क्‍या हम इससे इन बातों को सिख सकते हैं। क्‍या कारण हैं आप भी तो कभी उसी प्रक्रिया से निकलेंगे हैं। आपने भी किसी गांव में काम किया। धीरे-धीरे करके district में आए, ऐसा करते-करते हम पहुंचे हैं। और भी बहुत लोग होंगे जो पिछले बार भी district में काम करते थे, इस बार भी district में काम करते हैं। लेकिन पहले उनको नहीं लगा, इसलिए entry hundred से भी कम आई। और इस बार एकदम से ज्‍यादा आई। quantum jump तो हुआ है और मैं इसका स्‍वागत करता हूं। हो सकता है किसी ने पूछा होगा कि क्‍या तुमने भेजा कि नहीं भेजा? तो उसको लगा कि यार नहीं भेजने से भी सवला उठेगा, इसलिए भेज तो दो। लेकिन जब मेरे सामने रिपोर्ट आया तो मेरा दिमाग कुछ और चलने लगा। मैंने कहा ऐसा कीजिए भाई अच्‍छा है quantum jump हुआ है। 100 से नीचे थे, अब 500 से ज्‍यादा हो गए, अच्‍छी बात है। अब थोड़ा qualitative analysis होना चाहिए। हम यह तो देखे कि जिसको हम भले number one, number two, number three नहीं देने पाएंगे, लेकिन at least seriously देखना पड़े, मन करे यार जरा देख तो सही कैसा किया है। excellence की category में आए, इसमें इतने कितने हैं। मैं वे आंकड़ा बताना नहीं चाहता हूं, Live TV चल रहा है। लेकिन फिर भी मैं संतुष्‍ट इसलिए हूं, चलो भई एक शुरूआत हुई, quantum jump हुआ। अब मैं चाहता हूं कि एक साल में qualitative change होना चाहिए। excellence से नीचे तो कोई entry होनी ही चाहिए। क्‍योंकि इस व्‍यवस्‍था में वो लोग हैं जिनको excellence का ठप्‍पा लगा है, तभी तो यहां पहुंचे हैं जी। 

यह ठीक है कि उन्‍होंने कोई coaching class join किए होंगे.. चलिए आप लोग समझ गए। लेकिन फिर भी ठप्‍पा तो लग गया कि जो Excellency है वो यही पर है। अगर Excellency यही पर है यह ठप्‍पा है फिर perform भी तो वैसे ही करने का हमें आदत बनानी होगी और धीरे-धीरे कभी-कभार आपने देखा होगा कि एक गृहणी होती है, कभी उसका रूतबा, उसका कौशल्‍य, उसकी क्षमता परिवार में नो‍टिस ही नहीं होती। एक taken for granted होता है। लेकिन परिवार का मुखिया ईश्‍वर ने अगर छीन लिया अचानक ध्‍यान आता है कि कल तक चूल्‍हे से जुड़ी हुई एक गृहणी पूरे परिवार का कारोबार चलाने लग जाती है। बच्‍चों की परवरिश ऐसी उत्‍तम कर देती है। और अड़ोस-पड़ोस के पुरूषों को भी शर्मिंदगी हो इतना उत्‍तम अपने पारिवारिक जीवन को ऊँचाई पर ले जाती है। कल तक वो गुमनाम थी, मतलब inherent ताकत पड़ी थी, जैसे ही अवसर आया उसने अपने आप को खिला डाला, विकसित करते हुए जिम्‍मेदारियों को निभाया। यहां वो लोग हैं exam देते हुए कितने ही pressure से गुजरे होंगे, लेकिन अब आपके पास इतनी बड़ी व्‍यव्‍सथा आ गई है। इतना बड़ा अवसर आ गया है, चीजों को नये तरीके से देखना का मौका मिल गया है। क्‍या आप इसे अपनाते हैं। एक मैं अनुभव कर रहा हूं, Hierarchy का बोझ वो तो है ही है। शायद वो ब्रिटिशों के जमाने की विरासत है, जो मसूरी से भी में से हम निकाल नहीं पाए। लेकिन मुझे सब आता है, मेरे जमाने में तो ऐसा होता था। अरे तू अभी नया आया है यार हम तो कई साल पहले, 20 साल पहले district करके आए हैं, यह जो अनुभव का बोझ है। वो बोझ हम ट्रांसफर करते चले जा रहे हैं। हम सोचे सीनियर लोग सोचे यह अनुभव बोझ तो नहीं बन रहा है। कहीं हमारा अनुभव नये experiment के लिए ब्रेक का काम तो नहीं कर रहा है। कहीं मुझे ऐसा तो नहीं लग रहा है कि मैं अब यहां secretary बन गया हूं। उस district में मैं पहले काम करता था मैंने मेरे समय में इस काम को पूरा करने की कोशिश की थी, नहीं किया। 20 साल बीत गए। अब यह नया लड़का आया है वो कर रहा है, यार मेरी इज्‍जत खराब हो जाएगी। कोई पूछेगा कि तू था नहीं हुआ, देख इस बच्‍चे ने कर दिया। तो मेरे अनुभव का बोझ ब्रेक बढ़ रहा है और मैं ही रूकावट बन जाता हूं। किसी दूसरे district का तो कर दूंगा, लेकिन जिस district में मैं काम करके आया था और मेरे रहते नहीं हुआ था। अब तू कर करके कमाई नहीं कर सकता इज्‍जत... यह है। अच्‍छा लगे, बुरा लगे, लेकिन यह है। हमें गर्व होना चाहिए कि जिस खेत को मैंने जोता था, मैं वहां से चल निकला, लेकिन मेरे बाद जो आया उनसे पानी का प्रबंध किया था। उसके बाद तीसरा आया वो कहीं से पौधा ले आया था। चौथा आया उसने उसको वटवृक्ष बनाया। पांचवा आया, मेरे पास फल ले करके आ गया। पांचों का मूल्‍य है, जब जा करके परिणाम हुआ है। यह भाव के साथ अगर इस परंपरा को हम आगे बढ़ाएंगे तो हम शक्ति जोड़ंगे और शक्ति को जोड़ना यह हम लोगों का प्रयास हो सकता है। हमें कोशिश करनी चाहिए। 

मैंने पिछली बार भी कहा था सिविल सर्विस की सबसे बड़ी ताकत क्‍या रही है। और यह छोटी ताकत नहीं है। और गुजराती हम एक कहावत है, हिंदी में क्‍या होगा, मुझे मालूम नहीं है। ठोठनिशार यानि होशिआर नि कद्र यानी जो पढ़ने में weak होता है, उसको जो पढ़ने में तेज होता है, उसकी कीमत उसको ज्‍यादा feel होती है कि हां यह तेज है जो बिल्‍कुल weak होता है, उसको पता है। पैसा एक गुण जो है आपका वो हम पॉलिटिशनों को बराबर समझ आता है। और मैं समझता हूं कि यह बहुत बड़ी ताकत है। इसको खोने नहीं देना चाहिए। बहुत बड़ी ताकत है और वो है, अनामिकता। 

कई अफसर आप देखेंगे उन्‍होंने अपने कार्यकाल में ऐसी कोई vision उनके मन में आया होगा, idea आया होगा। उसको कार्यरत किया होगा, उसका पूरा implementation का framework बनाया होगा और उसके परिणाम पूरे देश को मिलते होंगे। लेकिन खोजने जाने पर भी पता नहीं चलेगा यह कौन अवसर था, यार। किसको idea आया था। कैसे किया था। यह अनामिका, यह इस देश के सिविल सर्विस की उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम ताकत है, ऐसा मैं मानता हूं। क्‍योंकि मुझे मालूम है कि इसकी ताकत क्‍या होती है। लेकिन दुर्भाग्‍य से कहीं, उसमें कमी तो नहीं आ रही है। मैं सोशल मीडिया की ताकत को पहचानने वाला इंसान हूं। उसके महत्‍मय को समझने वाला इंसान हूं। लेकिन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को विकास अगर उसके माध्‍यम से होता हो, और यह व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को जनता जनार्दन से जोड़ने के काम आता है, तब तो उसका उपयोग है। अगर मैं सोशल मीडिया के नेटवर्क के द्वारा एक district का अफसर हूं और मैं टीकाकरण का प्रचार करने के लिए सोशल मीडिया का उपयोग करता हूं कि 20 तारीख को टीकाकरण है, जरूर आइये, बात पहुंचाइये। मैं सोशल मीडिया का उपयोग कर रहा हूं, लेकिन अगर मैं टीकाकरण में दो बूंद पिलाने गया हूं और मेरी फोटो फेसबुक पर प्रचारित कर रहा हूं तो अनामिका के लिए मैं सवालिया निशान बन जाता हूं। एक ही व्‍यवस्‍था को मैं कैसे उपयोग करूं। आज मैं देखता हूं district level के जो अफसर हैं वो इतने busy हैं, इतने busy हैं, इतने busy हैं कि ज्‍यादातर समय इसी में जाता है। मैंने आजकल मेरी मीटिंगों में सबको एंट्री बंद कर दी है। वरना सारी मीटिंगों में निकाल करके शुरू हो जाता है। जो ताकत किस काम के लिए आनी चाहिए, किसके लिए नहीं आनी चाहिए। इसका अगर विवेक नहीं रहेगा। आवश्‍यक है कि जन-जन तक पहुंचने के लिए उत्‍तम साधन हमारे हाथ आया है। 

E-governance से M-governance की ओर दुनिया चल पड़ी है। Mobile governance ये समय का सत्‍य है, हम इससे दूर नहीं रह सकते। लेकिन वो जन-आवयकताओं की पूर्ति के लिए हो, जन-सुविधाओं की पूर्ति के लिए हो, मैं समझता हूं ये जो अनामिका; ये जो हमारी पूरी ताकत रही है। ताजमहल कितनों ने design की होगी, कितनों ने concept paper तैयार किए होंगे, कितनों ने परिश्रम किया होगा, लेकिन न आप जानते हैं, न मैं जानता हूं; लेकिन ताजमहल हमें याद दिलाता है By and large इस क्षेत्र के लोगों ने यही काम किया है जीवन भर कभी कभार तो उसको खुद को भी पूछोगे रिटायर होने के बाद, 20 साल के बाद पूछोगे भई जरा एक पांच चीजें बताओ, तो उसको भी याद नहीं क्‍योंकि उसने इतना समर्पण भाव से वो जुड़ गया है तो उसको लगा कि अरे भई मैंने करते में था, मैंने कर दिया, चल दिए, चलो आगे चलो भाई। ये कितनी बड़ी ताकत है हमारे देश के पास। और उस ताकत के मालिक आप हैं। और इसका मूल्‍य मुझे बराबर समझ है क्‍योंकि हमें मालूम है कि हम लोगो की जो फोटो इधर से उधर हा जाए तो भी हमारी रात खराब हो जाती है, हम लोगों की बिरादरी ऐसी है। और इसलिए मुझे मालूम है कि अपने की पहचान बनाए बिना देश के लिए दिन-रात काम करना, ये छोटी चीज नहीं है जी। इसको मैं भली-भांति appreciate कर सकता हूं जी। इसकी ताकत मैं भली-भांति समझता हूं। लेकिन ये जो परंपरा हमारी आगे की पीढ़ी ने और हमारी senior पीढ़ी ने जो निर्माण किए हैं, उसको बरकरार रखना हमारी नई पीढ़ी की बहुत बड़ी जिम्‍मेदारी है और उसको कहीं खरोंच न आ जाए, ये देखने की आवश्‍यकता है। 

हम ये civil service day मना रहे हैं तब governance के reform के लिए दुनिया भर की कमेटियां बनी होंगी, कमीशन बैठे होंगे; केंद्र सरकार में बैठे होंगे, राज्‍य सरकार में बैठे होंगे। और जिन्‍होंने बनाया होगा, उन्‍होंने भी पूरा पढ़ा नहीं होगा। क्‍योंकि 6 लोगों ने piece लिखें होंगे फिर किसी ने तीसरे ने उसको combine किया होगा। ये जो सच्‍चाई है जिसे अच्‍छा लगे बुरा लगे, जो reality है ये। और उसके बाद तो शायद address भी पता नहीं होगा, कहां पड़ा है। राज्‍यों में भी ऐसे ढेर सारे, हर सरकार को लगा होगा, कुछ reform करेंगे, कुछ reform करेंगे, commission बनाएंगे और ठीक है कुछ लोगों को काम-धाम मिल जाता है रिटायर होने के बाद, लेकिन बदलाव नहीं आता है। मेरा आज भी अनुभव से मैं कह सकता हूं, मेरा सद्भाग्‍य रहा है कि मैं भी अगर आपकी तरह इस व्‍यवस्‍था में होता, हो नहीं सकता था क्‍योंकि मुझे coaching class तो कहीं मिलना नहीं था, लेकिन 16 साल कोई नौकरी करे तो क्‍या बन सकता है, deputy secretary बन जाता है, क्‍या बनता है? हैं, Director बन जाता है, तो मैं Director की category में आ जाता, क्‍योंकि मैं 16 साल से आप लोगों के साथ काम कर रहा हूं। इसी व्‍यवस्था के साथ आप ही लोगों के बीच काम कर रहा हूं। और इसलिए मेरा मत है और मैंने अनुभव देखा है, सचमुच में इस व्‍यवस्‍था में काम करने वालों का जो अनुभव है और उनके सुझाव हैं, इससे बड़ा reform के लिए कोई commission सुझाव दे ही नहीं सकता जी, ये हमारी गलत सोच है जी। आप लोगों के पास जो है, उससे उत्‍तम सुझाव बाहर से आ ही नहीं सकता साहब। ये हम अभी भी उसको न तवज्‍जो देते हैं और न ही हम उसको follow करते हैं। क्‍या हम अपने character में ला सकते हैं, भई छोटा सा व्‍यक्ति अपने अनुभव से ये जो exercise चल रहा है ना, जो paper लिख रहा है, नए लोगों से मैंने चार latest जो batch के लोग हैं, उनसे कहा भई आप लिख करके दो, एक नई thought process आए हमारे पास, आए, सबने लिखा। हो सकता है कुछ ने cut-paste किया होगा। मैंने देखा नहीं पूरा लेकिन ये सब मनुष्‍य का स्‍वभाव है होता रहता है। लेकिन फिर भी, फिर भी कुछ न कुछ ऐसा आया होगा, जिसमें मंथन हुआ होगा। अब ये व्‍यवस्‍था का मुख्‍य लोगों का काम है कि ये जो exercise था, हमने कोई degree पाने के लिए नहीं की है; academic ranking के लिए नहीं की है, मेरा पेपर स्‍वीकृत होगा इसके लिए नहीं की है। जो आए हैं, अनुभव की बातें आई हैं, धरती पर काम करने वाले इंसान ने कहीं हैं, जो रोजमर्रा किसानों के साथ जिंदगी गुजारता है, रोजमर्रा अपने clerical काम करने वालों से जिंदगी गुजारता है, जो अपने नए Computer-operator के साथ जिंदगी गुजारता है, Office timing के कारण और सीजन के साथ जो crisis आते हैं, वो जिसने देखा है; उसने कहा है। 

हम इसको एक Holy-book की तरह पकड़ सकते हैं क्‍या? भले ही छोटे व्‍यक्ति ने कहा हो, लेकिन हमारे अंदर से कहा है तो उसकी ताकत बहुत बड़ी है, ये हम अपना mind-set तैयार कर सकते हैं क्‍या? आप देखिए। हमें, अच्‍छा, जब अंदर से बात आती है तो उसकी ownership होती है जी। Ownership किसी भी success की पहली guarantee होती है जी। सफलता तब मिलती है जबकि Team ownership लेती है। ownership की संख्‍या जितनी ज्‍यादा बढ़ती है, सफलता उतनी तेजी आती है, जिम्‍मेवारी कम हो जाती है, बोझ कम हो जाता है, परिणाम का यश सबको मिलता है। ये जो प्रयास है वो एक प्रकार का ownership का movement है। ये दो दिन जो हम बैठते हैं ना, ये सबसे बड़ी बात है एक ownership का movement है। हर किसी को लगता है कि हां ये देश मेरा है, सरकार मेरी है, जिम्‍मेवारी मेरी है, परिणाम मुझे लाना है, समस्‍या का समाधान मुझे देना है। 

ये बात निश्चित है कि व्‍यक्ति के तौर पर इंसान की सही कसौटी कब होती है, आपको भी भलीभांति पता होगा क्‍योंकि आप उस जगह पर बैठे हैं। अभावग्रस्‍त अवस्‍था, ये व्‍यक्ति का सही मूल्यांकन नहीं करती है। प्रभावग्रस्‍त अवस्‍था व्‍यक्ति का सही मूल्‍यांकन करती है। आपके पास सब है फिर भी आप अलिप्‍त हैं, तब जाकर करके पता चलता है कि हां, ये कुछ बात है। कुछ नहीं है तो लगता है यार, ठीक है ऐसे ही जीते हैं; तो कोई देखता ही नहीं है, महत्‍व ही नहीं है इसका। आपके पास हर प्रकार का प्रभाव है, पूरी शासन व्‍यवस्‍था आपकी उंगलियों पर है, आपके शब्‍द की ताकत है, आपकी साइन की, तो किसी की दुनिया इधर से उधर बदल जाती है; तब जाकर आप क्‍या करते हैं ये आपकी कसौटी है। और इसलिए अभावग्रस्‍त अवस्‍था में न व्‍यक्ति का मूल्‍यांकन सफल होता है, प्रभावग्रस्‍त वयवस्‍था में होता है। 

उसी प्रकार से प्रगति में contribution, By and large हम देश में ऐसे कालखंड से गुजरे हैं, हमारे में से बहुतों की सोच अभाव के बीच कैसे रास्‍ते खोजना, उसकी रही है। विपुलता के बीच कैसे काम करना, ये By and large हमारे बहुत बड़ा class है जिसकी सोच में बैठता नहीं है। उसको ये तो मालूम था कि अकाल हो तो कैसे perfect management करना है लेकिन उसको ये मालूम नहीं था कि भरपूर पाक पैदा हो तो कैसे management करना है, वहां फिर वो चूक जाता है। उसे ये तो मालूम था कि engineering collage में सीट खाली हो तो लोगों को कैसे admission देना, लेकिन जब सीटें कम पड़ जाएं और विद्यार्थियों की संख्‍या बढ़ जाए तब कैसे manage करना, तो वो संकट में पड़ जाता है। 

जिस तरह देश बढ़ रहा है, जिस तरह देश में जन-सामान्‍य के expressions के साथ उसका परिश्रम जुड़ रहा है, तो विपुलता के भी दर्शन हो रहे हैं। कम पानी है तो कैसे नहाना आ जाता है लेकिन fountain ऊपर चल रहा है और कम पानी से नहाने की सूचना आए तो follow करना मुश्किल हो जाता है। हम विपुलता के बीच, जहां-जहां विपुलता की संभावनाएं दिख रही हैं, या विपुलताओं को हमारे सामने नजर के देख रहे हैं, उसके लिए हमारी stagey बदल सकते हैं क्‍या? हम अपनी mind-set बदल सकते हैं क्‍या? नहीं तो हम बड़े बन नहीं पाऐंगे जी। हमारी सोच की सीमा वही रहेगी जी। हमने उस चुनौतियों को स्‍वीकार कर करके आगे बढ़ने के लिए सोचा है जी। 

जैसे मैंने कहा शुरू में हमारा अपने-अपने में था, दूसरे district के साथ भी competition नहीं था। ये district जो है वहां पानी है इसलिए खेती अच्‍छी होती है, वहां सूखा है इसलिए खेती नहीं होती; होता है, होता है, मैं, मेरे पूर्वजों ने भी ये किया, ऐसा था। अब सिर्फ district, district नहीं, दुनिया इतनी बदल चुकी है कि अब राज्‍यों, राज्‍यों के बीच competition है, अब देश और देश के बीच competition है, कल और आज के बीच competition है। हर पल हमने इस प्रथा की चुनौतियों से अपने आपको ऊपर उठाना है और वैश्विक संदर्भ में भी करने की आवश्‍यकता है। 

Civil service की एक और ताकत, और मैं मानता हूं उसकी ताकत भी है उसका धर्म भी है, Civil service के व्‍यक्ति को उस धर्म से चलित होने का कोई हक नहीं है; और वो है, वो district में बैठा हो, तहसील में बैठा हो या final authority के रूप में बैठा हो; उसका दायित्‍व बनता है, हर proposal को, हर घटना को, हर निर्णय को राष्‍ट्रहित के तराजू से ही तौलना, उसे टुकड़ों में देखने का अधिकार नहीं है। ये निर्णय मैं यहां करता हूं लेकिन मेरे देश के किसी कोने में negative impact तो नहीं करेगा? मेरा तो यहां काम चल जाएगा, मेरे लिए तो वाहवाही हो जाएगी, लेकिन मेरा ये निर्णय मेरे देश के किसी कोने पर तो impact नहीं करता है; ये तराजू Civil service के पास है। उसकी training ही उस प्रकार से हुई है, उसमें कभी भी कमी नहीं आने दें। सरकारों आएंगी, जाएंगी; नेता आएंगे, जाएंगे; ये व्‍यवस्‍था अजर-अमर है। और इस व्यवस्‍था का मूलभूत धर्म हर निर्णय को राष्‍ट्रहित के तराजू से तौलना है। और भावी समय में भी क्या impact होगा, वो भी उसको देखना पड़ेगा। अगर भावी समय में उसके impact के बारे में अगर वो नहीं सोचता है तो भी नहीं चलेगा। और इसलिए Civil service में हम लोगों ने जो training पाई है बदलते हुए युग को समझते हुए, हम उसमें अपने-आपको relevant कैसे बनाएं। बदली हुई दुनिया में अगर हम irrelevant हो जाएंगे तो शायद स्थिति कहां से कहां पहुंच जाएगी, हम कहीं के नहीं रहेंगे। और इसलिए हमारा institutional growth, institutional development , institutional mechanism, इसको लगातार हमें overhauling करते रहना पड़ेगा, lubricating की जरूरत है। 

हां यहां HR की बात हुई है, काफी मात्रा में, मुझे मालूम नहीं HR में lubricating विषय आया कि नहीं आया। क्‍या कारण है हम सब civil service के लोग हैं, 25 साल पुराना मामला लटका पड़ा है, 30 साल पुराना मामला लटका पड़ा है, leadership के निर्णय के अभाव में नहीं, department की, दो department के बीच की फाइलों के बीच में लटका पड़ा है, क्‍या कारण है? और वो ही मुद्दा जब भारत के प्रधानमंत्री PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation) कार्यक्रम करें और ऐसे ही PRAGATI कार्यक्रम में listing हो जाए कि इतनी चीजों पर PRAGATI कार्यक्रम में देखने वाले हैं और फटाफट 24 घंटे में निर्णय हो जाए, सारे clearance मिल जाएं, और project clear हो जाए, 8-9 लाख करोड़ रूपये के project clear हो गए, क्‍या कारण था? PRAGATI की success हो तो मैं जय-जयकार कर सकता हूं कि देश का एक ऐसा प्रधानमंत्री है कि जो technology का उपयोग करते हुए लटकी पड़ी कई समस्‍याओं का समाधान कर रहा है। मेरे लिए वो संतोष का विषय नहीं है, मेरे लिए उस में से सीख का विषय है और सीख का विषय ये है कि मेरे सभी साथी ये सोचें, क्‍या कारण है कि जो निर्णय आपने 24 घंटे में किया, वो 15 साल से क्‍यों लटका पड़ा था? Road बन रहा है, लोगों को जरूरत है लेकिन forest department अटका पड़ा है, लेकिन प्रधानमंत्री ने intervene का clear हो गया, ये स्थिति अच्‍छी नहीं है। PRAGATI की success के लिए मोदी का जय-जयकार हो जाए, उससे देश का भला नहीं होगा, वो एक temporary चीज है। देश का भला इसमें है कि मेरी व्‍यवस्‍था सुचारू रूप से चलती हो, हर अफसर के बीच में एक lubricating व्‍यवस्‍था होनी चाहिए जी, lubricating cooperation होना चाहिए। घर्षण शक्ति को व्‍यय करता है जी, lubrication शक्ति को smooth कर देता है जी। क्‍या हम उस दिशा में सोचते हैं क्‍या? अभी भी मैं समझ नहीं पाता हूं जी। सरकार के दो department कोर्ट में क्‍यों झगड़ा कर रहे हैं, मैं नहीं समझ पाता। अदालत के अंदर दो अलग अलग department, अलग अलग view, सरकार एक। क्‍या हम एक All India Civil Service के नाते हमारी कमजोरी स्‍वीकार करते हैं? क्‍या कोई दायित्‍व से घबरा रहा है? दायित्‍व से भाग रहा है? या कहीं Ego बीच में आ रहा है। मैं चाहूंगा Civil Service Day पर ये हमारा आत्‍मचिंतन का अवसर भी होना चाहिए। देश की अदालतों का कितना टाइम जा रहा है, देश के सामान्‍य मानवी को जो जरूरत है उसमें कितनी रूकावटें आ रही हैं। और केस हार-जीत का कारण क्‍या बनता है, एक अफसर ने पूरा सोचे बिना अगर एक लाइन फाइल में लिख दी, और कोई interested group ने उस फाइल को हाथ लगा लिया, मामला चौपट हो जाता है। मिल-बैठ करके, बात कर कर के और ये सोचने की जरूरत नहीं है कि कोई निर्णय जल्‍दी करता है तो कोई बुरे के इरादे से करता है। ऐसे अरोप लगाने वालों ने अभी तक कोई आरोप पूरा नहीं हुए हैं। और इसलिए मन ये झिझक रखने की जरूरत, अगर सत्‍यनिष्‍ठा से, ईमानदारी से जन-सामान्‍य के हित में किया है तो दुनिया की कोई ताकत आपको बुरा नहीं ठहरा सकती है। पलभर के लिए कुछ हो जाए, हो जाए, देखा जाएगा, मैं आपके साथ खड़ा हूं। 

सत्‍यनिष्‍ठा से काम होना चाहिए, कौन रोकता है जी। और आज एक अवसर आया है हिम्‍मत से फैसले लेने का, आज एक अवसर आया है out of the box सोचने का, आज एक अवसर आया है निर्धारित मार्ग से भी नया मार्ग पर कदम रख करके स्थितियों को बदलने का अवसर आया है और मैं मानता हूं मेरे साथ काम करने वाले हर साथियों को ऐसा अवसर उनकी जिंदगी में बहुत कम आया होगा जो आज आया है। क्‍योंकि मैं इस सोच का व्‍यक्ति हूं। 

यहां पर reform, perform, transform की बात हो रही है। राजनीति की इच्‍छाशक्ति निर्भर करती है reform के लिए लेकिन आपकी कर्तव्‍य शक्ति निर्भर करती है perform के लिए। राजनीति की इच्‍छा शक्ति reform कर सकती है लेकिन अगर ये अगर ये team की कर्तव्‍य शक्ति कम पड़ जाएगी तो perform नहीं होता है और जन-भागीदारी नहीं होती तो transform नहीं होता है। तो ये तीनों चीजें; political will power, ये reform कर सकता है, लेकिन Bureaucratic system, governance, ये perform करता है। और जन-भागीदारी transform करती है। हमें इन तीनों को एक wave length में चलाना बहुत जरूरी है। जब हम तीनों को एक wave length में चलाते हैं तो में इच्छित परिणाम मिलता है। 

मैं चाहूंगा कि civil service day के निमित्‍त हम आत्‍मचिंतन करने में कोई कोताही न बरतें। सोचें, जिस दिन civil service के लिए आप select हुए होंगे आपके मां-बाप ने आपको किस रूप में देखा होगा, आपके यार-दोस्‍तों ने कैसे देखा होगा, और आप भी जब घर से चलें होंगे, उस पाल को याद कीजिए। मैं मानता हूं वो पल ही, उससे, उससे बड़ा, उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम आपका कोई मार्गदर्शक नहीं हो सकता है, जो जीवन की वो पहली पल थी। वो ही आपके जीवन की ताकत है। अगर कुछ और है तो आप derail हुए हैं, अगर वो बना हुआ है तो आप सच्‍चे रास्‍ते पर, ना मेरे शब्‍दों को याद करने की जरूरत है, न हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के कितने ही आपके senior लोगों ने आपको कहा हो कि किसी को याद करने के लिए, सिर्फ अपने-आप जिस दिन आप civil service के लिए select हुए थे, उस पल आपके मन में जो विचार आया था, वो ही आपकी प्रेरणा रहेगा; मैं नहीं मानता हूं इस देश को कोई नुकसान होगा। कोई बाहर से जरूरत नहीं है जी। उसी को याद करें, बार-बार याद करें, civil service day को याद करें; फिर से एक बार जरा 30-40 साल 25 साल पीछे चले जाइए जरा उस पल को याद कीजिए, जब मां-बाप को पता चला होगा कि आप UPSC पास करके, IAS हो करके अब आप आगे बढ़ रहे हैं, अब मंसूरी के लिए निकलने वाले हैं। उस पल को याद कीजिए, रेलवे स्‍टेशन पर आपके मां-बाप छोड़ने आए होंगे, पल याद कीजिए। बस, स्‍टेशन पर आपके साथी छोड़ने आए होंगे, पल याद कीजिए। वो पहले 24, 48 घंटों को याद कीजिए, जिंदगी में कैसे-कैसे सपने भर करके निकले थे, क्‍या कहीं उसमें dilution, diversion तो नहीं आया है? किसी और के उपदेश की आवश्‍यकता नहीं, किसी प्रेरक कथा की आवश्‍यकता नहीं है, ये अपने-आप में बहुत बड़ी ताकत होती है। 

सरकार का एक स्‍वभाव होता है, इसमें बहुत बड़े बदलाव की जरूरत है, और वो target पूरा हुआ है। क्‍या सचमुच मे आंकड़ों के खेल से बदलाव आता है क्‍या? आप लोगों के बीच में एक कथा बड़ी प्रचलित है, शायद आप लोग जानते भी हैं या कि हम सुनते हैं, पता नहीं कौन-कौन सोचते हैं। एक बगीचे में कुछ लोग काम कर रहे थे। एक senior व्‍यक्ति ने देखा। ये दो लोग इतनी मेहतन कर रहे हैं, पसीना बहा रहे हैं। एक गड्ढा गोद रहा है और दूसरा मिट्टी भर रहा है। तो उसको बड़ा कौतुहल हो गया, थोड़ा जागरूक नागरिक था। उसने जाकर पूछा भाई ये क्‍या कर रहे हो? आप इतने दो लोग, नहीं बोले, दो नहीं हम तो तीन हैं। पूछे, तीन हैं? नहीं बोले तीसरा आज आया नहीं है। तो बोले क्‍या काम कर रहे हो? तो बोले मेरे जिम्‍मे है गड्ढा करना, जो आज नहीं आया उसका जिम्‍मा है पैड लगाना और इसका जिम्‍मा है मिट्टी डालना। लेकिन वो नहीं आया, लेकिन हमारा काम चल रहा है। वो गड्ढा खोद रहा है, मैं, वो नहीं आया। कम हुआ? हुआ, जितने घंटे करना था किया, जितनी मिट्टी निकालनी थी, नि‍काली, जितनी डालनी थी, डाली; देश का क्‍या लाभ हुआ? क्‍यों? क्‍योकि एक missing था। 

Outcome Centric, हमें हर चीज को तौलना चाहिए और इस बार पहली बार बड़ी हिम्‍मत की है, गत वर्ष बजट के साथ एक outcome related document बजट के साथ दिया जाता है, बहुत कम लोगों ने इसको study किया होगा। पहली बार हिंदुस्तान में बजट के साथ outcome documental दिया जाता है। हम नीचे तक इस बात को एक हमारे culture के रूप में प्रचलित करें कि हर चीज को outcome के तराजू से तौलना होगा, output के तराजू से नहीं। Output, CAG के लिए ठीक है, Outcome एक step CAG+1 वाला है, और वो देश का लोकतंत्र है; जो CAG से भी दो कदम आगे है। और इसलिए हम CAG केन्द्रित Output देखेंगे तो देश में बदलाव शायद नहीं देख पाएंगे, लेकिन CAG+ की सोच के साथ करेंगे, Outcome के साथ, तो हम देश के लिए कुछ देकर जाएंगे। 

आजादी के 70 साल बाद पहली बार सारी प्रक्रियाएं शत-प्रतिशत पूर्ण करते हुए देश का बजट 31 मार्च को सारी प्रक्रिया पूर्ण हो जाए और 1 अप्रैल को नया बजट, नया धन खर्च करना शुरू हो, आजादी के 70 साल बाद पहली बार हुआ, पहली बार हुआ। आप ही तो लोग हैं, ये आप ही का कमाल है जी, आप ही ने करके दिखाया। इसका मतलब ये हुआ कि आज भी हमारे साथियों में ये, मेरे ये सेना में जो तय करें वो करने में दम है, ये मैं अनुभव करता हूं। और इसलिए मेरा विश्‍वास अनेक गुना ज्‍यादा है। लोग कभी निराशा की बात करते हैं, मैं आप लोगों को याद करता हूं, आप लोगों के कर्तव्‍यों को याद करता हूं, मेरे निराशा नाम की कोई चीज मुझे धड़कती नहीं है जी, मुझे छूती नहीं है। 

पिछले तीन साल में मैंने अनुभव किया है, मेरा गुजरात का अनुभव तो गहरा है लेकिन यहां मेरा तीन साल का अनुभव है; तीन साल में मैंने अनुभव किया है कि एक विचार मैंने रखा हो और मुझे उसका परिणाम न मिला हो, ऐसी कोई घटना मेरे सामने मुझे याद नहीं आ रही है, किसने किया? और इसलिए reform करने के लिए political will चाहिए, मुझे वो problem नहीं है; शायद extra है। लेकिन perform के लिए कर्तव्‍य बहुत आवश्‍यक होता है। और ये काम कौन करता है, मुझे बताइए? प्रधानमंत्री ने कहा कि भई ऐसा एक मेरे मन में विचार आता है, उस idea को policy में कौन convert करता है? आप लोग करते हैं। Scheme में कौन convert करता है? आप करते हैं। जिम्‍मेवारी कौन allot करता है? आप करते हैं। संसाधन कहां से निकालेंगे? आप करते हैं। तय करने के बाद monitoring कौन करता है? आप करते हैं। कमियां कहां रहीं, वो ढूंढता कौन है? आप ही ढूंढते हैं। गलत क्‍या हुआ, कौन ढूंढता है? आप ही ढूंढते हैं। सब चीज, बाहर के वाला व्‍यक्ति जब देखेगा तो उसको आश्‍चर्य होगा कि यही लोग अपनी कमियां भी ढूंढते हैं! यही लोग अपनी गलतियां भी ढूंढते हैं! यही लोग हैं उसके सुधार के लिए प्रयास करते हैं! ऐसी homogeneous व्‍यवस्‍था, ये बहुत बड़ी देन है देश को All India Civil Service, और इसलिए आज का दिन इसलिए देश के लिए भी बड़ा मत्‍वपूर्ण है कि ये एक व्‍यवस्‍था है जो व्‍यवस्‍था देश को इस प्रकार से देश को हर बार अपने-आपके कसौटी से कसते-कसते, अपने-आपको ठीक-ठाक करते-करते; हो सकता है अपेक्षा से शायद दो कदम पीछे रहते हों, लेनि कोशिश रहती है अपेक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने की, यही तो Team करती है; इस Team के प्रति देशवासियों का आदर भाव कैसे बढ़े? सामान्‍य मानवी के मन में ये भाव क्‍यों पैदा हुआ है? कभी आप भी आत्‍मचिंतन कीजिए; आप बुरे लोग नहीं हैं, आपने बुरा नहीं किया है, आप बुरा करने के लिए निकले नहीं हैं, फिर भी जन-सामान्‍य के मन में आपके प्रति भाव होने के बजाय अभाव क्‍यों है? क्‍या कारण है? ये आत्‍मचिंतन हम लोगों ने करना चाहिए। और आत्‍मचिंतन करेंगे तो मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि कोई बहुत बड़ा बदलाव की जरूरत पड़ेगी। थोड़ा सा विषय होता है जो संभालना होता है। अगर ये हम संभाल लेते हैं तो अपने-आप में अभाव, भाव में परिवर्तित हो जाता है। 

कश्‍मीर के अंदर बाढ़ आती है, और जब फौज के लोग किसी की भी जिंदगी बचाने के लिए अपनी जान की बाजी लगा देते हैं, तो वो ही लोग उनके लिए ताली भी बजा देते हैं, भले बाद में पत्‍थर मारते हों; लेकिन एक पल के लिए तो उसको भी छू जाता है, ये हैं मेरे लिए मरने वाले लोग हैं। ये ताकत आप में है, ये ताकत आपमें है। ऐसे उज्‍ज्‍वल भूतकाल के साथ हम आगे चलने वाले लोग हैं। 

मैं आपसे चाहूंगा, 2022, आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं। हमने टुकड़ों में देश नहीं चलाना चाहिए, हमने एक सपने के साथ देश जोड़ना चाहिए। हर सपने को संकल्‍प के रूप में परिवर्तित करने के लिए हमने catalytic agent के रूप में role play करना चाहिए। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के मन में ये भाव क्‍यों न जगे? 2022, आजादी के दीवानों ने जो सपने देखे और जिसके कारण हमें आजादी मिली; और जिसके कारण हम इस अवस्‍था में पहुंचे, उनके सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए हमारा भी तो कोई संकल्‍प होना चाहिए। हमारा भी तो कोई मंथन होना चाहिए। जिस इकाई को मैं देखता हूं उस इकाई के अपने संकल्‍प होंगे कि नहीं होंगे? जिन लोगों के साथ मैं कारोबार करता हूं उनके साथ, मेरे उन सपनों के साथ उनको भी मैं खीचूंगा कि नहीं खींचूंगा? मेरे साथ लूंगा कि नहीं लूंगा? अगर 2022, भारत की आजादी के 75 साल, ये भारत के सरकार के अंदर बैठा हुआ छोटे से बड़ा हर मुलाजिम का अगर सपना नहीं बनता है तो आजादी के उन दीवानों के प्रति हम अन्‍याय कर देंगे, जिन्‍होंने देश के लिए जान की बाजी लगा दी थी। ये हम सबका संकल्प होना चाहिएजी। 

गंगा सफाई की बात हम करते हैं, कोई न कोई Civil Service का व्‍यक्ति तो होगा कि गंगा के तट के कोई न कोई गांव उसके charge में होगा? ऐसा कोई गांव गंगा तट का नहीं होगा जो किसी न किसी Civil Service के व्‍यक्ति के साथ जुड़ा न हो। राजीव गांधी के जमाने से गंगा सफाई की बात चल रही है, उस तट पर जो गांव है उस पर कोई न कोई Civil Service का व्‍यक्ति का charge रहा ही होगा। वो district में रहा होगा जब भी वो गांव under में आया होगा, वो तहसील में होगा तब भी आया होगा। अगर मैं Civil Service में हूं, देश गंगा सफाई चाहता है, भारत सरकार का गंगा सफाई का कार्यक्रम है, कम से कम मैं गंगा तट के उस गांव में गंदगी नहीं जाने दूंगा, इतना संकल्‍प मेरा साथी नहीं कर सकता है क्‍या? एक बार वहां In-charge मेरा अफसर तय करे, मैं जिस गांव का In-charge हूं, यहां से कोई गंदगी अब गंगा में नहीं जाएगी, कौन कहता है गंगा साफ नहीं हो सकती है? करने के तरीके यहीं बनाने होंगे। हमारे सपनो और संकल्‍पों को micro level पर management क्‍या हो, इसके साथ हमें अपने आपको जोड़ना पड़ेगा। जिम्‍मेवारी लेनी पड़ेगी, ownership का भाव, अगर इस चीजों को हम करते हैं तो हम परिवर्तन ला सकते है जी। और ये मान के चलें दुनिया भारत के प्रति एक बहुत बड़ी आशा की नजर से देख रही है। भारत के democratic values बदलते हुए विश्‍व में भारत को एक अलग तरीके से दुनिया देख रही है। कल तक हम अपना गुजारा करने के लिए जो भी करते थे, करते थे, लेकिन 2022 के पहले हमने सपने देखने चाहिए कि विश्‍व के अंदर भी भारत एक ताकत के रूप में कैसे उभरे, ये सपना देख करके हमें चलना चाहिए। और ये चुने हुए लोगों का ही सिर्फ कर्तव्‍य नहीं है, सार्वजनिक जीवन में काम करने वालों का कर्तव्‍य नहीं है, शासन व्‍यवस्‍था में जीने वालों का ज्‍यादा कर्तव्‍य है। ये अगर हो और प्रशासक हो या शासक हो, हर एक का अगर एक दिशा में चलना हो, wave length एक हो, मुझे मन विश्‍वास है कि हम निश्चित परिणाम प्राप्‍त कर सकते हैं। 

सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल को हम हमेशा याद करते हैं। इस व्‍यवस्‍था को भारतीय संदर्भ में विकसित करने का काम सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल के सपनों के अनुकूल बनाने का काम हर किसी ने प्रयास किया। अब हम लोगों का दायित्‍व बनता है कि बदलते हुए युग में, चुनौतियों के कालखंड में, स्‍पर्धा के वातावरण में, हम अपने आपको सिद्ध कैसे करें, और सामान्‍य मानवी के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए प्रयास करें। 

मैं फिर एक बार आपको इस Civil Service Day पर देश भर में और दुनिया के हर कोने में बैठे हुए इसी क्षेत्र के हमारे साथियों को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, और देश को यहां तक पहुंचाने में आपकी जितनी भी पीढि़यों ने काम किया है, उन सबको आज उनका ऋण स्‍वीकार करता हूं, उनका धन्‍यवाद करता हूं, आप सबको शुभ कामनाएं देता हूं। 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                Namaskar,


Today All India Civil Services Day can, in a way, be commemorated as the day of “re-dedication”. On this occasion, I take pride in congratulating all the great talents who have received this opportunity to work in this noble profession of Civil Services.

This illustrious gathering here represents diverse experiences from all parts of the country. It goes without saying that all of you are mindful of the powers, challenges and responsibilities that the badge of a Civil Servant entails. And it has been observed that the nation has always benefitted from this existing system of the Civil Services. However, times have changed. One cannot compare today’s life with how things were a decade-and-a-half ago for the common man. Five years from now on, we are bound to see a different world altogether. Over the past two decades, the government was the only “go-to” machinery for every need of a citizen. Be it amenities like schools and hospitals or be it raw materials like cement, iron or steel, the government became the sole provider for all his needs. The government became everything. In situations where there is a monopolized tendency, there is a possibility of stagnation and corruption creeping into the system. It is a well-known fact that corruption breeds when there is no challenge to status quo. Government became almost invincible until globalisation provided alternatives for the people. Citizens were now exposed to private vs government choices. For example, they could now compare between the quality of private airlines and government ones. They were empowered about the crisp functioning of the private sector, and hence could conveniently opt out of government’s poor quality of service. An alternative in the form of private sector emerged.

Earlier they used to be complacent with the services of a government doctor; just his smile and a casual recording of BP would make them feel positive about their health. However, now, despite several visits, people still regret having consulted a government doctor, and eventually go for a second opinion from a private doctor. The last 15-20 years have provided them with an “alternate”. The availability of an ‘alternative’ has increased accountability and responsibility of all government officials, particularly of the Civil Servants manifold compared to the previous decade. Not that the workload has increased, but the challenges have certainly become more critical. We feel inadequate in confronting these challenges.

To bring about qualitative change, competitiveness within the system plays a big role. Everything looks hunky dory in a system which is stagnated and devoid of aspirations and comparative analysis. But quantum progression happens only in a competitive environment which provides the much needed impetus to perform better. This, however, doesn’t encapsulate that we pull someone down to create space for oneself. Rather, we should build ourselves together. The need of the hour is to immediately reinvent our working styles as well as mind-sets. It’s high time that we moved from being ‘regulators’ to ‘enabling entities’. As soon as we do it, the same challenges shall convert into opportunities for us. We must ensure that we create an ecosystem of governance such that this same government turns out to be a convenience rather than a burden for any one. This can be a reality in the near future if only we change our perspectives to deliver good governance.

Efforts have already begun in the right direction. The testimonial is this revamped Civil Services Day itself. How has it been achieved? Well not because of the whim and fancy of the Prime Minister after all.  No. Innovative and creative thinking made this event a celebration from what had become a mundane ritual. If we add vitality, connect wholeheartedly and have a futuristic vision then it is bound to add vigour to all our opportunities. If we appreciate the change, then such positive feelings are bound to be inherent in your every work.

It is important to immerse oneself in the system to experience and implement change. It brings great learning as you all are products of the same system. You will be developing yourselves from the ground level, accomplishing tasks first at the village level and then at the district level. There may be many who might have worked only at the district level. It was nice to see a quantum jump in entries above hundred. I do appreciate. I am sure everyone realised the importance of the work and sent the entries lest they be questioned. But when I saw the reports, this quantum jump immediately made me think that we should go for a qualitative analysis. It was encouraging to see the numbers rose from 100 to 500. It made sense to see the quality of the reports which were outstanding as well as those that did not achieve merit. It is not relevant to disclose those findings live on TV. However, I felt reassured that a change has been initiated. The Quantum jump reveals a bright future. Now I aspire for a qualitative change within a year. There must not be any entry which is below the category of ‘excellent’ because those who are now a part of this machinery have reached here because they were no less than excellent.

May be they would have attended coaching classes…yet they could make it till here only because they were indeed excellent. Excellence comes with its own price. You cannot afford to under-perform. So we have to make this habit of giving our best. You must have noticed the housewives. Their skill and talent never gets noticed in the family. She is always taken for granted. But unfortunately when the family loses its head, all of a sudden she has to dabble between all the responsibilities of the home as well as the family business. She adeptly rears her children and runs her family successfully and takes it to greater heights. She dons the crown of the family head in such a skilful way that males of the neighbourhood are put to shame. Some time back she was lost in an abyss, but what inherent strength she had! She bloomed bright and dared all the challenges while rendering her responsibilities. Similarly, some of you here may have experienced huge pressure while appearing for the civil services exams. But now you have been handed over the steering of public administration. This life-time opportunity shall unfold multiple avenues in front of all of you when you could add new and fresh perspectives. Hope you will embrace this opportunity wholeheartedly. I do realise that Hierarchy does become a burden sometimes. May be it percolates as a legacy from the British Rule which unfortunately still has its roots in Mussourie.  We still do encounter pansophism in bureaucracy. The burden of experience reeks in often heard phrases like “I know it all”, “it was like this in our times”, “you are but a fledgling and we have been here too long”, “have managed districts 20 years ago”. This seems to get transferred across batches. It is time for the seniors to eliminate the view if this experience is becoming a burden to bureaucracy; lest this experience become an impediment to innovation and experimentation.

Is our system breeding insecurities at higher designations? Even when I am at the Secretary level, does it worry me that a young cadet will accomplish the task I had initiated 20 years back in a district.  Am I shying away from raised fingers? What if someone scorns that a young chap did what I could not? What if someone questions my credibility? Then your pansophism is itself creating roadblocks in your career. Let’s face the truth! Well, I can work for another district but not the one where I left work unaccomplished.  You cannot digest someone else’s success in that same district? Like it or not, but this happens to be the bitter truth. We should be proud of the fact that the terrain which we ploughed has been well irrigated by the facilities implemented by one young peer, so that the other could plant trees there. His successor made a grove out of it, which very soon gave fruits due to the efforts of another young recruit. Efforts of all the five are equally valuable only then the desired results could be achieved. If only we could work with such synergy, we would certainly be able to progress.  This synergy is bound to strengthen our tradition. It is our collective responsibility to further this vision of progressive work culture. You may recall what I had cited as the biggest strength of civil services. It is no mean feat to achieve. As per a Gujarati proverb - and I am not sure how it translates in Hindi -“ठोठनिशार यानि होशिआर नि कद्र” a person who is weak actually realises the worth of an intelligent person.  You are considered at par with politicians and that is the power of being a bureaucrat which you cannot afford to lose. The other is anonymity.

There have been several officers who have implemented innovative ideas in governance by carefully developing a vision and framework which eventually benefitted the nation. However, it becomes so difficult to trace that officer who got that idea and what did he do to achieve the commendable feat. I believe, this quintessential anonymity is the biggest strength of Civil Services. I understand its power. Honestly, don’t you feel too that these values are depreciating?

 I totally endorse the power of social media. I realise its importance; however, only if it brings inclusive development by engaging citizens.  If I use social media to create awareness and empower people, let’s say about a forthcoming vaccination programme in the district, then it is justified. But if this platform is being used to blow their own trumpets by posting their photos of the event then of course anonymity is at stake. These days I have noticed that officers at the district level are so called ‘busy’ as much of their time goes into misusing the technology. Hence, nowadays I have restricted the use of devices during my meetings. Otherwise they would remain distracted due to the phones. If only we have the wisdom to use these facilities intelligently and optimally, this technology can help us to reach out to every citizen of our country.


There has been a paradigm shift from E-governance to M-governance across the globe.  Mobile governance is the call of the hour. And it is indispensible.  But it should be utilised to meet the needs of the citizens. I believe anonymity is our virtue. It is overwhelming to think now as to how many minds would have designed the exquisite Taj Mahal; imagine the brain behind the concept paper; how many hands worked relentlessly on this masterpiece; would any of us be able to tell? But this inconceivable Taj Mahal stands a tall testimony to the efforts of the people from this region by and large.

That’s the beauty of anonymity. You may have done a lot of work throughout your tenure at various levels, but when you sit to recount your five great achievements at the time of retirement it will be impossible to recall after a few decades.  That’s how selfless and committed you were to your services. This is the invaluable strength our country has and you are the owner of this virtue.  I do understand its value. How anxious we become when even our photo frames are shifted! It’s no mean thing to sacrifice the identity in national interest. I certainly appreciate the power of this virtuosity. It then becomes imperative for the newly inducted officers to uphold the tradition of selfless service that the seniors have so painstakingly established. Whether this new breed of civil servants would uphold or tarnish the reputation one would have to keep a really close watch.  

As we are celebrating Civil Services Day, numerous committees and commissions for reforms in governance in the centre and the state governments are perhaps being set up. Those who have prepared the reports might not have read them. Six different people might have written it in bits and pieces and yet another person might have combined it. This is the truth. You like it or not, this is the reality. And even after this, nobody will be able to trace the address where the document might be lying. Even the states want to bring reforms and form commissions. Of course, some people get jobs after retirement, but no real transformation takes place. Even today I can say with my experience, it is my good fortune that if like you I was into this system, it would not be possible because I wouldn’t have got a ‘coaching class’. However, if a person works for 16 years, what does he become? He can become a Deputy Secretary, he can become a Director. So I would have been under the category of a Director because I have been working with you for the past 16 years. I am working with you under this very system. Therefore in my opinion, those working under this system have such a great experience that no commission can ever give any recommendations for reforms like these people - this thinking is completely erroneous. With whatever experience you have, any better recommendation can never come from anyone else outside this system. So I don’t give importance to that school of thought, nor do I follow that. Can we inculcate this in our character? A person who is running this system with his experience, who is writing a paper, is very much a part of this exercise. I asked four people from the latest batch to write it down so that a new thought process develops. Everyone wrote. Maybe some of them have resorted to cut and paste method. Although I am not sure, because I have not seen it; but this is human nature. Nevertheless, something new might have come up.

Now, this exercise was not for achieving a degree or for getting an academic ranking or for getting recognition for the research paper. Whatever has come has come from experience. These have been said by a person who is down to earth, who daily spends his life with the farmers, with those who are  doing clerical job, with those computer operators; he who deals with seasonal crises. Can we consider this as a holy-book? Even though this has been said by an ordinary human being, yet this comes from within which is a source of immense power. Can we make this our mind-set? You see, When some thought comes from within we are its owners. Ownership is the guarantee for any success. Success comes only when a team acknowledges its ownership. As the number of ‘ownerships’ increases, success comes faster, accountability reduces, burden reduces, and everyone gets the credit. This effort is one type of ‘ownership movement’.  These two days of our discussions is very crucial as it is a part of our ‘ownership movement’.  Everyone feels that this is my country, my government, my accountability; I should bring out results and get solutions to the problems.

Definitely you must be knowing how and when you will be tested as an individual because you are sitting in that position. A situation where you do not have anything can never evaluate you correctly. A situation where you have everything, can evaluate you properly. You have everything yet you are aloof; then only you will be able to realize - yes, this is something. If we don’t get anything then we feel that let it continue like this; so no one sees or gives any importance to it. You have every kind of power; the entire governance system is at your fingertips, the power of your word, your sign can change a hell of a lot of things. Then in that scenario what do you do, is your real test. And therefore, an individual can never be judged in a situation where he does not have any power, the proper evaluation of a person is done only when he has all the power.

By and large, we have passed through such periods in the country, where many of us know how to find ways when things are lacking .But how to manage when things are in abundance, by and large, has never been the thinking of the larger class. They know how to perfectly manage a famine but do not know how to manage excess yield. There they miss it out again. They know how to fill the vacant seats in the engineering college, but when the seats fall short and the number of students increases, then how to manage it? Then they are in a dilemma.

The way the country is growing; common man’s expectations are also growing. Sometimes abundance becomes conspicuous. On the one hand, water is being wasted in fountains and at the same time if a notice is issued that one has to bath with less water; then it becomes very difficult to follow that order. Wherever we have abundance or the possibilities of abundance, can we change our mind-set accordingly? Otherwise we will not be able to grow. Our thought process will stagnate. We have to accept those challenges and move forward.

As I said in the beginning, we were working in isolation, and there was no competition even with the other district. This district has plenty of water and thus the cultivation is good; that district is dry; therefore cultivation is not possible; It happens, me and my ancestors did it too, it was like that. Now, not only the districts, the world has changed so much so that now there is competition among the states and also between countries. There is competition between yesterday and today. We need to raise ourselves to the challenges every moment and also in the global context.

Another strength of the civil servant, I believe, is his dutifulness. It is like a religion to a civil servant. He has no right to move away from that religion. If  is sitting in the district, sitting in the tehsil or sitting in the form of final authority; it is his obligation to weigh every proposal, incident, and decision with the scales of national interest and he does not have the right to see it in isolation. I am taking this decision here but will it have any negative impact in any corner of my country? My work will be done here, I will be applauded for my work, but will my decision negatively affect anyone in my country? These scales are with the civil servants. His training has been designed in such a way that there is no shortcoming in him. Governments will come and go; the leaders will come and go; this system is immortal. And the fundamental religion of this system is to weigh every decision with national perspective. And he will also have to see its impact on the future too. It is imperative that he thinks about the impacts on the future. And so, with the training received in the Civil services how do we make ourselves relevant to the changing times is the question that needs to be pondered over. If we become irrelevant in the changing times, then where will the situation reach, and it will be shameful for us. And therefore we have to continuously overhaul our institutional growth, institutional development, and institutional mechanism and lubrication is needed.

Yes there was a lot of discussion on HR. I do not know whether the subject on lubricating the HR was touched upon. We are all civil servants but what is the reason that a 25 year old case has still not been resolved; the 30 year old case has not been resolved? This is not due to the lack of leadership decision but the department is at fault. The file is stuck between the two departments, what is the reason? And that is why the issue has been taken up by the Prime Minister of India under PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) Scheme. Such matters get listed in the PRAGATI scheme and are monitored under the programme. These are decided quickly within 24 hours. All clearances are given fast and finally the projects get cleared. The projects worth 8-9 lakh crores were cleared; what was the reason? If PRAGATI is successful, then I can cheer that there is a prime minister of the country who is solving several problems with the use of technology. But for me, it is not a subject of contentment. For me it is a matter of learning and the subject of learning is that all my friends should think, why is it that the decision that you took  24 hours was stuck up for 15 years? Road is being constructed, people need it; but the project clearance  was stuck up in the forest department, till the Prime Minister intervened and got the clearance for it; this situation is not good. Cheer for Modi for the success of PRAGATI, will not be good for the country; it is a temporary thing. It will be really beneficial for the country if my system runs smoothly. There should be a lubricating system in each officer; there should be lubricating cooperation. Friction dissipates power, lubrication makes the power smooth.  Do we think in that direction? I still do not understand. Why do the two government departments quarrel, I do not understand. Why two different departments go to court with different views, when the government is one? Do we accept our weakness as a single All India Civil Service? Is anyone afraid of his obligation? Is he running away from his responsibilities? Or is it the ego that is playing a spoilsport. This should be our opportunity to introspect on Civil Services Day. So much time of our courts is being wasted and several obstacles are coming in the way of the common man of the country. And what is the reason for the defeat and win in a case, if an officer writes a line in the file without understanding, and any vested interested group gets hold of the file, then problems may crop up. While discussing an issue one need not think of whether a decision has been taken quickly with an ill intention. No such allegations have been proved right so far. And therefore, no need to keep this hesitation in mind because if you have done this with integrity, sincerity and in the interest of the public, then no power in the world can harm you. If anything happens for a moment, let it happen, we will see, I am standing with you as a support.

Work should be done with integrity, who will stop you? And today an opportunity has come to take decisions with courage; today an opportunity has come to think out of the box. Today an opportunity has come to change the status quo by taking a new path from the existing path and I believe everybody working with me would have had such a rare opportunity in his life which has come today because I am a person with this mindset.

Here we are talking of reform, perform, transform. Reform depends on the will of the political class but everything depends on your duty for ‘Perform’. The will-power of political class can bring the ‘reform’ but if this duty of the team slackens, then Performance will suffer, and if there is no public participation then there is no transformation. So these three things; Political will-power, it can reform, but the Bureaucratic system, governance, it performs. And public-participation transforms. It is very important that we run these three in a wave length. When we run these three in a wave length, we get the desired results.

I would like to see that for the civil services day we should not let any paucity in introspection. Think of the day when you were selected for civil services; how your parents looked at you, what was the reaction of your friends. And also think of the moment when you moved away from your home to achieve this goal. I believe, the first feeling of your success can be the greatest and the excellent guide for you in your profession. That could be the strength of your life. If it is different from that, I think you have been derailed. On the other hand if it is maintained, then you are on the right track. You need not remember my words, nor do you need to remember the suggestions given by so many of your seniors throughout India. I would like to repeat that the feeling on the first day of your selection will remain the only motivation for you. I cannot accept that this country is going to suffer any loss. Dear friends you do not need anything from outside. Recall that sprit, time and again, on the occasion of this civil services day; search for those moments, when your parents came to know that you had passed UPSC and became an IAS. Recall the events when your parents were witnessing that you were proceeding towards Mussoorie after passing UPSC and becoming IAS. Think of the day when your parents accompanied you to the Railway Station to see you off and your friends might have come to the Bus Stand to drop you. Remember the dreams you have seen within first 24, 48 hours of your success; what was passing through your mind. Is there any dilution and diversion from them? You just need this evaluation because it will be a great strength within you and no other motivational story is needed.

Govt. has a typical nature. It needs a big change, and that target of change has been achieved. Is it true that these statistics can really change the destiny of the people? There is a very common story prevailing among you people, perhaps you know. Two persons were working in a garden. A senior person was watching them. Both were working hard and were sweating heavily. One of them was digging and the other was filling mud into it. The man became curious. So he went to them and asked, what both of you are doing brothers? One of them replied, we are not two, in fact we are three. He asked them, then where is the third one? The third has not come today, they replied. What job you all are performing? One of them explained, my job is to dig a trough, the person who has not come today, his job is to plant a tree and the other person's job is to put mud in the trough. But we are doing our job. The work is not being done by the person who is absent. We will carry on the work as far as our duty is concerned. They worked as many hours as they thought, the mud was removed and put back accordingly. But the question remained, did this process benefit our country? Nothing, because one person was missing.   

It means we need to measure everything as Outcome Centric. First time, we dare to initiate in last year's budget, an outcome related document. A few people may have studied it. For first time the outcome related document was associated with the budget. We should incorporate this principle in our work culture and to percolate the message down the hierarchy, everything should be measured as an outcome and not as an output. Output is alright for the CAG. Outcome is one step ahead of CAG (CAG+1), and the democracy of the country is two step ahead of the CAG. If we look for CAG centric Output, then perhaps we will not be able to see a change in the country. We will be able to certainly contribute something to the country, if we work with the idea of CAG+ Outcome. 

For the first time after 70 years of Independence, that completing 100 per cent processes, the budget of the country was passed before 31st of March and the New Budget was effected from 1st April. Who made it possible? You all made it possible. It means that even today I believe, you have the courage to implement the determined actions as a team. So my confidence has multiplied manifold. Whenever somebody talks of pessimism, I remember you people, I remember your duties, and pessimism leaves me, disappointment can never touch me.   

 
I have vast experiences in managing Gujarat, but here I have spent only three years. My three years’ experience say that every idea floated by me, could come with an outcome. I don’t remember any incidence of non-implementation of ideas given by me. So, who did it? It is political will which matters for reforms. I am not facing that problem, rather I have an extra political will. However, action is necessary to perform. Can you tell me who takes that action?   If a Prime Minister puts any idea before his team, who converts the idea into policy? That is done by you people. Who allots the responsibility? You do it. Who plans for resource allocation? You do it. After deciding all these aspects, who does the Monitoring? You do it. Who traces the loopholes? That again is done by you. Any outsider will be surprised if they find out that the same people trace their weaknesses, find out their faults and make the efforts to rectify those. This homogeneous system, the All India Civil Service, is a blessing to our nation.  Therefore, this day is important for the country as this system was established which evaluates itself, introspects itself and moves ahead to build the nation. Probably we remain two steps behind the expectations yet we keep our efforts going to fulfil the dreams of the people. All this is done by the team. How the respect of the people can be enhanced towards this team? Why a negative feeling prevails in the minds of the people at large? You should also introspect. You are not ill-intentioned people; you have not committed anything wrong, you have not come out to do any harm, even then why is it that people have doubts in their minds about you. You must introspect. If you do this, I don’t think that some big change would be required. There are minor things, which need to be corrected. If we manage it, then this lack of faith could be converted into respect.   

When Kashmir was struck by floods, the army men sacrificed their lives to protect the people. Then the same people, who might be pelting stones some other day, appreciate the role of the Army that day. May be for a moment they appreciate it, but at least the people feel that these are the people who die to save us. This strength you have. With this bright past, we are the people, who are forward looking. 

I expect from you, till 2022, when we will be celebrating the 75th year of our Independence, can we make sure that country should not be run in parts but as a whole like a dream. We should work as a catalytic agent to convert every dream into a resolution. Why this idea should not come in the minds of one hundred twenty-five crore Indians.

By 2022 it is our duty to make a resolution to fulfil the dreams of our great freedom fighters and reach this stage. We should also introspect. As a public servant I think, the unit which I look after, shall have its resolutions or not? Would I be able to perform for the fulfilment of my dreams as well as the dreams of the people, with whom I work? Would it be possible to tag them with me? I would like to repeat, it will be injustice to the freedom fighters, who sacrificed their lives for the country, if in the year 2022, on the occasion of 75thyear of our Independence, every personnel working in GOI, in any post, big or small, it does not become a dream for them. This must be our resolution.

We talk about the cleanliness of the river Ganga. Will there not be a civil servant, who has a village on the bank of the river Ganga, in his or her charge? There must be a village which is under the charge of a civil servant. Ganga cleanliness mission has been in operation since the era of Rajiv Gandhi, the villages situated on the bank of this river must have come under the charge of a civil servant, at the time of his posting in the district or Tehsil. A public servant should make a resolution - if I am in civil service, the country wants the Ganga to be clean, GOI has a programme to clean the Ganga, and I will not let the litter to go into the river from the village situated on its bank. Can’t my friends take this type of resolution? If my officer in-charge there once decides that from the village under his charge will not permit the garbage to be thrown into the river then nobody should doubt about the cleanliness of Ganga. The mode of operation needs to be decided here only.

We need to associate ourselves with the concept of the management of our dreams and resolutions at micro level. The feeling of ownership ought to be there. If we do things like that, then change can be brought. Imagine that the world is pinning its hopes on India. India is seen by the world with its changing democratic values. In the past we may have taken several steps for our subsistence. However, before 2022 we must dream that India should emerge as a world power. We should work according to this dream. This is not only the duty of the elected representatives, but the public servant should also owe this responsibility, rather the people working under the system of governance share the greater burden of this responsibility. Then whether you are an administrator or a ruler, if we go in the same direction, may be with a different wave length, I believe we will definitely achieve the outcome.

We always remember Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The efforts to develop this system in Indian context has been done by so many people. Now we have the responsibility in this changing world full of challenges and in the competitive atmosphere to prove ourselves and how we will be able to fulfil the dreams of the common man.

I once again congratulate, on this Civil Services Day, to each and every friend living in every corner of the world. I appreciate the contribution of all the generations of the service, who have worked ceaselessly to elevate the country to this level. Thanks a lot and best wishes.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented awards and addressed civil servants on the occasion of the eleventh Civil Services Day. 

Describing this day as one of “rededication,” the Prime Minister said that civil servants are well aware of their strengths and capabilities, challenges and responsibilities. 

He said conditions prevailing today are quite different from about two decades ago, and would evolve much further over the next few years. Elaborating on this, the Prime Minister said that earlier, Government was almost the sole provider of goods and services, which left a lot of scope for ignoring one’s shortcomings. However, now, very often, people perceive that the private sector offers better services than Government. The Prime Minister said that with alternatives now being available in several areas, the responsibilities of Government officers have increased. He added that this increase is not in terms of scope of work, but in terms of the challenge. 

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of competition, which brings qualitative change. He said that the sooner the attitude of Government can change from regulator to enabler, the faster this challenge of competition will become an opportunity. 

The Prime Minister said that while the absence of Government in a sphere of activity should be perceptible, its presence in a sphere of activity should not become a burden. He asked civil servants to strive towards such arrangements. 

Noting the quantum jump in the applications for Civil Service Day awards, from less than 100 last year to over 500 this year, the Prime Minister said that the focus should now be on improving quality, and making excellence a habit. 

The Prime Minister urged senior officers to ensure that experience does not become a burden that stifles innovation of younger officers. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that anonymity is one of the greatest strengths of the civil services. He cautioned officers that the use of social media should not lead to a decline in this strength, even as social media and mobile governance are leveraged for connecting people to benefits and government schemes. 

Speaking in the context of “reform, perform and transform”, the Prime Minister said that political will is needed for reform, but the “perform” part of this formulation must come from civil servants, while transformation is enabled by people’s participation. 

The Prime Minister said that civil servants must ensure that every decision is taken keeping national interest in mind, and this should be their touchstone for taking a decision. 

Recalling that the year 2022 would mark 75 years of independence, he urged civil servants to play the role of catalytic agents in fulfilling the dreams of freedom fighters.

			मंच पर विराजमान सभी साथी और विशाल संख्‍या में पधारे हुए मेरे सभी परिवारजन। मैं दुविधा में था कि गुजराती में बोलू कि हिंदी में बोलू, लेकिन बाद में मेरे मन में विचार आया कि आप सबने इतना बड़ा काम किया है इसका देश को भी तो पता चलना चाहिए। यहां पर सभी दाताश्रियों की बधाई की वर्षा हो रही है। पांच सौ करोड़, पांच सौ करोड़ बड़ी वाह-वाही चल रही है, लेकिन मैं वाह-वाही नहीं करूंगा। इन्‍होंने कुछ नहीं किया है। आपको झटका लगा न, यह अगर पांच सौ करोड़, पांच हजार करोड़ देते हैं कुछ नहीं है, मैं बता रहा हूं। इसलिए ये वो लोग हैं जो गुजरात के गांव में खेत में मिट्टी खा करके बड़े हुए हैं। ये वो लोग हैं जो कभी अपने साथियों के साथ आमली-पिपली के खेल खेलते थे। पेड़ पर चढ़ना-उतरना यही इनका जिम था। साइकिल के टायर को दौड़ाते हुए मजा लेना, यही बचपन था। बारहों महीना मां-बाप एक ही बात करते थे घर में इस बार बारिश अच्‍छी हो जाए, तो अच्‍छा होगा। बेटा पढ़ाई करेगा या नहीं करेगा यह चर्चा नहीं होती थी। चर्चा यही घर में होती थी कि भगवान करे इस बार बारिश अच्‍छी हो जाए। दूसरी प्रार्थना करते थे हमारे पास एक या दो जो पशु हैं वो कभी भूखा न रहे। ऐसे परिवार की संतान है यह वो संतान है जिन्‍होंने अपनी आंखों से यह सब देखा है, जिन्‍होंने बचपन में इस जिंदगी को जीया है।

			बारिश कम भी हुई हो, परिवार को भी जितनी जरूरत है, उससे भी कम फसल हुई हो उसके बावजूद भी फसल का ढेर अगर खेत में तैयार पड़ा है, तो चोर खाए, मोर खाए, आया मेहमान खाए, जब बच जाए तो खेडू खाए। यह संस्‍कार जिन परिवारों के हैं। खुद के पसीने से पैदा की हुई फसल चोर भी उठा कर ले जाए गुस्‍सा नहीं, पशु-पक्षी आ करके खा जाए तो भी संतोष। कोई अतिथ‍ि आ जाए, झोली है भर दे और फिर कुछ बचा-कुचा है तो बच्‍चों के लिए घर ले जाए और एक साल गुजारा कर दे, यह मेरे गुजरात के खेडू परिवार के संस्‍कार है। यह उनके बच्‍चे हैं जिनके मां-बाप ने पेट काट करके भी किसी का पेट भरने में कभी कोई कमी महसूस नहीं करने दी। उनके लिए पांच सौ करोड़ कुछ नहीं होता। यह देने के संस्‍कार ले करके आए हैं। यह जब तक देंगे नहीं, रात को सौ पाएंगे नहीं। और मैं इन परिवारों के बीच में पला-बढ़ा हूं। मैं और जगह पर जाता हूं तो मुझे कभी-कभी feel होता है कि लोगों ने मेरे से नाता तोड़ दिया हैं। हर किसी की नजर में मैं प्रधनमंत्री बन गया हूं, लेकिन एक अगर कोई अपवाद है तो मेरा सूरत है। मैं जब भी मिला हूं वही प्‍यार, वही अपनापन। प्रधानमंत्री वाला कोई Tag कहीं नजर नहीं आता है। यह जो परिवार भाव मैं अनुभव करता हूं।

			आपको हैरानी होगी, बाहर वालों को भी शायद हैरानी होगी। यह सब धनी परिवार हैं। अरबों-खरबों में खेलने वाले लोग हैं। जब से मेरा सूरत आना तय हुआ, तो जिन-जिन परिवारों से मेरा निकट नाता रहा है, अब तो अरबो-खरबों पति हो गए हैं। कभी उनकी मां के हाथ से बाजरे के रोटी खाई है। कभी खिचड़ी खाई है। मुझे फोन क्‍या आया कि आज रात को सर्किट हाऊस में आप रूकने वाले हैं, तो बाजरे की रोटी भेज दूं क्‍या? खिचड़ी भेज दू क्‍या? आज सुबह भी मुझे जो नाश्‍ता आया एक परिवार ने पुराने मुझे वो अपने सौराष्‍ट्र में जो मोटी भाखरी बनाते हैं न, उनको याद था सुबह-सुबह भेज दी। उनको पता है, प्रधानमंत्री को क्‍या खाना है, क्‍या नहीं खाना है कोई मुश्किल काम नहीं है। लेकिन यह परिवार भाव है जिसकी हर परिवार की माँ ने, जिन्‍होंने कभी न कभी मेरी चिंता की है, वो उसी प्‍यार से मेरी चिंता में लगे हुए हैं। मैं समझता हूं जीवन का इससे बड़ा कोई सौभाग्‍य नहीं होता। पद से इंसान बड़ा नहीं होता हैं, यह प्‍यार ही है जो बड़प्‍पन को अपने सीने से सिमट कर रख देता है, जो आप लोगों ने मेरे साथ किया है मैं आपका आभारी हूं।

			आज एक अस्‍पताल का लोकार्पण हो रहा है, आधुनिक अस्‍पताल है। जब मैं यहां था तो कहता था कि जिसका शिलान्‍यास मैं करूंगा, उसका उद्घाटन भी मैं करूंगा, तो लोगों को लगता था कि यह बड़ा अहंकारी है। यह अंहकार नहीं था। यह मेरे मन में एक commitment है कि यह शिलान्‍यास करके पत्‍थर गाढ़ करके तख्‍तियां लगाने की fashion समाप्‍त होनी चाहिए, जो चीज शुरू करे वो चीज परिपूर्ण होनी चाहिए। अगर परिपूर्ण नहीं होने वाली है, तो शुरू नहीं करना चाहिए। यहां आप सबको जितनी खुशी होती है, मुझे उससे भी ज्‍यादा होती है, क्‍योंकि विजया दशमी का वो दिन था। भारतीय जनता पार्टी ने मुझे प्रधानमंत्री के नाते घोषित कर दिया था, उम्‍मीदवार के रूप में। मैं देशभर में दौड़ रहा था उस समय, लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी मेरे विजया दशमी और नवरात्रि के उपवास पूर्ण हुए थे। मैं तय किया कि नहीं, मैं सूरत तो जाऊंगा ही चाहे कितनी कठिनाई क्‍यों न हो, और मैं आया था। और उस दिन यह लाल जी बादशाह वो मेरी बगल में तस्वीर निकालना चाहते थे, तो भूमि पूजन के लिए फावड़ा चलाना था, तो मैंने बादशाह को कहा 50 करोड़ दोगे तो मैं करने दूंगा, नहीं तो नहीं करने दूंगा। इस अधिकार भाव से मैंने आप लोगों के बीच काम किया है और वो मान गए थे। इतने अधिकार भाव से मैंने आप लोगों के बीच काम किया। और तब यह अस्‍पताल, जब मैं अपने सामने इसका भव्‍य रूप देखता हूं, मेरे लिए इससे बड़ा कोई संतोष नहीं हो सकता है। और इस काम को इतने बढि़या ढंग से परिपूर्ण करने के लिए पूरी टीम को मैं हृदय से बहुत-बहुत अभिनंदन करता हूं।

			मैं देख रहा था कि दाताश्री के धन से यह अस्‍पताल नहीं बना है। यह अस्‍पताल परिवार भाव से बहाया गया परिश्रम से बना है। पैसा से ज्‍यादा मूल्‍यवान परिश्रम होता है, पसीना होता है और यहां सब लोग हैं। वहां पर बैठे हुए जो सब लोग हैं, उन्‍होंने बस पैसे बहाए नहीं है, अपना पसीना बहाया है, पैसों पर पसीने का अभिषेक किया है। और इसलिए इस अस्‍पताल में जो भी आएगा, सामान्‍य रूप से मैं डायमंड की फैक्‍ट्री का उद्घाटन करता तो मैं कह देता कि आपकी फैक्‍ट्री फले-फूले, आपका कारोबार बढ़े, आप textile industries करते तो मैं शुभकामनाएं देता, लेकिन आज मैं श्राप देता हूं, शुभकामनाएं नहीं देता हूं। मैं चाहूंगा कि किसी को भी अस्‍पताल में आने की जरूरत न पड़े। और एक बार आना पड़ा तो दोबारा कभी आने की जरूरत न पड़े, ऐसा मजबूत इंसान बन करके यहां से जाए यह भी साथ-साथ शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

			हमारे देश में डॉक्‍टरों की कमी, अस्‍पतालों की कमी, महंगाई दवाइयां। आज किसी मध्‍यम वर्ग के परिवार में अगर एक व्‍यक्ति बीमार हो जाए, तो उस परिवार का पूरा अर्थकारण समाप्‍त हो जाता है। मकान लेना है, नहीं ले पाता। बेटी की शादी करवानी है, नहीं करवा पाता। एक इंसान बीमार हो जाए तो। और ऐसे समय सरकार की जिम्‍मेदारी होती है कि हर किसी को आरोग्‍य सेवा उपलब्‍ध हो, हर किसी को एक सीमित खर्च से आरोग्‍य सेवा का लाभ मिलना चाहिए। भारत सरकार ने अभी Health Policy घोषित की है। अटल जी की सरकार के बाद, 15 साल के बाद इस सरकार ने Health Policy लाई है। बीच में बहुत काम रह गए, जो मुझे करने पड़ रहे हैं। अब दवाइयां, मैं गुजरात में था तो आपको मालूम है बहुत लोगों को मैं नाराज करता था अब दिल्‍ली में गया हूं तो देश में भी बहुत लोगों को नाराज करते रहता हूं। हर दिन एक काम करता ऐसा हूं कि कोई न कोई तो मेरे से नाराज हो ही जाता है। अब जो दवाइयां बनाने वाली कंपनियां जिस इंजेक्‍शन के कभी 1200 रुपया लेते थे, जिन गोलियों के कभी साढ़े तीन सौ, चार सौ रुपया लेते थे। हमने सबको बुलाया कि भई क्‍या कर रहे हो, कितनी लागत होती है, क्‍या खर्चा होता है और नियम बना करके जो दवाई 1200 रुपये में मिलती थी वो 70-80 रुपये में कैसे मिल जाए, जो 300 रुपये में मिलती थी वो 30 रुपये में कैसे मिल जाए। करीब सात सौ दवाइयां, उसके दाम तय कर लिए ताकि गंभीर से गंभीर बीमारी में गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति को सस्‍ती दवाई मिले, यह काम किया है। दवाई बनाने वाले मुझसे कितने नाराज होंगे इसका आप अंदाजा कर सकते हैं।

			आज heart patient.. हर परिवार में चिंता रहती है heart की। हर घर में भोजन के टेबल पर खाने की चर्चा होती है। वजन कम करो, कम खाओ, चर्चा होती है करते नहीं है कोई। लेकिन dining table चर्चा जरूरत होती है। हर किसी को heart attack की चिंता रहती है और heart में stent लगवाना, अब हम लोग जानकार तो है नहीं, डॉक्‍टर कहता है कि यह लगवाओगे तो 30-40 हजार रुपया होगा, patient पूछता है कि जिंदगी का क्‍या होगा, वो कहता है कि यह लगवाओगे तो चार-पांच साल तो कोई problem नहीं होगी। फिर दूसरा बताता है कि यह लगवाओगे, imported है तो डेढ़ लाख रुपया लगता है, यह लगवा दिया तो फिर जीवनभर देखने की जरूरत नहीं है। तो गरीब आदमी भी सोचता है कि यार 40,000 खर्च करके चार साल जीना है तो डेढ़ लाख खर्च करके जिंदगी अच्‍छी क्‍यों न गुजारू, वो डेढ़ लाख रुपये वाला ले लेता है। मैं stent वालों को बुलाया, मैं कहा कि भई कितना खर्चा होता है, तुम इतने रुपये मांगते हो, सालभर उनसे चर्चा चलती रही आखिरकार दो महीने पहले हमने निर्णय कर दिया जो 40,000 रुपये में stent मिलता है वो उनको 6-7 हजार रुपये में बेचना पड़ेगा, देगा पड़ेगा। जो डेढ़ लाख में देते हैं वो 20-22 हजार में देना पड़ेगा, ताकि गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति affordable हो।

			कभी-कभार तो ऐसे सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति को मुसीबत होती है, ज्ञान होता नहीं और कुछ न कुछ लोग… अब इसके कारण सामाज का एक तबका है, बड़ा ताकतवर तबका है, उसकी मेरे प्रति नाराजगी बढ़ना बहुत स्‍वाभाविक है। लेकिन गरीब के लिए मध्‍यम वर्ग के लिए आरोग्‍य सेवाएं सुचारू रूप से उपलब्‍ध हो, उस दिशा में सरकार एक के बाद एक कदम उठा रही है। अभी जो विजय भाई बता रहे थे। हम अस्‍पताल में सस्‍ती दवाई के लिए प्रधानमंत्री भारतीय जन औषधि परियोजना यह प्रारंभ कर रहे हैं ताकि बहुत सस्‍ते में.. अभी भी मैंने देखा है कि डॉक्‍टर लोग पर्चा लिखते हैं, पर्चा ऐसे लिखते हैं ताकि वो गरीब व्‍यक्ति को बिचारे को समझ नहीं तो उस दवाई की दुकान में माल खरीदने जाता है, जहां महंगी मिलती है। हम कानून व्‍यवस्‍था करने वाले हैं डॉक्‍टर पर्ची लिखेंगे, तो लिखेंगे कि जेनरिक दवा खरीदने के लिए उसके लिए काफी है और दवा खरीदने की जरूरत नहीं है। तभी आदमी, गरीब व्‍यक्ति सस्‍ते में दवाई खरीद सकता है। जिस प्रकार से आरोग्‍य की सेवाओं में बीमार होने के बाद की चिंता है, उससे पहले preventive health care की भी उतनी ही चिंता जरूरी है।

			मेरा स्‍वच्‍छता अभियान वो सीधा-सीधा आरोग्‍य से जुड़ा हुआ है। दुनिया में सारे सर्वे कहते हैं कि बच्‍चे अगर हाथ साबुन से धोए बिना खाना खाते हैं, तो दुनिया में करोड़ो बच्‍चे इस एक कारण से मौत के शरण हो जाते हैं। क्‍या हम आदत नहीं डाल सकते। आरोग्‍य की दृष्टि से स्‍वच्‍छता। सूरत के लोगों को स्‍वच्‍छता के पाठ पढ़ाने की जरूरत नहीं है। सूरत में जब महामारी आई उसके बाद सूरत ने स्‍वच्‍छता को अपना बना लिया। सूरत का स्‍वाभाव बन गया है स्‍वच्‍छता। देश के लिए प्रेरणा है। मैं कल यह रोड शो कर रहा था, मेरे साथ दिल्‍ली से जो अफसर आए थे, वो रोड शो नहीं देख रहे थे, सफाई देख रहे थे। बोले इतनी सफाई होती है, उनके दिमाग में सफाई भर गई। मैंने कहा आप जहां जाओंगे जरा बताना सबको। यह सूरत ने स्‍वाभाव बना दिया है। स्‍वच्‍छता अगर भारत का स्‍वभाव बने तो हमारे अरबों-खरबों रुपये बीमारी के पीछे खर्च होने बंद हो जाएंगे। हमारे गरीब एक बार बीमार हो जाते हैं, एक ऑटो रिक्‍शा, ड्राइवर बीमार हो जाए तो सिर्फ वो इंसान बीमार नहीं होता उसका परिवार तीन दिन के लिए भूखा रह जाता है, घर में कोई कमाने वाला नहीं होता। और इसलिए स्‍वच्‍छता.. मैं योग को ले करके पूरे विश्‍व में आंदोलन चला रहा हूं। 21 जून को सूरत भी शानदार योग का कार्यक्रम करके दिखाए। wellness के लिए योग, शरीर स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य के लिए आज जीवन का हिस्‍सा बनता जा रहा है। हमने इंद्रधनुष योजना के तहत देशभर में उन माताओं को, उन बालकों को खोज रहे हैं, जिनका टीकाकरण नहीं हुआ। टीकाकरण का अभियान चलाते हैं। दो करोड़ से ज्‍यादा ऐसी माताएं-बहनों को खोजा है, जिन्‍होंने टीकाकरण गांव में हो रहा था, लेकिन उन्‍होंने नहीं लगवाया है। सरकार ने खोज-खोज कर लोगों की सेवा करने के लिए बीड़ा उठाया है। लेकिन जन आंदोलन आवश्‍यक होता है, जन सहकार आवश्‍यक होता है।

			कभी-कभी हम लोग यह सोचते हैं कि देश आजाद होने के बाद एक ऐसा माहौल बन गया है कि सब कुछ सरकार करेगी, लेकिन हमारा देश, उसका चरित्र अलग है। हमारा देश सरकारों से न चला है न बना है। हमारा देश न राजाओं से चला है न राजाओं ने बनाया है। हमारा देश न नेताओं से चला है न नेताओं ने बनाया है। हमारा देश चला है जनशक्ति के भरोसे, जन सेवा भाव के भरोसे। जिसके जन-जन में सेवा परमो धर्म, यह उनकी प्रकृति रही है। आप मुझे बताइये गांव-गांव आपको धर्मशालाएं दिखती हैं। हर तीर्थ यात्रा के बाद हजारों लोग रह सके, इतनी धर्मशालाएं हैं। दुनिया की कितने बड़े होटल से भी ज्‍यादा रूम होते हैं इन धर्मशालाओं के। दो-दो हजार कमरों की धर्मशालाएं होती है हमारे देश में। किसने बनाई? सरकारों ने नहीं बनाई, जतना जनार्दन ने बनाई है। गांव-गांव पानी नहीं होते थे, कुंए होते थे, बावड़ी होती थी। कौन बनाता था? सरकारें नहीं बनाती थी, जनता जनार्दन बनाती थी। गो-शालाएं क्‍या सरकार बनाती थी? जनता जनार्दन बनाती थी। पुस्‍तकालय सरकार बनाती थी, जनता जनार्दन बनाती थी। हमारे देश का यह मूल चरित्र रहा है सामाज जीवन के सारे कामों को करना सामाज की सामूहिक शक्ति का स्‍वाभाव रहा था। लेकिन आजादी के बाद धीरे-धीरे उसमें कमी आने लगी। फिर से एक बार दोबारा वो माहौल बना है। हर किसी को लगता है कि मैं समाज के लिए कुछ करूंगा, मैं सामूहिक रूप से कुछ करूंगा, मैं समाज की भलाई के कुछ करूंगा, उस दिशा में आज काम हो रहा है। मैं सूरत में बैठे हुए खास करके सौराष्‍ट्र के जितने लोग हैं। छोटे से छोटा रतन कलाकार भी उसके दिल में एक चीज़ मैंने हमेशा देखी है, अपने गांव में कुछ न कुछ अच्‍छा करने के लिए वो कुछ न कुछ देता रहता है। यह छोटी बात नहीं है जी। छोटा रतन कलाकार है। कोई ज्‍यादा income नहीं है। बड़ी म‍ुश्किल से महीना निकालता है। लेकिन खुद के गांव में कुछ होता है, तो मैं सूरत रहता हूं। गांव वाले कहते हैं कि भई जरा तुम स्‍कूल में इतना कर दो, गांव में इतना कर दो, वो रतन कलाकार कष्‍ट झेल करके भी कर देता है। यहां बैठे हर प्रमुख लोगों ने अपने गांव में उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम काम किए। कुछ न कुछ ऐसा किया है, अपने मां-बाप के नाम पर किया है, अपने परिवारजनों के नाम पर किया है, कुछ न कुछ किया है। गांव के विकास के अंदर योगदान दिया है। और आज भी गांव के साथ वैसे का वैसा नाता रखा है। दीवाली के दिन में अगर सौराष्‍ट्र जाना है, तो बस में टिकट नहीं मिलती है। यह जो लगाव है, यह समाज का उत्‍तम लक्षण है। और मैं चाहूंगा हमारे आने वाली पीढि़यों में भी यह बना रहा। पुरानी पीढ़ी के लोग रहे, तब तक चले ऐसा नहीं, आने वाली पीढि़यों में भी बना रहे। यह इस पूरे गुजरात की अमानत बनेगी। मैं फिर एक बार आज इस अस्‍पताल के उद्घाटन समारोह के समय आप सबके बीच आने का अवसर मिला, मैं आपका आभारी हूं और जैसा मथुर दास कह रहे थे, यहां से बयाना जा रहा हूं, वहां भी पानी का कार्यक्रम करने जा रहा हूं। --- जा रहा हूं वहां भी पानी का कार्यक्रम कर रहा हूं गुजरात ने पानी को ही अपनी एक बहुत बड़ी ताकत बना दिया और उसी ताकत से गुजरात आगे बढ़ रहा है और बढ करके रहेगा। इसी एक विश्‍वास के साथ मैं सबको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। उत्‍तम स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य के लिए शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

			जुलाई महीने में मैं इस्राइल जा रहा हूं। आप लोगों में से हर किसी का इस्राइल से नाता है। मैं देश्‍ का पहला प्रधानमंत्री हूं जो इस्राइल जा रहा है और डायमंड का कारोबार और इस्राइल से आज सीधा-सीधा नाता है और इसलिए वहां मैं आपका प्रतिनिधि बन करके भी जा रहा हूं। यह बात मैं आपको विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

मंच पर विराजमान गुजरात के लोकप्रिय मुख्यमंत्री श्रीमान विजय रूपाणीजी, उप मुख्यमंत्री श्रीमान नीतिनभाई पटेल, पूर्व मुख्यमंत्री आदरणीय आनंदीबेन, मंच पर विराजमान केन्द्र और राज्य के मंत्री श्री, सांसद सदस्य श्री, विधायक श्री और विशाल संख्या में उपस्थित बोटाद के भाईयों और बहनो।  

बोटाद की धरती भारतीय जनता पार्टी के कार्यकर्ता के लिए एक प्रकार से तीर्थ यात्रा होती है। शायद बोटाद की जो नयी पीढ़ी है उनको यह सुनकर आश्चर्य होता होगा कि भारतीय जनता पार्टी के कार्यकर्ता के लिए बोटाद तीर्थक्षेत्र कैसे होगा? जिस जमाने में भारतीय जनता पार्टी के पूर्व अवतार में हम जनसंघ के तौर पर कार्य करते थे। उस समय निशान दिया था। हम दिया बनाते तब ऐसा लगता था की इस बार हमारी पार्टी जीतने ही वाली है। ऐसे वह दिन थे, जनसंघ की कोई पहचान नहीं थी। जनसंघ के नेता के नाम भी कोई जानता नहीं था, उस ज़माने में, 1967 में बोटाद में पहली जनसंघ की म्युनिसिपालीटी बनी थी और जनसंघ के जीवन में विजय इतना बड़ा था की समग्र देश में बोटाद...बोटाद...हो गया था। और पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय केरल के अंदर जनसंघ के अधिवेशन में अध्यक्ष बने थे, उनको यह समाचार मिले, तो पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय खुद सीधे बोटाद आये थे, बोटाद की जनता का आभार व्यक्त करने। आज एक तरफ पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी की जन्म शताब्दी मनायी जा रही है, और दूसरी तरफ पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय का जो अर्थचिंतन था, उस अर्थ चिंतन में पंडित जी एक बात कहते थे, की देश की शकल बदलनी हो, देश को नई आर्थिक उंचाईयों पर ले जाना हो तो उनका सीधा सादा सूत्र था “हर हाथ को काम, हर खेत को पानी”। और जब पंडित दीनदयाल जी की शताब्दी मनाते हो और वह भी बोटाद की धरती पर, 400 किलोमीटर दूर से माता नर्मदा का पानी लेकर आते है वह हमारे लिए कितने आनंद के पल होंगे। बोटादवासियों के लिए कितने आनंद के पल होंगे। बहुत खुशी हो ऐसी यह घटना है। यह घटना को हम सबको मनानी है। पानी का मूल्य क्या है यह तो वही जानता है जिन्होंने सूखा कृष्णसागर तालाब देखा हो उनको पता होगा की पानी किसको कहते है। काठियावाड़ की धरती को पता चले की बिना पानी की धरती कैसी हो। काठियावाड़ के आदमी को पता हो की पानी के बगैर ज़िंदगी कैसी हो। आज जब माता नर्मदा हमारे यहां पधारे है तब यहां बैठे हुए सबको मेरी बिनती है कि हम लोग माता नर्मदा का स्वागत करें। आपकी जेब में मोबाईल फोन हो तो बाहर निकालो, मोबाईल की लाईट चालू करो और सब लोक एक साथ माता नर्मदा का स्वागत करो। आप सब मेरे साथ में बोलेंगे. नर्मदे....सर्व दे....नर्मदे..सर्व दे..

बहुत धन्यवाद साथियों...गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर आप लोगों ने जब मुझे सेवा का मौका दिया था और मैं जब देश की मीटिंग में जाता था और देश के लोग और अन्य मुख्यमंत्रियों को कहता था की हमारी आर्थिक ताकत, हमारे बजट का बड़ा हिस्सा पानी के पीछे खर्च होता है। किसी के गले यह बात नहीं उतरती थी। कई लोग मुझे कहते थे की मोदी जी आप इतने सारे रूपये पानी के पीछे खर्च कर रहे हो, आप कभी चुनाव जीतेंगे नहीं। लोगों को पसंद आये ऐसा कुछ करो। मैंने कहा भाई हम भारतीय जनता पार्टी के लोग अलग मिट्टी के है, मुझे चुनाव जीतने का कारोबार नहीं करना है, मुझे मेरे गुजरात के गांव को समृद्ध करना है। अगर एक बार मेरे गुजरात का गांव समृद्ध हो गया, तो गुजरात की प्रगति की यात्रा को कोई नहीं रोक पायेगा और गुजरात के गांव को पैसों का ढग सुख नहीं दे पायेगा, गुजरात के गांव को पानी ही सुख दे सकेगा। यह बात मेरे दिमाग में साफ थी। एक तरफ पैसों का ढग हो और दूसरी और पानी हो तो गुजरात का आदमी पानी के भरोसे पैसों से भी ज़्यादा सोना पका सके उतनी ताकत के साथ खड़ा रह सके और इसलिए हम पूरी ताकत पानी के लिए लगायी। कोई सरकार चुनाव से पहले हज़ार – दो हज़ार करोड़ की योजना गांव के नाम पर घोषित कर दे तो भी हमारे देश में वाह..वाह की हेडलाईन बनी होती और चुनाव भी जीता जा सके। कोई कल्पना कर सकता है पानी पहुंचाने के लिए सौनी योजना द्वारा 16000 करोड़ का बजट यह गुजरात सरकार खर्च कर रही है। आज यहां जो पानी पहुंचा है, 400 किलोमीटर दूर मां नर्मदा बैठे है, जिस मां नर्मदा को सिर पर पानी चढ़ाने के लिए बेटे श्रवण की तरह अपने मां-बाप को यात्रा पर ले जाये और नर्मदा पानी का आचमन कराके लाते थे और मां नर्मदा के दर्शन करके बेटे को आशीर्वाद देती थी, जो मां नर्मदा के दर्शन करने के लिए बेटा पैसे इकट्ठा करके गरीब मां को यात्रा कराता था आज खुद मां नर्मदा उनके संतानो को आशीर्वाद देने के लिए हमारे आंगन में आयी है। भाईयों-बहनों इससे बड़ा मिरेकल क्या हो सकता है? नहर में से पानी ले जाये तो खर्च कम होगा। पर मनुष्य का स्वभाव है, न आया हो तब तक बहुत ही अच्छी बातें करता है...वाह मोदी साहब, कमाल कर दिया आपने तो...और थोड़े ही दिनो में मैंने देखा बड़े  बडे पम्प लगाकर पानी की चोरी करने लगे की जहां पानी पहुंचना चाहिये वहां पहुंचे ही नहीं और एक भय पैदा हुआ। हम लोगों ने तय किया कि भले ही खर्च हो पर पाईपलाईन से पानी ले जायेंगे तो ही आखिर के गांव तक के लोगों तक पानी पहुंचे नहीं तो बेफाम पानी की चोरी होगी, कोई रोक भी नहीं सकेगा। मेरी पूरे गुजरात से विनती है, इस गुजरात के गरीब से गरीब आदमी के पेट को काटकर यह पानी की पाईपलाइन डाली गई है। गरीब की जरूरत को रोक लगाकर पानी पहुंचाने का प्रयास हुआ है। वह पानी ईश्वर का प्रसाद है। एक बूंद पानी के बिगाड़ने का मुझे या आपको कोई हक़ नहीं है। 400 किलोमीटर दूर से मां नर्मदा आयी है और 400 फूट की ऊंचाइ पर पहुंचाया है। और आज जो दूसरी योजना की शुरूआत हुई, वह पानी जब पहुंचेगा तब मां नर्मदा 500 किलोमीटर दूर होगी और पानी की ऊंचाई पहुंची होगी 500 मीटर। पानी जहां नर्मदा मैया है वहां से 500 मीटर ऊंचा ले जाने का काम गुजरात का किसान सुखी हो इसलिए किया गया है। और शोर्टकट नहीं लीया है लंबे समय के हल लाने कि दिशा में काम किया है। परिणाम प्राप्त करने की दिशा में काम किया है। आज भी हम अगर राजस्थान और गुजरात के गांव में देखें की लाखा वणझाराने बावड़ी बनाई है। हरे गांव में लाखा वणझारा की बातें सुनाई देती है। उस जमाने के करोड़ों–करोड़ों रूपये के पत्थरों से छोटे तालाब बनाकर लोगों को पानी देने के प्रयास हुए थे। भाईयों-बहनों वह दिन दूर नहीं होगा, 50 – 100 साल बाद की पीढ़ी यह पाईपलाईन से पानी पहुंचने की बात समजेंगे तब उनको लगेगा कि हमारे पूर्वज थे वह हमारे लिए पानी का यह प्रबंध करके गये थे ऐसा काम आज गुजरात में सौनी योजना द्वारा हो रहा है। इतना सब कुछ करने के बाद भी पानी की जरूरत जो है वह पूरी करने के लिए काफी प्रयत्न करने की जरूरत है। मैं गुजरात के लोगों को विनती करता हूं, कि आप जरा देखो मध्यप्रदेश की सरकार क्या काम कर रही है। मध्यप्रदेश की शिवराजसिंह की सरकार का गुजरात के हर एक किसान को आभार व्यक्त करना चाहिये। गुजरात के अखबारों का ध्यान भी नहीं पड़ा होगा, गुजरात के पानी निष्णात का भी ध्यान नहीं पड़ा होगा, नर्मदा एक ऐसी नदी है जो पर्वतों में से नहीं निकलती है। यह नदी की विशेषता है। बाकी तो नदियां पर्वत में से आती है। यह नदी जंगलों में से, घने पेड में से जो पानी रातभर गिरता रहता है वह सब मिलकर नर्मदा मैया आगे बढती है। उसका शुरूआती स्थान तो देखने जैसा है। अभी मध्यप्रदेश की सरकार ने गुजरात के गांव-गांव में पानी पहुंचे, गुजरात के किसान को 100 साल के बाद भी पानी के लिए तकलीफ ना हो इसके लिए मध्यप्रदेश की सरकार ने मध्य प्रदेश में नर्मदा के किनारे यात्रा निकाली है। पिछले 6 महीनों से यात्रा चल रही है। और वह यात्रा नर्मदा के किनारे के गांव के किसानो को जंगल बनाने की प्रेरणा देती है। नर्मदा के तट पर एक घना जंगल बनाने का अभियान चल रहा है। वह अभियान जिस तरह से चल रहा है भविष्य में कई लोग कहते है की नर्मदा का भविष्य कितना? अगर यह जंगल गये तो पानी कहां से आयेगा? उसकी फिक्र अभी से करके मध्यप्रदेश शिवराजसिंह भारतीय जनता पार्टी की सरकार ऐसा जंगल तैयार कर रही है जिससे 100 साल बाद भी मां नर्मदा न सूखे उसके फिक्र भारतीय जनता पार्टी वहां कर रही है। भारी गरमी में वहां से रोज यात्रा निकलती है। हज़ारो ग्रामजन उसके साथ जुड़ते है। और उसका समापन 15 तारीख को है। एक दिन हमारे मुख्यमंत्री विजयभाई रूपाणी भी वहां हो कर आये है। बोटाद में बैठे हुए आदमी को पता नहीं होगा की हमारे यहां पानी पहुंचाने के लीये 6 महिने से लोग पदयात्रा कर रहे है। पैड़ – पौधे लगा रहे है और उसका कारण है की मां नर्मदा में पानी एक बूंद भी कम न हो। अगर यह भाव रहा तो ही मां नर्मदा का पानी बचा पायेंगे और वह फिक्र हमें करनी पड़ेगी। वह जिम्मेदारी हमें लेनी पड़ेगी। और इसलिए टपक सिंचाई, स्प्रिंक्लर उनको जीवन का धर्म बनाना पड़ेगा। और अब टपक सिंचाई हो तो यह खेती हो सकती है यह नहीं वह सब चला गया है। हर एक प्रकार की फसल टपक सिंचाई और स्प्रिंक्लर से ली जा सकती है। हमारे पुरखों ने पानी बचाया इसलिए हमारे हिस्से में आया है। हम पानी बचायेंगे तो हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ी को पानी पहुंचने वाला है। और कोई मां-बाप ऐसे नहीं होंगे की बच्चों के जीवन का जो होना हो वह होगा हम तो अपनी व्यवस्था कर लेंगे। ऐसे मां-बाप कहीं नहीं होंगे। और इसलिए मां नर्मदा जब आशीर्वाद देने आये है तब हमारी जिम्मेदारी बढ़ जाती है।

2022, भारत की आज़ादी के 75 साल पूरे हो रहे है। जो महापुरूषों ने सालों तक आजादी का आंदोलन चलाया है। सैंकडों लोग फांसी पर चढ़ गये। हज़ारों लोगों ने अपनी जवानी जेल में बिता दी। पीढि़यां हिन्दुस्तान आज़ाद हो उसके लिए पूरी हो गई। उस आज़ादी के 75 साल 2022 में आ रहे है। हमें आज़ादी के लिए देश के लिए मरने का सौभाग्य नहीं मीला। हमें आज़ादी के लिए मुश्‍किलें सहने का अवसर नहीं मिला। पर भले ही देश के लिए मरने का अवसर न मिला हो पर आज देश के लिए जीने का अवसर जरूर मीला है। 2022 देश की आज़ादी के दिवानो के सपनों के जैसा भारत बनाने की ज़िम्मेदारी हमारी है या नहीं? मैं बोटाद वालों से पूछता हूं 2022 तक आज़ादी के 75 साल में देश के लिए कुछ करने की ज़िम्मेदारी हर एक नागरिक की है या नहीं?हमें ज़िम्मेदारी उठानी चाहिये या नहीं? हमें कोई संकल्प करना चाहिये या नहीं? 2022 में एक ऐसा काम मै लूंगा जो मेरे देश, मेरे समाज को काम आये वह मैं कर के रहूंगा। यह निर्णय हिन्दुस्तान के एक-एक नागरिक को करना चाहिये या नहीं? मेरी आपसे विनती है गांव-गांव, हर घर में, यह बात पहुंचाये कि 2022 आज़ादी के दिवानों के सपनों के जैसा हिन्दुस्तान बनाना है। हमने भी कुछ सपने देखे है। भारत सरकार ने देश के सामने एक विषय रखा है। 2022 तक हिन्दुस्तान के जो किसान है वह किसानों की आय हमें दो गुना करनी है। उसमें किसानो का साथ चाहिये। आधुनिक टेक्नोलोजी का आविष्कार चाहिये। खेती की पद्धति उत्तम कैसे हो वह करनी चाहिये। खेती के साथ अन्य कौन से काम हो सके? दूध उत्पादन कैसे हो? खेत के चारों और ईमारती लकड़ी की खेती किस प्रकार हो। खेत में सोलर एनर्जी का किस तरह उपयोग हो सके? माता-बहनों को मधुमक्खी पालन का शिक्षण दे कर शहद का उत्पादन किस तरह से बढाया जाये? 2022 तक कितने किसान हो जो तय करे की आज मैं पांच थैला यूरिया इस्तेमाल करता हूं, 2022 तक मेरी खेती मै एसी करूंगा कि पांच थैले से मैं दो थैले तक आ जाऊंगा और यूरिया में कटौती करके यह भारत माता की सेवा करूंगा ऐसा संकल्प करने वाले कितने किसान निकलेंगे? कितने किसान निकलेंगे जो तय करे कि अब मेरे खेत में एक भी पानी की बूंद बिगड़ने नहीं दूंगा। और टपक सिंचाई से खेती करूंगा और नया इतिहास बनाने का काम मैं करके रहूंगा, मेरे देश की आज़ादी के 75 साल मुझे मनाने है। यह भाव कैसे बनेगा? यह भाव पैदा करने की आवश्यकता है। और एक बार सवा सो करोड़ देशवासी संकल्प कर ले, एक देशवासी का एक संकल्प, एक परिवार का एक संकल्प। हर एक नगर खुद का संकल्प तय करे, बोटाद तय करे की 2022 में बोटाद को यहां तक पहुंचाना है। हर एक गांव यह तय करे की 2022 तक हमारे गांव में किसी को गरीब रहने नहीं देना है कुछ न कुछ काम उसके लिए ढूंढ लेना है। कौन कहता है गरीबी से देश मुक्त नहीं हो सकता? कौन कहता है की दुनिया के सामने भारत आ कर के खड़ा नहीं रह सकता ? भाईयों-बहनों एक ज़माना था हमने हथियार रख दिये थे। बारिश आये तो ठीक और न आये तो भी ठीक। अगर आये तो साल अच्छा गया, न आये तो कुदरत की मेहरबानी। आज से 15 साल पहले कभी काठियावाड़ के आदमी ने सोचा नहीं था की सूखे में से भी हम बाहर आ सकते है। यह मानवी के पुरुषार्थ का कमाल है कि आज गुजरात सूखे में से बाहर आ गया और स्वप्रयत्न से आया, पुरुषार्थ से आया, योजना से आया। पानी जैसी बड़ी समस्या को अगर हम पार कर सकते है तो विकास की नयी उंचाईयों को क्यूं पार नहीं कर सकते? और इसलिए गुजरात ने कृषि के क्षेत्र में एक नयी ताकत के दर्शन करवाये है। उसको हम नयी उंचाईयों पर किस तरह से ले जाये उसके लिए प्रयास करें। हमारा एक प्रयास है पुरानी पद्धतियों से देश को बहार निकालना है। आधुनिक विज्ञान टेक्नोलोजी मनुष्य का स्वभाव बनाना है। यहां मैंने जब कहा कि आपके मोबाईल फोन की लाईट चालू करो, सबके हाथ में मोबाईल फोन था। भाईयों-बहनों आपके हाथ में जो मोबाईल है ना ऐसी स्थिती पैदा करनी है कि पूरी सरकार राज्य की हो या केन्द्र की वह आपके मोबाईल फोन में आ जाये ऐसी स्थिती मुझे पैदा करनी है। आपका मोबाईल फोन ही आपकी बैंक बन जाये। उस दिशा में देश को ले जाना है। एक भीम एप बनाई है। और मैं चाहता हूं की बोटाद के इस कार्यक्रम में आया हुआ हर एक व्यक्ति खुद के मोबाईल में भीम एप डाउनलोड करे। और अब कारोबार रोकड़ से नहीं, भीम एप से चलाये। मुझे गरीब लोगों की मदद करनी है। आज मध्यम वर्ग का सामान्य मानवी छोटी दुकान हो, थोड़ा माल खरीदे तो भविष्य में अच्छी आमदनी होने की आशा हो। तो वह क्या करेगा? ऊंचे ब्याज से पैसे लेकर आता है। बैंक उसको पैसे नहीं देगी। क्योंकि उसका कोई रोकड़ न हो, सब रोकड़ व्यवहार हो। बैंक वाला कहेगा किसके आधार पर तुझे पैसे दूं? अगर आप भीम एप से पैसे की लेन-देन करो, तो आपका हिसाब अपने आप बनता जायेगा। नाई की दुकान हो, सिलाई की दुकान हो उसकी लेन-देन इससे चले तो बैंक में हिसाब जायेगा कि इस भाई की महीने की 2000 की लेन-देन है तो 500-700 की लेन-देने में कोई दिक्कत नहीं होगी, उसको ऊंचे ब्याज पर पैसे लाने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी और बैंक सामने से उसको पैसे देगी। हम एक ऐसी व्यवस्था करना चाहते है कि आपके कारोबार की माहिती भीम एप के जरीये जब बैंक के पास पहुंचे तो बैंक हिसाब देखें और बैंक आपको मेसेज भेजेगा की पिछले महिने आप 2000 की लोन लेने के हकदार थे पर अब आपका काम सुधर गया है तो आप 2500 की लोन के लिए हकदार है। छ महीने बाद कारोबार में सुधार आये तो फिर बैंक का ही मेसेज आये की पहले आप 2500 के हकदार थे अब आपका काम बढ़ा है और अब आप 5000 लेने के हकदार बन गये है। लेना न लेना वह आपके ऊपर है। पर एक बार आप यह व्यवस्था के साथ जुड़े, यह बैंक आपके घर आकर आपकी सेवा करे ऐसा परिवर्तन मुझे लाना है। वह तभी आयेगा जब आपका साथ-सहकार मुझे मिलेगा। जो नव-युवान है उनको इस वेकेशन में मुझे कमाते हुए देखना है। आजकल हिन्दुस्तान में भी वेकेशन में युवा लोग कुछ न कुछ करने का उत्साह दिखाते है। पहले हम पढ़ते थे कि अमेरिका में बच्चे पढ़े तो शनि-रवि ड्राईविंग करे, होटेल्स में काम करे और कमाई करे और वापस पांच दिन पढ़े। और हम कहते थे के बच्चे बहुत अच्छा करते है। आजकल हिन्दुस्तान के बच्चे भी करते है। वह लोग भी काम करने का उत्साह दिखाते है और महेनत करने में जरा भी संकोच नहीं करते है। उनको शर्म नहीं है अगर रिक्शा चलानी पड़े तो गर्व से चलाते है। और पेसेन्जर के साथ अंग्रेजी में बात करते है। तीन महीना वेकेशन है तो रिक्शा चलाते है। एक नया कल्चर पैदा हो रहा है। इन नव-युवको को इस वेकेशन में कमाने के लिए भारत सरकार ने एक बहुत अच्छी योजना रखी है। आप आपके मोबाईल में भीम एप डाउनलोड करो और आप अन्य कोई एक को भीम एप डाउनलोड करना सीखाओ। भीम एप द्वारा तीन बार लेन-देन करना सीखाओ। तीन बार अगर वह इस्तेमाल करे तो आपके खाते में सरकार की और से यह काम करने के लिए 10 रूपये आपके खाते में जमा होंगे। एक दिन में ऐसे 20 लोगों को पकड़ो, तो शाम तक आपके मोबाईल के खाते में 200 रूपये आ जायेंगे। एक महीने में आपको पांच से छह हजार की कमाई होगी। इस तीन महीने के वेकेशन में 15 से 20 हजार कमाना, नवयुवाओं के लिए बांये हाथ का खेल है। और यही काम कोई दुकानवाला करे, व्यापारी करे और अगर वह अपनी दुकान पर कहे कि मैं तो भीम से ही पैसे लूंगा और भीम से ही दूंगा तो उसको एक ग्राहक के लिए अगर तीन बार लेन-देन हो तो उनको 25 रूपये देने का विचार सरकार ने किया है। शाम होते ही 10 ऐसे लोग आये तो 250 रोज की उसकी आय बढ़ जायेगी। गरीब आदमी भी कमा सके और देश का पूरा तंत्र बदल जाये उस दिशा में काम करने का बीड़ा उठाया है। मैं गुजरात के युवाओं को कहता हूं और गुजराती व्यापारी को बहुत अच्छे से पता होता है की इससे क्या होगा। उनको देर नहीं लगेगी। मैं आपको निमंत्रण देता हूं, खास करके मेरे युवकों को निमंत्रण देता हूं। इस वेकेशन में 25000 कमाने का संकल्प करो। भारत सरकार की योजना है और कोई युवान ऐसा नहीं होगा जिसको इस वेकेशन में 25000 नहीं कमाने हो। सरकार के पास योजना है। व्यापारीयों को मेरा आग्रह है की अगर आप चाहे तो आपकी दुकान में 50000 तक की आय बढ़ा सकते है। जो योजना रखी है उसको आप आगे बढ़ाईये।

भाईयों-बहनों परिवर्तन लाने की दिशा में काम करना है। आज नर्मदा मैया पीने का पानी, शुद्ध पीने का पानी आरोग्य का उत्तम मार्ग है। पीने का शुद्ध पानी हो तो आरोग्य का अनेक प्रश्नों का वही समाधान हो जाता है। आज गुजरात में एक ज़माना था जब हम लोग सब विपक्ष में थे तब गुजरात में 4 से 13 फिसदी तक घरों में नल से पानी आता था। हमारे आने के बाद जो अभियान उठाया, आज गुजरात में 80 फिसदी घर ऐसे है, जहां रसोई घर में नल से पानी आता है। यह माता-बहनों को सिर पर मटका रख कर दूर तक जाना पड़ता था वह बंध कराने का काम हजारों करोड़ खर्च करके हमने पूरा किया है। भाईयों-बहनों गुजरात का भाग्य उसमें है कि ऐसी स्थायी व्यवस्थाओं को आगे बढायें। छोटे रास्तों से हम आगे नहीं बढ़े है और बढ़ने वाले भी नहीं है। सच्चा रास्ता लंबा हो पर उस रास्ते पर गये है और उसके परिणाम आज दिख रहे है। उस शक्ति को और बढ़ाना है। पूरे देश के विकास के अंदर गुजरात उसका पूरा योगदान देता रहे, उस तरह गुजरात को आगे बढ़ाना है। और इतनी बडी संख्या में, आज सुबह से मैं जहां गया वहां अद्भूत मात्रा में लोग, अनेक-अनेक आशीर्वाद। मैं गुजरात के लोगों का जितना आभार व्यक्त करुं उतना कम है। देश में प्रधानमंत्री तो काफी आये पर मैं एक अपवाद हूं। इतने साल मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर काम करने के बाद प्रधानमंत्री बनने का मौका मिला ऐसा मैं पहला आदमी हूं। और इसके कारण मुझे सारी छोटी-छोटी बाते पता चलती है यूरिया समय पर न पहुंचे तो किसान को क्या तकलीफ होती है वह मुझे पता होता है। पानी पहुंचाने के समय पानी न पहुंचे और फसल पीली पड़ना शुरु हो जाये तो किसान का खून भी पीला पड़ना शुरु हो जाता है। भाईयों-बहनों आप के बीच रह कर मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर जो भी कुछ सीखा हूं वह आज मुजे प्रधानमंत्री के तौर पर काम करने में इतना मददगार साबित हो रहा है। समाज के सामान्य प्रश्नों को समझने की और उसके कारण मेरे में जो काम करने की दृष्टि आयी है उसका लाभ आज हिन्दुस्तान के सभी राज्यों को मिल रहा है, दूर-दूर के विस्तारों को मिल रहा है और उसके लिए मैं सदा सर्वदा गुजरात वासियों का रूणी रहूंगा जिन्होंने मुझे शिक्षित किया, दीक्षित किया, मेरी कुशलता बढ़ाई, और देश के लिए आपने मुझे प्रशिक्षित करके भेजा है उसके लिए मैं आपका बहुत आभारी हूं। फिर से एक बार दोनो मुठ्ठियां बंध करके पूरी ताकत से मेरे साथ बोलेंगे, ‘नर्मदे...सर्वदे…’  

नर्मदे...सर्वदे...

नर्मदे...सर्वदे...

नर्मदे...सर्वदे...

धन्यवाद.........

तबियत कैसी है? इस बार गरमी थोड़ी जल्दी शुरु हो गई है। मंच पर विराजमान गुजरात के लोकप्रिय मुख्यमंत्री श्रीमान विजयभाई, नीतिनभाई, श्री बाबुभाई बोखीरिया, श्री गणपतभाई वसावा।

आज सूमुल डेरी के तत्वावधान में आप सब को मिलने का सौभाग्य मिला है जिसके निमित्त मेरे युवा साथी भाई राजु पाठक, मंच पर विराजमान विधायक श्री सांसद श्री, सहकारी आगेवान और बडी मात्रा में उपस्थित हुए मेरे आदिवासी भाइयो और बहनों।

इस व्यारा में मैने चप्पलें घिस डाली है। स्कूटर पर आता था तो कभी कंधे पर झोला उठाकर बस में से उतरकर चल के जाता। कितने सालों से इस विस्तार में गरीब आदिवासियों के बीच रहकर, सामाजिक कार्य करने के मुझे संस्कार मिले। भारतीय जनता पार्टी के कार्यकर्ता के तौर पर आया, मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर भी आया पर मैंने इस विस्तार में इतना बडा विराट कार्यक्रम पहली बार देखा। मेरी नजर जहां तक पहुंचे, सर ही सर दिखाई दे रहे हैं।

इतना विराट दृश्य और ऐसी उत्तम discipline, ऐसी उत्तम शिस्त; आप सभी को सर झुका के नमन करता हूं। आप सभी तो यहां मुझे आर्शीवाद दे रहे हैं, लाखों की संख्या में आकर आर्शीवाद दे रहे हो, पर मैं अनुभव करता हूं की यह विस्तार के ग्यारह लाख; जिसमें से यहां एक भी मौजूद नहीं है। ऐसे ग्यारह लाख पशु, वह भी आज हमें आर्शीवाद दे रहे हैं। आज का यह मेरा क्षण, मैं वह ग्यारह लाख पशुओं को समर्पित करता हूं। आज पशुदान के द्वारा पशुओं को उत्तम आहार, इससे बडी सेवा कौन सी हो सकती है? इससे बडा जीवन का संतोष कौन सा हो सकता है?

सूमुल ने जिस तरह अच्छा काम किया है, और सूमुल आज उसकी सवर्ण जयंती मना रहा है। 50 साल की उसकी यात्रा, जिसने यहां के आर्थिक जीवन को बदल डाला है। यह वही सूमुल है जिसकी शुरूआत देश के भूतपूर्व नायाब प्रधानमंत्री मोरारजीभाई देसाई ने की थी।

और आज मेरा सौभाग्य है की हर एक समय आप के बीच आता रहता हूं, और आज जब सूमुल एक लंबी छलांग लगा रहा है, consumer market में, फूड प्रोसेसिंग में, नई ऊंचाईंयों को सर करने के सपने के साथ कदम रख रहा है, सूमुल को, इस सहकारी प्रवृत्ति को, उसको जी जान से आगे ले जाने वाले सभी खाताधारकों को, दूध मंडलियों को और विशेषतः पशुपालन की उत्तम कामगीरी करनार मेरी आदिवासी बहनों को हृदयपूर्वक अभिनंदन देता हूं|

आदिवासी विस्तार का विकास कैसे होगा? आदिवासी के जीवन में quality of life  बदलाव कैसे आये? उसकी जीवन परंपरा का रक्षण हो और साथ ही विकास के उसके सपने साकार हो; उसकी उत्तम व्यूहरचना, उत्तम रणनीति; उमरगाम से अंबाजी तक पूरे आदिवासी पट्टे में हमने कर दिखाई है। और देश के विद्वानों, आज नहीं तो कल सामाजिक-आर्थिक परिवर्तन जनभागीदारी से कैसे किया जा सकता है? संस्कार और सहकार की जुगलबंदी से कैसे किया जाता है? वह गुजरात ने करके दिखाया है। आज सूमुल ने, उसके कर्ताहर्ता ने और पिछले पचास वर्ष में सूमुल को यहां तक पहुंचाने में जिस-जिसने योगदान दिया है; हमारे लिए राजकीय पक्षापक्षी सहकारी प्रवृत्ति में अंदर नहीं आने देनी है। इसलिए पचास सालों में जिन्होने भी योगदान दिया है, और आज राजुभाई के नेतृत्व में जो प्रगति हो रही है, वह सभी अभिनंदन के अधिकारी हैं और अनेक शुभकामनाएं देने के लिए आया हूं।

आज मुझे एक महत्वपूर्ण घोषणा भी करनी है। हमें पता है जब दिल्‍ली में हमारी सरकार बनी, सिर्फ एक हफ्ता भी नहीं हुआ था। विजय के फूल-हार भी ताज़ा थे और जिसको हम पसंद नहीं थे उनको तो आज भी पसंद नहीं है। उन्होने बवाल मचा दिया था दाल के दाम, दाल के दाम, दाल के दाम। गरीब की दाल गई, सब कुछ हमें पहले से मिला था पर हमारे माथे पड़ा और उस समय मैंने देश के लोगों को विनती की थी की हम जो तुवर की दाल खाते है, दुनिया में बहुत ही कम जगह में तुवर की खेती होती है। पूरी दुनिया में से अगर खरीदें तो जितना चाहिए उतना समय पर ना मिले और कभी मिले तो हमारे यहां बहनें कहेंगी की इसका दाना ऐसा है, यह पानी में चढ़ती है, यह पानी में नहीं चढ़ती और सब वापस अटक जाता है। मैंने देश के किसानों को विनती की थी, में तो नया-नया ही प्रधानमंत्री बना था। मैने देश के किसानो को विनती की थी की देश के गरीबों को प्रोटीन कठोल में से मीलता है उडद हो, तुवर हो, मूं ग हो, चने हो, वह गरीब के लिए अनिवार्य है। मैंने देश के किसानों  को विनती की थी की आप जो भी पकाते हो वह पकाओ पर बीच में थोड़ा कठोल भी बोया करो। मुझे मेरे देश के किसानों के आगे आज सर झुकना है उनको नमन करना है।एक जज़बात को उन्होंने स्‍वीकार किया और देश में कठोल का विक्रम उत्पादन करके दिखाया और आज सरकार के बाल की खाल उखाड़ने वालों का मुंह मेरे देश के किसानो ने बंद कर दिये। थाली में सस्ती दाल मिलना शुरु हो गया, गरीब के पेट में सस्ती दाल जाने लगी।

पिछले साल बारिश देरी से शुरू होने के कारण खेती का टाईम टेबल विलंबित हुआ था और परिणामतः कठोल के उत्पादन में भी समय गया और हमने minimum sport price से पहली बार देश में कठोल खरीदने का निर्णय किया। पर किसानो ने मेरे ध्यान में  रखा की साहब यह खरीदारी पंद्रह तारीख को बंद होने वाली है, अभी हमें थोडा समय चाहिये क्योंकि यह पूरा टाईम-टेबल में देरी हुई है।

नाफेड पंद्रह तारीख तक बंद न करे तो कुछ करो। आज मैं देश और गुजरात के किसानों को कहता हूं की सरकार ने खरीदी का समय एक सप्ताह बढ़ा दिया है अब किसानों को चिंता करने की जरूरत नहीं है। आपके फसल को तैयार होने में अगर विलंब है तो आपको भी उसका लाभ मिलेगा जिससे कठोल उगाने वाले किसानों को कोई मुश्किल नहीं होगी और उसकी फिक्र करने की जिम्मेदारी सरकार की है। उसका विश्वास फिर से यह निर्णय से उजागर होगा कारण गरीब के घर में, उसकी थाली में उनको उत्तम तरह के प्रोटिन खा सके उसके लिए सरकार ने यह बीड़ा उठाया है। मेरे किसान भाईयों ने वह बीड़ा उठा लिया है और सरकार उनके सम्‍मान करने की बात को आगे बढ़ाने की दिशा कृतसंकल्‍प है।

भाईयों-बहनो आज 958 करोड़ रुपये की पानी की योजना आगे बढ़ाने का शिलान्यास हुआ है। आप जब उनकी फिल्म देख रहे थे तब देखा होगा की उसमे कहा है की पानी नीचे से उठाकर 118 मीटर की उंचाई पर ले जाया जायेगा और वहां पहुंचने के बाद खेत तक नीचे वापस आएगा। आप सोच सकते है कि 50 मंजिला ईमारत से भी उपर तक पानी पहुंचाने का काम और वह भी सामान्य नहीं, ऐसी बड़ी पाईपलाईन जिसमें मारूति कार तक चली जाये। कितना बडा विरल कार्य है। इसलिए 70 साल तक जब भूतकाल में सरकारें  चलती थी, आज भी मै हिन्दुस्तान के कोने कोने में जाता हूं तो गरीब आदमी क्या मांगता है? साहब हमारे गांव में मिट्टी का काम करवा देना गुजरात में कोई मिलेगा तो क्या कहेगा? मोदी साहब बहुत हुआ, अब पेवर रोड चाहिये। उच्छल निझर के आदिवासी मुझे मिलने आते थे कि साहब रोड तो है पर अब पेवर रोड चाहिये, Four Laneचाहिये क्‍योंकि गुजरात ने विकास के नये मॉडल के साथ जनमानस को भी तैयार किया है। आज भी हिन्दुस्तान के काफी जगहों पर हेन्डपम्प लगा दो तो बहुत बड़ा काम किया हो ऐसा है, तीन-चार चुनाव भी जीत जायेंगे, एक हेन्‍डपम्‍प लगा दो तो।

हमारे विजयभाई का सपना है की गुजरात को हेन्डपम्प से मुक्त करना है, पाईपलाईन से मेरी बहनों को रसोईघर तक पानी पहुंचाना है। नल चालु करें और पानी आये ऐसा सपना देखा है। एक आधुनिक हिन्दुस्तान बनाना हो तो किस तरह बनाया जाये, व्यक्ति के जीवन में बदलाव किस तरह से लाया जाये, उनकी आवश्यकताओं की पूर्ति कैसे होगी उस दिशा में काम उठाया है। आज सूमुल में आया हूं तब एक डेरी और किसानों को मिलाकर कितना बड़ा आर्थिक revaluation किया जा सकता है।

आप कल्पना करो और मान लो की दस गांव हम पकड़ते है दस गांव में किसान उसके खेत के आसपास Solar Panel लगा दें और सौर उर्जा पैदा करें, सूरज से बिजली; और वह उर्जा थोड़ी उसके लिए रखें और थोडी गुजरात सरकार खरीदे। आप मुझे बताओ की सहकारी प्रवृत्ति से जैसे दूध उत्पादन हो रहा है ठीक उसी तरह सूर्य शक्ति द्वारा बीज उत्पादन हो सकता है या नहीं? किसानों को बिजली का भार कम हो सकता है या नहीं? और देश को विदेशों से जो पेट्रोलियम चीजें लानी पड़ रही है उसमें कटौती हो सकती है या नहीं? दक्षिण गुजरात में पहाड़ भी है, उत्तम प्रकार के कुदरती जंगली फल-फूल भी है। उत्तम शहद का उत्पादन हमारे किसान दूध के उत्पादन के साथ कर सकते है। बहनों को शहद उत्पादन की ट्रेनिंग मिले और दूध लेने जो गाड़ी जाये वह साथ में शहद भी लेकर आये उसका packing हो, Branding हो और दुनिया में सूमुल का शहद भी किस तरह से बिकना चालु हो और उसकी अतिरिक्त आय हो।  दस-बार गांव का cluster, दस-बार गांव का गोबर एक जगह इकठ्ठा हो। जैसे दूध इकठ्ठा होता है वैसे ही गोबर इकठ्ठा हो, गांव का कचरा इकठ्ठा हो। उसमें से गैस का उत्पादन हो और वह गैस यह दस गांव में देने की व्यवस्था हो और उसमें से भी आय मिले। को-ऑपरेटिव तरह से इतने नये प्रोजेक्ट्स हम ले सकते है जिसके कारण सूमुल केन्द्रवर्ती रहकर यहां के पूरे जीवन को किस तरह बदल सके उनके पायलट प्रोजेक्ट शुरु करने चाहिये। अगर सफलता मिले तो उसको scalable करके उनका विस्तार करना चाहिये। हमने गुजरात में सिंचाई के पानी के लिए सिंचाई समिति बनाने की कल्‍पना की है।

किसानों की पानी समिति हो, सहकारी हो पानी का पूरा हिसाब रहे ‘per drop more crop’ एक-एक बूंद पानी में से विपुल मात्रा में फसल पैदा हो, ऐसे आयोजन की तैयारी आज से करें तो यह 958 करोड रुपये के खर्च से जो पानी की योजना बन रही है, पीने का शुद्ध पानी भी मिले और दूर सुदूर अलग-अलग स्‍थानों पर वाड़ी योजना चला सकते हैं।

समग्र देश में वाड़ी योजना एक आकर्षण का केन्द्र बनी है। दक्षिण गुजरात उसमें सफल हुआ है। वह वाड़ी योजना की फसल, टपक सिंचाई, sprinkler उसका लाभ कैसे मिलेगा। हमारे दक्षिण गुजरात में शुगर की खेती, गन्ने की खेती; उसमें से गन्ने का उत्पादन एक समय था, जब बहुत ज्यादा पानी से गन्ने पकाये जाते थे और उस समय मैने गन्ने के उत्पादकों को बुलाया और मैंने कहा की compulsory किसानों को sprinkler से खेती सिखाओ। और आज मुझे खुशी है की गुजरात में जहां गन्ने की खेती होती है, हर एक जगह पर टपक सिंचाई द्वारा, फव्‍वारा पद्धति से कम से कम पानी से गन्ने पकाने में सफलता प्राप्त हुई है और उसका लाभ गन्ने की फेक्टरियों को भी मिल रहा है। sugar content बढ़ा है, गन्ने में से ज्यादा रस निकलने लगा है उस रस में से ज्यादा चीनी मिल रही है। इन सभी से हम कई क्रांतिकारी कदम उठाते रहे है।

 

मुझे याद है आज से दस साल पहले एक छोटा सा जिला बनाया था हमने देखते ही देखते यह तापी जिले ने अपनी अलग पहचान बना ली है। उच्छल निजर के मेरे आदिवासी आज केले पकाते है और आज दुनिया के बाजार में उच्छल के केले बेचे जाये वह स्थिति गुजरात ने बनाकर दिखाई है। जैसे उत्पादन में विविधता आई है वैसे हमारा अगला बल है, value addition मूल्य वृद्धि, फूड प्रोसेसिंग जिसे करने में अपने गुजरात का किसान जो प्रयोगशील है, आदिवासी किसान भी प्रयोगशील है।

एक जमाना था दाहोद जिले का किसान भुट्टे से आगे कुछ सोच नहीं सकता था दाहोद के आदिवासियों ने इतनी बडी क्रांति की है कि वह खेत शब्द भूल गये है और खेत को फुलवाड़ी कहना शुरु कर दिया है और दाहोद जिले के आदिवासी ने उगाये हुए फूल मुंबई में सुबह भगवान को चढ़ाते हैं। यह ताकत गुजरात के आदिवासी के पास है।

भाईयो-बहनो, एक क्रांति सहकारी आंदोलन द्वारा, संस्कारिता के आंदोलन द्वारा, सामाजिक एकता का बीडा उठाकर गुजरात ने कर दिखाया है। आज के नवतर प्रयास को, गुजरात सरकार के पानी के अभियान को, सूमुल के दूध के अभियान को मेरी और से अनेक अभिनंदन देता हूं। पर मेरी किसानों से विनती है हमें ध्यान देना चाहिये की आज भी हमारे यहां माता-बहनें ही पशुपालन संभालती है, पुरुषों का कोई योगदान होता नहीं है। उनको पता भी नहीं होता की गाय की क्या हालत है यह सब। सब बहनों के भरोसे छोड़ दिया होता है थोड़ा अगर ध्यान दिया जाये। आज हमारे पशु जितना दूध देते है उसके बजाय उतने ही पशु डबल दूध कैसे दे उसके वैज्ञानिक प्रयोग होते है। सूमुल ने उसमें काफी काम किया है हम उसको अपनायें, हमारे पशु बीमार ना पडे उसका ध्यान रखें, पशु की दूध देने की क्षमता बढें ऐसे पशुपालन की और ध्यान केन्द्रित करना ये भारत की आवश्यकता है। े

अभी दुनिया में पशु द्वारा जो दूध उत्पादन होता है उसके सामने हम काफी पीछे है। पूरे देश में जो दूध उत्पादन प्रति पशु जो होता है, उसके सामने गुजरात काफी आगे है पर गुजरात अभी भी काफी आगे जा सके उस स्थिती में है। और मै आग्रह करुंगा, गुजरात की सभी डेरियों को मेरा आग्रह है, गुजरात के सारे पशुपालकों को मेरा आग्रह है, गुजरात के किसानों को मेरा आग्रह है की हम हमारे पशु की दूध उत्पादन क्षमता किस तरह बढायें, per capita mild production किस तरह से बढे, और जितने भी प्रकार से पर capita milk production बढेगा, उसके सामने per capita milk consumption भी बढेगा। और जब गरीब का बालक भी सस्ता दूध प्राप्त करेगा, तो nutrition की जो फिक्र लगी रहेती है उसमें से भी हमारे बच्चों को हम बाहर ला सकेंगे।

इस उत्तम काम में आप मुझे सहयोग दो इसी अपेक्षा के साथ फिर से एकबार यह स्वर्णिम जयंती पर्व पर मेरी बहुत सारी शुभकामनाएं आप के बीच आने का अवसर मिला इतनी बडी संख्या में यहां आ कर आपने आर्शीवाद दिये, आदिवासी माताओं ने आर्शीवाद दिये मै फिर से एक बार आप सब का आभार व्यक्त करता हूं।

भारत माता की जय

He said that after assuming office, he sought details on impact of development schemes in Dadra and Nagar Haveli; and since then the Union Government has worked on areas needing attention.

Speaking on development themes, he said that every Indian must have access to housing facilities. He said that in less than a year, the number of beneficiaries under the Ujjwala scheme for LPG has crossed 2 crore.

The Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government will never allow the poor and the middle class to be looted. He urged the assembled people to download the BHIM App for cashless transactions.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the SUMUL cattle feed plant at Bajipura in southern Gujarat. He also laid the Foundation Stone for three Lift Irrigation Schemes, and inaugurated the Drinking Water Supply Scheme for Vyara Town and Jesinhpur-Dolvan Groups of Tapi district. 

Addressing a large gathering, the Prime Minister recalled having worked in this area for a long time. He said SUMUL – the Surat District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited - has empowered several people in the nearby areas. He said the stretch from Umbergaon to Ambaji has been transformed and this has benefited the tribal communities of Gujarat. Here, in SUMUL we see the positive results that can be achieved when Sahkar (Cooperatives) and Sarkar (Government) work together, the Prime Minister said. He said SUMUL also illustrates the good that happens when farmers and dairies work closely. 

The Prime Minister said that Tapi district is one of the newer districts of Gujarat, and he is happy to see it achieve remarkable progress. 

The Prime Minister called for value addition in the agriculture sector, and focus on increasing per capita milk production.

                Mr Praful Bhai Patel, Administrator of Daman, Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli on the dias, Mr. Natu Bhai, MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mr. Lalu Bhai, MP from neighbouring Daman and Mr. Raman Kakva, President of District Panchayat, Chairman of Silvassa, Bhai Rakesh Chauhan Ji and my dear brothers and sisters of Dadra & Nagar Haveli who are present herein large numbers.

Will you do one thing? Please take out your mobile phones and let us begin this grand show by turning on the lights of the phones. Each one's mobile phone should glow. See all the camera-men are recording you. Everyone's hand should be raised in the air. Shake the hands above. Shake your mobile phones. See the stars are twinkling. Look at the strength of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Speak aloud, Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!  (Victory  to Mother India!)

You have done a splendid job today.

The people of the country or of any part of the world would have been surprised to see this programme that a small place like Silvassa, occupying a small area of the country, with a small share in the parliamentary seat but the crowd present here today is even bigger than that of any rally in the country. Brothers and sisters, the Union Territory is administered by the centre whether it is Dadra & Nagar Haveli or Daman and Diu; but usually the people were not even aware of the government! They used to consider the collector as the government. For the first time after Praful bhai came here as the administrator that every citizen started feeling that they are being protected by someone in Delhi and that someone from Delhi is concerned about their happiness and sorrows. The people of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu had such a positive feeling for the first time. Otherwise they had assumed that there was no Government and since Delhi was far way there was no one to address their issues. But we have proved that even the smallest of the small areas and poorest of the poor citizens has the same right over the country as a person sitting in Delhi. Therefore, it is the country of 125 crore citizens who are the rulers of their country. It is the responsibility of every citizen to transform the fate of every citizen of this country. I was told that the last time any Prime Minister visited this place was about 35 to 40 years ago. The citizens who have turned 35 years old would not even remember whether this small place was ever included in the list of any Prime Minister. The last time about 35 to 40 years ago the former Prime Minister of India Shri Morarji Bhai Desai ji had visited this place. After that I got this privilege to visit this place as the Prime Minister. But this is not the first time that I have come here. Hardly there would be any Panchayat which was not visited by me. I used to go around on the scooter. You would find several families here who would tell you that “Modi ji used to come here and used to have meals with us. He used to have tea with us”. I got the opportunity to roam around in this entire region and because of that I am familiar with your problems. I am familiar with the possibilities of development of this region. In a way Silvassa and Daman have become Mini India. People from every corner of India can be found here. When lands were being leased out to the tribal people, the best work was done in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time. The then Government of India and the Ministers from Congress used to instigate the tribals and spread lies. They used to tell that Modi government did not give any land to the tribal people. When I came to power in the centre I was astonished! Where the responsibility directly lies with the officers of the central government and state government has no role, yet the state government was being accused!  The government in the centre that was ruling for so many years used to blame the state governments and make false accusations. I am pained to say that the tribal brothers of Dadra & Nagar Haveli were also not given any land lease. It was not expected of them. When we came to power and appointed Praful bhai for its administration we asked to find out all the schemes that were not implemented. Earlier the government officials used to prefer union territories for service. They used to think that they can lead a lavish life there by taking care of the MP. Isn't that the truth? But now this is not the Congress government, but Modi government. Work has to be done for the public. A lot of hard work and toiling needs to be done. I am working with this objective. Consequently, today thousands of families are being given the lease of land today. For the first time thousands of tribal families who were holding these lands for several generations but didn't have the piece of paper to prove that it was their land are now getting their rights over the land. Today I congratulate the Administrator of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and his entire team for doing this great job of giving the land rights to the tribal brothers and sisters. I am getting this great opportunity to hand-over this letter of rights to thousands of families.

Brothers and sisters,

2325 tribal families receiving rights over land, is the greatest event of this region since independence, the biggest event! You can imagine the immense joy and satisfaction of my mind. Those glowing mobile phones were for my tribal brothers.

Brothers and sisters,

The year 2022 will mark 75 years of independence. Several people had laid down their lives for the country's freedom. Can't each Indian have a dream for 2022? Shouldn't everyone sitting here have a thought and a desire of doing something for the country by the year 2022 when 75 years of independence will be completed? Close both the fists and tell me that you will do. You will do it for the country, not for yourself. You will make at least smallest of the contribution. It will create an environment in the entire country where 125 crore Indians will be determined to do something for the country. Then no one can stop India from progressing. We have a dream. By the time India completes 75 years of independence in the year 2022 there should not be any poor person who does not have his own house. The poorest of the poor should have his own house or not? Brothers and sisters, according to a survey, 6234 families in Dadra & Nagar Haveli do not have their own house and in an urban centre like Silvassa 800 families do not have houses. The work of providing these 7000 families their own accommodation is being launched today. So, I congratulate my poor families. The way you have illuminated the area with your mobile phones, we want those houses to be electrified in the same manner. We want to provide such houses with facilities like electricity connection, water supply, toilets and schools and hospitals in the neighbourhood. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Today we have accomplished another important work and that is providing gas connection and gas ovens. We are also gifting pressure cookers and gas lighters. Brothers and sisters, look at the mentality of the politicians of our country. During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, on the one side was the Bharatiya Janata party that had declared me as the Prime Ministerial candidate and the contesting party was the Congress. The political parties make promises during elections. The Congress party had held a meeting in Delhi for framing election strategy. Thereafter, they held a press conference. Try to recall the announcements made in that press conference. They had said that they would win the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and form the government. They promised to increase the capping on gas cylinders from 9 to 12. They fought the elections on this promise. They were asking for votes on this issue of cylinders. You will be astonished to know that few years back MPs used to get 25 gas coupons every year and they used to give those coupons to their relatives and workers for providing gas connection. We would read in newspapers that those MPs used to even sell those coupons in black market. Ultimately this practice of giving coupons to the MPs was discontinued. This meant that the common man had to queue up outside the houses of these MPs for availing gas connection. You also must have taken so much pain to get a gas connection. Brothers and sisters, when our government came to power I thought that what's the fault of my poor mothers that they cook with firewood. Friends, you will be shocked to know that when one mother cooks using firewood, the amount of smoke that enters her body is equal to that of 400 cigarettes. Can you imagine the condition of that mother? Then, small children also play at home and the mother cooks food inside the house. This smoke enters the bodies of these small children too. Can you imagine the condition of health of these children? Brothers and sisters, I was also born in poverty. My mother used to burn firewood. I have seen how the smoke used to engulf the entire house. I have seen this myself and experienced it. At that time I had decided to rid my poor mothers of this and brothers and sisters we have taken this responsibility of providing free gas connections to poor families. It has been 11 months since we started this programme and till now gas connections have been provided to 2 crore families. I am happy that today 8000 families of Dadra & Nagar Haveli will also be given gas connections. But due to the efforts of the people here, these families will also get pressure cooker and gas lighter. This is the special case here. I congratulate you all for this campaign.

Brothers and sisters,

Steps have been taken to provide some utility items to my 'Divyang' brothers and sisters. Electric vehicles have been provided. Those who cannot see are being given modern sticks so that they can sense any object through the sensors. Earlier the governments used to make schemes but our government has organized 5000 camps till date and has provided services to lakhs of divyangs through these camps. Earlier, in 30 years hardly 50 camps used to be organised and the funds remained unused. Brothers and sisters, governments are meant for the poor and their welfare. Therefore, our government puts up camps in different districts, finds the divyangs and provides resources from the government's treasury so that they can lead their lives with confidence. We are working in that direction.

 Brothers and sisters, 

Today Jan Aushadhi medical centres have also been launched here. We know that falling ill has become so expensive, even if it's a happy family, a middle class family or a family where both the husband and the wife are earning, if someone in the family falls ill, the entire finance of the family collapses.  They are unable to get their daughters married or purchase a property. The medicines are so expensive!  Even the doctors' visits are expensive. Brothers and sisters, we have made a list of 800 medicines and talked to the pharmaceutical companies. We asked them why they were hiking the price of the medicines. What will they do with so much profit? Everyone fell in line. The medicines that used to cost 1200 rupees are now sold at 70-80 rupees and the medicines that used to cost 300 rupees are now sold at rupees 7 or 10. The poor people should also get timely access to medicines. He has the right to live. Only a strong government can bring changes. Today, these Jan Aushadhi centres are being launched in Dadra & Nagar Haveli so that the poor can get whatever medicines are prescribed by the doctor from these medical stores. There is no difference in these medicines. If someone is spreading the rumour that these are ineffective because these are cheap, don't believe him. We won't let the poor to be exploited. We won't let a middle class person to die. Therefore brothers and sisters, we came up with these schemes. I observed that when the topic of Wi-Fi arose, all the youngsters were extremely happy. As the inauguration of Wi-Fi was shown on television, a wave of happiness swept through. This is an example of a transformed new India. They feel that it has become a part of life.  Brothers and sisters, I want you all to do one thing. Will you do it? This week voice won't do any good. Tell me will you do it?  I can't hear it from this side. Tell me will you do it? Download the Bhim app on your mobile phones. Not only this, you should also help the traders in your area to download this app. Now while making a payment for gas cylinder tell him to download the Bhim app and make payments through that app. And make it a habit brothers and sisters. Since you are enjoying the Wi-Fi services make your mobile phones your banks. Make your mobile phones your wallet. In this way a business can be run through less cash. Brothers and sisters, I have waged a war against corruption. Tell me brothers and sisters whether corruption should end or not? Whether the country should be governed with honesty or not? How will it be possible without your help? Tell me whether you will help? One of the ways by which you can help is by using less cash. Start making transactions through Bhim app. All the paths of black marketing and corruption will close. Therefore, I need your help. I have made a new scheme for all those youngsters who want to earn during their vacations. If you make your transactions through the Bhim app and teach another merchant or another person to download the Bhim app and help him to make transactions at least 3 times, then your mobile phone will be credited with 10 rupees by the Indian government. If you help 20 people with this in a day, then your phone will be credited with 200 rupees. If you do this in 3 months of your vacation then you can easily earn 18 to 20 thousand rupees. Every youngster of this country should earn at least 20000 rupees in this vacation through the Bhim app. “Now I don't have to ask for money from my parents. I would avail the benefit of Modi ji's scheme. We will propagate about the Bhim app. I will explain about this app to 20 people every day and earn 200 rupees.” We can do this job, brothers. Tell me will you do it?

Brothers and sisters, 

Many schemes have been started here.  I am not mentioning all the plans. So many plans simultaneously - house for the poor people and the tribal people, Wi-Fi for the youngsters, employment for the youth and gas connections for the mothers and sisters. No one is left behind. Probably for the first time in the history of Dadra & Nagar Haveli so many schemes and benefits have come in its way since independence. Close both the fists and say along with me Bharat Mata Ki Jai (victory to mother India). Not like this. Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

Thanks a lot!

                All my friends on the dais and all the people present here in large numbers,

I was in a dilemma whether I should speak in Gujarati or in Hindi. Then I thought that the entire country should know about your great accomplishment. All the donors here are being praised for their generosity. 500 crore! Everyone is appreciating! But I will not! They have not done anything. I know you all are shocked. Even if they donate 500 crores or 5000 crores of rupees, it won't matter as such. Let me tell you the reason. These are the people who grew up in the muddy agricultural fields of Gujarat. These are the people who used to play 'amli-pipli' game with their friends; climbing the branches of the trees was gym for them; enjoying the race with cycle tyres in their childhood.  Throughout the year they just had one topic of discussion with their parents - hopefully this time their place will receive good rainfall. Nobody bothered about whether their children would study or not. The discussion revolved around only whether that year will see good rainfall or not. Secondly, they used to pray that their cattle shouldn’t go hungry any day. So, these are the children belonging to such families. They have seen all the hardships. They have lived such a life since their childhood. 

Even if there is deficient rainfall and consequently lesser crop yield for the family, the Khedu families would be the last ones to get the crops, after thieves and animals have taken away part of the harvest. Such values are inherent in them. They are never angered by the fact that part of the crops grown with tremendous hard-work is taken away by thieves. If the crops are eaten away by animals and birds, they do not complain. If a guest arrives, they would fill his bag with the crop yield and then the left over would be taken by the family for their kids and for their own survival. These are the values imbibed by my Gujarat's Khedu family. They are the children of those parents who would ensure that others do not go hungry even if they themselves have to go without food. For them 500 crores is nothing. They have inherent values to donate such huge amounts. They won't sleep at night till they donate. I have been brought up among these families. When I go elsewhere I get a feeling that people have broken relations with me. They look at me as a Prime Minister but one exception is Surat. Whenever I came here, I received the same love and belongingness. Nobody puts a Prime Minister tag on me.

You will be surprized to know, they are extremely rich families. They deal in millions and billions. When my Surat trip was fixed, those families with whom I had close relations are now millionaires and billionaires. Once I used to have chapatis and khichdi cooked by their mothers. So, I received a call, ""since you are staying at the circuit house at night shall I send you Bajra chappatis? Shall I send you khichdi?"" This morning too one family sent me Moti Bhakri from Saurashtra. They know what the Prime Minister eats. No issue with that. These are familial ties; their mothers are always concerned about me. I believe that it is difficult to have such a good fortune. A person doesn't become great by his power or position but by love and generosity. I am grateful to you all for this treatment to me.

Today a hospital is being inaugurated. It is a modern hospital. When I was here, I used to say that the foundation-stone of something laid by me should also be inaugurated by me. People used to think that I am arrogant. It was not arrogance. It was a commitment. The fashion of laying foundation-stone and placing plaques should be stopped. Something that has been initiated should be completed. If it cannot be accomplished, it should not be started in the first place. I feel happier than you all because it was the day of Vijaya Dashami. Bharatiya Janata Party had declared me as the Prime Ministerial candidate. I was running from one place to the other all over the country, yet I was observing my Vijaya Dashami and Navratri fasts. I was determined to come to Surat despite all the obstacles and I had come. That day, Lal ji Badshaah wanted to click pictures next to me and then to shovel for 'bhoomi-pujan'. I asked Badshaah to donate 50 crores, only then I would allow him for the same. I have worked among you with this authority and he agreed. And now when I see this hospital, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction. I congratulate the entire team from the bottom of my heart to complete this work in such an excellent manner.

This hospital was thus built not with the donors' money but with familial love and emotions and a lot of hard work. Hard-work is much more valuable than money. Those people sitting over there have not only contributed their wealth but also shed their sweat. They have consecrated their money with their sweat. Normally, in an inauguration ceremony of a diamond factory I would have wished them luck so that the business expanded; if it were a textile industry I would have given my best wishes but today I will throw a curse instead of best wishes. I would say that the need for visiting the hospital should never arise and even if someone happens to visit the hospital once he need not go there the second time. I wish that the person should leave the hospital with such a strong treatment that he need not visit it again.

Our country has a dearth of doctors and hospitals while medicines are expensive. Today, if a member of a middle class family falls sick, the entire savings of the family erodes. If they want to purchase a house or get the daughter married, they are not able to do so. In such a scenario, the government comes into the picture to provide access to healthcare facilities to everyone. The government is responsible for providing affordable healthcare facilities to everyone. The government of India has recently announced a New Health Policy. 15 years after Atal Ji's government, this government came up with a health policy. A lot of work was left unaccomplished that I am completing now. Talking of medicines, when I was in Gujarat I antagonised many people. Now that I am in Delhi, I am again antagonising many people in the country. Every day I do one such work that disappoints someone or the other. The pharmaceutical companies used to take Rs.1200 for injection or Rs.350-400 for tablets. I asked them, ""What are you doing? What are the actual costs of these things?” I made a rule and reduced the cost of medicines that used to be sold at Rs. 1200 to 70-80;   reduced the cost of some medicines from 300 to 30. Prices of about 700 medicines were fixed so that poorest of the poor can get cheap medicines for curing the most serious diseases. You can imagine how annoyed the pharmaceutical companies would be.

Today, every family is worried about heart diseases. Every family is discussing about proper diet on the dining table. They say, one should lose weight and eat less. Everyone is worried about heart attack. Discussion regarding this on the dining table is inevitable. We are not so knowledgeable regarding stents used for heart. The doctor says stents will cost 30-40,000 rupees. The patient asks whether the life would be saved. The doctor says that with the stents there will not be any problem for 4-5 years. Then some other doctor says that imported stent will cost 1.5lakh rupees. If this is inserted then you won't face any problem in your lifetime. The poor person thinks that instead of spending rupees 40,000 for 4-5 years, if I spend 1.5 lakhs, I shall be able to lead a problem-free life. I told the stent makers why you are charging so much for stents. The deliberation went on for a year. Ultimately, 2 months back we decided to cap the prices of stents. The stents that used to cost 40,000 rupees are now only 6 to7000 rupees. The stents that used to cost 1.5lakhs should now be sold at 20 to 22000 rupees so that the poor can afford. Sometimes it used to cause so much trouble for the common man especially when he did not have enough knowledge regarding this. Now, due to this decision a large section of the society is disappointed with me. It is quite natural. But the government is taking steps to provide affordable healthcare facilities to the poor and the middle class. Just now Vijay Bhai was saying that we are starting Pradhañmantri Jan Aushadhi yojana to provide affordable medicines to the people in hospitals. I have seen that doctors do not make proper prescriptions. The poor patient doesn't understand. He goes to the chemist shop to purchase the medicines where the medicines are really expensive. We will bring a system by which the doctor will have to write generic medicines in their prescriptions and there is no need to shell out money. Only then, the poor person can purchase medicines at cheaper rates.

Just like we are worried about post-illness care, we should also think about preventive healthcare. My cleanliness campaign is directly linked to health care. All the surveys around the world emphasise that one or the major causes of death of crores of children across the world is - not washing hands with soap before having meal. Can't we make it a habit?  Cleanliness for health. The people of Surat need not be taught the lesson of cleanliness. Surat has adopted cleanliness. Surat was once affected by a pandemic and since then Surat has adopted cleanliness. It is an inspiration for the country. I was conducting a Road-show yesterday. The officer who had come along with me from Delhi was not looking at the Road-show but was focused upon cleanliness. He remarked that Surat was so clean! He was impressed by the cleanliness. I asked him to let everyone know about this wherever he goes. Surat has made it a habit. If the entire India makes cleanliness a habit then millions and billions of Rupees can be saved on health care. If one poor person falls ill, for example, if one auto rickshaw driver becomes sick, then it's not only him but his entire family starves for 3 days. There is no other earning member in the family! Therefore I am spreading this movement of yoga and cleanliness across the world. Even Surat should put forth a grand yoga performance on 21st June.  Today yoga is becoming an important part of our lives for wellness and health. Under the Indradhanush scheme we are searching for those mothers and children who were left out of the immunization programme. We are running this immunization campaign. We have found more than 2 crore mothers and sisters who were not covered under the immunization programme that was undertaken in their villages. The government has undertaken the responsibility to search and serve the people. But mass movement is necessary and public cooperation is necessary. 

 

Sometimes we think that after independence an atmosphere has been created where we believe that the government will do everything but the nature of our country is different. Our country has never been ruled or created by the government. Our country has never been ruled by the kings either or by the politicians but by the power of the people and by the confidence of the people. Public service is the greatest religion and nature of the country. You tell me, you see Dharmashala in every village. There are innumerable Dharamshalas that can accommodate thousands of people who are on a pilgrimage. There is more number of rooms than that of the grand hotels of the world. There are Dharmashalas in our country that consist of 2000 rooms. Who built these? Not the government but the public. There used to be water scarcity in some villages, the people used to dig wells or make baolis. Did the governments make cow-sheds? No; it’s the public. Libraries were made not by the government but by the people. This has been the special feature of our country. All the work in social life was done by the people. But after independence, this nature started changing. But now once again this nature has started developing. The people want to contribute to the social life for the welfare of the people. I have seen the people of Surat and especially the people of Saurashtra and even a small ratan artist come forward to contribute something or the other for their villages or the society. It is not a small thing. A small artist who has a meagre income and has a difficult livelihood but on any occasion if the villagers ask him to do something for a school or the village for example, he would do that despite all the hardships. Each person sitting here has done something or the other for his/her village, on the parents' names or on some relative's name. They have contributed for the development of their village. Even today they have continued with the same association with their village. If someone wants to visit Saurashtra on the day of Diwali it is difficult to get tickets of a bus. This attachment is a wonderful trait of this society. I hope that in the future generations too this trait should remain. It should not only be confined to the older generations but the future generations should also maintain the same association. This will become a great wealth for the entire Gujarat. Once again I am grateful to you all for being able to attend the inauguration ceremony of the hospital. Like Mathur Dasji was telling, I shall be going to Bayana from here. There I have a programme that is associated with water.

Gujarat has made water its strength and with this strength Gujarat is moving forward and will keep moving forward. With this, my best wishes to everyone. My best wishes for good health.

I am going to Israel in July. All of you have some association with Israel. I am the first Prime Minister of India to visit Israel. There is a direct link with Israel especially for Diamond business and therefore I am going there as your representative as well. I assure you that. Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Kiran Multi-Speciality Hospital, and the Diamond Manufacturing Unit of M/s Hare Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd in Surat. 

The Prime Minister described the effort devoted towards making the hospital as “commendable”, and added that the state-of-the-art hospital would benefit citizens. He emphasized that the poor must have access to quality and affordable healthcare. In this context he talked about the Union Government’s initiatives to bring down the prices of medicines, stents etc. He said he is committed to providing affordable healthcare for the poor and the middle class. Calling for focus on preventive healthcare, the Prime Minister said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is linked to efforts towards a healthier India. 

The Prime Minister said Surat has made a mark in the diamond industry but there is now need to look at the entire gems and jewellery sector. He said that as far as the gems and jewellery sector is concerned, our aim should not only be ‘Make in India’ but also 'Design in India'.

                There is such a long list of names; I am not taking everybody’s name; others have already mentioned them a number of times, you may not have forgotten.

Today, a number of projects are being dedicated to the country from the land of Nagpur. Today is 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar. It is an inspiring occasion. It was my privilege to visit the Dikshabhoomi in the morning and to bow down to that holy land. I have come to you drawing new energy and new inspiration from that place.

What will happen to the lives of the dalits, the down-trodden, the deprived villages, the poor, the peasants of this country in Independent India? What will happen to their hopes and aspirations? Whether these people will have any say in the Independent India? All these questions were answered and guaranteed by Bhim Rao Ambedkar in the Constitution. And as a result of that, due to constitutional support, today, every section of the people of the country has the opportunity to do something and the same opportunity motivates them for realizing their dreams with excitement and enthusiasm.

Personally, I have experienced that despite poverty the journey of life can be successfully and effectively carried forward and the source of such an inspiration is Baba Ambedkar Rao. One should not shed tears due to poverty and should not be distracted by the effect, this balanced life becomes a force for the depressed classes, and this strength was provided by Baba Saheb Ambedkar through his life. When bitter experience becomes part of a person’s daily life - getting humiliated, tortured, and despised, often a person with a narrow mind fills his mind with this bitterness; and a feeling of revenge gets the better of him which he tends to reflect through his activities. People tend to become vindictive. If he is humiliated in his childhood, in school, at workplace his mind becomes revengeful.  Despite terrible sufferings, this sort of bitterness never entered Bhimrao Ambedkar’s mind. He neither showed any resentment in his words nor while drafting the Constitution. Only on such occasions, the greatness of a person can be understood. We hear of Shivaji's greatness as to how he had drunk the poison. But Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to drink poison every moment in his life and yet he had showered nectar on the people. So we are trying to dedicate some new schemes to the country, on the birth anniversary of that great man and bow to that ‘deeksha bhoomi’ where he took a new birth.

Many schemes and new buildings are getting underway today. About two thousand MW capacity power plant was dedicated to the nation. Energy has become an integral part of life. No dream of development is possible without energy. And in the 21st century, energy has become the right of every citizen even if it has not been legally provided but it has become the right. If the country has to be taken forward in the 21st Century, if India is to transform into a modern India, energy is the first prerequisite. On the one hand, the world is challenging Thermal Power due to environmental concerns; on the other hand, it is the only support for developed countries. Since there is a need to find a way to get rid of such a huge conflict at the global level, India has shown the world that we are the people who consider the whole world and the universe as one family; so we will not let anything happen to our family and will not push our future generations into any crisis. Therefore India has dreamt of generating 175 Giga-watts renewable energy - Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydroelectric power projects etc. Nitin ji was telling that the waste water generated by the people of Nagpur is recycled and used for the production of electricity. I congratulate Nagpur for this environment-friendly initiative. In other parts of the country too, the concept of zero waste is gradually developing.

Today, a huge housing programme has also been launched. In the year 2022 we will celebrate 75 years of independence. For a moment, let us try to live the kind of a life that was 75 years ago. Let us recall the era of 1930s, 40s and 50s, when people had laid down their lives for the country, sacrificed their lives to hoist the tricolour in the independent India, embraced death and spent their lives in jails for the independence of motherland from the shackles of slavery. The brave heroes of this country had shown such strength that the number of gallows became less than the number of those who became martyrs for the country. The result of innumerable sacrifices was that our motherland became independent. But these freedom fighters also had some dreams of how India should be. They did not get that opportunity. We did not get that opportunity to sacrifice our lives for the country’s freedom but we have got an opportunity to live for the country.

The year 2022 will mark 75 years of independence. It is 2017 and we have five more years. If the 125 crore people of the country decide that just like those great men who have laid down their lives for freedom, I too will contribute for making that India which they had dreamt of; I will certainly contribute, and that resolution will be in the right direction. I have no doubt regarding the fact that by the year 2022 India shall be strong enough to stand in front of the world. I have a dream; and that dream is: by 2022, the poorest of the poor of our country shall have a house to live in. There should not be any poor person in this country without a home to live in. Such a home should have all the amenities like electricity, water, a stove, a school for children nearby, a hospital nearby for the elderly. Why can’t we visualize such an India? Can’t the 125 Crore people wipe out the tears of the poor of our country? The time has come to live those dreams which Bhim Rao Ambedkar had dreamt of while drafting the Constitution. If we make a resolution to do something for our country by 2022, I believe this dream will certainly be fulfilled.

I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for implementing the schemes of the Central government effectively. Work is going on for the construction of a large number of houses and it is going to generate huge employment opportunities for the people. The poor will get home and at the same time, those who are involved in the construction of the houses will also get employment. Those who make the cement will get work, the iron makers will get the job - everyone will get job. There is also a great possibility of creating jobs. There is a huge campaign to build houses in every corner of India. Today I got the opportunity to start one.

The 21st century is the century of knowledge. And human history is a witness to the fact that whenever mankind has been in the Knowledge era, India has always been the leader. The 21st Century is the era of knowledge. There is a great opportunity for India to take up the leadership. With the construction of new buildings, leading institutions like IIIT, IIM, and AIIMS will have their own campuses. The youth of Maharashtra and India will get the opportunity to create a bright future by honing their talents through these institutions. I wish my younger generations a very good luck as I am dedicating this to the nation.

We have been working towards Digital India extensively. One of the aspects of it is - Digi-dhan, and I believe, that day is not very far when the poorest of the poor will say that ‘Digi-dhan’ is ‘niji-dhan’ (personal wealth). This is going to be the voice of the poor. I have seen even many learned people to protest against this initiative of a Cashless Society. I have listened to such speeches that were not only weird and bizarre, but also very funny. It was not expected from learned people.

You would have seen that even in a wealthy family where the son is staying in a hostel, the parents discuss between themselves and are reluctant to send huge cash lest their son’s habit gets spoilt. Whether it is a rich family or poor, if the son asks for five rupees, the father will give him two rupees. Less cash holds significance in life as we have experienced it in the family. A Happy family does not give bundles and bundles of money to sons, because they know what happens with it. Less is better than the problems of plenty. Whatever happens in the life of a person is also true to the society, to the country and to the economy of that country. We must bring this straightforward and simple understanding into practice. The business can be run with less cash and there was a time when Gold used to be the only currency. There used to be Gold coins; then it evolved into leather-currency and paper currency. Several have been seen. And every era has accepted every such change. During that period too there definitely would have been people who might have opposed such changes; probably due to absence of newspapers these things did not get published. But there will be changes and opposition to those changes. Now the time has changed. You have alternate systems available, safe arrangements are available such as the BHIM App. And I believe just as Bhimrao Ambedkar has done the work of giving rights to the common man through the constitution of India, in the similar way BHIM App is going to work as the leading factor of the economy. Mark my words - no one can stop; it shall happen.

You will be surprised to know that in a country like India billions of rupees can be saved if the expenditure on printing of currency, its transportation in a secured manner etc. is curtailed. This money can be used to build homes for the poor. The country can be served in such a great way. And all this is possible; so we should do it. The change is possible if we are determined to move towards a less-cash economy. I am amazed how five policemen are engaged to protect one ATM, while providing security for a human being is difficult as they will be busy in protecting the ATMs! In a cashless economy, your mobile phone will become your ATM. And the time is not far when premises-less and paper-less banking is going to be part of your lives. This means that your mobile phone will not only be your wallet but also will be your bank. The technological revolution is becoming a part of economic life. This digi-dhan scheme was lauched on December 25, on the day of Merry Christmas. It was implemented in 100 cities in hundred days. And today, on April 14, the birth anniversary of Baba Ambedkar Saheb, as well as on Good Friday, we are launching this BHIM App. We have come so far successfully since the day of Christmas.

Today, people are worried that what will happen to the people who do not have mobile phones? I have read a lot of interesting speeches in parliament saying that the country does not have smart phones etc. We tried to explain that even a cheap mobile phone worth Rs. 800-1000 can serve the purpose but how do you make a recalcitrant person understand! But now you do not even need a mobile phone. You all have a thumb, don’t you? There was a time when thumb used to be a sign of illiteracy. How that time has changed! Now that very thumb has become the centre of your power. Today the youngsters are busy hours together with their thumbs for typing messages. Technology has made the thumb powerful. And therefore BHIM-AADHAAR can make India proud. Even the advance countries of the world do not have this system in place which India has.

Now the people who have accepted the BHIM App after a lot of resistance are now engaged in opposing the Aadhaar. They will continue with this. Whether you have a mobile phone or not, if you have a Aadhaar number the problem will be solved. When you visit a shopkeeper, you will see that he has a small instrument. The bigger PoS machine will also not be needed, the small one instrument of about two inches will be produced in front of you and your thumb impression will be taken. If you already have your Aadhaar number seeded with the bank and you buy an item worth ten rupees, then that amount will automatically be deducted from your account. There is no need to carry even a single penny with you. Your business will not be hindered; we are going in the right direction. Such is the Bhim-Aadhaar system. And you will see that one day greatest universities around the world will come to India for researching on ‘BHIM-AADHAAR’ as a case study. All the youngsters will study. It is going to be the basis of an economic transformation in the world. This will become a reference.

And I was asking Shri Ravi Shankar ji yesterday whether the Indian government got it patented or not, because the world is going to study this system. I met the leaders of the African countries recently. They were also curious about it and asked whether I could help them to introduce this system in their country. It can gradually spread to the whole world and India can be a catalytic agent in the process.

Under the Digi-dhan scheme several programmes were organized in hundred different cities of India. Lakhs of people took part in the programme enthusiastically and tried to understand the technology. Several people received attractive prizes and one of the recipients of the awards from Chennai declared that he would donate his award money for the Ganga cleanliness drive. I congratulate him. This digi-dhan scheme is basically a cleanliness drive, to clean the country of its prevalent corruption and black money.

I want to tell the countrymen that whether you like the concept of less cash or not, the dream of cash-less society or not, but there will be not be a single person in this country, who doesn’t have a strong anger against corruption. The bribe-giver would also be angry, and the bribe-taker would think that the Modi government has come to power; if I get caught, what will happen? Till today whatever has happened is not acceptable but now we have a tool to fight this evil. Whoever will help me by using BHIM-Aadhaar, they are my soldiers in the fight against corruption and black money. It is a very powerful tool for me. And so I invite my youngsters! Two new things have been added to this. We will run this scheme till October 14. Today is April 14th. On October 14, Baba Saheb Ambedkar had taken initiation.  October 14 was a holy occasion for Baba Saheb Ambedkar. So there is a special plan from 14 April to 14 October. You must have seen that the youngsters show the desire to do some work during vacations and earn money for themselves. The children of the wealthy family also hide their identities and go to such a place and do such things as they want to train themselves as there is a less scope due to their wealthy family background. They go to the hotels, clean the utensils, serve tea, etc. Many go to work in petrol pumps. Today this generation wants to live with pride and such thinking is shaping its mind.

Earlier we used to hear that in foreign countries the youngsters work for two to three hours at night, take up a part-time driving job etc. alongside their study. They study and work part-time for earning. Today, this concept has penetrated into India as well but we never paid attention. Under this BHIM-AADHAAR, I invite the young people of my country in these vacations. There is a Referral plan for it which means that if you explain the Bhim App to anybody, say to a merchant or any citizen, help him download the Bhim app on his mobile phone and with your inspiration, if he carries out three transactions of say fifty rupees, 30 rupees or 100 rupees, then the government will add 10 rupees to your account for every person you teach. If you teach 20 people in one day, then by the evening you will have 200 rupees in your pocket. You need to fix the three months of your vacation for earning 200 rupees per day. Tell me my young friends; is this a difficult task for you? You don’t have to do anything. You just need to teach and explain it. And the businessman who will use the BHIM-App at his shop for running his business will get 25 rupees. This amount will be deposited in his account. That is what you can explain to him. And this scheme will be going on till October 14, the day of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's initiation. We have six months. Every youngster can earn Rs10 thousand to 15 thousand easily during this vacation. And you will become my biggest helper in winning the battle against corruption, so I invite you to learn this scheme. I am broadly telling you about the scheme but when you read the details write-up of the plan you will surely understand its nitty-gritties. Since your exams are now over, I want the youth of the country to take your mobile phones and make an attempt to understand this app and start teaching 20 people, 25 people or 30 people per day. You will go home with an earning of Rs 200-300 and you will be able to spend the next year's expenditure from your pocket money. You will not have to ask for money from poor parents. It is an effort to bring about revolution.

Today, 75 Townships were declared as the areas that transact with less cash. This means that the townships where people live in, townships of different fertilizer companies, railways, townships of soldiers, 75 such townships have declared themselves less-cash townships. So when the first such township came up, I took their presentation. I asked how the vegetable vendor would be benefitted. Why should he come into this business? He gave an interesting answer. The vegetable vendor said, earlier in this township, I used to sit on the footpath for selling vegetables; the women who used to buy vegetables never gave the change. For example, if the bill was 25 rupees 80 Paise then they paid only 25 rupees and did not pay the 80 paise. Even the women from wealthy families, or the wife of a rich babu did the same. After this initiative, I get the whole amount i.e. 25 rupees and 80 Paise. And said that earlier, his earning used to be Rs 15-20 less, but now he earns 15-20 rupees extra. Now see how a poor man has been greatly benefitted.  This ‘75 township’ is a good starting point. It should be for each of us to take the country towards less-cash, and contribute in this way. And let us become soldiers in this revolution. We should carry this idea forward.

Today more than Rs. 250 crores have been given away as prize money; I am sure that the people who have received prizes should not be complacent just by receiving the prizes. These thousands of people who have received prizes should become the Ambassadors to take this idea forward. It is a very successful campaign to help bring change in the country with the help of the citizens. I congratulate Ravi Shankarji and his entire team and NITI Aayog for creating a full-proof technology. All the types of technologies in the world have been studied and the best thing about this is that even the common man and the poorest of the poor in India will be able to use it. A user-friendly and trustworthy system has been developed. I once again congratulate all the colleagues in the department. I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra that Nagpur has been served well for organising this programme. I got an opportunity to meet you all. Thanks a lot.

                धम: चक्र परावर्तने च कार्य, य: दीक्षा भूमिवर डॉक्‍टर बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडर जी ने केला य: भूमिला माझे प्रणाम। काशी प्राचीन ज्ञान नागरिया है, नागपुर बनु सकता क्या? 

आज एक साथ इतनी लम्‍बी बड़ी लिस्‍ट है सबके नाम बोल नहीं रहा हूं। काफी लोगों ने बोल दिए, आपको याद रह गए होंगे। 

एक साथ इतने सारे प्रकल्‍प आज नागपुर की धरती से देश को समर्पित हो रहे हैं। और आज.. आज 14 अप्रैल डॉक्‍टर बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडर की जन्‍म जयंती का प्रेरक अवसर है। यह मेरा सौभाग्‍य रहा कि आज प्रात: दीक्षाभूमि में जा करके उस पवित्र भूमि को नमन करने का अवसर मिला। एक नई ऊर्जा, नई प्रेरणा ले करके मैं आपके बीच आया हूं। 

इस देश के दलित, पीडि़त शोषित, वंचित गांव, गरीब, किसान हर किसी के जीवन में आजाद भारत में उनके सपनों का क्‍या होगा? उनकी आशाओं, आकांक्षाओं का क्‍या होगा? क्‍या आजाद भारत में इन लोगों की भी कोई पूछ होगी कि नहीं होगी? इन सारे सवालों के जवाब भीम राव अम्‍बेडकर जी ने संविधान के माध्‍यम से देशवासियों को दिए थे, गारंटी के रूप में दिए थे। और उसी का परिणाम है कि संवैधानिक व्‍यवस्‍थाओं के कारण आज देश के हर तबके के व्‍यक्ति को कुछ करने के लिए अवसर सुलभ है और वही अवसर उसके सपनों को साकार करने के लिए उमंग और उत्‍साह के साथ जी और जान से जोड़ने के लिए प्रेरित करते हैं। 

व्‍यक्तिगत रूप से मैंने जीवन में.. मैं हमेशा अनुभव करता हूं कि आभाव के बीच में पैदा हो करके भी किसी भी प्रकार के प्रभाव से प्रभावित हुए बिना अभावों के रहते हुए भी प्रभावी ढंग से जीवन के यात्रा को सफलतापूर्वक आगे बढ़ाया जा सकता है और वो प्रेरणा बाबा अम्‍बेडर राव से मिलती है। आभाव का रोना नहीं रोना और प्रभाव से विचलित नहीं होना, यह संतुलित जीवन दबे-कुचले हर किसी के लिए एक ताकत बन जाती है और वो ताकत देने का काम बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडरक ने अपने जीवन से दिया है। कभी-कभार व्‍यक्ति के जीवन में अविरत रूप से जब कटु अनुभव रोज की जिंदगी का हिस्‍सा बन जाता है, अपमानित होना है, प्रताडि़त होना है, तिरस्‍कृत होना। अगर इंसान छोटे मन का हो तो ये चीजें घर में, मन-मंदिर में, मन-मस्तिष्‍क में किस प्रकार से कटुता के रूप में भर जाती है। और मौका मिले तो कभी लगता है अरे इसको दिखाऊंगा मैं। यह मेरे साथ हुआ था, बचपन में मेरे साथ यह हुआ था, स्‍कूल गया तो यह हुआ था, नौकरी करने गया तो यह हुआ था। क्‍या कुछ मन में नहीं था, लेकिन ये भीमराव अम्‍बेडकर थे, इतनी बुराइयों से सामना करना पड़ा। इतनी प्रताड़ना झेलनी पड़ी, लेकिन खुद के जीवन में जब मौका आया रत्‍तीभर इस कटुता को बाहर आने नहीं दिया। बदले का भाव अंश भर भी न संविधान में कभी प्रकट हुआ, न कभी उनकी वाणी में प्रकट हुआ, न उनके कभी अधिकार क्षेत्र में प्रकट हुआ। व्‍यक्ति की ऊंचाई ऐसे समय कसौटी कसने पर पता चलता है, कैसा महानतम व्‍यक्तित्‍व होगा। हम शिवजी को जब उनकी महानता की चर्चा सुनते हैं तो कहते है जहर पी लिया था। बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर ने जीवन में हर पल जहर पीते-पीते भी हम लोगों के लिए अमृत वर्षा की थी। और इसलिए उस महापुरूष की जन्‍म जयंती पर और वो भी जिस धरती पर उनका नव जन्‍म हुआ उस दीक्षा भूमि पर प्रणाम करते हुए देश के चरणों में एक नई व्‍यवस्‍था देने का आज प्रयास हम कर रहे हैं। 

आज अनेक योजनाओं का प्रारंभ हो रहा है, नये भवनों का प्रारंभ हो रहा है। करीब दो हजार मेगावाट बिजली के कारखानों का लोकार्पण हुआ। ऊर्जा जीवन का अटूट अंग बन गई है। विकास का कोई भी सपना ऊर्जा के अभाव में संभव नहीं है। और 21वीं सदी में ऊर्जा एक प्रकार से हर नागरिक का हक बन गया है। लिखित हो या न हो, बन चुका है। देश को 21वीं सदी की प्रगति की ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाना है अगर भारत को आधुनिक भारत के रूप में देखना है, तो ऊर्जा उसकी पहली आवश्‍यकता है। और एक तरफ पर्यावरण की चिंता के कारण विश्‍व Thermal Power को चुनौती दे रहा है तो दूसरी तरफ विकसित देशों के लिए वही एक सहारा है। वैश्विक स्‍तर पर इतनी बड़े conflict के बीच में जब रास्‍ता निकालना है तब भारत ने भी बीड़ा उठाया है कि हम पूरे विश्‍व को परिवार मानने वाले लोग है, पूरे ब्रह्माण को अपना मानने वाले लोग हैं, हमारे द्वारा हम ऐसा कुछ नहीं होने देंगे, जो भावी पीढ़ी के लिए कोई संकट पैदा करे और इसलिए भारत ने 175 गीगावाट renewable energy का सपना देखा है। Solar Energy हो, Wind Energy हो, Hydro के projects हो और जब नितीन जी बड़े गर्व के साथ बता रहे थे कि नागपुर वासियों को जो गंदा पानी है, वो बिजली के उत्‍पादन में काम लाया जाता है, recycle किया जाता है। एक प्रकार से पर्यावरण के अनुकूल जो initiative है, मैं इसके लिए नागपुर को बधाई देता हूं। और देश के अन्‍य भागों में भी zero waste का concept धीरे-धीरे पनप रहा है। 

आज यहां आवास निर्माण का भी एक बहुत बड़ा कार्यक्रम हाथ में लिया गया, उसका भी प्रारंभ हुआ है। 2022 आजादी के 75 साल हो गए। पल भर के लिए हम 75 साल की पहले की जिंदगी के जीने का प्रयास करके देखे। हम उस कल्‍पना में अगर पहुंचे 1930, 40, 50 के पहले का कालखंड जब देश के लिए लोग जान की बाजी लगा देते थे। हिंदुस्‍तान का तिरंगा फहराने के लिए फांसी के तख्‍ते पर चढ़ जाते थे। मां भारती को गुलामी की जंजीरों से मुक्‍त कराने के लिए जवानी जेल में खपा देते थे। मृत्‍यु का आलिंगन करते थे। हंसते-हंसते देश के लिए मर मिटने वालों की कतार कभी बंद नहीं हुई थी। इस देश के वीरों ने वो ताकत दिखा थी कि फांसी के फंदे कभी कम पड़ जाते थे, लेकिन मरने वाले देश के लिए शहादत देने वालों की संख्‍या कभी कम नहीं हुआ करती थी। अनगिनत बलिदानों का प्रणाम था कि भारत मां हमारी आजाद हुई है। लेकिन आजादी के दीवानों ने भी तो कुछ सपने देखे थे उन्‍होंने भी भारत कैसा हो, एक इरादा रखा था। उनको तो वो सौभाग्‍य मिला नहीं आजाद हिंदुस्‍तान में सांस लेने का। हमें सौभाग्‍य मिला नहीं उस आजादी के आंदोलन में अपनी जिंदगी खपाने का, लेकिन हमें मौका मिला है, देश के लिए मरने का मौका न मिला, देश के लिए जीने का मौका मिला है। 

क्‍या 2022 जब आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे है। आज हम 2017 में खड़े हैं। पांच साल का समय हमारे पास हैं। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी अगर संकल्‍प करे कि जिन महापुरूषों ने आजादी के लिए जीवन लगा दिया, उनके सपनों का भारत बनाने के लिए मेरी तरफ से इतना योगदान होगा। मैं भी कुछ करके रहूंगा, और संकल्‍प करके रहूंगा और सही दिशा में करके रहूंगा, मैं नहीं मानता हूं कि 2022 आते-आते देश विश्‍व के सामने खड़े होने की ताकत के साथ खड़ा नहीं होगा, मुझे कोई आशंका नहीं है। और उसमें एक सपना है हमारा 2022 जब आजादी के 75 साल हो तब मेरे देश के गरीब से गरीब का अपना घर हो। इस देश का कोई गरीब ऐसा न हो, जिसको अपना रहने के लिए अपना घर न हो, अपनी छत न हो। और घर भी ऐसा हो, जिसमें बिजली हो, पानी हो, चूल्‍हा हो, गैस का चूल्‍हा हो, नजदीक में बच्‍चों के लिए स्‍कूल हो, बुजुर्गों के लिए नजदीक में अस्‍पताल हो ऐसा हिन्‍दुस्‍तान क्‍यों नहीं देख सकते। क्या सवा सौ देशवासी मिल करके हमारे देश के गरीब के आंसू नहीं पोंछ सकते? भीम राव अम्‍बेडकर जी ने जिन सपनों को ले करके संविधान में रचना की है, उन संविधान को जी करके दिखाने का अवसर आया है। हम 2022 के लिए संकल्‍प करे, कुछ कर-गुजरने का इरादा लेकर चल पड़े। मैं मानता हूं कि यह सपना पूरा होगा। 

मैं महाराष्‍ट्र सरकार को बधाई देता हूं कि भारत सरकार की योजनाके साथ महाराष्‍ट्र भी कदम से कदम मिला करके आगे बढ़ रहा है। और बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में घर बनाने की दिशा में काम चल रहा है और उससे लोगों को रोजगार भी बहुत मिलने वाला है। गरीब को घर मिलेगा, लेकिन घर बनाने वालों को रोजगार भी मिलेगा। सीमेंट बनाने वालों को काम मिलेगा, लोहा बनाने वालों को काम मिलेगा, हर व्‍यक्ति को काम मिलेगा। एक प्रकार से रोजगार के सृजन की भी बड़ी संभावना है। और हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कौने में अपने-अपने तरीके से घर बनाने का बहुत बड़ा अभियान चल रहा है। आज उसका भी प्रारंभ करने का मुझे अवसर मिला है। 

21वीं सदी ज्ञान की सदी है। और मानव इतिहास इस बात का गवाह है जब-जब मानवजात ज्ञान युग में रहा है, तब-तब हिंदुस्‍तान ने नेतृत्‍व किया है। 21वीं सदी ज्ञानका युग है। भारत को नेतृत्‍व देने का एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर है। आज यहां एक साथ IIIT, IIM, AIIMS एक से बढ़कर एक और यहां नये भवनों के निर्माण पर यह सारी institutions चलेगी। महाराष्‍ट्र के और देश के नौजवानों को अपना भाग्‍य बनाने के लिए, आधुनिक भातर बनाने के लिए अपनी योग्‍यता बढ़ाने की इन संस्‍थानों के द्वारा अवसर मिलेगा। मेरी युवा पीढ़ी को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। यह आज जब मैं उनको, मेरी देश की युवा पीढ़ी को यह अर्पित कर रहा हूं, मेरी उन सबको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। 

आज...पिछले कुछ दिनों से डिजिटल इंडिया की दिशा में हम काम कर रहे हैं और बहुत व्‍यापक रूप से काम कर रहे हैं। उसका एक फलक है – डिजि-धन, और मेरा मत है वो दिन दूर नहीं होगा। गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति कहने लगेगा डिजि-धन, निजि-धन। यह डिजि-धन, निजि-धन यह गरीब की आवाज बनने वाला है। मैंने देखा बड़े-बड़े विद्वान विरोध करने के लिए ऐसा विरोध कर रहे थे कि मोदी जी अब कह रहे हैं कि कैशलैस सोसायटी, फलाना-ढिंकाना। मैंने ऐसे-ऐसे भाषण सुने आपको फिर मुझे बड़ा व्‍यंग विनोद के लिए और कुछ करना नहीं पड़ा था। उनको याद कर लेता था तो मुझे बड़ा.. मैं हैरान था मतलब विद्वान लोग क्‍या बोल रहे हैं। 

कम कैश घर में भी आपने देखा होगा धनी से धनी परिवार होगा, बेटा होस्‍टल में रहता होगा तो भी मां-बाप के बीच चर्चा होती है। एक साथ ज्‍यादा पैसा मत भेजो, कहीं बेटे की आदत बिगड़ जाये। धनी से धनी परिवार भी, गरीब से गरीब परिवार भी बेटा कहेगा मां मुझे आज पांच रुपया दो, तो बाप समझाता है नहीं-नहीं बेटा ऐसा कर दो रुपया ले जाओ। कम कैश जीवन में भी महत्‍व रखती है, यह हम परिवार में अनुभव करते आए हैं। सुखी से सुखी परिवार भी बंडल के बंडल बेटों को नहीं देते, क्‍योंकि उनको मालूम है इससे क्‍या-क्‍या होता है। अच्‍छा कम होता है, बुरा ज्‍यादा होता है। जो व्‍यक्ति के जीवन में है वही समाज के जीवन में होता है, वहीं राष्‍ट्र के जीवन में होता है, वही अर्थव्‍यव्‍सथा के भी जीवन में होता है। यह सीधी-सीधी सरल समझ को हमने व्‍यवहार में लाना चाहिए। कम कैश, कम नगद इससे कारोबार चलाया जा सकता है और कोई एक जमाना था जब सोने की ही लगड़ी ही करेंसी रहती थी। सोने की गिनी हुआ करती थी, बदलते-बदलते कभी चमड़े का भी आया, कागज़ का भी आया, न जाने कितने बदलाव आए। और हर युग ने हर बदलाव को स्‍वीकार किया है। हो सकता है उस समय भी कुछ लोग रह होंगे, जो कुछ कहते होंगे शायद उस समय अखबार नहीं होंगे, इसलिए छपता नहीं होगा, लेकिन कुछ कहते तो होंगे ही होंगे उस समय भी। विवाद भी रह होंगे, लेकिन बदलाव भी हुए होंगे। अब वक्‍त बदला है। आपके पास alternate व्‍यवस्‍थाएं available, सुरक्षित व्‍यवस्‍थाएं available हैं और उसमें से BHIM App. और मैं मानता हूं भारत के संविधान में सामान्‍य मानव को हक देने का काम जिस तरीके से भीमराव अम्‍बेडकर ने किया है, उसी तरीके से BHIM App अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था के महारथी के रूप में काम करने वाली है। यह मेरे शब्‍द लिख करके रखिए। कोई रोक नहीं पाएगा, यह होकर रहने वाला है। 

आप हैरान होंगे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान जैसे देश में करेंसी छापना, छाप करके पहुंचाना, सुरक्षित पहुंचाना अरबो-खरबों रुपया का खर्च होता है। अगर इन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं से पैसे बच जाए, तो कितने गरीबों के घर बन जाए दोस्‍तो। कितनी बड़ी देश सेवा हो जाए। और यह सब संभव है इसलिए करना है, न होता तो नहीं करना है। वो भी गुजारा करते थे, पहले वो व्‍यवस्‍था थी, जरूरी थी, करते थे। अगर कम कैश की दिशा में हम तय करे आप देखिए बदलाव संभव है। मैं तो हैरान हूं एक-एक एटीएम की रक्षा के लिए पांच-पांच पुलिस वाले लगे रहते हैं। एक इंसान को सुरक्षा के लिए पुलिस देने में दिक्‍कत होती है, एटीएम के लिए खड़ा रहना पड़ता है। अगर कम कैश का कारोबार हो जाए, आपका मोबाइल फोन ही आपका एटीएम बन जाए। और वक्‍त दूर नहीं है जब premises-less and paper-less banking जीवन का हिस्‍सा बनने वाला है। जब premises-less and paper-less banking जीवन का हिस्‍सा बनने वाला है इसका मतलब हुआ कि आपका मोबाइल फोन यह सिर्फ आपका बटुआ नहीं, आपका मोबाइल फोन आपका अपना बैंक बन जाएगा। Technology का revolution आर्थिक जीवन का हिस्‍सा बन रहा है। और इसलिए 25 दिसंबर को जब यह डिजिधन योजना को लॉन्‍च किया गया था। जिस दिन लॉन्‍च किया था क्रिसमस की शुरूआत थी। Happy Christmas के साथ शुरू किया था। सौ दिन तक सौ शहरों में चला। और आज उसकी पुर्नाणावति एक प्रकार से इधर 14 अप्रैल बाबा अम्‍बेडकर साहेब की जन्म जयंती, BHIM App का सीधा संबंध और दूसरी तरफ गुड फ्राइडे का दिन। Christmas के दिन प्रारंभ किया था, हंसी-खुशी के साथ शुरू किया था। यात्रा करते-करते अब तक चल पड़े। 

आज तभी लोगों को लगता था कि जिसके पास मोबाइल फोन नहीं है, क्‍या करेंगे। मैंने Parliament में बहुत भाषण पढ़े, interesting भाषण हैं सब। देश के पास स्‍मार्ट फोन नहीं हैं, ढिंगना नहीं है, फलाना नहीं है। हमने उनको समझाया भई 800-1000 रुपया वाले फीचर वाले फोन से भी गाड़ी चलती है, लेकिन जिसको समझना नहीं उसको कैसे समझाए! लेकिन अब तो आपको मोबाइल फोन की आवश्‍यकता नहीं है, अब आप यह नहीं पूछोगे कि भई क्‍या करेंगे। आपके पास अंगूठा तो है न। एक जमाना था अनपढ़ होने की निशानी हुआ करती थी। युग कैसे बदल गया है, वही अंगूठा आपकी शक्ति का केंद्र बिंदू बनता जा रहा है। यहां सारे नौजवान दिन में दो-दो घंटे अंगूठे पर लगे रहते होंगे। मोबाइल फोन ले करके मैसेज लिखते होंगे। टेक्‍नोलॉजी ने अंगूठे को ताकतवर बना दिया है। और इसलिए BHIM-AADHAR भारत गर्व कर सकता है। दुनिया के टेक्‍नोलॉजी के लिए advance देश के पास भी यह व्‍यवस्‍था नहीं है, जो हिंदुस्‍तान के पास है। 

अब जो लोग BHIM App पर विवाद करने के बाद भी लोग स्‍वीकार करते गए, तो वो आधार पर विवाद करने में लगे हुए हैं। वो उनको काम करते रहेंगे। आपके पास मोबाइल फोन हो या न हो, आपका अगर आधार नंबर है। आप स्‍वयं किसी दुकानदार के यहां गए हैं और उसके पास छोटा सा instrument होगा। बड़ा PoS मशीन की भी जरूरत नहीं होगा, छोटा सा एक होगा दो इचं बाय दो इंच का, वो आपका अंगूठा वहां लगवा देगा और उससे अगर आपका पहले से ही बैंक के साथ आपका आधार नंबर जुड़ा हुआ है। अगर आपने दस रुपया का माल लिया है, दस रुपया आपका automatic कट हो जाएगा। एक रुपया साथ में ले जाने की जरूरत नहीं। कहीं आपका कारोबार रूकेगा नहीं, कितनी उत्‍तम व्‍यवस्‍था की दिशा में हम जा रहे हैं। और इसलिए जो आज भीम आधार एक ऐसा version.. और आप देखना जी वो दिन दूर नहीं होगा दुनिया की बड़ी-बड़ी युनिवर्सिटी इस BHIM-AADHAR का case study करने के लिए भारत -- आएगी। सारे नौजवान study करेंगे। दुनिया में आर्थिक बदलाव क्‍या हो सकता है इसका यह आधार बनने वाला है। यह reference बनने वाला है। 

और मैं कल ही हमारे रविशंकर जी को कहता था कि भारत सरकार ने इसका patent करवाया कि नहीं करवाया, क्योंकि यह होने वाला है, दुनिया इस विषय को अपना विषय बनाने के लिए.. मुझे अभी अफ्रीकन देशों के जितने मुखिया लोग मिले, उन्‍होंने मेरे से इसकी जिज्ञासा भी की और यह भी चाहा था कि हमारे देश के लिए आप कर सकते हैं क्‍या? धीरे-धीरे इसका वैश्विक विस्‍तार का कारण भी बन सकता है और भारत एक बहुत बड़े Catalytic Agent के रूप में काम कर सकता है। 

इस डिजिधन योजना के तहत हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सौ अलग-अलग शहरों में कार्यक्रम किए गए। लाखों लोगों ने बढ़-चढ़ करके हिस्‍सा लिया। टेक्‍नोलॉजी को समझने का प्रयास किया, स्‍वीकार करने का प्रयास किया। और बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में लोगों को ईनाम मिले और आज जिन लोगों को ईनाम मिला उनमें से एक सज्जन चेन्‍नई के उन्‍होंने तो घोषणा कर दी कि मुझे जो ईनाम मिला है, वो मैं गंगा सफाई के लिए समर्पित कर देता हूं। मैं उनका अभिनंदन करता हूं। और वैसे भी यह डिजिधन सफाई अभियान ही है। भ्रष्‍टाचार, कालेधन के खिलाफ लड़ाई का एक बहुत बड़ा माजा रखता है। 

और मैं देशवासियों को कहना चाहता हूं कम cash विचार आपको पसंद आए या न आए। cash-less society का सपना आपको अच्‍छा लगे या न लगे। नोटो के बिना जिंदगी कैसे गुजरेगी आपके मन में सवाल या निशान हो या न हो, लेकिन इस देश में कोई ऐसा इंसान नहीं होगा, जिसके दिल, दिमाग में भ्रष्‍टाचार के प्रति गुस्‍सा न हो। देने वाला भी गुस्‍सा करता होगा, और कभी लेने वाला भी रात को जा करके सोचता होगा कि यार अभी मोदी आया है कहीं फंस जाऊंगा तो क्‍या होगा? बहुत बुरा हआ है, लेकिन आगे बुराई से बचने के लिए एक उत्‍तम साधन है। जो भी BHIM-AADHAR के सहारे मदद करेंगे मेरी, वो एक प्रकार से भ्रष्‍टाचार और कालेधन की लड़ाई लड़ने के सिपाही हैं मेरे लिए। यह बहुत बड़ी ताकत है मेरे लिए। और इसलिए मैं इसे निमं‍त्रण देता हूं मेरे नौजवानों! और इसमें दो नई चीजें जोड़ी है इस बार। और तो योजना यह है कि वो 14 अक्‍तूबर तक हम चलाएंगे। आज 14 अप्रैल है। 14 अक्‍तूबर इसलिए 14 अक्‍तूबर को बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर ने दीक्षा ली थी। बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर का दीक्षा का वो पवित्र अवसर था, 14 अक्‍तूबर। और इसलिए आज 14 अप्रैल से 14 अक्‍तूबर तक एक विशेष योजना है। आज देखा होगा आपने अच्‍छे परिवार के नौजवान भी उनके दिमाग में भी है कि हम vacation में कुछ न कुछ काम करे और खुद कमाई करे। धनी परिवार के बच्‍चे भी अपनी पहचान छुपा करके ऐसी जगह पर जाते हैं और ऐसे काम करते हैं खुद को trained करना चाहते हैं। जिस सर्कल में वो पैदा हुए हैं वहां वो मौका नहीं बनता है। वो होटल में जाते हैं, बर्तन साफ करते हैं, चाय परोसते हैं इस प्रकार से काम करतेहैं। कई पेट्रोल पम्‍प पर जा करके काम करते हैं। एक गर्व से जीने का.. आज नई पीढ़ी के दिमाग में यह चीजें आ रही है। 

पहले हम सुनते थे विदेश में नौजवान सब रात को जा करके दो-दो तीन-तीन घंटे ऐसी मेहनत काम करते हैं टैक्‍सी चलाते हैं, ढिंकाना करते हैं, फलाना करते हैं। कुछ कमाई करते हैं और फिर पढ़ते रहते हैं। आज हिंदुस्‍तान में यह चीज आई नहीं है, ऐसा नहीं है। हमारा ध्‍यान नहीं है। इस BHIM-AADHAR के तहत मैं इस vacation में मैं मेरे देश के नौजवानों को निमंत्रित करता हूं। इसमें एक योजना है referral यानी अगर आप किसी को भीम एप के संबंध में समझाएंगे। किसी merchant को समझाएंगे, किसी नागरिक को समझाएंगे, उसके मोबाइल फोन पर भीम एप download करवाएंगे। और आपकी प्रेरणा से वो तीन transaction करेगा, कभी पचास रुपयेकी चीज़ खरीदेगा, कभी 30 रुपये की, कभी 100 रुपये की खरीदेगा। यह आपके द्वारा अगर हुआ है तो एक अगर आपने व्‍यक्ति को इसमें जोड़ा तो सरकार की तरफ से आपके खाते में 10 रुपया जमा हो जाएगा। अगर एक दिन में आप 20 लोगों को भी यह कर लें, तो शाम को आपकी जेब में 200 रुपया खाते में आएंगे। अगर vacation के तीन महीने तय कर लें कि 200 रुपया कमाना है, बताइये मेरे नौजवान साथियों यह कोई मुश्किल काम है क्‍या आपके लिए? सामने से कुछ लेना-देना नहीं उसको सिर्फ सिखाना है, समझाना है और जो व्‍यापारी अपने दुकान पर BHIM-App को लागू करेगा कारोबार उससे शुरू करेगा, तो उसको जो उसकी minimum जो रैंक है उसको करेगा, तो उसको 25 रुपया मिलेगा। उसके खाते में 25 रुपये जमा हो जाएंगे। यानी जिसको आपको समझाना है उसको समझा सकते हैं। लेकिन मुझे तो 10 मिल रहा है, लेकिन तेरे को 25 मिलने वाला है। और यह योजना 14 अक्‍तूबर तक चलेगी बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर का दीक्षा प्राप्‍त करने वाला दिवस था। छह महीने हमारे पास है। हर नौजवान इस vacation में 10 हजार, 15 हजार आराम से कमा सकता है। और आप भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ की लड़ाई जीतने के लिए मेरे सबसे बड़े मददगार बन जाएंगे, इसलिए मैं आपको निमंत्रण देता हूं कि इस योजना में उसकी बारीकी जो लिखित होगी वो ही फाइनल मैं समझाने के लिए थोड़ा plus-minus बोल रहा हूं। लेकिन जब आप लिखिल पढ़ेंगे तो पक्‍की योजना आपको समझ आ जाएगी। और मैं चाहता हूं, मैं देश के नौजवानों को चाहता हूं कि अब exam हो गई है, मोबाइल फोन उठाइये, इस व्‍यवस्‍था को समझिए और per day 20 लोग, 25 लोग, 30 लोग लग जाइये। आप शाम को 200-300 रुपये कमा करके घर चले जाएंगे और पूरे vacation में आप करेंगे अगली साल की आपका खर्चा पढ़ाई का pocket खर्चा अपने निकल जाएगा। कभी गरीब मां-बाप के पास से एक रुपया मांगने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी। यह revolution लाने का प्रयास है। 

आज यहां 75 township कम कैश वाली उसका लोकार्पण हुआ। इसका मतलब यह हुआ कि जहां पर township में लोग रहते हैं, अलग-अलग fertilizer कंपनियों की township है, कहीं रेलवे वालों की township है, कहीं फौज वालों की township है ऐसी 75 ने पूरी तरह अपने आप को कम कैश वाला किया है। तो जब मैंने इसकी पहली एक township कम कैश वाली बनी तो मैं उसका presentation ले रहा था। मैंने कहा सब्‍जी वाले का क्‍या interest है, वो क्‍यों यह कारोबार में आया। उसने बड़ा interesting जवाब दिया सब्‍जी वाले ने, उसने कहा पहले यह जो township में यह जो बैचने के लिए मैं फुटपाथ पर बैठता हूं, सब्‍जी बैचता हूं, तो जो महिलाएं सब्‍जी खरीदने आती हैं अगर बिल बन गया 25 रुपया 80 पैसा तो कहती है कि चलो 25 रुपये ले लो, काम चल जाएगा, वो 80 पैसे नहीं देती। कितनी भी अमीर परिवार की महिला हो, बड़े से बड़े बाबू की पत्‍नी हो। वो 80 पैसा नहीं देती थी। ले लो 25 रुपया, चलो ठीक है, छुट्टा छोड़ दो। बोले इसके कारण क्‍या हुआ है मुझे पूरा 25 रुपया 80 पैसा मिलता है। और बोला शाम को जो मेरा 15-20 रुपया कम पड़ जाता था अब मेरा 15-20 रुपया मेरी extra income ऐसे ही हो गई। अब देखिए कितना फायदा एक गरीब आदमी ने अपने में से ढूंढ लिया। लेकिन यह 75 township एक अच्‍छी शुरूआत है। यह हम लोगों की कोशिश रहनी चाहिए कि हम कम कैश की ओर देश को ले चले, हम इसमें योगदान दे और यह जो revolution हो रहा है। उसके हम स्‍वयं एक सिपाही बने। उस बात को हम आगे बढ़ाएं। 

मुझे विश्‍वास है कि आज जिन लोगों को ईनाम मिला है और इतने कार्यकाल में करीब ढाई सौ करोड़ रुपये से ज्‍यादा ईनाम मिले हैं। वे ईनाम प्राप्‍त कर करके संतोष न माने। हजारों की तादाद में नागरिकों को ईनाम मिला है वे भी इसके एम्‍बेसेडर बने, वे भी इस काम को आगे बढ़ाए। यह देश में परिवर्तन लाने का नागरिकों की मदद से होने वाला एक बहुत बड़ा सफल अभियान है। मैं रविशंकर जी और उनके विभाग की पूरी टीम को नीति आयोग को बड़ी बधाई देता हूं कि full-proof technology के लिए उन्‍होंने भरसक कोशिश की। दुनिया में जितने प्रकार की technology में innovation हुए हैं इन सारी चीजों को स्‍टडी किया है और उसमें से उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम क्‍या हो सकता है। भारत के सामान्‍य मानव को गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति भी इसको अपने कारोबार से चला सके। इतना user friendly विश्‍वस्‍त यह व्‍यवस्‍था विकसित हुई है। मैं फिर एक बार विभाग के सभी साथियों को बधाई देता हूं। मैं महाराष्‍ट्र सरकार का अभिनंदन करता हूं कि इस कार्यक्रम की रचना के लिए नागपुर को उन्‍होंने जजमान के रूप में उत्‍तम सेवा की। बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में आप सब से मुझे मिलने का अवसर मिला। आपका बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                I congratulate the Ladies’ Wing of the Indian Merchants’ Chamber on the completion of 50 years. The completion of 50-years is very important for any institution, because by that period of time a person or an institution comes out in the form of gold and starts shining; and perhaps that's why completion of 50 years is also called Golden Jubilee. The institution which you are a part of has a very glorious history. It was established in the backdrop of Swadeshi movement. You have also contributed in some way or the other in the last 50 years for the welfare of women; and whatever your organization has achieved is praiseworthy. I congratulate all those who have carried this work forward in the last 50 years.

When it comes to financial empowerment and participation in decision-making, the strength of women has increased in these areas. If you look at any sector, women have moved two steps ahead of men wherever they got opportunity.

Today the women of the country are flying fighter aircraft, going to space and winning medals for the country in the Olympics. From the Panchayat to Parliament, from village well to the Silicon Valley, women of India are shining. And so, it is a myth that the women of India are engaged only in domestic work. If we look at the agriculture sector of India or the dairy sector, one cannot deny the fact that the largest contribution in India's agricultural sector and in the field of animal husbandry is by women.

If you go to a tribal area and see the activities of the men, you will be able to see what happens after sun set. We have never paid attention to the way the women in the tribal areas run the household; their skill, their talent, their capability and power. They engage in economic activities with whatever skill they have and run cottage industries. I believe that every person has an entrepreneurial skill and an inborn knowledge of business. One just needs the right opportunity and guidance.

The women who are engaged in Dairy business in different places of the country, their payment is transferred directly to their bank accounts. Wherever I meet the people of the dairy sector, I urge them that it would be better to transfer the amount to the bank accounts of the women who come to deliver milk, instead of paying them in cash. You see, the poor lady of the village, who keeps a cow, a buffalo, feels empowered when she deposits money in the bank. Her voice is heard in the household. As long as they are not empowered, all the efforts will go in vain. So, these small changes also give a new strength.

Today women are running thousands of milk societies in the country. Many brands have been successful because they had the power, labour and business acumen of women. These brands have also become case studies for big management schools worldwide. Now consider the example of Lizzat papad. Once some tribal women started lizzat papad in the form of a cottage industry, and today, Lizzat Papad has achieved great heights. Today Amul has become a household name. Thousands of women contribute to the milk cooperatives. And as a result of that they have created their identity and made a place for themselves. The women of our country possess willpower, capability, as well as the courage to fight for success. Institutions like yours can help them show the right path.

One more glory that is associated with the Indian Merchants’ Chamber is the fact that Mahatma Gandhi was also a member of it.  A name must have come to the knowledge of those who have read a lot about Gandhiji. That name did not get the kind of recognition that it should have got. And today I urge you all to ask ‘Google Guru’ which is that name that I am talking of?  That name is ‘Ganga Ba’. Probably very few people know about Ganga Ba.

When Mahatma Gandhiji returned to India from Africa, his public life started in Sabarmati Ashram. About 100 years ago one incident took place.  Gandhiji came to know from the village about a young widow named Ganga Ba who had lost her husband at a very early age. She started her education again after fighting against the customs of the society. She had become a widow at a very young age probably at the age of 8 or 10 years. Mahatma Gandhi used to tell Ganga Ba that she was a very courageous woman. When Gandhiji heard about her, from Sabarmati Ashram he went to meet her. And when Gandhiji met Ganga Ba, she presented a gift to Gandhiji.

And the Charkha, that became the symbol of national movement for freedom and associated with Gandhiji , was the gift that Ganga Ba had presented to Gandhiji. Ganga Ba had inspired Gandhiji regarding the idea of women’s empowerment with the help of this ‘charkha’. Today women are also given awards in the name of Ganga Ba and a book on her life has also been published. The point is that even 100 years ago, a woman had that strength of talking about women’s empowerment directly to Gandhiji. This is the power of the women in our country.

There is not one but crores of Ganga Bas in our society. We only need to empower them. Our modern India can move forward only by empowering our mothers and sisters. And with this thought the government is taking progressive decisions. Wherever a law is required to be changed, it is being changed; whenever new rules are needed, new rules are being made. More recently, maternity leave has been increased from twelve weeks to 26 weeks by changing the Maternity Act. Even the big and prosperous nations of the world today do not have such a law.

Having made changes in the Factory Act, the states have also been advised to provide facilities for women working at night. Provisions have been made by making changes in the Disability Act for providing the same support and reservation that is available to the Divyangas, also to those women who have been affected by acid attacks. Apart from this, a plan has been successfully worked out to connect the mobile phones of the women with the network of police force through a panic button. Women have now become familiar to the Universal Helpline, 181.

The Government has made a very important decision that the woman head of a household will be the first beneficiary of the schemes of the government. For example, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, it is being emphasised that the registry of the house should be in a woman’s name. Even today, the situation of our society is such that if we ask a woman in whose name has the house been registered, it is either in the name of her husband or her son; Similarly a car or a scooter is registered in the name of the husband or the son. A woman has to be encouraged and some laws and rules have to be changed if we want to instil in them a sense of self-esteem. They should have that confidence that even a woman can possess a property. We shall definitely get the results if we make women-centric laws. There has also been a major change in passport rules; now it will not be mandatory for women to provide their marriage or divorce certificates. She will have the choice of writing either her father's name or her mother's name in the passport. The government is making every effort at every stage so that women come forward on their own for self-employment.

You all must have heard about Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana which has been going on for the last three years. In the last two years, nearly three lakh crore Rupees have been given by the banks as loans without any guarantee from anyone. You will be happy and surprised to know that 70% of the 70 million account holders who take the loan under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana are women. Any Indian would be proud of the fact that a loan of Rs 3 lakh crore was given by the banks and 70 per cent of them were women. Under the ‘Stand Up India’ programme, the government has started giving loans without any guarantee ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore to women entrepreneurs.

Right now, Deepak ji was referring to the UJJWALA scheme, under which so far, two crore women have been given free gas connections so that the poor women can get rid of the kitchen smoke and go out to work.

I want to elaborate upon this. I asked the people of the country from the ramparts of Red Fort that if they did not require the LPG subsidy then why they took it. Even the rich households never pondered over this question; they used to take the subsidy. But when I appealed to the countrymen, more than 1 crore 20 lakhs families surrendered their gas subsidies. And then I promised that the gas subsidy which was surrendered would be transferred to the poor.

Once upon a time in our country, a Member of Parliament was given 25 coupons for gas connection so that he could oblige the people of his constituency. In order to get the gas connection, the people had to face a lot of hurdles by knocking at the doors of MPs time and again. These coupons were sold in the black market. In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a party which was contesting against me, was contesting on the issues such as - whether nine cylinders be provided or 12 cylinders; who should be the Prime Minister of the country; which government should rule the country? One of the parties was fighting on the agenda of whether 9 cylinders should be provided or 12 cylinders! You can imagine that in 2014, we were stuck between 9 and 12; and this government delivered gas cylinders to 1crore 20 lakh households in the last 11 months!

And the mothers and sisters who are present here among us can imagine when a mother cooks food by burning fire-wood, the smoke that enters her body amounts to smoking  400 cigarettes in a day. Just think about the impact on the children playing in the house. By feeling their pain, I started a campaign to liberate these mothers and sisters from the smoke of fire-wood. Eleven months have already passed; so in the next two years, we have taken this resolution to liberate five crore poorest of the poor families from the kitchen smoke.

As Deepak Ji was telling, devising schemes and making law is not everything. The real transformation in the lives of the people takes place only through proper implementation of the schemes. The vision of this government is that the schemes are chalked out, the road map is prepared and constant monitoring is done to ensure the success of the scheme.

This is Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay’s birth centenary. Under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojna, more than 10 lakh women self-help groups have been created in the last two-and-a-half years, in which about three and a half lakh women are involved. In the budget this year, 500 crores have been allocated for the establishment of Mahila Shakti Kendras. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is being implemented so that our daughters can get higher interest rates on savings. So far, accounts of more than one crore daughters have been opened under this scheme.

Maternal mortality, infant mortality, sometimes the death of both the mother and the child or of the pregnant mother, is a very painful scenario in our country. If institutional delivery increases, more and more lives of mothers and children can be saved. And thus, in order to promote institutional delivery, an amount of Rs.6000 in three instalments is being transferred directly to the account of every poor pregnant woman.

If these decisions are viewed separately, perhaps you will not be able to notice the pace at which the work is being done for the empowerment of India's women and to bring about a change in their quality of life. But when you look at many such schemes together, you will understand the intensity with which the government is engaged in women’s empowerment through well-planned schemes for increasing women's participation in development, and the magnitude of the work.

Friends, today more than 65 per cent of the country's population is below 35 years of age. They have their dreams. They want to do something and prove themselves. The government is engaged in every way and at every level so that they can fulfil their dreams and can channelize their energy in the right direction. However, the contribution of institutions and agencies like yours becomes essential for this purpose.

In 2022 our country will be celebrating the 75th year of its independence. Five years are still left. I urge the members of IMC, every person, every family, every home, every institution, every organization, every city and every village of the country to fix for yourself some goals; so as to fulfil the resolve that we all have to work together in order to uplift the society. Today we are independent. We are taking our own decisions. The 125 crore countrymen are the framers of their destinies. Is it not our obligation to fulfil the dreams of those freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the freedom of our country, faced immense hardships, were tortured; some young men went to the gallows; some spent their youth in the prisons of Andaman & Nicobar. When I talk about the responsibility, it is not just the responsibility of the government but also of the 125 crore Indians.

I am requesting you all to make contributions in whatever way possible. Before independence, every activity under the leadership of Gandhiji used to be related to independence. For example, any cleanliness campaign or weaving khadi  or teaching, everything was associated with freedom struggle. Not everybody went to jail or was hanged but everybody used to do something in his own way for independence. Can we celebrate the 75 years of independence in 2022 with our own contribution? I urge all of you today to make resolutions for 2022 and take some steps to do something for the country and society; I expect this from you.

How to get a market on a large platform, at national and international level, for the small and medium women entrepreneurs who are producing  products at a very small level in different parts of the country? Can any campaign be started to make them aware about this? Can a target be fixed till 2022 keeping this goal in mind? Is it possible to organize 500 or at least 100 camps?  I would like to suggest to you a small experiment. Organisations like yours are catalytic agents which can tie up women self-help groups with a corporate house that makes certain products. Corporate houses can provide skill development to women self-help groups, give them raw materials, and the women can make the type of product that is required by that corporate house; the corporate house can then market these products along with their own products. You see, a huge eco system will be created at a low cost, where poor people will get the opportunity to work even without the government’s involvement. We can work in this direction.

Today India has the strength to send her hardworking and skilled workers all over the world. Can your organization develop such an online platform that will help the youngsters to know about the kind of skill which is in demand around the world these days?

The government is running a national entrepreneurship promotion scheme. Under this, the government wants to sponsor 50 lakh youth. Can your organization start a campaign to spread awareness in these companies regarding these schemes so that more number of youth and women get employment opportunities? The government is also tying up with the corporate sector so that the youth getting training under Kaushal Vikas Yojana are able to get employment. You should also think about how your organization can help in the process of getting more companies to join this campaign.

Can your institution contribute in some way to strengthen the State Level Bankers’ Committee? Similarly, how can the representatives of your organization contribute by visiting the training institutions of banks? Every member of the women's wing of IMC has a deep understanding of the merchandise of business. They know business very well. They are well aware of the kind of problems that are faced while starting a new business and they also have the experience of overcoming those difficulties. And they are the ones who can hold the hands of the new businessmen and motivate them to work in this direction.

I hope that your organization will help the common people of the society and give them new strength.

Right now Deepak ji was talking about GST. Can we start small study camps to make the people, the entrepreneurs, especially women entrepreneurs aware about GST? How to use technology? How to make GST seamless? What is the new Tax-system? How is it going to benefit the people? If we can do these things, if we all contribute together, then I am confident that the GST, which has been a long-standing demand, will be a grand success.

We need to change our perception about democracy we have known, a little bit. It is generally believed that democracy is just pressing the vote-button once in five years, and getting the fingers inked every five years. But No, democracy in fact is the journey of participation. Democracy is not successful without the participation of every person at every level. The government does not have a contractor that has been given the contract to change the destiny of the people in five years. The government and the public have a strong partnership, which together only can change the fate of the country and change the economy of the country and strive to fulfil the dreams of the new generation of the country. Come let us move forward cherishing the dreams of a New India keeping in mind the challenges of the 21st century world. We should have a resolution and a road map of our own for the New India and make some of our own contributions. I have put some suggestions in front of you today; perhaps you have better options. I appeal to you that whatever you decide to do put all your efforts into it. New India is the dream of 125 crore people of the country. In order to fulfil this dream, 125 crore Indians will have to work together and find new paths. And with these words I end my speech.

I congratulate the women’s wing of the IMC once again on the completion of 50 years. I could not be present there physically, due to paucity of time. But still you gave me the opportunity to speak to you all. I am very grateful to you.

Thank you!

                मैं Indian Merchant Chamber के Ladies Wing को 50 वर्ष पूरे होने पर बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। किसी भी संस्था के लिए 50 वर्ष का पड़ाव बहुत अहम होता है और ये ऐसा कालखंड होता है कि व्य क्ति हो या संस्था हो, वो सोने की तरह तप करके निकलता है, चमकने लगता है; और शायद इसीलिए 50 वर्ष पूरे होने को Golden Jubilee भी कहते हैं। आप जिस संस्था का हिस्सा हैं उसका बहुत ही गौरवशाली इतिहास रहा है। स्वदेशी आंदोलन की पृष्ठिभूमि में इसकी स्थासपना हुई है। आपने भी पिछले 50 वर्ष महिलाओं के लिए काम करते हुए, कुछ न कुछ योगदान दिया है; और इसके लिए आपकी संस्था प्रशंसा की पात्र है। और पिछले 50 वर्ष में जिन-जिन लोगों ने इसका नेतृत्वि किया है, इसको आगे बढ़ाया है, वे सभी अभिनंदन के अधिकारी हैं। 

आज की जो आर्थिक सामर्थ्य का जब विषय आता है, निर्णय में भागीदारी की बात आती है, जब भी महिलाओं में आर्थिक सामर्थ्य बढ़ा है; निर्णय में उनकी भागीदारी भी बढ़ी है। आप कोई भी सेक्टिर देखिए; जहां भी महिलाओं को सही अवसर मिला है, वो पुरुषों से दो कदम आगे ही निकल गई हैं। 

आज देश की महिलाएं लड़ाकू विमान उड़ा रही हैं, अंतरिक्ष में जा रही हैं, ओलम्पिक में देश को medal दिला रही हैं। पंचायत से ले करके parliament तक, गांव के well से ले करके silicon valley तक भारत की महिलाओं की धमक है। और इसलिए ये कल्पrना कि भारत की महिलाएं सिर्फ घरेलू हैं, ये एक myth है। अगर हम भारत के agriculture sector को देखें, dairy sector को देखें, कोई इस बात से इंकार नहीं कर सकता कि भारत के कृषि क्षेत्र को और पशुपालन के क्षेत्र में अगर सबसे बड़ा योगदान किसी का है; तो नारी शक्ति का है। 

अगर आप आदिवासी इलाके में चले जाएं, वहां पुरुषों की गतिविधि देखिए तो आपको अंदाज आएगा, और शाम के बाद तो हाल क्या होता है, और आदिवासी इलाके में जाइए महिलाएं जिस प्रकार से घर चलाती हैं, आर्थिक गतिविधि करती हैं, उसके पास जो कला है, कौशल्य है, कुटीर उ़द्योग है; आदिवासी महिलाओं में ये जो हुनर होता है, जो सामर्थ्य होता है, हम लोगों में उस तरफ ध्याहन नहीं जाता है; और मेरा मानना है कि हर व्यखक्ति में एक उद्यमी भी होता है, Business की समझ होती है। बस उसे सही मौका और मार्गदर्शन देने की जरूरत होती है। 

देश में कई स्थासनों पर Dairy business से जो महिलाएं जुड़ी हुई हैं, सीधे उनके bank account में पैसा transfer किया जाता है। और मेरा तो जहां-जहां भी डेयरी उद्योग के लोगों से मिलना होता है तो मैं आग्रह करता हूं कि आप डेयरी से संबंधित दूध भरने के लिए जब महिलाएं आती हैं, वो पैसे cash देने की बजाय अच्छाू होगा उस पशुपालक महिलाओं का ही अलग bank account हो, उन्हींप महिलाओं के account में पैसा जमा हो। आप देखिए, वो गांव की गरीब महिला भी जो एक गाय, एक भैंस पालती है जब उसके खाते में bank में जमा पैसे होते हैं वो एक empowerment feel करती है; पूरे घर में उसकी आवाज को notice किया जाता है, उसकी बात को सुना जाता है। जब तक इसको एक माला में पिरोते नहीं हैं, उसकी सारी मेहनत बिखर जाती है। और इसलिए इन छोटे-छोटे बदलाव भी एक नई ताकत देते हैं। 

आज देश में हजारों milk society को महिलाएं चला रही हैं। कई brand इसलिए कामयाब हुए हैं क्योंशकि उनके पीछे महिलाओं की ताकत थी, महिलाओं का श्रम था, उनका business acumen था। ये brand आज दुनियाभर के बड़े management स्कूलों के लिए भी case study बन चुके हैं। अब आप लिज्जdत पापड़ की कथा देखिए, एक जमाने में कुछ आदिवासी महिलाओं ने मिल करके लिज्ज त पापड़ को शुरू किया, एक प्रकार से कुटीर उद्योग के रूप में शुरू हुआ, और आज लिज्ज्त पापड़ ने कहां से कहां अपनी जगह बना ली; आप अमूल को देखें, हर घर में अमूल की पहचान बनी है। हजारों महिला दूध मंडलियों के द्वारा उसके अंदर बहुत बड़ा संचालन में और योगदान होता है; और उसी का परिणाम है कि इन्होंहने अपनी एक पहचान बनाई, एक जगह बनाई है। हमारे देश की महिलाओं में संयम भी है, सामर्थ्य भी है, और सफलता के लिए संघर्ष करने का हौसला भी है। आप जैसी संस्थाभएं उन्हेंक सही रास्ताभ दिखाने में मदद कर सकती हैं। 

Indian Merchant Chamber के साथ एक और गौरव भी जुड़ा हुआ है। और वो गौरव है स्वतयं महात्माM गांधी भी Indian Merchant Chamber के सदस्य थे। जिन लोगों ने गांधीजी के बारे में बहुत अध्यrयन किया होगा उनके ध्याhन में एक नाम आया होगा; जितनी बड़ी चर्चा उस नाम की होनी चाहिए, हुई नहीं है। और आज मैं आपसे भी आग्रह करूंगा कि जिस नाम का मैं उल्लेनख कर रहा हूं, आप भी कोशिश कीजिए; Google Guru के पास जा करके जरा पूछिए कि कौन से नाम की मैं चर्चा कर रहा हूं, और वो नाम है गंगा बा। बहुत कम लोगों को शायद ये गंगा बा के विषय में जानकारी है। 

महात्मा गांधीजी अफ्रीका से भारत लौटे, साबरमती आश्रम में उनका सार्वजनिक जीवन का प्रारंभ हुआ। तो उन्हेी गांव से पता चला, आज से 100 साल पहले की घटना की बात है ये! कि कोई गंगा बा है जो बहुत छोटी आयु में विधवा हो गई और वो समाज के रीतियों के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ करके उसने पुन: अपनी शिक्षा शुरू की, पढ़ना शुरू किया। बहुत छोटी आयु में विधवा हो गई थी, उस समय तो 8, 10 साल की उम्र होगी शायद। और महात्मा गांधी गंगा बा को कहते थे वो बड़ी महा-साहसी महिला थी। जब गांधीजी ने उसके विषय में सुना तो गांधीजी साबरमती आश्रम से उनको मिलने के लिए चले गए। और जब गांधीजी गंगा बा से मिले तो गंगा बा ने गांधीजी को एक भेंट दी थी, एक gift दी थी। 

और आज जिस आजादी के आंदोलन के साथ जो चरखा गांधीजी के साथ हर पल दिखाई देता है, वो चरखा गंगा बा ने गांधीजी को भेंट दिया था। और women empowerment की बात वो चरखा के माध्यदम से गंगा बा ने गांधीजी को प्रेरणा दी थी। अब गंगा बा के नाम पर women empowerment को भी award भी दिया जाता है, उनके जीवन पर एक किताब भी निकली हुई है। मेरा कहने का तात्पगर्य ये है कि 100 साल पहले एक नारी में वो ताकत थी जो गांधीजी को भी आंख से आंख मिला करके women empowerment के विषय में खुल करके बात कर पाती थी। ये हमारे देश की नारी की ताकत है। 

हमारे समाज में भी एक नहीं, लाखों, करोड़ों गंगा बा हैं, बस उन्हेंथ सशक्ता empower करने की आवश्य कता है। आधुनिक भारत में मां, बहनों को सशक्तं करके ही देश आगे बढ़ सकता है। और इसी सोच के साथ सरकार प्रगतिशील फैसले ले रही है। जहां कानून बदलने की आवश्यतकता है, वहां कानून बदला जा रहा है; जहां नए नियम की जरूरत है, वहां नए नियम बनाए जा रहे हैं। अभी हाल ही में maternity act में बदलाव करके maternity leave को twelve week से बढ़ा करके 26 week कर दिया गया है; 12 हफ्ते से सीधा 26 हफ्ते। दुनिया के बड़े-बड़े, समृद्धशील देशों में भी आज ऐसे नियम नहीं हैं। 

Factory Act में भी बदलाव करके राज्योंे को सलाह दी गई है कि महिलाओं को रात्रि में काम करने के लिए सुविधा प्रदान की जाए। Disability act में भी बदलाव करके acid attack से जो पीडि़त महिलाएं हैं उन महिलाओं को वही सहायता, वही reservation देने का प्रावधान किया गया है, जो दिव्यांागों को मिलता है। इसके अलावा mobile fan के द्वारा नारी सुरक्षा को ले करके panic button के द्वारा एक पूरा पुलिस थाने के साथ networking का काम, बड़ी सफलतापूर्वक उसको workout किया गया है। Universal Helpline, 181 अब तो महिलाओं के लिए परिचित हो गया है। 

सरकार ने एक बड़ा महत्वयपूर्ण फैसला भी किया है कि सरकार की योजनाओं का लाभ जिन-जिन परिवारों को मिलता है, वे पहला हकदार उस परिवार की प्रमुख महिला होगी; जैसे प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना में इस बात को प्राथमिकता दी जा रही है कि घर की registry महिलाओं के नाम पर हो। हम जानते हैं कि अगर किसी महिला को पूछो; आज भी हमारे समाज की स्थिति है- घर किसके नाम पर, तो पति के नाम पर या बेटे के नाम पर; गाड़ी किसके नाम पर, तो पति के नाम पर या बेटे के नाम पर; स्कू टर भी लाया तो किसके नाम पर, तो पति के नाम पर या बेटे के नाम पर। सौहार्द स्व भाव जो हो कि महिला के नाम पर भी संपत्ति हो सकती है, उसके लिए थोड़ा प्रोत्सापहित करना पड़ता है, कुछ नियम बदलने पड़ते हैं, कुछ व्यसवस्थानओं को महिला- केंद्रित करनी पड़ती है, उसका परिणाम भी मिल रहा है। Passport के नियमों में भी एक बड़ा महत्वरपूर्ण बदलाव किया गया है; अब महिला को अपनी शादी का या तलाक का certificate देना जरूरी नहीं होगा। ये उसकी इच्छाै पर होगा कि वो Passport में अपने पिता का नाम लिखवाए या फिर मां का। सरकार हर स्तचर पर हर Ladder पर प्रयास कर रही है कि महिलाएं नौकरी के लिए, स्वसरोजगार के लिए, स्व यं हो करके आगे आएं। 

आप सबको पता होगा एक प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना पिछले तीन साल से चल रही है। पिछले दो साल में लगभग तीन लाख करोड़ रुपया बैंकों से कर्ज दिया गया है, और किसी भी गारंटी के बिना दिया गया है। आपको जान करके आनंद भी होगा, आश्चसर्य भी होगा, प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना के तहत जो कर्ज लेने वाले सात करोड़ खाताधारकों में से 70 प्रतिशत महिलाएं हैं। कोई भी हिन्दु स्ता नी इस बात से गर्व कर सकता है कि बैंक से 3 लाख करोड़ रुपयों का कर्ज दिया गया; उन लेने वालों में 70 प्रतिशत महिलाएं हैं। सरकार ने तो Standup India कार्यक्रम के तहत भी महिला उद्यमों को अपने रोजगार के लिए 10 लाख से एक करोड़ रुपये तक का कर्ज without any guarantee देने का शुरू किया है। 

गरीब महिलाएं घर से निकलकर काम कर सकें, रसोई के धुंए से उन्हेु मुक्ति मिले; अभी दीपक जी उसका बड़ा वर्णन कर रहे थे और इसलिए उज्व्य ला योजना के तहत अब तक दो करोड़ से ज्यासदा महिलाओं को मुफ्त गैस कनैक्श‍न दिया गया है। 

मैं इसको जरा विस्तािर से कहना चाहता हूं आप लोगों को। जब मैंने लालकिले पर से देश के लोगों से कहा था कि अगर आपको जरूरत नहीं है तो आप गैस सिलेंडर की subsidy क्यों लेते हैं? और अमीर घर में भी सोचा नहीं गया था, subsidy का गैस आता था लेते थे। ..... लेकिन जब मैंने देशवासियों को कहा, एक करोड़ 20 लाख से ज्या दा परिवारों ने अपनी गैस subsidy surrender कर दी। और तब मैंने कहा था कि ये गैस subsidy जो surrender हुई है, मैं ये गरीबों को transfer कर दूंगा। 

एक समय था हमारे देश में parliament के member को gas connection के लिए 25 coupon दी जाती थी ताकि वो अपने इलाके के लोगों को oblige कर सके। और MP के घर लोग चक्क.र काटते थे कि उनके परिवार को एक gas connection मिल जाए। Gas connection की coupon की कालाबाजारी होती थी। 2014 का जो चुनाव हुआ था, एक पार्टी इस मुद्दे पर चुनाव लड़ रही थी लोकसभा का; जो मेरे खिलाफ लड़ रहे थे, उनका मुद्दा ये कि अब नौ सिलेंडर देंगे या 12 सिलेंडर देंगे? हिन्दु.स्तांन की लोकसभा का चुनाव, देश का प्रधानमंत्री कौन हो? देश की सरकार क्याग हो? एक political party का agenda था कि 9 सिलेंडर मिलेंगे या 12 सिलेंडर? आप कल्पहना कर सकते हैं कि 2014 में जब 9 और 12 के बीच में हम अटके पड़े थे, इस सरकार ने पिछले 11 महीने में एक करोड़ 20 लाख परिवारों को गैस का चूल्हाच पहुंचा दिया है। 

और ये, आप माताएं, बहनें यहां बैठी हैं, आप इसका अंदाज कर सकते हैं; जब लकड़ी का चूल्हा1 जला करके मां खाना पकाती है तो एक दिन में उसके शरीर में 400 सिगरेट का धुंआ जाता है। बच्चेर घर में खेलते हैं तब क्यां होता होगा? उनके शरीर का हाल क्यात होता होगा? उस पीड़ा को समझ करके, उस वेदना को समझ करके इन मां, बहनों को लकड़ी के चूल्हे के धुंए से मुक्ति दिलाने का मैंने एक अभियान छेड़ा। और आने वाले दो साल में, 11 महीने हो चुके; दूसरे दो साल में पांच करोड़ परिवारों को, जोकि हमारे गरीबतर; हिन्दुीस्ताधन में total 25 करोड़ परिवार हैं। 5 करोड़ परिवारों को इस धुंए से मुक्ति दिलाने का एक बहुत बड़ा बीड़ा उठाया है। 

प्रधानमंत्री उज्ज्वला योजना के तहत इस काम को, और जैसा अभी दीपक जी बता रहे थे, योजना एक बात है, कानून-नियम एक बात है, सामान्य मानवी की जिंदगी में बदलाव तब आता है जब उसका implementation होता है, आखिरी छोर पर बैठे हुए व्यीक्ति तक वो व्यनवस्थाउ पहुंचती है और इस सरकार की ये पहचान है कि यहां पर योजनाओं की संकल्पीना की जाती है, road map तैयार किया जाता है, और उसको परिपूर्ण करने के लिए लगातार monitoring हो करके उसको साकार किया जाता है। 

पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याकय की जन्म -शताब्दीै चल रही है, दीनदयाल अंत्योnदय योजना के तहत पिछले ढाई साल में 10 लाख से ज्या।दा women self-help group बनाए गए हैं, जिसमें लगभग साढ़े तीन करोड़ महिलाओं को जोड़ा गया है। इस वर्ष बजट में भी 500 करोड़ के निवेश के साथ महिला-शक्ति केंद्रों की स्थाैपना का भी एलान किया गया है। बेटियों को बचत पर ज्या दा ब्यामज मिल सके, इसलिए सु‍कन्याल समृद्धि योजना चलाई जा रही है। अब तक एक करोड़ से जयादा बेटियों के account इस योजना के तहत खोले जा चुके हैं। 

हमारे देश में माता-मृत्युनदर, शिशु-मृत्युनदर, प्रसूता मां का मरना, कभी-कभी pregnancy में मां और बेटी, दोनों का, बच्चेु दोनों का मरना; ये बड़ी दर्दनाक स्थिति है हमारे देश में। जितनी ज्याेदा institutional delivery बढ़ेगी, इतने हम माताओं की जिंदगी बचा पाएंगे, बच्चोंस की जिंदगी बचा पाएंगे। और इसलिए institutional delivery को बढ़ावा देने के लिए गरीब गर्भवती महिलाओं के account में 6000 रुपये की राशि तीन किश्तोंो में सीधी transfer की जा रही है। 

ये फैसले अगर आप अलग-थलग देखेंगे तो शायद अंदाज नहीं आयेगा कि भारत की नारी शक्ति के empowerment के लिए, उनके quality of life में बदलाव लाने के लिए क्या हो रहा है। लेकिन ऐसी कई योजनाओं को जब एक साथ देखेंगे तो आपको अंदाज आएगा कि सरकार नारी के empowerment के लिए, भारत के विकास में नारी शक्ति की भागीदारी के लिए कितनी सोची-समझी योजना के तहत एक-एक चीजों को आगे बढ़ा रही है और कितने व्याकपक स्तीर पर काम हो रहा है। 

Friends, आज देश की 65 प्रतिशत से ज्या दा जनसंख्यात 35 साल से कम उम्र की है। उसके अपने सपने हैं। वो कुछ कर गुजरना चाहते हैं। वो अपने सपने पूरे कर सकें, अपन ऊर्जा को सही इस्ते माल कर सकें, इसके लिए सरकार हर स्तकर पर, हर तरीके से जुटी हुई है, लेकिन उसमें आप जैसी संस्थाकएं, आप जैसी एजेंसियां; इनका भरपूर योगदान आवश्यहक होता है। 

और मेरा आपसे आग्रह है कि जब 2022 में, और मैं ये विशेष रूप से आग्रह करूंगा यहां बैठे हुए IMC के सभी महानुभावों से, कि जब 2022 में देश अपनी स्वंतंत्रता के 75 वर्ष मना रहा होगा, आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं 2022 में; अभी पांच साल हमारे पास बाकी हैं। हम अभी से हर व्य क्ति, हर परिवार, हर संगठन, हर सामाजिक व्य्वस्थाा, हर गांव और शहर, हर कोई मिल करके अपने लिए कोई लक्ष्य7 तय कर सकते हैं क्याग? कि हम 2022 तक व्य क्ति के नाते मेरे द्वारा समाज के लिए करूं, संस्थात के द्वारा मैं देश के लिए समाज के लिए करूं। आज हम आजादी की जिंदगी जी रहे हैं। हम अपने फैसले खुद कर रहे हैं। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी अपने भाग्यद के नियंता हैं। जिन आजादी के दीवानों ने देश को आजादी दिलाने के लिए अपने-आपको बलि चढ़ा दिया, जवानी जेल में काट दी, कष्टअ झेले, कुछ नौजवान फांसी के तख्तअ पर चढ़ गए, कुछ लोगों ने अपनी जवानी अंडेमान-निकोबार में काट दी; क्या, उनके सपने पूरे करना हमारा दायित्वि नहीं है? और जब मैं हमारा दायित्वद कहता हूं तब मैं सिर्फ सरकार की बात नहीं करता हूं, मैं सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की बात करता हूं। 

मैं आपसे आग्रह कर रहा हूं, हम जहां भी जाएं जिसके भी साथ बैठैं, 2022- आजादी के 75 साल; जैसे आजादी के पहले गांधीजी के नेतृत्वि में हर गतिविधि आजादी लेकर रहेंगे करते थे, आजादी के लिए अपने-आपको जोड़ कर रखते थे। कोई सफाई अभियान करता था तो भी आजादी के लिए करता था, कोई खादी बुनता था तो भी आजादी के लिए करता था। कोई लोगों को पढ़ाई का काम करता था तो भी आजादी के लिए करता था। कोई स्वददेशी का आग्रह करता था तो भी आजादी के लिए करता था। हर कोई जेल नहीं जाता था, हर लोग फांसी के तख्तेे पर नहीं चढ़ते थे लेकिन जहां थे वहां आजादी के लिए कुछ करते थे। क्यार हम 2022, आजादी के 75 साल, हमारे अपने योगदान के साथ मना सकते हैं क्या्? मैं आज आप सबको इसके लिए आग्रह करता हूं कि हम 2022 के लिए कोई संकल्पम करें, सपने संजोंए और देश और समाज के लिए कुछ कर गुजरने के लिए कुछ कदम हम भी चल पड़ें; ये मेरी आपसे अपेक्षा है। देश के अलग-अलग हिस्सोंम में मध्यं महिला-उद्ममी बहुत छोटे स्त।र पर जो product तैयार कर रही है वो कैसे एक बड़े platform पर market प्राप्त् करें, National, International; जहां भी हम पहुंचा सकें। वो अपनी पैठ कैसे बना सकती हैं, क्यों् उन्हेंत इस बारे में जागरूक करने के लिए कोई अभियान शुरू किया जा सकता है? 2022 twenty-twenty two तक कोई target fix किया जा सकता है कि इस लक्ष्य को ध्यांन में रखते हुए 500 या 100 कैम्पt लगाए जाएंगे। एक छोटा सा experiment, आपको मैं सुझाव देना चाहूंगा, आप जैसी एक catalytic agent हो जो संस्थाा काम कर रही हो, corporate house हो जो कुछ न कुछ product करते होंगे, और women self-help group. Corporate house इन women self-help group को skill development का काम करें, उनके raw material दें, और जिस प्रकार के product की जरूरत उस Corporate house को है; women self-help group से करवा दें। और Corporate house अपनी बड़ी product के साथ इसको जोड़ करके marketing करे। आप देखिए कम खर्चे में एक बहुत बड़ा एक eco system तैयार होगा, जहां सरकार के कहीं बीच में आए बिना भी गरीब से गरीब लोगों को काम का अवसर मिल जाएगा। और इस दिशा में हम काम कर सकते हैं। 

आज भारत में वो ताकत है, वो दुनियाभर में अपने मेहनती और कुशल कामगारों को भेज सकता है। क्याा आपकी संस्था इस तरह का कोई Online platform develop कर सकती हैं? जिससे नौजवानों को ये पता चले कि दुनिया के किस देश में इस समय किस तरह के skill की demand है। 

सरकार national entrepreneurship promotion scheme चला रही है। इसके तहत सरकार 50 लाख युवाओं को sponsor कराना चाहती है। क्याn आपकी संस्था। कम्पतनियों में scheme को ले करके जागरूकता का अभियान चलाया जा सकता है? ताकि ज्याeदा से ज्या‍दा युवाओं को, महिलाओं को रोजगार के लिए अवसर मिले। कौशल विकास की training लेने वाले युवाओं को नौकरी के लिए सरकार private sector की कम्पmनियों से भी समझौता कर रही है। ज्याकदा से ज्याीदा कम्पलनियां इस अभियान से जुड़ें, इसके लिए आपकी संस्थाै किस प्रकार से मदद कर सकती हैं, इस बारे में भी आपको सोचना चाहिए। 

क्या State level bankers committee को मजबूत करने के लिए आपकी संस्थाै कोई सहयोग दे सकती हैं? इसी तरह क्याb बैंकों के training institution में आपकी संस्था के प्रतिनिधि जाकर क्या अपना योगदान दे सकते हैं? IMC के ladies wing की हर सदस्यक business की बारिकियों के बारे में गहरी समझ है। वो उठते-बैठते पैसे, business, व्याआपार; ये सब चर्चा करना उनके स्वेभाव में है। अपना business शुरू करने में किस-किस प्रकार की दिक्कातें आती हैं, उनको भलीभांति पता है। उन दिक्कउतों से सामना करते हुए कैसे आगे निकला जाए, उसका अपना अनुभव है। और वे जो नए लोग हैं उनका हाथ पकड़ करके उनको इस दिशा में काम करने के लिए प्रेरित कर सकते हैं। 

और इसलिए मैं आशा करूंगा कि आपके संगठन के माध्य म से समाज के सामान्य् स्त र के लोग, जिनका आप लोगों के बीच बैठना-उठना संभव नहीं है; उनके पास जा करके उनको हम नई ताकत दे सकते हैं। 

अभी हमारे दीपक जी GST के विषय में कह रहे थे। समय रहते हुए GST के संबंध में हम लोगों को उद्यमियों को, खास करके महिला उद्यमियों को उनके कोई छोटे, छोटे, छोटे study camp लगा सकते हैं क्याS? Technology का कैसे उपयोग करना है? GST को stream-less कैसे बनाना है? Tax-system नई क्याम है? उससे सामान्यन जो व्यGक्ति हैं उसकी सुविधा कितनी बढ़ने वाली है? ये सारी बातें अगर हम बता सकते हैं तो मुझे विश्वा स है कि GST जो कि कितने वर्षों से मांग थी। हर कोई चाहता था, अब हुआ है तो सफल बनाने के लिए हम सबका भी योगदान बहुत आवश्यरक है। 

और लोकतंत्र जिस रूप में हमने जाना-समझा है उसको थोड़ा बदलने की आवश्य कता है। ज्याोदातर ये माना गया पांच साल में एक बार गए, बटन दबा दिया, उंगली पर काला टिकवा लगा दिया तो देश का लोकतंत्र हो गया। जी नहीं, लोकतंत्र हर पल भागीदारी का, भागीदारी की यात्रा है। हर स्तार पर, हर व्य क्ति की भागीदारी के बिना लोकतंत्र सफल नहीं होता है। सरकार कोई contractor नहीं है जिसको हमारा भाग्य बदलने का हमने contract दे दिया, पांच साल में वो भाग्यc बदल देंगे। सरकार और जनता एक मजबूत साझेदारी होती है जो मिल करके देश का भाग्यग बदलते हैं, देश की अर्थव्यतवस्थाो को बदलते हैं, देश की नई पीढ़ी के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए प्रयास करते हैं। आइए, 21वीं सदी के विश्वक में जिस प्रकार की चुनौतियां हैं, विश्व में जिस प्रकार का माहौल बदला है; हम भी मिल करके New India का सपना ले करके चलें। New India का हमारा अपना कोई संकल्पय होना चाहिए। New India का हमारा अपना कुछ न कुछ योगदान करने का road map होना चाहिए। मैंने कुछ सुझाव आज आपके सामने रखे हैं, हो सकता है इससे भी बेहतर option आपके पास होंगे। मेरी आपसे अपील है कि आप जो भी लक्ष्या तय करें उसमें पूरी ताकत के साथ जुट जाएं। New India देश के सवा सौ करोड़ लोंगों का सपना है। इस सपने को पूरा करने के लिए सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों को मिलकर रास्तेो निकालने होंगे, मिलकर काम करना होगा। और इन्हीं। शब्दोंर के साथ मैं अपनी बात खत्मि करता हूं। 

IMC की ladies wing को 50 वर्ष पूरे होने पर मैं फिर से एक बार बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। मैं स्व यं वहां पर नहीं आ पाया, समय की सीमा थी। लेकिन फिर भी आप लोगों ने मुझे, मेरी बात कहने का अवसर दिया, सबके दर्शन करने का मौका मिला। मैं आपका बहुत-बहुत आभारी हूं। 

धन्यवाद।

                आज हम 20वीं सदी के एक महान घटनाक्रम का समारोह का शुभांरभ करने के लिए एकत्र हुए हैं। 100 वर्ष पहले आज का ही दिन था, जब गांधीजी पटना पहुंचे थे, और चंपारण के अपने सफर की शुरूआत की थी। चंपारण की जिस धरती को भगवान बुद्ध के प्रवचन का आशीर्वाद मिला था, जो धरती सीता माता के पिता, जनक के राज्‍य का हिस्‍सा रही थी; वहां के किसान कठोरत्‍तम स्थिति का सामना कर रहे थे। न सिर्फ चंपारण कि किसानों को, शोषितों को, पीडि़तों को गांधीजी ने एक रास्‍ता दिखाया, बल्कि पूरे देश को ये एहसास कराया कि शांतिपूर्ण सत्याग्रह की क्‍या शक्ति होती है। 

दोस्‍तों, हमारे देश का इतिहास सिर्फ कुछ व्‍यक्तियों तक सिमटा नहीं रहा, सिर्फ कुछ परिवारों तक सिमटा नहीं रहा। हमारा देश का इतिहास वृहद, व्‍यापक; एक ऐसा इतिहास, जो नये रूप और संदर्भों में बार-बार लौटता है और हमें मजबूर करता है कि हम अपनी आंखें खोलें और अपने राष्‍ट्र की गौरवशाली संस्‍कृतिक परम्‍परा को पहचानें। इतिहास के कुछ पन्‍ने ऐसे होते हैं, कि वे जब भी आपको या आप उनको छूते हैं, खोलते हैं तो आपको कुछ नया बनाकर जाते हैं। इसे पारस स्‍पर्श कहते हैं, इतिहास का पारस स्‍पर्श। चंपारण का सत्‍याग्रह ऐसा ही पारस है। इसलिए बहुत आवश्‍यक है कि हम ऐसे ऐतिहासिक अवसरों को जानें, उनसे जुड़ें, हो सकें तो उन्‍हें जीने का प्रयास करें। 

अब यहां एक प्रदर्शनी का उद्घाटन किया गया, online interactive quiz का आरंभ हुआ है, नृत्‍य-नाटिका भी प्रस्‍तुत की गई है। चंपारण सत्‍याग्रह के 100 साल पूरे होने पर होने वाले ऐसे कार्यक्रम सिर्फ औपचारिकता नहीं हैं। ये हमारे लिए एक पवित्र अवसर है। बापू के आदर्शों से प्रेरित होकर देश-हित के लिए खुद को संकल्पित करने का, समर्पित करने का। 

साथियो, हमें अब महात्‍मा गांधी को श्रद्धांजलि के साथ-साथ कार्यांजलि भी अर्पित करनी है। अपने कार्यों को उन्‍हें अर्पित करना है। और उसके सबसे बड़ा माध्‍यम है स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह। सत्‍य के प्रति आग्रह की तरह ही स्‍वच्‍छता के प्रति भी आग्रह। 

दोस्‍तों, 1917 में, nineteen seventeen में, जब गांधीजी चंपारण गए तो उनका इरादा वहां बहुत लम्‍बे समय तक रुकने का नहीं था। वे चंपारण की स्थिति के बारे में बहुत जानते भी नहीं थे। लेकिन जब गांधीजी वहां पहुंचे तो कुछ हफ्ते नहीं बल्कि कई महीनों तक वहां रुके। चंपारण ने ही उन्‍हें मोहनदास कर्मचंद गांधी से महात्‍मा गांधी बनाया था। चंपारण पहुंचने से पहले वो सत्‍याग्रह की ताकत से खुद अवगत थे, वो उसे जानते थे। लेकिन उन्‍हें पता था कि सिर्फ उनके सत्‍याग्रही बनने से इच्छित परिणाम प्राप्‍त नहीं होंगे। वो देश के जनमानस को सत्‍याग्रह की ताकत का एहसास कराना चाहते थे। 

जब Magistrate ने उन्‍हें चंपारण से जाने का आदेश दिया तो उन्‍होंने कहा था, इस आदेश से इंकार वो अदालत की अवमानना के लिए नहीं कर रहे हैं, बल्कि वो ऐसा अपनी अतंरात्‍मा की आवाज और अपने अस्तित्‍व के सम्‍मान के लिए कर रहे हैं। पूरा अंग्रेजी शासन गांधी के उस निर्णय से back-foot पर चला गया। जब गांधीजी ने कहा था कि मैं जेल जाने के लिए तैयार हूं, अंग्रेजों ने सोचा नहीं था। जनता देख रही थी कि दक्षिण अफ्रीका से लौटा एक बैरिस्‍टर यहां चंपारण में आकर किस तरह जेल जाने के लिए तैयार हो गया। इतनी गर्मी में पूरे इलाके की धूल खा रहा है। तपती धूप में कभी बैलगाड़ी में, कभी इक्‍के और कभी पैदल ही एक जगह से दूसरी जगह गांधी चला जा रहा था। 

आप ध्‍यान दीजिए गांधी जी इस वक्‍त लोगों के thought process को जगा रहे थे। नील की खेती करने वाले किसानों से उनके बयान लिए जा रहे थे, जांच की जा रही थी। लेकिन इस प्रक्रिया में गांधीजी खुद को लोगों से जोड़़ करके, खुद को खपा करके, खुद का उदाहरण प्रस्‍तुत करके, जन-जन का- उसकी शक्ति को आपस में जोड़ रहे थे। 

गांधीजी कहते थे, ''मेरा जीवन ही मेरा दर्शन है।'' और यही हमने चंपारण में देखा है। गांधीजी ने अपनी आत्‍मकथा में लिखा है कि कैसे लोगों को अपनी शक्ति का एहसास हुआ और ये भी समय आया कि परिवर्तन हो सकता है, बदलाव हो सकता है। उन्‍होंने लिखा है 100 साल से चले आने वाले तीन कठिया कानून के रद्द होने ही नील की खेती करवाने वाले अंग्रेजों का राज अस्‍त हुआ। जनता का जो समुदाय बराबर दबा ही रहता था, उसे अपनी शक्ति का कुछ और भान हुआ। और लोगों का ये वहम हुआ कि नील का दाग होने पर धुल नहीं सकता। 

यानि ऐसी स्थिति जब लोग ये मानने लगें कि कुछ हो ही नहीं सकता, कुछ परिवर्तन आ ही नहींसकता, उसे गांधी जी ने लोगों का भ्रम कहा है। इस भ्रम को उन्होंने तोड़ा, और लोगों को अपनी शक्ति का एहसास कराया। 

भाइयों और बहनों, गांधी जी मूलरूप से स्वच्छाग्रही थे। वो कहते थे- “स्वच्छता आजादी से कहीं अधिक महत्वपूर्ण है”। वे यह देखकर व्यथित हो जाते थे कि गांवों में लोग अज्ञानता और बेपरवाही के कारण गंदगी और अस्वच्छ स्थितियों में रहते हैं। 1917 में ही एक कार्यक्रम के दरम्‍यान पूज्‍य बापू ने कहा था कहा था, “जब तक हम अपने गांवों और शहरों की स्थितियों को नहीं बदलते, अपने आप को बुरी आदतों से मुक्त नहीं करते और बेहतर शौचालय नहीं बनाते तब तक स्वराज का हमारे लिए कोई महत्व नहीं है।"" 

एक तरह से कहें तो देश में स्वच्छता आंदोलन का मूल स्थान भी चंपारण को माना जा सकता है। उन्होंने साफ-सफाई और स्वच्छता को गांधीवादी जीवन-शैली का एक अभिन्न हिस्सा बनाया। उनका सपना था सभी के लिए संपूर्ण स्वच्छता। 

दोस्तों, चंपारण से वहां जो कुछ भी मंथन हुआ, जो प्रयास हुए, उसमें से हमें पंचामृत मिला। जन-सामान्‍य को जोड़ करके, मंथन करके, कार्य करके, संघर्ष करके इस पंचामृत से देश के स्वतंत्रता आंदोलन को नई धार मिली। 

अगर हम बारीकी से देखें तो पांएगे कि चंपारण में गांधीजी ने जो कुछ किया, उससे पांच अलग-अलग अमृत देश के समक्ष प्रस्‍तुत हुए। ये पंचामृत आज भी देश के लिए उतना ही महत्‍वपूर्ण है- 

पहला अमृत - सत्‍याग्रह की ताकत से लोग परिचित हुए, 

दूसरा अमृत - जनशक्ति की ताकत से लोग परिचित हुए, 

तीसरा अमृत - स्‍वच्‍छता और शिक्षा को लेकर भारतीय जनमानस में नई जागृति आई, 

चौथा अमृत - महिलाओं की स्थिति सुधारने का प्रयास हुआ, 

और पांचवां अमृत - अपने हाथों से काते गए वस्‍त्र पहनने की सोच पैदा हुई। ये पंचामृत चंपारण आंदोलन का सार हैं। 

साथियों, जब मैं चपांरण की बात करता हूं, तो मुझे बालमोहन यानी बाल कृष्‍ण की याद आती है। मोहन से मोहन तक कैसी यात्रा चली है; एक सुदर्शन चक्रधानी मोहन और दूसरा चरखाधारी मोहन। हम सबको पता है कि जब माता यशोदा बहुत परेशान थीं कि उनके बालक ने मिट्टी खा ली है। इसी चिंता में जब उन्‍होंने बाल मोहन से मुंह खोलने के लिए कहा, तो उन्‍होंने माता यशोदा को पूरे ब्रह्मांड के दर्शन करा दिए थे। ऐसा करके बाल मोहन ने अपनी माता को चिंता से मुक्ति दिलाई। 

जब मैं चंपारण की बात करता हूं तो मुझे किशोर मोहन की भी याद आती है। वो चक्रधारी मोहन जब किशोर था, जिसे हम कृष्‍ण के रूप में जानते हैं; जो रासलीला करता था, बांसुरी बजाता था। किशोर मोहन ने जब घनघोर बारिश से गांववालों की रक्षा के लिए गोवर्धन उठाया तो बाकी गांव वालों से भी कहा कि आप भी अपनी लाठी ले करके खड़े हो जाइए, तब जा करके गोवर्धन उठेगा। जब गोवर्धन पर्वत उठा तो हर एक को लग रहा था कि वो मेरी ताकत से उठा हैृ; मेरी लाठी से उठा है। और ऐसा करके किशोर मोहन ने जन-जन के खुद की ताकत और सामूहिक ताकत से परिचित कराया था। 

ठीक इसी तरह हमारे मोहन, महात्‍मा गांधी ने लोगों को गुलामी की चिंता से मुक्‍त किया, उनहें वो रास्‍ता दिखाया जिस पर चलकर आजादी मिल सकती थी। हमारे मोहन ने लोगों की जनशक्ति को जगाया और उन्‍हें सत्‍याग्रह से स्‍वरूछाग्रह की शक्ति से परिचित कराया। 

जनशक्ति जागरण के इस अभियान में बापू ने महिलाओं को भी बराबर का सहभागी बनाया। चंपारण में भी महिलाओं की स्थिति को देखकर वो सोचने पर मजबूर हुए कि क्‍यों ना लोग अपने ही हाथ से धागा बुनें और खुद वस्‍त्र बनाएं। वो इसे सशक्तिकरण का भी एक जरिया मानते थे। खादी के विकसित होने के पीछे महात्‍मा गांधीजी का चंपारण प्रवास भी बहुत बड़ी वजह रही है। 

सा‍थियों, सत्‍याग्रह ने गांधी जी के नेतृत्‍व में हमें आजादी दिलाई, किंतु स्‍वतंत्रता के बाद गांधी जी का स्‍वच्‍छ भारत का सपना अधूरा ही रह गया था। सात दशक बाद भी हम इस बुराई से मुक्‍त नहीं हो पाए। इसलिए जब 2014 में मैंने लालकिले से हर घर में शौचालय की बात की, तो लोग हैरान थे कि इस तरह बात मैं क्‍यों कर रहा हूं। 

दोस्‍तों, स्‍वच्‍छ भारत मिशन बापू के अधूरे सपनों को पूरा करने का अभियान हे। ये सपना लगभग 100 वर्षों से अधूरा है और हमें इसे मिल करके पूरा करना है। मुझे खुशी है कि आज स्‍वच्‍छ भारत मिशन के जरिए देश के लोग बापू के सपने को पूरा करने के लिए उठ खड़़े हुए हैं। स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान सच्‍चे अर्थों में एक जन-आंदोलन बनता चला जा रहा है। समाज का हर वर्ग इस स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह से जुड़ रहा है। जब स्‍वच्‍छ भारत किशन शुरू हुआ था तो उस समय केवल 42 प्रतिशत ग्रामीण आबादी ही शौचालयों का उपयोग करती थी। आज ये बढ़ करके 63 प्रतिशत पर पहुंचे हैं। 

पिछले ढ़ाई सालों में एक लाख 80 हजार से ज्यादा गांव और 130 जिले खुद को खुले में शौच से मुक्त घोषित कर चुके हैं। अब राज्यों में भी एक होड़ सी शुरू हुई है, एक प्रतिस्पर्धा शुरू हुयी है कि कौन पहले खुद को खुले में शौच से मुक्त या Open Defecation Free राज्य घोषित करता है। 

आज की स्थिति है कि सिक्किम, हिमाचल प्रदेश और केरल पूरी तरह ODF उन्होंने घोषित किया हैं। गुजरात, हरियाणा, उत्तराखंड और कुछ अन्य राज्य भी खुद को खुले में शौच से मुक्त घोषित करने की ओर बहुत तेजी से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। बहुत जल्द हमें उसके भी समाचार पहुंचेंगे। 

गंगा तट के किनारे बने गांवों को प्राथमिकता के आधार पर Open Defecation Free बनाया जा रहा है। मुझे आपको ये बताते हुए खुशी है कि उत्तराखंड, उत्तर प्रदेश, बिहार, झारखंड और पश्चिम बंगाल, जिन पाँच राज्यों से गंगा जी होकर गुजरती हैं, वहां गंगा किनारे के 75 प्रतिशत गांवों ने खुद को खुले में शौच से मुक्त घोषित कर दिया है। गंगा किनारे बसे गांवों में कचरे के प्रबंधन की योजनाएं लागू की जा रही हैं ताकि गांव का कचरा भी नदी में ना बहाया जाए। मुझे उम्मीद है कि जल्द ही गंगा तट पूरी तरह खुले में शौच से मुक्त हो जाएगा। 

भाइयों और बहनें, आज सभी सरकारी स्कूलों में लड़कों और लड़कियों के लिए अलग-अलग शौचालय हैं। अब बच्चों के syllabus में स्वच्छता से जुड़े chapter शामिल किए जा रहे हैं ताकि उन्हें शुरू से ही इसके फायदों और नुकसान के बारे में पता चले, और वो स्वच्छता को अपनी जिंदगी का, अपनी आदत का हिस्सा बनाएं। 

दोस्तों, स्वच्छ भारत मिशन ने ही हमें कार्यांजलि का एक और नया मंत्र दिया है। ये मंत्र है Waste से Wealth. घरों से जो गंदगी निकलती है, बिल्डिंग बनाने के दौरान जो कचरा निकलता है, वो भी कमाई का एक जरिया हो सकता है। इससे बिजली बनाई जा सकती है, खाद बनाई जा सकती है, इसे Recycle करके construction से जुड़े कामों में उन्हें re-use किया जा सकता है। और इसलिए Waste से Wealth पर भी जोर दिया जा रहा है और इसके लिए हमें प्रयास करना चाहिए। 

सरकार के अलग-अलग विभाग भी स्वच्छता को बढ़ाने के लिए, लोगों की सहूलियत को ध्यान में रखते हुए नए-नए initiative ले रहे हैं। इसमें टेक्नोलॉजी का भी इस्तेमाल किया जा रहा है। आपने देखा होगा कि कैसे रेलवे में गंदगी से जुड़ा एक भी ट्वीट होने पर कितनी तेजी से उसको respond किया जाता है। वरना आप लोग याद करिए, पहले कैसे रेल के डिब्बों में, प्लेटफॉर्म पर गंदगी को व्यवस्था का हिस्सा मान लिया गया था। 

अभी हाल ही में पेट्रोलियम मंत्रालय ने swachhta @ petrol pump के नाम से एक मोबाइल app लॉन्च किया है। अगर पेट्रोल पंप पर बने शौचालयों में गंदगी है, वो साफ नहीं हैं तो इसकी शिकायत तुरंत इस app के माध्यम से की जा सकती है। देश के लगभग 55 हजार पेट्रोल पंपों पर ये सुविधा उलब्ध होगी। 

इसी कड़ी में दिल्ली में एक राष्ट्रीय स्वच्छता केंद्र की भी स्थापना की जा रही है। ये केंद्र स्वच्छता अभियान से जुड़ी सभी जानकारियां, आधुनिक तकनीकें लोगों तक पहुंचाने में मददगार साबित होगा। 

दोस्तों, अलग-अलग स्तर पर, गवर्नमेंट से लेकर गांव तक स्वच्छाग्रह का अभियान इस समय देश में छिड़ा हुआ है, वो अभूतपूर्व है। अब लोगों के thought-process में आ रहा है कि गंदगी नहीं फैलानी है, बच्चे बड़ों को टोक रहे हैं, शिकायत कर रहे हैं। और इसलिए स्वच्छता, स्वच्छाग्रह इस अभियान को आगे बढ़ने के लिए शिकायत के साथ ही एक भाव ये भी तो आ रहा है कि हमें गंदगी नहीं करनी है, अपने आसपास घर, दफ्तर, सड़क-शहर को साफ रखना है। स्वच्छता के प्रति ये भाव ही स्वच्छाग्रह है, स्वच्छता के लिए किया गया कार्य ही बापू को कार्यांजलि है। 

दोस्तों, गांधी जी सिर्फ व्यवस्था परिवर्तन ही नहीं मूल्य परिवर्तन भी चाहते थे। उन्होंने अपनी आत्मकथा में लिखा है- “मैं चाहता हूं कि भारत इस बात को पहचान ले कि वह शरीर नहीं बल्कि अमर आत्मा है, जो हर एक शारीरिक कमजोरी के ऊपर उठ सकती है और सारी दुनिया के सम्मिलित शारीरिक बल को चुनौती दे सकती है”। 

हमें देश की आत्मा को पहचानना होगा। बदलाव आ सकता है, इस सोच के साथ आगे बढ़ना होगा। जितनी ये सोच मजबूत होगी, उतना ही NEW INDIA की नीव मजबूत होगी। हमें स्वच्छता से जुड़े अपने लक्ष्य तय करने होंगे और उन्हें प्राप्त करने के लिए लगातार प्रयास करना होगा। कोई वजह नहीं कि भारत की पहचान एक अस्वच्छ देश के तौर पर रहे। कोई कारण नहीं कि हमारा देश स्वच्छ नहीं हो पाए। कोई कारण नहीं के हम स्वच्छाग्रह के इस अभियान को पूरा ना कर पाएं। महात्मा गांधी के एक स्वच्छ, स्वस्थ और खुशहाल भारत का सपना प्रत्येक भारतीय का सपना होना चाहिए। इस मिशन की सफलता ही, बापू को सच्ची श्रद्धांजलि होगी, सच्ची कार्यांजलि होगी। 

मैं सच में आग्रह करता हूं देशवासियों, 2019 जब गांधी के 150 साल होंगे, 1915 में जब गांधी भारत लौटे थे, दो साल के भीतर-भीतर 1917 में, चंपारण में मोहनदास कर्मचंद गांधी महात्‍मा गांधी बन गए। बारदौली के सत्‍याग्रह में वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल, सरदार पटेल बन गए थे। देश उनके पीछे चल पड़ा था। हमारे लिए चंपारण सत्‍याग्रह आजादी के आंदोलन की एक नई धारा को सशक्‍त बनाने का प्रारंभ बिन्‍दु था। आज उसकी जब शताब्‍दी मना रहे हैं तब स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह का हमारा संकल्‍प भी सत्‍याग्रह से स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह की यात्रा; और ये दोनों चीजें गांधी की देन हैं। उस समय सत्‍याग्रह आजादी के लिए आवश्‍यक था, इस समय स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह देश को गंदगी से मुक्ति के लिए आवश्‍यक है। और गंदगी से मुक्ति मतलब गरीबों का कल्‍याण। अगर सचमुच में गरीबों की सेवा करनी है, उनको बीमारियों से बचाना है, उनको जिंदगी में कोई बदलाव लाना है तो गंदगी से मुक्ति के इस मंत्र को ले करके देशवासियों हम को चलना है। 



मैं फिर से एक बार चंपारण की सत्‍याग्रह की शताब्‍दी के प्रारब्‍ध में ही, सालभर चंपारण सत्‍याग्रह की शताब्‍दी हो, साबरमती आश्रम को सौ वर्ष होने जा रहे हैं, जहां महात्‍मा गांधी ने तपस्‍या की मेरे हिसाब से। और 150 गांधी के 2019 में हमारे सामने हैं। ये ऐसा कालखंड है, जो हम 20वीं सदी के गांधी को 21वीं सदी में जीने का, आधुनिक रूप-रंग के साथ जीने का, नई सोच के साथ जीने का, नये संकल्‍प के साथ जीने का, नई उम्‍मीदों को जगाने के लिए जीने का एक नया अवसर के रूप में ले करके चलने का अगर हम करके चलेंगे, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि वही सच्‍चे अर्थ में कार्यांजलि होगी। श्रद्धांजलि हमने बहुत दी है, श्रद्धांजलि देंगे भी, लेकिन अब आवश्‍यकता है कार्यांजलि की। हमारा संकल्‍प, हमारा परिश्रम उन सपनों को साकार करने के लिए है। हमारी नित्‍य-निरंतर कोशिश है उस कार्यांजलि के द्वारा बापू के सपनों के भारत को हम आंखों के सामने देख सकते हैं। इसी एक भावना के साथ, इस महान अवसर को देशवासी जी करके दिखाएं; इसी एक अपेक्षा मैं सबका बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद करता हूं। 

वंदे मातरम। भारत माता की जय।

                Today we have gathered to commemorate the celebration of one of the greatest events of 20th century. 100 years ago on this very day Gandhiji reached Patna, and started his journey to Champaran. The land of Champaran where the blessings of Lord Buddha's discourse were received, which was a part of the territory that belonged to Mother Sita’s  father Janak; The farmers of that land were in distress. Gandhiji did not just show the way to the farmers, the exploited people and the victims, but made the whole country realize the power of a peaceful Satyagraha.

Friends, the history of our country are not limited to just a few persons or families. Our country's history is broad, comprehensive; a history that re-emerges in new forms and forces us to open our eyes and recognize the glorious cultural tradition of our nation. Some pages of history are such that whenever you come across them, you make something new out of it. It is called the mystical touch - the mystical touch of history. Champaran Satyagraha is such a turning point. Therefore it is imperative that we know such historical events, be connected to them and if possible make an effort to live them.

An exhibition was inaugurated here today; an online interactive quiz was introduced, and a dance drama has also been presented. Such programmes are not just formalities. It is a sacred occasion for us wherein we shall get this opportunity to be inspired by the ideals of Bapu, for dedicating oneself for the cause of the country.

Friends, we should not only pay our homage to Mahatma Gandhi but also dedicate our work to him. The greatest means of doing it is through ‘swachhagraha’ – just as stayagraha which literally means ‘insistence on truth’, swachhagraha means ‘insistence on cleanliness’.

Friends, in the year 1917, while going to Champaran Gandhiji never thought of staying there for long. He did not even know much about the situation in Champaran. However, when he reached Champaran he stayed there for months instead of few weeks. ‘Champaran Satyagraha’ itself transformed Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi into Mahatma Gandhi. He was well versed with the impact of Satyagraha before reaching Champaran. But he knew this very well that just being a satyagrahi was not going to bring the desired results. He wanted to bring the masses under the fold of Satyagraha.

When the Magistrate ordered him to leave Champaran, he disobeyed the order saying that he was disobeying the orders of the Magistrate not to contempt the orders of the court but to uphold the honour of his soul. The entire British government was taken aback when Gandhiji informed about his decision to go to jail instead. The British never had thought of it. The people were witnessing these developments – a barrister who had recently returned from South Africa had readily agreed to go to jail. Moreover, he was happily taking the pain of moving around barefoot or sometimes in bullock cart or by horse-driven cart in the scorching heat.

Notice how Gandhiji was trying to awaken the thought process of the people. The statements of the indigo peasants were being recorded and investigations were being conducted. In the process, Gandhiji was getting connected to the people as well as linking the people among themselves by   setting an example himself.

Gandhiji used to say, ""My life is my mission”. And this is what we have seen in Champaran. Gandhiji wrote in his autobiography how people realized their power and a time came when changes could take place. He wrote that the rule of the British planters, who had been forcing the ‘Tinkathiya system’ of indigo cultivation on farmers, finally had come to an end. The hitherto suppressed masses realized about their internal strengths.

Gandhiji said that it was a misconception of the people, who had lost all hopes that the scars of indigo could never be washed away. He broke all those myths and misconceptions of the people and made them realise about their hidden strengths.

Brothers and sisters, Gandhiji primarily was a ‘Swachhagrahi’. He used to say – “Cleanliness holds far more importance than independence”. He was extremely distressed by the fact that people used to live in unhygienic conditions because of ignorance. During a programme in 1917, Bapu had said that, ""Independence will be of no use till the time we don't change the conditions of the villages and cities, liberate ourselves from bad habits and build better toilets.""

In a way Champaran campaign can be considered as the principal centre for the cleanliness movement. He made cleanliness and hygiene an integral part of Gandhian life-style. His dream was complete cleanliness.

Friends, the efforts at Champaran provided us with the ‘Panchamrit’ or the five nectars. The freedom movement got an impetus by the five nectars derived from unity of the people and their immense struggle.

If we look closely at the efforts made by Gandhiji at Champaran, five nectars can be segregated. These five nectars are significant even today.

The first nectar - the people became acquainted with the power of Satyagraha;

Second nectar - People became familiar with the power of manpower;

Third nectar - A new awakening emerged in the Indian public about cleanliness and education;

Fourth nectar - An attempt was made to improve the status of women;

And the fifth nectar - the thought of wearing the clothes woven with own hands emerged. These are the essence of Panchamrit of Champaran movement.

Friends, when I talk of Champaran, young Mohan or Lord Krishna comes to my mind. On one hand we have Mohan - the holder of Sudarshan-chakra; and on the other hand we have Charkha-spinner Mohan.

We all know that story when Mother Yashoda was very worried because her child had eaten the dirt. With this concern, when she asked Bal Mohan to open his mouth, He had shown the entire universe to Mother Yashoda. By doing this Bal Mohan liberated His mother from anxiety.

When I talk about Champaran, I am also reminded of Mohan in his teenage. When Lord Krishna or Mohan was a teenager, He used to play the flute and used to engage in Rasleela. When Mohan lifted Govardhan Mountain to protect the villagers from the rains, He told the villagers to stand there with their sticks, only then can the Govardhan be lifted. When the mountain was lifted, everyone felt that it was raised because of his own strength. By doing so, young Mohan familiarized the people with their own strengths and collective power.

In this campaign of ‘awakening the people of their strengths’, Bapu made women as equal partners. Seeing the conditions of women in Champaran, he was forced to think that why can’t people themselves make the garments that they wear. He considered it a way of empowerment too. Mahatma Gandhiji's stay at Champaran has also been a major reason behind the development of Khadi.

Friends, Satyagraha under the leadership of Gandhiji gave us freedom, but even after Independence, Gandhiji's dream of a clean India remained incomplete. Even after seven decades we have not been able to get rid of this evil. So, in 2014, when I talked about building toilets in every house from the ramparts of  Red Fort, people were surprised that why was I talking like that.

Friends, Swachh Bharat Mission is the mission to fulfil Bapu's incomplete dreams. This dream has remained incomplete for almost 100 years and we have to complete it together. I am happy that today people of the country have come out to fulfil Bapu's dream through this mission. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, in true sense, has been transformed into a mass movement. Every section of the society is getting connected to this ‘swachhagraha’. When Swachh Bharat Mission was started, only 42 per cent of the rural population used toilets. Today it has increased to 63 per cent.

In the last two and half years, more than one lakh 80 thousand villages and 130 districts have declared themselves open defecation free. Now a competition has started among the states to declare themselves ‘Open Defecation Free states’.

Today Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have been declared as ODF states. Gujarat, Haryana, Uttarakhand and some other states are also moving very rapidly towards declaring themselves as open defecation free. Very soon we will get this news too.

Villages along the Gangetic coast are being made Open Defecation Free on a priority basis. I am glad to announce that the 5 states through which Mother Ganges flows viz. Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, 75 per cent of villages located on the banks of the river have been declared open defecation free. Plans for waste management in the villages located along the river are being implemented so that garbage from the villages is not thrown into the river. I hope that soon the banks along the Ganges will be completely open defecation free.

Brothers and sisters, today there are separate toilets for boys and girls in all government schools. Now chapter on hygiene and cleanliness is being included in their syllabus to teach them about its advantages and disadvantages so that they make hygiene a part of their habits and lives.

Friends, Swachh Bharat Mission has given us another new mantra for our ‘karyanjali’ or work which is Waste to Wealth. The garbage that comes out from the houses, the garbage that is generated during construction work, can also be a way of earning. This can be used to make electricity, manure; it can be recycled and used for construction work. And hence the emphasis is on the Wealth from Waste and we should strive for that.

Different departments of the government are also taking innovative initiatives keeping in mind the convenience of the people to increase sanitation. Technology is also being used for this. You must have seen how fast railways respond as soon as there is a tweet complaining about dirt. Think of the earlier times when dirt on the platform and inside the coaches of the trains was considered part of the system.

Recently, the Petroleum Ministry has launched a mobile app called swachhta@PetrolPump. If the toilets at the petrol pumps are not clean then a complaint can be lodged immediately through this app. This facility will be available for about 55 thousand petrol pumps in the country.

A National Hygiene Centre is also being set up in Delhi now. This centre will help in disseminating all the information related to the cleanliness drive and modern techniques to the people.

Friends, at different levels, from the government to the village, the campaign of Swachhagraha is now spreading in the country, which is unprecedented. Now the mind-set of the people is changing and the realization is dawning on them that the filth should not be spread. Children are pulling up the elders and complaining and taking this campaign forward. The sense that we should not litter and keep the house, the office, road and the city clean around us is emerging. This expression of hygiene itself is ‘Swachhagraha’, the work done for cleanliness is the only ‘karyanjali’ of Bapu.

Friends, Gandhiji wanted to change not only the system but also the values of the system. He has written in his autobiography - ""I want India to recognize that she is not a body, but an immortal soul, which is beyond every single physical weakness and can challenge the combined physical force of the whole world"".

We have to recognize the soul of the country. We have to move forward with this belief that transformation will come. The stronger this thought will be, the more the foundation of New India will be strong. We have to set our goals related to cleanliness and have to make constant efforts to achieve them. There is no reason India's identity should remain as an unclean country. There is no reason our country cannot be clean. There is no reason we cannot fulfil the objectives of the cleanliness campaign. The dream of Mahatma Gandhi's clean, healthy and happy India should be a dream of every Indian. The success of this mission will be a true tribute to Bapu and will be a true work or ‘karyanjali’.

In 2019 Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated. After Gandhiji returned to India in 1915, within two years i.e. by 1917, Mohandas Karammchand Gandhi became Mahatma Gandhi in Champaran. In the Satyagraha of Baradoli, Vallabh Bhai Patel became Sardar Patel. The whole country had followed them. For us Champaran Satyagraha was the turning point that gave impetus to the freedom movement. Today, when we are celebrating the centenary of the event, our resolution for cleanliness is also a journey from Satyagraha to Swachagraha; and both are Gandhiji's contribution. At that time Satyagraha was necessary for freedom, and today Swachagraha is essential for the liberation of the country from filth. And liberation from dirt means the welfare of the poor. If we really want to serve the poor, save them from diseases, and bring changes in their lives, then countrymen, we have to move ahead by taking this mantra of hygiene forward.

Once again, on the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, I wish that it is celebrated the whole year. Sabarmati Ashram is going to be of hundred years, where Mahatma Gandhi, in my opinion, practiced austerity. In 2019 Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated. It is that period, when we will get to live and experience the 20th century Gandhi in the 21st century in a modern form, with new thinking, new resolutions, and with a new hope. I believe that if we move ahead with this new opportunity, it will be ‘karyanjali’ in the true sense. We have been paying tribute and will pay tribute, but now there is a need for paying tribute to work i.e. ‘karyanjali’. Our resolve, our hard work is to make those dreams come true. I wish that we are able to see the India which Bapu dreamt of, through our tireless efforts and ‘karyanjali’. With this very sentiment on this great occasion and with the expectation that this great opportunity shall be utilized by the countrymen; I would like to thank you all very much.

Vande Mataram! Long live Mother India!

                His Excellency Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, 
Members of Media, 

Excellency,

I am delighted to welcome you on your first ever visit to India. Just last month, we witnessed a thrilling conclusion to the Border-Gavaskar trophy. In my speech at the Australian Parliament in 2014 I had spoken of legendary Bradman and Tendulkar. Today, Virat Kohli in India and Steven Smith in Australia are shaping the young brigades of cricket. I hope your visit to India is as productive as it has been for Steven Smith's batting, the other Australian Captain. 

Excellency, 

I vividly recall our meetings on the sidelines of G-20. They have always reflected a strong sense of convergence and purpose. I particularly appreciate your active interest in advancing the substance of our engagement. The journey of our cooperation is firmly on course. Under your leadership, our relationship has touched new milestones. And, your visit gives us an opportunity to shape new priorities in our strategic partnership. 

Excellency, 

The waters of the Indian Ocean remind us of our linked histories. They are also a pointer to our connected destinies. The values and principles of democracy and rule of law are common to both our nations. Today, the vast scope of opportunities in our ties is defined by a strong desire for economic prosperity by 1.25 billion people of India, and Australia's capacities and strengths. 

Friends, 

In our discussions today, Prime Minister and I reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations. We took a number of forward-looking decisions to further strengthen our partnership, including the decision to soon hold the next round of negotiations on our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In a lighter vein I am, of course, glad that our decisions are not subject to the D.R.S. review system.


Friends, 

Both India and Australia recognize the central value of education and innovation in the prosperity of our societies. It is no surprise, therefore, that cooperation in the field of education and research is one of the most important aspects of our engagement. Prime Minister and I have just inaugurated the TERI-DEAKIN Research Centre on Nano and Bio Technology, which is a classic example of the kind of cutting-edge science and technology cooperation that is happening between our two countries. The Australia-India Research Fund of nearly 100 million dollars has focused on collaborative research projects in the areas such as nano-technology, smart cities, infrastructure, agriculture and disease control. Our joint development of bananas fortified with Vitamin A has entered the phase of field trials. Our scientists are also collaborating on developing more nutritious and hardy varieties of pulses. These are just two examples of our outstanding scientific cooperation firmly rooted in tangible outcomes that will improve the lives of millions including our farmers. I also extend a warm welcome to the large delegation of Vice Chancellors and Heads of Vocational Training Institutions that is accompanying Prime Minister. A number of institution-to-institution tie-ups have been concluded during this visit. Student exchanges are an important element of bilateral education cooperation. Australia is home to more than 60,000 Indian students. Increasing number of Australian students are coming to study in India. Responding to the aspirations of India's youth, building world class institutions in India is one of the objectives of my government. Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed ways by which Australian Universities could connect and contribute to this goal. 

Friends, 

Prime Minister and I share a conviction that our economic growth and prosperity must be gentle on the environment. We are happy that our dialogue and cooperation in other forms of energy including renewable energy is on the up-swing. I would also like to thank Prime Minister for Australia's decision to join the International Solar Alliance. And, With the passing of legislation in the Australian Parliament with bi-partisan support, Australia is now ready to export Uranium to India. 


Friends, 

Prime Minister and I recognize that our future is deeply tied to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. We, therefore, agree on the need for a secure and rule based Indo-Pacific. We are also aware that in this globalized world, challenges like terrorism and cyber security, extend beyond the boundaries of our region. And, therefore, require global strategy and solutions. Indeed, Prime Minister's understanding and insight into regional and global issues brings a new dimension to our cooperation on matters that concern us both. Our cooperation in the area of defence and security has reached new heights. Our maritime exercises and exchanges have been productive. Our bilateral mechanisms on counter-terrorism and trans-national crimes are functioning well. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to conclude an MOU on Security Cooperation during this visit. We also agree that strong regional institutions are necessary for peace, prosperity and a sense of balance in our region. We would, therefore, actively work to cooperate more closely with members of the East Asia Summit and the Indian Ocean Rim countries to pursue our common interests. 


Friends, 

A major pillar of strength in our partnership is the connect between our societies. Australia is also home to nearly half-a-million people of Indian origin. Their prosperity and vibrant culture enrich our partnership. A very successful Festival of India called ""Confluence” was held in many cities of Australia last year. I thank Prime Minister for all the help and support accorded to the Festival by the Australian Government. 


Excellency, 

India and Australia have made major strides in our bilateral relations in recent years. In months and years ahead, we only see promise and opportunities for our two nations. Our strong and vibrant strategic partnership is of course important for the security and well-being of our societies. But, it is also a major factor for peace, stability and security in our region. With these words, Excellency, let me welcome you once again to India, and wish you a fruitful and productive stay. 


Thank you. 

Thank you very much.

He will also launch an ‘Online Interactive Quiz’ at the event which is being organized by the National Archives of India.

 

Speaking about the event in a series of tweets, the PM said that the Champaran Satyagraha was a historic mass movement which had a phenomenal impact and he urged the countrymen to become Swachhagrahis and create a Swachh Bharat.
 

“Tomorrow I will join a very special program, 'Swachhagraha – Bapu Ko Karyanjali' to mark 100 years of the historic Champaran Satyagraha.
 

There will be an exhibition showcasing Champaran Satyagraha & it will connect essential principles of Satyagraha with Swachhagraha.
 

The exhibition will also showcase the ground covered by the Swachh Bharat Mission in creating a mass movement towards a clean India.
 

A century ago, Indians became Satyagrahis and fought colonialism. Today, let us become Swachhagrahis& create a Swachh Bharat.
 

Champaran Satyagraha was a historic mass movement led by Bapu. Its impact was phenomenal”, the Prime Minister said.

सभा में उपस्थित अति-विशिष्ट गणमान्य सदस्यों
विशिष्ट अतिथि गणऔर मेरे सभी मित्रों

आज एक विशेष दिन है। आज भारत तथा बांग्लादेश के शहीदों के बलिदान को स्मरण करने का दिन है।बांग्लादेश की स्वतंत्रता के लिए जिंदगी देने वाले योद्धाओं को याद करने का दिन है।बांग्लादेश के स्वाभिमान की रक्षा के लिए लड़ने वाले भारतीय फौज के जांबाजों को याद करने का दिन है। लेकिन ये अवसर बांग्लादेश पर किए गए उस क्रूर प्रहार को भी याद करने का है जिसने लाखों इंसानों की जिंदगी छीन ली।किन्तु साथ ही साथ इतिहास की जो त्रासदी बांग्लादेश पर गुज़री, उस के पीछे की विकराल मानसिकता को नकारने का भी है। आज का ये अवसर भारत और बांग्लादेश के 140 करोड़ से ज्यादा नागरिकों के बीच अटूट विश्वास की strength को पहचानने का है। हम अपने समाजों को कैसा एक सशक्त तथा समृद्ध भविष्य दें इस पर चिंतन करने का भी यह उचित अवसर है।

एक्सेलेंसी,

तथा साथियों कई कारणों से आज का दिन ऐतिहासिक है। बांग्लादेश के स्वतंत्रता संग्राम में शहीद हुए सभी भारतीय सैनिकों के परिवारों के लिए भी ये कभी न भूल पाने वाला क्षण है।आज बांग्लादेश उन 1661 भारतीय सैनिकों का सम्मान कर रहा है, जिन्होंने 1971 में बांग्लादेश की स्वतंत्रता के लिए अपनी जान की क़ुरबानी दी थी ।मैं भारत के सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों की तरफ से बांग्लादेश की प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना जी का; वहां की सरकार और बांग्लादेश के लोगों का; इस भावनात्मक पहल के लिए आभार व्यक्त करता हूं। भारत के वीर सैनिक तथा हमारी गौरवशाली सेना केवल बांग्लादेश के साथ हो रहे अन्याय एवं नरसंहार के खिलाफ नहीं लड़े थे। यह वीर, भारतीय संस्कृति में निहित मानव मूल्यों के लिए भी लड़े थे। यह मेरा परम सौभाग्य है कि इस समय 7 भारतीय शहीदों के परिवार यहां उपस्थित हैं। पूरा भारत आपकी व्यथा, आपका दर्द और आपकी पीड़ा में सहभागी है। आपका त्याग और तपस्या अतुलनीय है।भारतीय सैनिको के बलिदानों के लिए मैं और पूरा देश सभी शहीदों को कोटि-कोटि नमन करते हैं।

साथियों,

बांग्लादेश का जन्म जहां एक नयी आशा का उदय था । वहीं 1971 का इतिहास हमें कई अत्यंत दर्दनाक पलों की भी याद दिलाता है। 1971 में अप्रैल का यही वो महीना था जब बांग्लादेश में नरसंहार अपने चरम पर था। बांग्लादेश में पूरी एक पीढ़ी को खत्म करने के लिए संहार किया जा रहा था। हर वो व्यक्ति जो बांग्लादेश के गौरव से जुड़ा हुआ था, हर वो व्यक्ति जो भावी पीढ़ी को बांग्लादेश के अतीत से अवगत करा सकता था, उसे रास्ते से हटा दिया गया। इस नरसंहार का उद्देश्य केवल निर्दोषों की हत्या करना नहीं था, अपितु बांग्लादेश की पूरी सोच को जड़ से मिटा देना था। लेकिन अंतत अत्याचार विजयी नहीं हुआ । जीत मानव मूल्यों की हुई , करोड़ों बांग्लादेशियों की इच्छा शक्ति की हुई।

साथियों, 

बांग्लादेश की जन्म गाथा असीम बलिदानों की गाथा है। और इन सभी बलिदानों की कहानियो में एक सूत्र, एक विचार कॉमन है। और वह है राष्ट्र तथा मानवीय मूल्यों के प्रति अगाध प्रेम का।मुक्ति योद्धाओं का बलिदान राष्ट्र प्रेम से प्रेरित था। मुक्ति योद्धा मात्र एक मानव शरीर और आत्मा नहीं थे, बल्कि एक अदम्य तथा अविनाशी सोच थे। मुझे खुशी है कि मुक्ति योद्धाओं के लिए भारत की तरफ से भी कुछ प्रयास किए जाते रहे हैं।मुक्ति योद्धा स्कॉलरशिप स्कीम के तहत मुक्ति योद्धाओं के परिवार से 10 हजार से ज्यादा बच्चों को पढ़ने के लिए स्कॉलरशिप दी जाती है। उन के परिवार कल्याण के लिए आज इस अवसर पर मैं तीन और घोषणाएं कर रहा हूं। अगले पाँच वर्षों में मुक्ति योद्धा स्कॉलरशिप स्कीम का फायदा दस हजार और बच्चों तक पहुंचाया जाएगा।मुक्ति योद्धाओं को 5 वर्ष के लिए मल्टीप्ल एंट्री वीसा फैसिलिटी दी जाएगीऔर भारत में मुफ्त इलाज के लिए प्रतिवर्ष 100 मुक्ति योद्धाओं को एक स्पेशल मेडिकल स्कीम के तहत सहायता दी जाएगी।मुक्ति योद्धाओं के साथ साथ बांग्लादेश के लिए किये गए भारतीय फौज का संघर्ष और बलिदान को भी कोई नहीं भुला सकता।ऐसा करने में उनकी एक मात्र प्रेरणा थी, बांग्लादेश की जनता के प्रति उनका प्रेम, और बांग्लादेश के लोगों के सपनों के प्रति उनका सम्मान । और यह भी याद रखना चाहिये की युद्ध की बर्बरता में भी भारतीय सेना अपने कर्तव्य से नहीं मुड़ी और युद्ध के नियमों के पालन की पूरे विश्व के सामने एक मिसाल रखी।भारतीय फौज का यह चरित्र था कि 90 हजार उन कैदी सैनिकों को; (POWs ) को सुरक्षित जाने दिया। 1971 में भारत की दिखाई ये इंसानियत पिछली शताब्दी की सबसे बड़ी घटनाओं में से एक है। दोस्तों, भारत और बांग्लादेश, न केवल क्रूरता को परास्त करने वाले देश हैं, बलिक क्रूरता की मूलभूत सोच को नकारने वाले देश हैं। 

साथियों, 

बांग्लादेश पर चर्चा बिना बंगबन्धु के अधूरी है। दोनों का अस्तित्व एक दूसरे से जुड़ा हुआ है।दोनों एक दूसरे की सोच के पूरक हैं। बंगबन्धु बांग्लादेश की स्वंत्रता के प्रमुख सूत्रधार थे। वह अपने समय से कहीं आगे की सोच रखते थे। उनकी हर एक पुकार जनता की ललकार थी। एक मॉडर्न, लिबरल तथा प्रोग्रेसिव बांग्लादेश का उन का विज़न आज भी बांग्लादेश की उन्नति का मार्ग प्रशस्त कर रहा है।1971 के बाद यह बंगबंधु शेख मुजिबुर्रहमान का ही नेतृत्व था जिसने बांग्लादेश को अशांति और अस्थिरता के दौर से बाहर निकाला था । समाज में मौजूद द्वेष तथा आक्रोश को मिटा कर, महान बंगबंधु ने बांग्लादेश को शांति तथा विकास का एक मार्ग दिखलाया।सोनार बांग्ला के सपने को सच करने की राह दिखाई। भारत की उस समय की युवा पीढ़ी तो उनसे विशेष रूप से प्रभावित थी।और यह मेरा सौभाग्य था कि मैं स्वयं उन के विचारो के ज्ञान से लाभ उठा सका।आज बंगबन्धु को न केवल दक्षिण एशिया में बल्कि पूरे विश्व में शांति और सहअस्त्तिव की स्थापना करने वाले नेता के तौर पर याद किया जाता है।उनकी बेटी, एक्सेलेंसी शेख़ हसीना आज बांग्लादेश की प्रधानमंत्री के तौर पर यहां हैं। इस अवसर पर मैं उनके साहस की भी प्रशंसा करना चाहता हूं। जिस मुश्किल हालात से उन्होंने खुद को निकाला, अपने देश को निकाला, वो साहस हर किसी में नहीं होता। लेकिन वो चट्टान की तरह आज भी खड़ी हैं, और अपने देश को विकास पथ पर ले जाने के लिए काम कर रही हैं।

दोस्तों, 

आज हमारे क्षेत्र को, दुनिया के इस प्राचीन भूभाग को मुख्यतः तीन विचारधाराएं परिभाषित करती हैं। यह विचार धाराएं हमारे समाज तथा सरकारी व्यवस्थाओ की प्राथमिकताओं का आइना हैं। इस में एक सोच है जो आथिक विकास पर केन्द्रित है ; देश को समृद्ध तथा शक्तिशाली बनाने पर फोकस्ड है;समाज के सभी वर्गों को साथ ले कर चलने पर आधारित है।इस सोच का एक प्रत्यक्ष उदाहरण है बांग्लादेश की प्रगति एव उन्नति। 1971 में बांग्लादेश के नागरिकों की औसत आयु (लाइफ एक्स्पेक्टेनसी) भारत से भी कम थी। आज बांग्लादेश के नागरिकों की औसत आयु भारत से भी ज्यादा है। पिछले 45 वर्ष में बांग्लादेश की GDP 31 गुना बढ़ी है।प्रति व्यक्ति आय में 13 गुना की बढोतरी हुई है। इन्फेंट मोर्टेलिटी 222 से घट कर अब 38 रह गई है।प्रति व्यक्ति डॉक्टरों की संख्या में तीन गुना बढोतरी हुई।स्वतंत्रता के बाद से अब तक बांग्लादेश का निर्यात 125 गुना बढ़ चुका है। परिवर्तन के यह चंद पैरामीटर्स अपने आप में काफी कुछ कह रहे है। प्रधानमंत्री शेख़ हसीना के विज़न पर चलते हुए बांग्लादेश आर्थिक प्रगति की नयी सीमाए पार कर रहा है।

साथियों, 

साथ ही साथ एक दूसरी सोच है: सब का साथ; सब का विकास। मेरा यह स्पष्ट मत है कि मेरे देश के साथ ही भारत का हर पड़ोसी देश प्रगति के मार्ग पर अग्रसर हो;अकले भारत का विकास अधूरा है;और अकेले हमारी समृधि अपने आप में सम्पूर्ण नहीं हो सकती। हम इस बात से भी परिचित हैं कि सबका साथ; सबका विकास केवल शांति की आधार शिला पर संभव है। इसलिए हर देश के प्रति हमने सदैव मित्रता का हाथ बढ़ाया है।हर देश को अपनी समृद्धि का सहभागी बनाने के लिए आमंत्रित किया है।स्वार्थी न बनकर हमने पूरे क्षेत्र का भला चाहा है।इस सोच की सफलता का प्रत्यक्ष उदाहरण है भारत-बांग्लादेश के संबंधों का सशक्त graph.और इस से उत्पन्न दोनों समाजो के लिए आर्थिक बेनिफिट्स .हर क्षेत्र में: चाहे आर्थिक, राजनैतिक, इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर बिल्डिंग , इकनोमिक कनेक्टिविटी , एनर्जी सिक्योरिटी, अथवा सिक्योरिटी हो या फिर कई दशकों से लंबित लैंड बाउंड्री तथा मेरीटाइम बाउंड्री का डिस्प्यूट सेटलमेंट का मुद्दा हो .हर क्षेत्र में हमारा सहयोग, परस्पर शांति, साझा विकास, आपसी विश्वास तथा क्षेत्रीय विकास की सोच की सफलता के tangible प्रमाण है

साथियों, 

लेकिन दुःख की बात है कि इन दो विचार धाराओं के विपरीत भी दक्षिण एशिया में एक मानसिकता है। ऐसी सोच जो कि आतंकवाद की प्रेरणा तथा उसकी पोषक है। ऐसी सोच जिस का वैल्यू सिस्टम मानवता पर नहीं अपितु हिंसा, आतिवाद तथा आतंक पर आधारित है । जिस का मूल उद्देश है टेर्रोरिस्ट्स द्वारा टेररिज्म फैलाना। 

एक ऐसी सोच जिस के नीति निर्माताओं को: 

· मानववाद से बड़ा आतंकवाद लगता है।
· विकास से बड़ा विनाश लगता है।
· सृजन से बड़ा संहार लगता है।
· विश्वास से बड़ा विश्वासघात लगता है।

यह सोच हमारे समाज के शांति तथा संतुलन, और उस के मानसिक तथा आर्थिक विकास के लिए सब से बड़ा चैलेंज है। यह विचारधारा पूरे क्षेत्र तथा विश्व की शांति तथा विकास में अवरोधक है। जहां भारत और बांग्लादेश समाज के आर्थिक विकास की थॉट स्ट्रीम्स में सहभागी हैं, वहीं हम इस तीसरी, नकारात्मक विचारधारा के विक्टिम भी है। 

साथियों 

हमारी हार्दिक अभिलाषा है की इस क्षेत्र के सभी देशो के citizens सफलता और समृधि की ओर बढ़ें। और इस के लिए हमारे सहयोग के द्वार सदैव खुले हैं ।लेकिन इस के लिए आतंकवाद और आतंकवादी सोच का त्याग अनिवार्य है ।

साथियों,

भारत-बांग्लादेश संबंध ना सरकारों के मोहताज हैं और ना ही सत्ता के। भारत और बांग्लादेश इसलिए साथ हैं, क्योंकि दोनों देशों के 140 करोड़ लोग साथ हैं। हम दुःख-सुख के साथी है । मैंने हमेशा कहा है कि जो सपना मैं भारत के लिए देखता हूं, वही शुभकामना मेरी बांग्लादेश के लिए भी है।और भारत के हर पड़ोसी देश के लिए भी है। मैं बांग्लादेश के उज्ज्वल भविष्य की कामना करता हूं। एक दोस्त होने के नाते भारत जितनी मदद कर सकता है, वो करेगा।आखिर में, मैं एक बार फिर मुक्ति योद्धाओं को, भारत के वीर सैनिकों को नमन करता हूं। और इस कार्यक्रम के आयोजन तथा उपस्थिति के लिए प्रधानमत्री शेख़ हसीना जी का खास तौर पर अभिनन्दन करता हूँ।भारत सदैव एक घनिष्ठ तथा विश्वसनीय मित्र की तरह बांग्लादेश के साथ हर घड़ी हर सहायता के लिए तैयार है और रहेगा।

जय हिंद- जॉय बांग्ला !!!

                Excellency, 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
Members of the media,

It is a true pleasure to welcome Her Excellency Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India.

Excellency, 

Your visit to India comes at an auspicious time, just before the advent of पोयला बोइशाख. I take this opportunity to wish you and the people of Bangladesh शुवो नबा बर्षो Your visit marks another शोनाली अध्याय (golden era) in the friendship between our people and our nations. The extraordinary transformation in our relationship and achievements of our partnership are a clear recognition of your strong and decisive leadership. Your decision to honour Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the Liberation War of 1971 has deeply touched the people of India. Every Indian takes pride in the knowledge that Indian soldiers and बीर मुक्तिजोधा fought together to liberate Bangladesh from the reign of terror.

Friends, 

Today, Excellency Sheikh Hasina and I held productive and comprehnsive discussions on the full range of our partnership. We agreed that the agenda of our cooperation has to remain focused on purposeful action. We specifically looked at charting new avenues and tapping fresh opportunities in advancing our relationship. We want to build cooperation in new areas, especially some high-technology areas, that have a deeper connect with the youth in both our societies. These would include working in the fields of Electronics, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Space exploration, Civil Nuclear Energy, and others areas.

Friends,

India has always stood for the prosperity of Bangladesh and its people. We are a long-standing and trusted development partner of Bangladesh. India and Bangladesh are also determined that the fruits of our cooperation must benefit our people. In this context, I am happy to announce a new concessional Line of Credit of 4.5 billion dollars for the implemntation of projects in priority sectors for Bangladesh. This brings our resource allocation for Bangladesh to more than 8 billion dollars over the past six years. Energy Security is an important dimension of our development partnership. And, our energy partnerhship continues to grow. Today, we added an additional 60 Mega Watt of power to the 600 Mega Watt of power already flowing from India to Bangladesh. The supply of another 500 Mega Watt has already been committed from the existing inter-connection. We have also agreed to finance the diesel oil pipeline from Numaligarh to Parbatipur. Our companies are entering into a long-term agreement for the supply of high speed diesel to Bangladesh. We have also agreed on a time table for regular supply till the pipeline is constructed. We are encouraging private sectors in both our countries to enter this space. Several agreements for investments in the energy sector in Bangladesh are expected to be signed by the Indian companies in the coming days. India will continue to be a willing partner in meeting the energy needs of Bangladesh, and its goal of achieving ‘Power for all by 2021’.

Friends,

Connectivity is crucial for the success of bilateral development partnership, sub-regional economic projects and for the larger regional economic prosperity. Today, together with the Honourable Chief Minister of West Bengal , we have added several new links to our growing connectivity. Bus and train links between Kolkata and Khulna, and राधिकापुर-बीरोल have been restored today. In-land water-ways routes are being optimized. And, steps are being taken to put into operation the Coastal Shipping Agreement. We are also happy to see the progress being made in two-way trans-shipment of goods. We look forward to early implemntation of the B.B.I.N. Motor Vehicles Agreement. This would usher in a new era of sub-regional integration.

Friends,

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and I recognize the need to diversify our commercial engagement. Not just to forge wide-ranging business partnerships between our two economies. But also for greater regional benefit. In this, a major part of the effort has to be from the business and industry of the two countries. We are happy to receive the high powered business delegation accompanying the Prime Minister. Our agreement to open new Border Haats will empower border communities through trade and contribute to their livelihoods. 

Friends,

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and I have noted the success of our capacity building and training initiatives. The training of 1500 Bangladesh civil servants in India has almost concluded. We would undertake training along similar lines for 1500 Judicial Officers of Bangladesh in our judicial academies. 

Friends,

While our partnership brings prosperity to our people, it also works to protect them from forces of radicaliztion and extremism. Their spread poses a grave threat, not just to India and Bangladesh but to the entire region. We have the greatest admiration for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s firm resolve in dealing with terrorism. Her Government’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy towards terrorism is an inspiration for all of us. We agreed that peace, security and development for our people and for the region will remain central to our engagement. Today, we have also taken a long overdue step by signing an agreement on close cooperation between our armed forces. I am also happy to announce a Line of Credit of US dollars 500 million to support Bangladesh’s defence related procurement. In implementing this line of credit, we will be guided by Bangladesh’s needs and priorities.

Friends,

Our two countries share one of the longest land boundaries. During my visit to Dhaka in June 2015, we had concluded the Land Boundary Agreement. Its implemntation is now underway. Along with our shared land boundaries are our shared rivers. They sustain our peoples and their livelihoods. And, the one that has attracted the greatest attention is the Teesta. This is important for India, for Bangladesh and for India-Bangladesh relationship. I am very happy that the Chief Minister of West Bengal is my honoured guest today . I know that her feelings for Bangladesh are as warm as my own. I assure you and the people of Bangladesh of our commitment and continuing efforts. I firmly believe that it is only my government and Excellency Sheikh Hasina,your government, that can and will find an early solution to Teesta Water Sharing.

Friends,

Bangabandu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a dear friend of India and a towering leader. As a mark of our respect and deep admiration for the father of Bangladesh, a prominent road in our capital city has been named after him. We have also agreed to jointly produce a film on the life and works of Bangabandhuwhich will be released on his birth centenary year in 2020. Along with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji, I am also honoured to release the Hindi translation of Bangbandhu’s ‘Unfinished Memoirs’. His life, struggle and contribution to the creation of Bangladesh will continue to inspire future generations. To mark the Golden Jubilee Year of Bangladesh’s independence in 2021, we have agreed to jointly produce a documentary film on the Liberation War of Bangladesh.

Excellency, 

You have successfully carried forward the vision and legacy of Bangabandhu Today, under your leadership, Bangladesh is marching on a trajectory of high growth and development. We in India rejoice in our ties with Bangladesh. Ties that have been forged in blood and generations of kin-ship. Ties that seek a better and secure future for our people. With these words, Excellency, I once again welcome you and your delegation to India.

Thank you.
Thank You very much

                Brothers and sisters,

 

Today I have got the privilege of coming to the land of Santhals. This is the land of brave sons like Bhagvan Birsa Munda, Chand Bhairav, Nilambar-Pitambar. I salute this land and heartily greet the brave citizens of this land. Today on the land of Sahibganj seven development projects are being inaugurated. I believe that for the first time since independence so many schemes are being launched in a single programme for the development of this region. There is one way of solving the problems of my poorest of the poor tribal brothers and sisters and for the welfare of the Santhal region so as to transform their lives. That solution is development. Faster the rate of development of this place, the more successful we will be in changing the lives of common man here. Today an extremely important programme is being taken up and that is connecting Jharkhand and Bihar. The bridge with an investment of 2200 crore rupees will not only connect the two states above the river Ganga, but also will open up new possibilities of development. With this bridge you will be getting the opportunity of connecting directly with eastern India.

I congratulate the people of Bihar and Jharkhand as the foundation-stone is being laid for this important bridge. Nitin Gadkari ji is a Minister who is known for getting the work done on time. Therefore, I am sure that he will get the work done by the date fixed for its inauguration. This work will not remain pending. You can imagine the opportunities for employment it will create for the youngsters. They can easily return to their homes in their own district if they want. This will provide employment along with skill development. A person becomes even more efficient and skilful than an engineer when he works on a project for 2 to two and a half years. Several youngsters of this region will gain this strength by working on this project. In the future, if any such project comes up in Jharkhand or Bihar or any other region, then preference for manpower will be from this region and these youngsters will get an opportunity to work at an enhanced remuneration. Such is the strength of this project. The greatest strength of these projects is that of the manpower. There is a need for development of manpower with skill development.

My best wishes are with the youngsters here. A great opportunity is knocking at your door. You too should be determined to work hard and increase your ability. Once your capabilities expand, the world will start asking for experienced youngsters like you. This is the change that is going to occur. Today I got the opportunity to inaugurate another programme too and that is the road constructed between Sahibganj and Govindpur. Earlier it used to take 10 hours, 12 hours or 14 hours to reach Govindpur from here. With the construction of this new road, you can now reach in just 5 or 7 hours. Your life has received such a great momentum with this. This has brought such a big change in your lives. This is not just a road passing through the Santhal region but it is opening up new opportunities for development in the lives of poorest of the poor resident of the Santhal region. This is bringing the goal of development closer. Hence, there are several roads for transportation but this road is not just for transportation but this is a way to move towards development. It will transform the face of Santhal region. This is my strong belief.

Brothers and sisters,

We address our rivers as mother. Mother gives us everything but sometimes it is said that even mothers don't give us something unless we ask for it. Mother Ganges has been fostering the whole region for centuries. It is flowing in the form of its lifeline. But mother Ganges can give us new strength in this changing era. In the 21st century, mother Ganges can connect Jharkhand to the world directly and we are working in that direction. Have you ever thought about it that the cities that are situated on the sea shore are automatically connected to the world; but can a landlocked region like Jharkhand which does not have a sea around it also be connected to the world? Nitin Gadkari ji is working on a project with his heart and mind and it is going to be one of the greatest projects. On the completion of this project, Jharkhand will be directly connected to the world. It is the Multi Modal Terminal Project, the foundation-stone for which is being laid today. Ships will move from here to the Bay of Bengal, carry the goods and the goods can directly reach the world through Bay of Bengal. When such facilities are available for world trade then Jharkhand can make its mark in the world trade, be it the stone chips or the coal of other yields of Jharkhand. This will create a capacity to directly connect to world market. Moreover, if one wants to carry the goods from this region to the western part of India after the system becomes operational, not necessarily one has to use road or rail transport. One can carry goods via coastal route along the Bay of Bengal. It will be cheaper. It will help in making the workers of this field financially stronger.

Brothers and sisters,

There has been a lot of efforts and thinking on highways in our country during Atal ji's time. Two significant contributions were made to the infrastructure of our country during that period. There are several other contributions but I am mentioning just two. First, connecting the country with the golden quadrilateral gave it a modern outlook. The second one is Pradhanmantri Grameen Sadak Yojana which, in a way, provided every village with arterial network of roads. During his governance, a great work was accomplished. The governments that came later have also been continuing with that scheme. This was the second contribution by Vajpayee ji.

Brothers and sisters, when it comes to infrastructure, we talk about road and railways. We have made highways and constructed airports for the aeroplanes. We have worked towards expansion of Railways. But we are facing a challenge in one area. The present government has taken a decision under the leadership of Nitin Gadkari ji to transport cargo through inland waterways. Under this, a system is being developed to transport cargo between Varanasi and Haldia. Jharkhand is being connected to the Bay of Bengal. Ships will start from here. We have seen small boats on these rivers but now we will also see ships carrying thousands of tons of cargo in these rivers. Now you can imagine the new field of development that is emerging. We had Highways, Railways and air ways; but now we are also developing waterways. The waterways are being inaugurated today. Investments of about thousands of crores will be made. This campaign is being renewed in India and hence is going to be appreciated. The economists are going to write on it and discuss about it in the future. This is an environment friendly infrastructure which is being promoted in India. The environment is also being protected along with development and expansion of transportation network. This work is being done by Nitin Gadkari Ji's department. Mother Ganges is providing everything. This new gift from Mother Ganges is opening up a new path of development. Therefore, we are highly indebted to mother Ganga.

Brothers and sisters,

Today I congratulate the Chief Minister of Jharkhand Shri Raghubar Das Ji for taking this extremely important step for Santhal region's farmers and animal-rearers. This step is towards the dairy sector. If an animal rearer gets an assured price for his milk then he will definitely be engaged in animal husbandry. Today he does animal husbandry to fulfil the need of milk for his family or sells some of it in the neighbouring areas. But he doesn't understand the commercial model of this profession. After the milk is produced by the poor farmer or animal rearer, a huge chain can be formed by value addition to the milk produced. I have come from the land of Gujarat. Amul is famous in that area. Amul has penetrated every corner of the country. A small cooperative was formed under the direction of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Some farmers started this work by pooling in milk. Gradually it started developing and today it is known as Amul all over the world. Today Raghubar Das is going to lay the foundation-stone of that dairy for the poor farmers and animal rearers of Santhal region. This dairy will ensure right price for their milk through processing, marketing and branding. He is working in that direction. My best wishes are with him. Gujarat has a good experience in the dairy sector. If Jharkhand needs assistance from Gujarat I will ask them to help you so that it helps the farmers and the animal rearers of this region. This is because sometimes landholding is often small but if animal husbandry is strong then it supports them. I would like to appeal to the Chief Minister that just like he has worked towards developing the dairy sector, he can also develop the honey industry. An animal rearer can also develop honey through apiculture. Honey can be collected and a global market for honey can be created. Our farmers can earn from milk, honey as well as agriculture. They can have an assured income for 12 months in a year. I am sure Raghubar Das ji is far-sighted even if it might appear as a small thing right now. It appeared as a small thing even when the cooperative was formed by the inspiration of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. But now it has become world renowned. Raghubar ji has started this small work. I can clearly see its future strength. I believe that this will play a major role in transforming the fate of the Santhal region and of the animal rearers and the farmers.

Brothers and sisters,

On 2nd October 2015, I got the privilege of visiting Khunti on an invitation of Justice DN Patel. The court at Khunti is the country's first solar court. The court works on solar power.

Today I am glad that once again a government complex and the second court in Sahibganj are going to become fully operational with the help of solar energy. For this I want to congratulate Justice DN Patel and his entire team as well as the Government of Jharkhand. They have promoted solar energy. They have taken the responsibility of promoting rooftop solar energy by installing about 4500 kilowatt solar energy successfully. If we want to save our forests and leave something for our future generations then we should protect our environment. One of the excellent sources of energy is the solar energy and India is progressing towards the direction of solar energy. India has a dream of achieving 175 Giga watt of renewable energy in which 100 Giga watt will be by the solar energy. It saves us a lot of money that we usually have to spend on purchasing energy from other countries. That money will be used for the welfare of the poor. The environment will also be saved from damage. There was a time when one unit of solar energy used to cost 19 rupees. But India has undertaken such a campaign that the Solar Energy is cheaper than the coal energy today. Just now the tender that was out was of only 3 Rupees or 2 Rupees 96 Paise. This means we just need to pay for the investment cost and after that the electricity can be obtained without any cost.

Brothers and sisters,

In the 21st century no one can be compelled to live in darkness. There are several families today that are not taking electricity connection. They feel there is no need for the same. They take it only after a lot of persuasion. Even when the government provides electricity for free, they are indifferent. For the progress of the children of such families the government has taken steps to provide small bulbs that can run on solar batteries and can be fixed on the ground or table and used for studying. For a farmer, electricity costs a lot for pumping out water from the ground. Now they are using solar pumps to pump out water from the ground. The battery will also get charged with the solar energy and water can also be pumped out simultaneously. The field will also be green with the harvest. Now he will start growing 3 crops instead of 2 crops. The Solar pumps will also help to double the income of the farmers. The Indian government is revolutionizing the field of solar energy. The Government of Jharkhand has also taken the responsibility to walk hand in hand with the Government of India. Solar energy and rooftop solar energy projects are being promoted. For this I congratulate the Government of Jharkhand. I would also like to tell my countrymen to be sensitive towards energy issues. We should understand the importance of energy and protection of our future. Now a nation-wide campaign for LED lights is being run. If any government in a budget announces its decision to distribute 10 thousand crore rupees then everyone will be happy. The people will praise Modi ji and it will become the headline in the newspapers that 10 thousand crores are going to be distributed among the people. Friends, we have done something with your cooperation that more than 10 thousand crores Rupees will go straight to your pockets. What did we do? Install LED bulbs and save electricity. Your electricity bill will be reduced. Some of you will save Rs.250, some will save Rs.1000 and some Rs.2000 annually. That amount will be helpful in feeding milk to the poor children. When we came to power, the LED bulbs used to cost Rs.350-400. The same bulbs now cost Rs.60. And about 22 crore bulbs have been distributed by the government in the entire country. Some people have themselves purchased these bulbs and now 50 crore new LED bulbs have been installed in the homes of the people. The amount of money saved on electricity bills for this is more than 11 thousand crore rupees. This amount will be saved by the people who have saved electricity. A small step can turn into a revolution. In a way we are making a 360 degree network by saving electricity on one hand and using solar energy on the other. You are going to benefit out of it.

I can see some youngsters in front of me. They are wearing caps with yellow flowers. They are looking fabulous! They are the children of Aadim race of Pahadiya society. They have till date not got the opportunity to work in the government. Kindly have a round of applause and I congratulate Raghubar Das ji for his new initiative and for selecting these Pahadiya children. He amended government rules. He compromised on their height and educational qualification. He provided them training and assigned them the job of security-men. In a way they have become a part of the government. Brothers and sisters, Pahadiya children are among those Indians who are considered to be the most backward. The Pahadiya daughters are now being brought to the mainstream. They are now being linked to the mainstream of development. When these daughters had come to collect their certificates I was sure after looking at their body language, their way of saluting, their way of speaking to the media and their confidence, that they are going to make us proud. My friends of Pahadiya community are going to be a new strength of Jharkhand by providing security. Kindly have another round of applause and feel the pride. You people should congratulate Raghubar Das ji for this important work. In the community that is poor and even more backward than the tribal people, who could not get the opportunity to go to school for generations together, are present before us today. I am really delighted due to this. My life is blessed today by looking at these children. They are going to be the foundation of my India. This is my new India. This is an example of how every poor person of the country will be involved in the journey of development India.

Brothers and sisters,

Some women had appeared on the stage today. I am not sure whether you could see them from that distance but on behalf of the Government of Jharkhand I was giving them mobile phones. I also observed that they were giving correct answers to my questions. They know what an app is, what the Bhim app is, how to download the app and how to use it for monetary transactions through the mobiles. I was feeling extremely happy. My friends in the Parliament were asking me that how the poor of India will understand the working of a mobile phone and how to operate it. I will definitely tell my friends when I meet them in Parliament that I had been to the most backward Santhal area of the country where my tribal sisters were teaching me the use of mobile phones. This is revolution. This is digital India revolution. This is a revolution of a less cash society. After the demonetization everybody is thinking of making their mobile phones as their banks. The head of small Sakhi Mandals will have a mobile phone, that phone will be connected to a bank and the phone to the customers. This is going to be a revolution. I congratulate the sisters of the Sakhi Mandals of Santhal region. I have one experience of the past which inspires me even today. This was when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. There is a village of tribal people in Southern Gujarat named Kaparada. I was the Chief Minister at that time but I did not get time to visit that place earlier because no such opportunity ever came to me. There was not even a field to organize a meeting. The entire region was covered under forest. The houses were scattered. But then I decided to go. There we started a dairy farm and established a chilling centre for cooling the milk. It is a place where the milk is stored for 2 to 4 hours before being carried to the dairy. It is a small project and costs 25 to 50 lakhs. I said that I would come for that project. So everyone was disappointed. They asked me whether I really wanted to go for a 50 lakh programme! I insisted that I wanted to go. It was very difficult to hold public meeting there. It was arranged in a school ground 3 to 4 kilometres away. But some women had come with their utensils filled with milk to the chilling centre. The programme was successful. After that I saw that those women kept their utensils aside and took out their mobile phones to click my photo. There were about 30 women and everyone had a mobile phone and that too with a camera feature. They were clicking pictures. I went to them. It was a big wonder! I asked them - what are you doing? They said - we are clicking your photos. I asked- what will you do by clicking the photos? They said- we will get them downloaded. I was surprised to hear the word 'download' from them. Sometimes the high class people are unaware of the fact in that even the common people have the strength of learning Modern Technology and Science. Once again today I heard from my tribal sisters who said that - we will be the part of Digital revolution. We are determined to do this job. I congratulate the Government of Jharkhand for starting this digital campaign by making the Sakhi Mandals - the soldiers of this revolution through mobile phone connectivity. The era has changed and we have to move in this direction of a changed era.

Brothers and sisters,

The poor of India wants to live with dignity. India's tribal people, the Dalit, the suppressed and the exploited want to live with dignity. He doesn't want anyone's grace. The young man is saying that he needs the opportunity and he can write his own fortune. This is the strength of the children of my poor tribal people, suppressed and the exploited. I am using all my strength for these children and youngsters so that they make efforts to change the fate of their country, of India.

Brothers and sisters,

Corruption has destroyed the country like a termite. If cleared at one place, it emerges in another place; if cleared in that place, it emerges in yet another place. But with your blessings, we will continue this fight. Those who have robbed the poor of their wealth will have to return that to them. Till that happens I am not going to be at peace. I will take one step after another. Therefore, brothers and sisters keep blessing me for this fight for integrity and honesty. After demonetisation I got an opportunity to interact with a few youngsters who were well educated and belonged to wealthy families. I thought that they would be worried and annoyed because of demonetization but they told me something interesting. They said that once they told their father - in your period the rules of the government were different and tax rates were also high, so even you had to get into corruption. But now an era of honesty has arrived in our country. And the people of our generation do not want to be in a dishonest affair. We want to live in peace and lead an honest life. An era of honesty has begun in our generation. A desire to live honestly has emerged. If the country’s youth have this mind-set that we will not do what our ancestors or parents had to do, this is a good sign for me and my country.

Brothers and sisters,

We can lead a happy and peaceful life even without looting and robbing. We can sleep with contentment. Therefore, we should move towards an era of honesty. The year 2022 will mark 75 years of India's Independence. Brothers and sisters, 75 years of Independence will not just be a date on the calendar but it means that the people like Birsa Munda who belonged to this region and others who laid down their lives for the country's freedom. Why did they do this? They had dreamt of an independent India and therefore they had sacrificed their lives. They went to the gallows to fulfil their dreams. They had spent their lives in the prisons for us. Can't we give 5 years, I am just asking for 5 years, to the country's service? We will contribute something or the other for the country. This should be the dream of country's 125 crore citizens. 125 crore countrymen should have 1 resolution that till 75 years of independence, for which we have 5 years in our hands, we should do something for the society. India can move 125 crore steps ahead by the year 2022 if every Indian moves one step ahead with this resolution. This is our strength, friends. Therefore, the need of the hour is that we should take a resolution that by 2022 we will have to reach our destination whether we are in a government department or in a Nagar Palika or in a Nagar Panchayat or in a school or in a village or a mohalla or in a family. If every Indian makes it a dream then by 2022 we can see the India which will satisfy the souls of the great personalities that our country is moving on a right direction; the country for which they had sacrificed their lives. We should move ahead with the dream of 'my country is moving ahead'. With this hope, I once again salute the land of Jharkhand. I salute the land of Birsa Munda. I congratulate these Pahadia youngsters. My best wishes to the people of Jharkhand. We have started this campaign by seeking the blessings of mother Ganga. In this region we will bring an economic revolution and with this belief and hope I thank you all. My best wishes to you all.

भारत माता की      जय

भारत माता की      जय

भाइयो, बहनों नवरात्रि का पावन पर्व चल रहा है और मुझे मां के चरणों में आने का ये अवसर मिला है, ये मेरे लिए सौभाग्‍य है। अभी नीतिन गडकरी जी बता रहे थे कि विश्‍व के जो मानक है उस मानक के अनुरूप इस सुरंग का निर्माण हुआ है। उन्‍होंने कहा कुछ बातों में विश्‍व के मानकों से भी कहीं-कहीं हम एक कदम आगे हैं। मैं नीतिन ग‍डकरी जी को, उनके विभाग की पूरी टीम को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, अभिनंदन करता हूं। उन्‍होंने आधुनिक technology का उपयोग करके, समय-सीमा में इस कार्य को पूरा करने में सफलता पाई है। लेकिन भाइयो, बहनों, ये सिर्फ लम्‍बी सुरंग नहीं है। ये जम्‍मू और श्रीनगर को दूरी कम करने वाली सिर्फ लम्‍बी सुरंग नहीं है। ये लम्‍बी सुरंग जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के लिए विकास की एक लम्‍बी छलांग है, ऐसा मैं साफ देख रहा हूं।

भाइयो, बहनों, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में तो इस Tunnel की चर्चा होगी ही, लेकिन मुझे विश्‍वास है कि दुनिया के जितने पर्यावरणवादी हैं, Climate Change, Global Warming की चिंता जताते हैं, चर्चा करते हैं; उनके लिए भी ये सुरंग का निर्माण एक बहुत बड़ी खबर है, बहुत बड़ी नई आशा है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के किसी और कोने में अगर ये सुरंग बनी होती तो पर्यावरणविदों का ध्‍यान जाने की संभावना कम थी। लेकिन हिमालय की कोख में ये सुरंग बिछा करके हमने हिमालय की रक्षा करने का भी काम कया है, हमने पर्यावरण की रक्षा करने का काम किया है, Global Warming से परेशान दुनिया को भारत ने संदेश दिया है कि हिमालय की छाती में ये सुरंग बना करके, हिमालय की प्राकृतिक रक्षा करने का एक महत्‍वपूर्ण प्रयास सफलतापूर्वक आज हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सरकार ने पूरा किया है।

भाइयों, बहनों, ये Tunnel हजारों करोड़ रुपयों की लागत से बनी है। लेकिन मैं आज गर्व से कहता हूं, भले, भले इस Tunnel के निर्माण में भारत सरकार के पैसे लगे होंगे, लेकिन मुझे खुशी इस बात की है कि इस सुरंग के निर्माण में भारत सरकार के पैसों के साथ जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के नौजवानों का पसीने की उसमें महक आ रही है। ढाई हजार से ज्‍यादा युवकों ने, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के 90 प्रतिशत जवान जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के हैं; जिन्‍होंने काम करके ये सुरंग का निर्माण किया है। रोजगार की कितनी संभावनाएं उपस्थित हुई, ये हम अंदाज कर सकते हैं।

और भाइयो, बहनों, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के जिन नौजवानों ने इन पत्‍थरों को काट-काट करके सुरंग का निर्माण किया, एक हजार दिन से ज्‍यादा दिन-रात मेहनत करके वो पत्‍थरों को काटते रहे और सुरंग का निर्माण करते रहे। मैं कश्‍मीर घाटी के नौजवानों को कहना चाहता हूं, पत्‍थर की ताकत क्‍या होती है; एक तरफ कुछ भटके हुए नौजवान पत्‍थर मारने में लगे हैं, दूसरी तरफ उसी कश्‍मीर के नौजवान पत्‍थर काट करके कश्‍मीर का भाग्‍य बनाने में लगे हैं।

भाइयो, बहनों, ये सुरंग कश्‍मीर घाटी के Tourism का एक नया इतिहास रचने के लिए अपनी ऐतिहासिक भूमिका अदा करने वाली है। यात्री, Tourist असुविधाओं की खबरों से परेशान हो जाता है। पटनीटोप पर हिमवर्षा हुई हो, 5 दिन रास्‍ते बंद हो गए हों, Tourist अटक गए हों तो दुबारा Tourist आने की हिम्‍मत नहीं करता है। लेकिन भाइयो, बहनों, अब ये सुरंग के कारण कश्‍मीर घाटी में यात्री के रूप में देश के कोने-कोने से जो लोग आना चाहते हैं; उनको इन संकटों का सामना नहीं करना पड़ेगा, सीधे-सीधे वो श्रीनगर पहुंच पाएंगे।

मैं कश्‍मीर घाटी के लोगों से कहना चाहता हूं, ये सुरंग उधमपुर-रामबन के बीच भले हो, लेकिन ये कश्‍मीर घाटी की भाग्‍य-रेखा है; ये कभी भूलना मत। ये कश्‍मीर घाटी की भाग्‍य-रेखा इसलिए है कि कश्‍मीर घाटी का मेरा किसान भाई प्राकृतिक आपदाओं के बीच दिन-रात पसीना बहाता है, खेतों में काम करता है, बगीचे में काम करता है। आवश्‍यकता के अनुसार पर वर्षा हुई हो, मौसम आवश्‍यकता के अनुसार रहा हो, फसल बहुत अच्‍छी हुई हो, फल दिल्‍ली के बाजार में बेचने के लिए निकलने वाले हों, लेकिन यहीं पर पांच दिन सड़क बंद हो गई हो तो आधे से ज्‍यादा फल उसके बरबाद हो जाते हैं। दिल्‍ली पहुंचते-पहुंचते पूरी मेहनत की कमाई पानी में मिल जाती है। कश्‍मीर घाटी के किसानों के लिए ये सुंरग बरदान बनके आई है। जब वो अपनी फसल, अपने फल, अपने फूल, अपनी सब्‍जी निर्धारित समय में दिल्‍ली के बाजार तक आसानी से पहुंच पाएगी; उसको जो खर्च घाटा होता था वो घाटा अब नहीं होगा; ये लाभ कश्‍मीर घाटी को मिलने वाला है।

भाइयो, बहनों, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का हर नागरिक, उसके मन में एक सपना रहता है; कभी न कभी तो कश्‍मीर देखना है। वो Tourist बन करके इन वादियों में आना चाहता है। और जो Infrastructure का काम हमने उठाया है, उससे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के कोने-कोने से टूरिस्‍टों को आने की सुविधा बढ़ने वाली है, Guaranteed Tourism होने वाला है और जितना ज्‍यादा  Tourism बढ़ेगा, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर की आर्थिक स्थिति पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में सबको पीछे छोड़ करके आगे निकल जाएगी; ये मेरा विश्‍वास है।

भाइयो, बहनों, मैं घाटी के नौजवानों से कहना चाहता हूं, आपके सामने दो रास्‍ते हैं जो आपके  भाग्‍य को किस दिशा में ले जाएंगे? एक तरफ है Tourism, दूसरी तरफ है Terrorism. 40 साल हो गए अनेक निर्दोष लोगों ने अपनी जान गंवाई, किसी का फायदा नहीं हुआ; अगर लहुलुहान हुई तो मेरी अपनी प्‍यारी कश्‍मीर घाटी हुई है। अगर कोई लाल खोया है तो मेरी कश्‍मीर की मां का लाल हमने खोया है, कोई हमने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का लाल खोया है।

भाइयो, बहनों, ये खून का खेल 40 साल के बाद भी किसी का भला नहीं कर पाया है। लेकिन इसी 40 साल में अगर Tourism को बल दिया होता, तो आज पूरी दुनिया कश्‍मीर की घाटी के चरणों में आ करके बैठी होती, ये ताकत कश्‍मीर की घाटी में है। और इसलिए Tourism की ताकत को हम पहचाने, Tourism को बल देने के लिए जो भी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं खड़ी करनी हों; दिल्‍ली में केंद्र सरकार कश्‍मीर के साथ है; जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के साथ है; यात्राओं को बढ़ावा देने के लिए आपके साथ खड़ा है।   

मैं महबूबा जी को विशेष रूप से अभिनंदन करता हूं, मैं उनको बधाई देता हूं, उनका साधुवाद करता हूं। पिछले वर्ष भारत सरकार ने जो 80 हजार करोड़ रुपये का जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के लिए package घोषित किया, मुझे खुशी है इतने कम समय में आधे से अधिक बजट का खर्च, package का खर्च जमीन पर कार्यरत हो गया है; ये छोटी बात नहीं है। वरना package कागज पर रह जाते हैं, जमीन पर उतरते-उतरते सालों बीत जाते हैं। लेकिन महबूबा जी और उनकी सरकार ने हर बारीकी को ध्‍यान देते हुए, चीजों को जमीन पर उतारने के लिए जो कड़ी मेहनत की है और जिसके फल नजर आ रहे हैं; मैं इसके लिए जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर की सरकार, मुख्‍यमंत्री, उनकी मंत्रिपरिषद, उन सबको हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।

भाइयो, बहनों, आज हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में प्रति व्‍यक्ति आय, अगर तेज गति से आय बढ़़ाने के लिए सबसे उपयुक्‍त कोई राज्‍य है, तो उस राज्‍य का नाम जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर है। मैं इसकी ताकत को भलीभांति समझ पाता हूं। मुझे कई वर्षों तक इन वादियों में संगठन के कार्य के लिए आने-जाने का, रहने का अवसर मिला है। यहां के दिलदार लोगों को मैं जानता हूं। यहां की सूफी परम्‍परा की संस्‍कृति को जानता हूं।

भाइयो, बहनों, इस अनमोल विरासत, अगर हम उसको भूल जाएंगे तो हम हमारे वर्तमान को खो देंगे, और हम हमारे भविष्‍य को अंधेर में धकेल देंगे। ये भूमि हजारों साल से पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का मार्गदर्शन कर सके, ऐसी महान विरासत की भूमि है। उसके साथ अपने-आप को जोड़ें, उसका गौरव करें और परिश्रम से हम अपना भविष्‍य बनाने के लिए सरकार के साथ कंधे से कंधा मिला करके आगे चलें; देखते ही देखते जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर का जीवन बदल जाएगा।

भाइयो, बहनों, जब भी जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर की बात आती है, हर कश्‍मीरी के दिल में, हर जम्‍मूवासी के दिल में, हर लद्दाखवासी के दिल में अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी का नाम हमेशा याद आता है। कश्‍मीरियत, इंसानियत, जम्हूरियत- इस मूलमंत्र को ले करके, जो मूलमंत्र अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जी ने दिया है; उसी मूलमंत्र को ले करके हम कश्‍मीर को विकास की नई ऊंचाइयों पर, सद्भावना के वातावरण को, भाईचारे के वातावरण को, नौजवानों के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य के लिए हम मजबूती के साथ, मजबूत इरादे के साथ एक के बाद एक कदम उठा करके आगे बढ़ने के लिए कृतसंकल्‍प हैं; कोई बाधा हमें रोक नहीं पाएगी। और जो सीमा पर बैठै हैं वो खुद को नहीं संभाल पाते।

भाइयो, बहनों, हम सीमा पार के सीमा पार के हमारे कश्‍मीर के हिस्‍से के नागरिकों को भी प्रगति करके दिखाना चाहते हैं कि देखिए कश्‍मीर कैसे विकसित होता है। और जिन लोगों ने आप पर कब्‍जा जमा करके बैठे हैं उन्‍होंने आपको कितना बर्बाद किया है ये हम करके दिखाने वाले हैं। विकास यही हमारा मंत्र है, विकास के मंत्र को ले करके जाना चाहता हूं। जन-भागीदारी हमारा रास्‍ता है, उस रास्ते पर हम चलना चाहते हैं। युवा पीढ़ी को साथ ले करके आगे का भविष्‍य बनाना चाहते हैं।

भाइयो, बहनों, अभी एक सुरंग अगर कश्‍मीर की भाग्‍यरेखा बन जाता है, घाटी के किसानों के जीवन को बदल सकता है, घाटी में Tourism को बढ़ावा दे सकता है। भविष्‍य में ऐसी नौ सुरंग बनाने की योजना है,  नौ। पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के साथ ऐसा जुड़ाव हो जाएगा और ये सिर्फ रास्‍तों का network नहीं होगा, ये दिलों का  network बनने वाला है, ये मेरा विश्‍वास है।

भाइयो, बहनों, विकास की यात्रा को हम आगे बढ़ाएं। जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर के नौजवान इस इलाके के भाग्‍य बदलने के लिए भारत की सरकार के रोजगार की योजनाओं का फायदा उठाएं; शिक्षा के जो नए-नए क्षेत्र यहां मौजूद हैं, उसका फायदा उठाएं; विकास की नई ऊंचाइयों को पार करें। और मेरे जम्‍मू के भाई, इस जम्‍मू क्षेत्र का विकास भी तेज गति से हो रहा है।

Smart City की दिशा की बात हो, हृदय योजना हो, अमृत योजना हो, शिक्षा के क्षेत्र की बातें हों, Infrastructure तैयार करना हो, यहां तालाब की पुनर्रचना हो, हर क्षेत्र में; चाहे लद्दाख हो, घाटी हो या जम्‍मू हो, एक संतुलित विकास हो और इस विकास का फायदा पूरे जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर की भावी पीढ़ी को मिलता रहे, इसकी तैयारियां करते चलें, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर को आगे बढ़ाते चलें; इन सपनों को ले करके आज आगे जाना है।

मैं फिर एक बार नीतिन जी को, उनकी टीम को, डॉक्‍टर जितेन्‍द्र सिंह जी को, जम्‍मू-कश्‍मीर की सरकार को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।

                This longest tunnel of India has been inaugurated today, the ceremony is being performed by me but I want all the citizens present here today to jointly inaugurate the tunnel and I tell you the way to do this thing. 

All of you please bring out your mobile sets and all of you should together turn on the flash lights while hailing the victory for mother India (Bharat Mata Ki Jay). See! All the cameramen are taking your pictures now! All of you who have mobiles please bring them out, please turn on your flash lights. What a wonderful sight! I see this wonderful sight before me. You people have really inaugurated the tunnel by turning on the flash lights of your mobile phones. The entire country is watching this. 

Bharat Mata Ki Jay. 

Bharat Mata Ki Jay. 

Brothers and sisters, the holy festival of Navratri is going on and I’m fortunate that I got the opportunity to pay my obeisance at the feet of mother goddess. 

Nitin Gadkari Ji told us just now that the tunnel has been constructed as per the global standards. He has informed that in some cases we have surpassed the global standards. I offer my respect, my heartfelt congratulations to Nitin Gadkari Ji and his entire team. He has successfully completed the work of this tunnel in the stipulated time by using the modern technology. But brothers and sisters, this is just not a tunnel. This tunnel hasn’t just reduced the distance between Jammu and Srinagar. But, I can clearly see that this tunnel is a giant leap for the development of Jammu and Kashmir. 

Brothers and sisters, in any case, this tunnel will get the due attention in India, but I’m also confident that all the environmentalist of the world, who are concerned about the climate change and global warming, the construction of this tunnel is a big news for them, it will give them a new hope. Had this tunnel was being built in any other corner of the country then there was a possibility of receiving less attention. However, we have also protected the Himalaya by constructing the tunnel through it. We’re protecting the environment. India has conveyed the message of protecting the Himalaya to the world that is worried over global warming. The government of India has successfully completed the important task of protecting the environment of Himalaya. 

Brothers and sisters, this tunnel has been built at a cost of thousands of crores of rupees. But today I can say this thing with pride though it’s true that Government of India has incurred the expenditure for construction of this tunnel but I’m happy that the smell of the sweat of the hard work of the youth of Jammu and Kashmir along with the money spent by Government of India. More than 2,500 youth, more than 90% of the total 2,500 youth who worked for the construction of the tunnel are from Jammu and Kashmir. We can think about how many opportunities for employment have been created. 

And brothers and sisters, the youth of Jammu and Kashmir those who have hewed these stones to construct the tunnel they kept working day and night for more than thousand days to construct the tunnel. I’d like to tell the youth of Kashmir Valley about the power of the stone; there are some misguided youth who have been engaged in the stone pelting and there are some other youth from Kashmir are busy making their future by cutting the stones. 

Brothers and sisters, this tunnel is going to play its historic role in creating a new history for the tourism in the Kashmir valley. A traveler, a tourist gets worried after getting the news about poor facilities. If there is a hailstorm at the Patnitop that closed the roads for five days, if the tourists are stuck then they don’t have the courage to visit again. But brothers and sisters, the tourists from every nook and corner of the country, those who want to visit Kashmir valley as a tourist, will not face any problem now due to this tunnel, they will be directly able to reach Shrinagar. 

I’d like to say one thing to people of Kashmir valley: it’s true that the tunnel is being constructed between Udhampur and Ramban but please never forget one thing that this tunnel is the line of fortune for Kashmir valley. 

Why this is the line of fortune for Kashmir valley because my brother farmers from Kashmir valley work very hard amidst the natural calamities, he tills the land and works in orchards, even if there is a good rain as required, even if the weather was favorable and there was a bumper crop but if there is incessant rain for five days when he was about to leave for Delhi to sell his produce and half of his produce will perish here only if the road is blocked for five days. And his entire hard work will be wasted by the time he reaches Delhi. This tunnel has come as a boon for the farmers of Kashmir valley. Now he can take his produce, his flowers and fruits, and his vegetables to Delhi very easily. Now he won’t incur the loss as was the case earlier, this is the benefit for the Kashmir valley. 

Brothers and sisters, every citizen of India has a dream to visit Kashmir at least one. He wants to visit these valleys as a tourist. And the work of development of infrastructure taken by us is going to facilitate the tourists from across the country to come here. It’s certain that the tourism will grow and the more the tourism grows I’m confident that the economy of Jammu and Kashmir will surpass the rest of India in terms of economic growth. 

Brothers and sisters, I’d like to tell the youth of Jammu and Kashmir that there are two ways before them to decide their destiny. On one hand is tourism and on the other terrorism. It’s been forty years, several innocent people lost their lives but no one benefitted from it, if anything has been deeply wounded then it is the Kashmir valley. If someone is being killed then we have lost of the son of a Kashmiri mother, we have lost the son of an Indian mother. 

Brothers and sisters, this bloodbath has not benefitted anyone in the last forty years. However, had anyone focused on tourism in these forty years then the entire world would submit itself before Kashmir valley, this is the strength of Kashmir valley. Therefore we should recognize the strength of tourism, whatever facilities are required to strengthen it; central government in Delhi is with Jammu and Kashmir for that; we are with you to encourage the tourism. 

I offer my kind regards to Mehbooba Ji, I congratulate her and I appreciate her. This is not a mean achievement that half of the special package of Rs. 80 thousand crore announced by the government of India for the state of Jammu and Kashmir last year has been implemented on the ground in such a small time. 

Otherwise most of the packages remain on paper and it takes years to implement them. However, Mehbooba Ji and her government have carefully worked very hard to implement it on the ground and its results are there for anyone to see. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the government of Jammu and Kashmir, to the chief minister, to her council of minister for this thing. 

Brothers and sisters, today, if there is one state capable of rapidly increasing the per capita income of its people then it’s Jammu and Kashmir. I’m very well aware about its strength. I had the opportunity to visit and stay in these valleys for several years for the organization work. I’m aware about the large hearted people of this place. I’m aware about the Sufi culture of this place. 

Brothers and sisters, if we forget this invaluable legacy then we will lose our present and will completely destroy our future. This land belongs to that legacy that was able to guide India for thousands of years. We should associate ourselves with that legacy, we should take pride in that and we should move ahead with the government to make our future brighter by means of hard work. It will very soon change the fortune of Jammu and Kashmir. 

Brothers and sisters, whenever the issues of Jammu and Kashmir are discussed, then every Kashmiri, everyone from Jammu, everyone from Laddakh remembers Atal Bihari Bajpayi’s name. We are committed to take Kashmir’s development, the environment of harmony, the atmosphere of brotherhood to a new height, we are committed to take continuous steps for the welfare of the youth of Kashmir by following the mantra given by Atal Bihari Bajpayi Ji, and no obstacle can stop us. And people sitting on the other side of the border are not even able to take care of themselves. 

Brothers and sisters, we also want to demonstrate it to the other side of the Kashmir across the LoC how the Kashmir will be developed. And we are going to show them that those people who have subjugated them how they have ruined them. Development is our motto and people’s participation is our way and we want to follow that path only. We want to make a brighter future by taking the young generation along with us. 

Brothers and sisters, if one tunnel becomes the line of fortune for Kashmir then it can change the lives of farmers of Kashmir, it can boost terrorism in the valley. We have plan to construct 9 such tunnels in the future. It will connect you with the entire India and it will not only be a network of roads but it is going to connect hearts as well, I’m confident of this thing. 

Brothers and sisters, we should take the journey of development forward. The youth of Jammu and Kashmir should take advantage of employment schemes of government of India to change the fortune of this region. They should take advantage of the new sectors of education in this area; they should scale new heights of development. And my brothers from Jammu; this Jammu region is also witnessing rapid development. 

Whether it is Smart City scheme, or be it Hriday Yojana or be it Amrit Yojana, or the schemes in the education sector or be it development of infrastructure or be it rejuvenation of ponds, in every sector be it Laddakh or the Valley or Jammu, every region should be developed in balanced manner and this development should benefit the future generation of the entire Jammu and Kashmir, we should move forward with this preparation, we should take the development of Jammu and Kashmir forward; we should move forward with these dreams. 

I once again congratulate Nitin Ji, his entire team and to Dr. Jitendra Singh Ji and also to the government of Jammu and Kashmir. Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today dedicated India’s longest road tunnel, the 9 kilometre long Chenani-Nashri Tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir, to the nation. 

The Prime Minister travelled the entire length of the tunnel, and was briefed on some of its key features. 

Addressing a public meeting in Udhampur, the Prime Minister said that the tunnel is world-class, and matches the best standards. He said the tunnel is environment-friendly and will help in the fight against global warming. He said that while some misguided youngsters were pelting stones, the youth of Kashmir were cutting stones to create infrastructure. He said the tunnel would also boost tourism, which will bring economic growth. 

The Prime Minister said that violence and terrorism can never help anyone. He thanked the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, and said that work had begun on the package that the Union Government had announced for the State. 

Recalling the vision and work of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government's sole mantra is development, and this could be achieved through people’s participation.

                The dignitaries present on the stage,

In a way it marks the conclusion of the Sesquicentennial Celebrations. But the completion of this celebration that was going on for the past one year could prove to be a source of new energy, new inspiration, new resolution and help in achieving the dream of a new India. The existence of Allahabad High Court in the world of Judiciary is 150 year old and I believe that Allahabad is India's pilgrimage centre in the field of Judiciary. I feel proud and privileged to have got the opportunity to be present in such a pilgrimage centre and to listen to you and to share my thoughts with you all.

The Chief Justice Sahib was talking his heart out and I was listening to him. I could feel the pain in his every word and I feel the need to do something to address it. I believe that this leadership will help to fulfil the resolutions of the Judges of India. I assure that the government is with you and will make every effort to help you fulfil the responsibilities. When the Allahabad High court had completed 100 years, the then President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan was present here and had expressed a few thoughts. I would like to read one paragraph from that speech which was delivered 50 years ago and reiterate the ideas.

Dr. Radhakrishnan ji had said, ""Law is something that constantly changes, laws should be in line with the nature of people, adapted to the traditional values, and also the law should take into account the modern trends and challenges. All these things should be taken into account while reviewing the law. What kind of life do we want to lead? What is the law? What is the ultimate goal of law? The welfare of all people is not just the welfare of the rich people; rather it is the welfare of every citizen of the country. This is the goal of the law and we should strive to achieve that.""

 

I think that Dr. Radhakrishnan ji had given a vital message to the judges and the rulers of this country 50 years ago from the same land and it is equally relevant and praiseworthy today.

Gandhiji used to say as to how to be sure if a decision is right or wrong. What is the criterion for it? So, Gandhi had specifically told the government that whenever you make a decision and are in a dilemma, always think about the marginal person of this country and the impact of that decision on that person's life. If the impact is positive then you must go ahead with that decision.

How can we make this idea a part of our lives?  How to make it a purpose of our lives which can become a wind of change?

Before independence, the lawyers or the people from the field of Judiciary in Allahabad in particular and the entire India in general had given a push to the freedom movement. They used to inspire crores of people to become fearless by fighting against the British Empire. This generation of freedom fighters who later turned into politicians mostly had a background of law. They led the freedom movement and also the governance system after independence. It was everyone's dream to see the country free. Without this dream, it would have been impossible to get freedom. One of the specialities of Gandhiji was that he had awakened the desire for independence in the heart of every Indian. The sweeper used to think that his work is for achieving freedom, if someone was engaged in education, he had a similar thinking. Similarly if someone was wearing khadi, he used to think that it was for the country. He had instilled this zeal within every Indian as per the individual's capacity. Today I am in a place like Allahabad which had strengthened the struggle for freedom.

We have completed 70 years of Independence. 75 years of Independence will be completed in the year 2022. Can Allahabad inspire the country? Could the obsession, the renunciation, the immense hard-work and  labour that had inspired the countrymen during the freedom struggle be rekindled in the 125 crore people in these 5 years so as to fulfil the vision of elevating India to newer heights by the year 2022 when we reach 75th year of independence? Every individual may have a resolution, a roadmap for the year 2022. If every citizen does this, I believe that no citizen should doubt about the results.

There is a tremendous strength in the 125 crore countrymen, our institutions, our government and society. Today while we are celebrating the completion of 150 years, we should move ahead with the resolution of doing something for the welfare of our country on the principles of Dr.Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi, in whichever field we are. I believe that the dream which our Chief Justice has, you all have the same fire within you. This fire can prove to be an energy that can bring a change within the country. I invite the countrymen from this platform to frame a resolution that the dreams that our freedom fighters had, we should strive to fulfil them with our efforts by the 75th year of independence. I believe that the dream of 125 crore Indians and one step of 125 crore Indians will take the country forward by 125 crore steps. Such is their power. We should put efforts in this direction to strengthen this further. The era has changed.

While I was campaigning for 2014 elections, many people of the country didn't know me. I did not have any identity. In a small programme, I was interviewed. I had said- ""I don't know how many new laws will I frame; but I will definitely end one law every day if I become the Prime Minister. I want to reduce the burden of these laws that have been imposed by the governments on the common man."" Even the Chief Justice was wondering how to come out of it. The government was also thinking about reducing the burden. Today I am glad that we have abolished about 1200 laws, more than 1 law per day, before the completion of 5 years of our coming to power. A more simplified system and lesser burden of laws will make the judicial system more efficient. For achieving this, the role of technology in today's era is indispensable. Just now the Chief Justice was saying that there is no need of a document, the file will move automatically within a fraction of a second. With the Digital India initiative, the government has strengthened the judicial system with the use of ICT - Information and Communication Technology. The work has been simplified. There was a time when the judges would have to look into the books very minutely for hours for every case.

Today's lawyers don't have to work so hard. They just have to ask 'Google guru' and the Google guru answers instantly, like it was the case of 1989; this was the matter and such and such person was the Judge. Technology has simplified everything. The entire community of lawyers has obtained such a great strength that has improved the quality of debates with state-of-the-art information system. Arguments can be supported with the help of technology. It will bring sharpness and the quality, not for the dates but for solving the issues. I believe that when there is sharpness in the debates before the judges, it won't take much time to find out the truth. This will expedite the judicial process. How to use technology at every stage? Today the dates are being assigned by physically going to the court. When will the process of giving dates through SMS begin?

 

Today, suppose an officer works in some city. Suppose a case is going on for which his presence is required; but he is transferred.  Then for attending the hearing why should he leave his job and the city to go back to the previous city? Can't we provide a facility of video conferencing? They can be interrogated in a short time. In this way, their time can also be utilised for the governance. Everyone knows the process, taking the prisoners to the court, huge expenditure in the security and so on.

Now Yogi ji has come to power. This might stop. We can reduce a lot of expenditure and time if we can connect the jails to the courts through video conferencing. We can bring simplicity in the entire process. The Government of India has tried to ensure that our judicial system gets the full benefit of modern ICT Technology.  It should be prioritized. I wish to appeal to the youngsters with start-ups to bring new innovations for the country's future judicial system. They should also strengthen the country's judiciary with the help of technology. I believe that with the help of technology and innovation, the country's judicial process will be expedited. If we try in all four directions, we will complement each other and will obtain the desired results certainly.

Once again, my best wishes to Dilip ji, his entire team, honourable Judges and my friends on the completion of 150th year of this journey. I believe that we should move ahead with the dreams for the 75th year of independence in the year 2022 and we should strive to fulfil the resolutions as soon as possible leaving no stone unturned. We should strive to take our nation to newer heights and make every effort to fulfil the dream of new India by the new generation. With this one expectation I am very grateful to all of you.

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the valedictory ceremony of the Sesquicentennial Celebrations of the Allahabad High Court. 

Speaking on the occasion, he said the Allahabad High Court is like a place of pilgrimage for our judiciary. He said those associated with the legal profession also played a vital role in our freedom struggle, and protected our people against colonialism. 

He urged people to think about the India we want to create when we mark 75 years of freedom in 2022. He said every citizen should prepare a roadmap towards it. 

The Prime Minister said that about 1200 obsolete laws have been scrapped by the Union Government since May 2014. He said technology is playing a key role in this century and there is a lot of scope for its use in the judiciary as well. He urged those involved in the startup sector to innovate on aspects where technology can help the judiciary.

Smart India Hackathon भारत में अपनी तरह सबसे बड़ा experiment है। जिस देश की जनसंख्‍या में 65 प्रतिशत लोग 35 वर्ष से कम उम्र के हों, जो देश दुनिया का युवा देश हो, वहां की युवा शक्ति आज; इस वक्‍त अपने समाज, अपने देश की कुछ अहम समस्‍याओं का solution निकालने में जुटी हुई है। अपना innovation दिखाने के लिए, अपनी creativity दिखाने के लिए आप सब; सारे नौजवान, जिस जोश के साथ कार्यक्रम में हिस्‍सा ले रहे हैं, वो प्रशंसा के योग्‍य हैं। 15 घंटे लगातार काम करने के बाद भी इस वक्‍त आपके चेहरों पर शिकन नहीं है। आपके चेहरों पर मुस्‍कान मैं देख रहा हूं। जब ऐसी ऊर्जा, ऐसे जज्‍बे के साथ काम किया जाता है, तभी नतीजे मिलते हैं। 

दोस्‍तों, ज्ञान के क्षेत्र में हमारे देश की अपनी एक पहचान रही है; आज से नहीं, हजारों वर्षों से। कहते हैं शून्य का अविष्‍कार भारत में ही हुआ। आज IT Knowledge के क्षेत्र में भारत विश्‍व का नेतृत्‍व कर रहा है। शून्‍य से मंगलयान की मंगल यात्रा का सफर हमें गौरवान्वित करता है। उपनिषद से उपग्रह तक हमारी यात्रा विस्‍तृत हुई है। लेकिन ये भी सच है कि आज भारत को अपन जरूरतों, अपनी समस्‍याओं को सुलझाने के लिए Information Technology के और ज्‍यादा इस्‍तेमाल की आवश्‍यकता है। एक प्रकार से आज का समाज Technology Driven है। Innovation, Technology, ये समाज जीवन को गति दे रहे हैं, ऊर्जा दे रहे हैं। और इसलिए इस Hackathon के लिए MyGov. की मदद से ऐसी लगभग 500 समस्‍याओं को चुना गया है, जिसका समाधान खोजा जाए, युवा मनों के द्वारा खोज जाए, आधुनिक Technology के द्वारा खोज जाए। इन समस्‍याओं को आपके सामने समाधान के लिए रखा गया है। आपके लिए चुनौती भी है, अवसर भी है। और इस काम से मुझे विश्‍वास है कि आप अपनी Exam के लिए कोई Job work करें, उससे जो आनंद मिलता है, उससे ज्‍यादा आनंद आपको आपके इस काम से मिलेगा। क्‍योंकि जब काम पूरा होगा, और आपको लगेगा कि किसी गरीब के काम आने आपकी मेहनत आने वाली है। आप जो solution खोज रहे हैं वो शायद हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सरकार की नीति-रीति का हिस्‍सा बनने वाला है। तो आपका जीवन अपने-आप में धन्‍यता अनुभव करेगा। 

लोकतंत्र की सफलता जन भागीदार से भागीदारी से ही है। लोकतंत्र का मतलब ये नहीं कि वोट डाल दिया और किसी को 5 साल का Contract दे दिया, लो जाओ भाई मेरी समस्‍या दूर कर दो। और 5 साल में न कर पायें तो कह दिया जाये चलो अब अगला Contractor को पकड़ेंगे; लोकतंत्र ये नहीं है, लोकतंत्र जन-भागीदारी का है। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों ने देश को मिल करके आगे बढ़ाना है। सब कुछ सरकार को ही पता है, सारी समस्‍याओं को हल सरकार ही कर पाएगी, उसके पास सारे उपाय हैं; ये भ्रम है। सरकार में भी तो आप ही की तरह लोग आ करके बैठे हैं। सब समस्‍याओं का समाधान हम सब मिलकर ही कर सकते हैं। जो सरकार में नहीं हैं उनके पास भी अनेक अच्‍छे सुझाव होते हैं, बुद्धि-प्रतिभा होती है, काम करने के लिए एक मूड होता है। और इ‍सलिए मेरी हमेशा कोशिश है कि जन-भागीदारी से कैसे चीजों को आगे चलाया जाये। और आज का ये अवसर, देश के दस हजार नौजवान Engineering Profession होगा, IT Profession होगा, वे जुट करके हमारी रोजमर्रा की 500 समस्‍याओं का समाधान खोज रहे हैं। बिना खाये-पिए, बैठे, लगे हैं; ये एक अपने-आप में एक नई ताकत का परिचय करा देगा। और इसलिए सबसे पहले तो इसमें हिस्‍सा लेने वाले, मैं आप सभी को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, आप सबका अभिनंदन करता हूं। 

आज जब आप अपनी ऊर्जा को Governance के Process में Channelize करेंगे तो निश्चित तौर पर बहुत सकारात्‍मक नतीजे मिलेंगे। मेरा हमेशा से मानना रहा है कि Technology के माध्‍यम से, Information Technology के माध्‍यम से हम आज के समाज में बहुत बड़ा बदलाव ला सकते हैं। Technology हमें ऐसे-ऐसे solution देती है, जिसके बारे में कुछ वर्षों पहले तक सोचा भी नहीं जा सकता था। किसने सोचा था कि कभी सड़कों पर driver-less कारें चलने लगेंगी? आने वाले समय में Artificial intelligence का फैलाव और भी बढ़ने जा रहा है। 3D Technology की मदद से 3 Dimension Object की Printing, और उसके ऊपर आने वाले भविष्‍य के निर्माण, 3D Technology उसका एक बहुत बड़ा आधार स्‍तम्‍भ बनने जा रही है। 

Manufacturing Sector में, even मकानों के design में इसका बहुत बड़ा उपयोग होने वाला है। अब तो दौर “Internet of things” का है। एक ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था बन रही है जहां काफी कुछ “Internet of things” से ही तय होगा। आज देश में जो शहर Smart City में परिवर्तन किए जा रहे हैं, वहां इस Technology का जमकर इस्‍तेमाल किया जा रहा है, चाहे Smart Parking हो, Smart Lighting हो, Air Quality की Monitoring हो; इनमें “Internet of things” को apply किया जा रहा है। 

दोस्‍तों Technology आज की जिंदगी में बहुत बड़े बदलाव कर रही है। कुछ नई चीजें, नई परम्‍पराएं, पैदा हो रही हैं; कुछ पुरानी चीजें, पुराने तरीके खत्‍म हो रहे हैं। आप खुद देखिए, आपके सामने ही Floppy, Tape Recorder, Walkman, ये सारी चीजें आईं और चली गईं; खत्‍म हो गईं। लम्‍बा, लम्‍बे तक तो वो टिकी नहीं; नई Technology ने जगह ले ली। एक जमाना था जब रेडियो, आज के जो Microwave Oven होते हैं, उतनी size का हुआ करता था। और आज रेडियो, माचिस की डिब्‍बी में भी फिट हो सकता है। Technology ने दुनिया को छोटा करने के साथ ही सुविधाओं का विस्‍तार और बढ़ाने में मदद की है। आपने देखा होगा कि पिछले कुछ महीनों में कैसे हमारे देश में Cashless Transaction का प्रसार तेजी से बढ़ा है। और इस क्षेत्र में भी लगातार नए Innovative Solutions सामने आ रहे हैं। 

दोस्‍तों Innovation ही बेहतर भविष्‍य का आधार है। इतिहास उन लोगों के द्वारा लिखा जाता है, जो चली आ रही परम्‍पराओं को चुनौती देते हैं, उनमें बदलाव लाते हैं। इसके लिए एक और बात बहुत जरूरी और वो है Perseverance, दृढ़ता, लगातार जुटे रहना। बचपन से हम लोगों को, कई कथाएं आप लोगों ने भी सुनी होंगी; कहते हैं कि वो चींटी अपने खाना ले जा रही थी, Sugar का दाना, और ले जाते, ले जाते कितनी बार उससे छूट गया, नहीं ले जा पा रही थी, ऊपर दीवार चढ़नी थी लेकिन आखिरकार ले जाकर ही वो रुकी। एक चींटी भी लगातार कोशिश करने की प्रेरणा का कारण बन जाती है और इसलिए हमें भी इस बात को याद रखना है कि Innovations के रास्‍ते में कई बार आपको असफलता मिल सकती है। लेकिन आपको हार नहीं माननी और इसलिए जो जीत का संकल्‍प ले करके चलता है वो जूझना भी जानता है और जो जूझना जानता है वो जीत कर को पाने का तक मादा भी रखता है। आप सफल होंगे, उस दिन इसी दुनिया के लोग कहेंगे कि आपका रास्‍ता सही था, आपके Method सही थे। लेकिन इस दौरान एक बात का अवश्‍य ध्‍यान रखिए कि आपके Innovation का End Product है Quality. 

Quality से किसी प्रकार का समझौता नहीं होना चाहिए, नहीं किया जा सकता। Quality ऐसी चीज है जिसे लोग याद रखते हैं। आपके Innovation से, आपके Product से लोगों की जिंदगी, Quality of Life में जो बदलाव आता है वह महत्‍वपूर्ण है। दोस्‍तों आप सभी जितने Innovative हैं, जितने Energetic हैं; देश की, समाज की समस्‍याओं को सुलझाने के लिए आपकी जो Approach है वो New India को और मजबूत करने वाली है। जैसे तकनीक पहले की अपेक्षा कई गुना तेजी से बदल रही है, वैसे ही आज की Generation पहले की अपेक्षा कई गुना तेजी से सोचती है, काम कर रही है। कुछ लोग कहते हैं कि आज का नौजवान सवाल बहुत पूछता है, ये कोई खराब बात नहीं है, ये तो अच्‍छी बात है। आज का युवा, कोई Baggage लेकर चलता है और हर बात को शुरूआत से समझना चाहता है, अपने नजरिए से देखना चाहता है। कुछ लोग ये भी कहते हैं कि आज के युवा में धैर्य नहीं है। मैं कहता हूं कि यही बात तो आज की पीढ़ी के नौजवानों की और उनके अंदर Innovation के लिए प्रेरणा का कारण बन जाती है। जीवन में धैर्य होना चाहिए, अधीर जीवन नहीं चल सकता है, लेकिन ऐसा भी धैर्य न हो कि जो नया सोचने के लिए प्रेरित न करे; ठहराव ले आए। और इसी वजह से वो ज्‍यादा तेजी से काम कर रहे हैं, और मैंने देखा है ऐसे नौजवान नतीजे भी ला करके रहते हैं। कुछ लोग ये भी कहते हैं कि आज का युवा Monotonous work नहीं चाहता, उसे वो पसंद नहीं है; वो बदलाव चाहता है। मैं मानता हूं कि उसकी यही सोच है जो Automation में नये-नये आइडिया ला रही है। अगर वो भी पुराने ढर्रे में जीरा चाहता तो, तो नया कहां मिलता? जो पुराना तोड़़ करके निकलना चाहता है वो ही तो नया देता है। कुछ लोग ये भी कहते हैं कि आज का युवा एक ही समय पर कई काम एक साथ करना चाहता है। कुछ लोगों को लगता है कि ये कोई ऐसे अपना फालतु समय बर्बाद करता है। लेकिन मैं कभी-कभी जिन युवकों में ऐसी विधा होती है, एक, सात, पांच, दस चीजें अपने-आप एक साथ कर लेते हैं; मैं इसे बुरा नहीं मानता। अब Multitasking के लिए अपने-आप को तैयार करना चाहिए। हर किसी ने कोशिश, और जो करता है उसे प्रोत्‍साहन देना चाहिए। कुछ लोगों को नौजवानों की Ambition से भी Problem हो जाता है। वो कहता है आज का नौजवान बहुत तेजी से आगे बढ़ना चाहता है। दोस्‍तों में आगे बढ़ने के पक्ष में हूं लेकिन कुछ लोग कम समय में धन इकट्ठा करने के लिए आगे दौड़ते हैं, वो शायद ही जीवन में सफल होते हैं। कुछ कर दिखाने के लिए जो आगे दौड़ते हैं, तेजी से दौड़ते हैं, समय से पहले कर लेते हैं, वो खुद को भी कुछ देते हैं, दुनिया को भी कुछ देते हैं। और यही तो New India की जब मैं बात करता हूं, तो इसी spirit को ले करके कर रहा हूं। 

मेरे भारत का युवा समस्‍याओं के समाधान जल्‍दी खोजना चाहता है, उन्‍नति ये जल्‍दी चाहता है और मैं इसे अच्‍छा मानता हूं। आज का युवा किसी की नौकरी करने से ज्‍यादा खुद ऐसा बनना चाहता है, जो दूसरों को रोजगार दे सके। निश्‍चित तौर पर इसमें Capital की जरूरत तो होती है, लेकिन उससे भी अहम है Purpose of Life, Sense of Mission, जिसकी हमारे युवाओं में कोई कमी नहीं है। वो अपने Ideas को, अपने Innovative Solutions को इस तरह जमीन पर उतारना चाहते हैं कि चीजें और efficient और Economically Viable हों। आप जैसे लाखों-करोड़ों नौजवानों की इस अद्भुत क्षमता को ही ध्‍यान में रखते हुए सरकार “Start-up India” अभियान चला रही है। मुद्रा योजना के तहत आप जैसे करोड़ों युवाओं को Bank Guarantee की चिन्‍ता से मुक्‍त करते हुए करोड़ों रुपयों का कर्ज दिया जा रहा है। 

दोस्‍तों, सपने देखने की क्षमता हर किसी में होती है। आप इतने लोग यहां बैठे हैं, हर दिन कोई नया सपना देखने वाले लोग होंगे। सपने देखने की क्षमता हर किसी में होती है। सपनों को संकल्‍प में बदलने की क्षमता होनी चाहिए। और संकल्‍प को सिद्ध करने के लिए सारी क्षमताओं को झोंक देना चाहिए। कुछ लोग ऐसे भी होते हैं जिनके सपने, संकल्‍प और सिद्धि अनेक लोगों की प्रेरणा का कारण भी बनते हैं। आपने IT की दुनिया में ही देखा होगा कि कई बड़े-बड़े Innovations की शुरूआत किसी एक छोटे से कमरे में, किसी गैराज में बहुत छोटे स्‍तर पर हुई थी। लोगों ने शुरू में उन्‍हें खारिज कर दिया था, लेकिन ऐसे लोग अपने सपने को, अपने संकल्‍प को, पूरी ताकत से जुट करके सिद्ध करने में जुटे रहे, सफल भी रहे। कभी जिन Ideas को बहुत छोटा समझा गया वो आज Billion Dollar की कम्‍पनी चला रहा है। इसलिए आप सभी को मेरी सलाह है, आपके सामने लम्‍बा समय है, आपको बहुत कुछ करना है। अपनी Journey में किसी Idea को यूं ही खत्‍म मत होने दीजिए। हो सकता है आपको ऐसा ही कोई Idea कल Billion Dollar की कम्‍पनी में बदल जायें और Billion लोगों की जिंदगी में बदलाव का कारण भी बनें। 

दोस्‍तों, आपको आज की तेजी से बदलती दुनिया में Knowledge और Skill के बीच का फर्क भी समझना होगा। दोनों में बहुत बड़ा फर्क है। Knowledge है किसी Concept को समझना, Basic चीजों को समझना; जैसे ये जानना कि Electric Circuit कैसे काम करता है, लेकिन Skill है इस Concept को Apply कैसे करना। बहुत से लोग होंगे जिन्‍होंने Electronics या Electrical Engineering पढ़ी होगी, लेकिन घर में अगर Fuse उड़ जाये तो उसे ठीक करने के लिए बाहर से किसी को बुलाता है। Knowledge को Sharpen करके उसे Apply करना ही Skill है। इसलिए आज जितनी तेजी से जानकारी बढ़ रही है, उतनी ही तेजी से Skill का भी बढ़ना आवश्‍यक है और इसलिए मैं कहता हूं Skill Engagement Optimization (SEO), Internet की दुनिया Search Engine की धूरी पर घूमती है और इसलिए उसमें Search Engine Optimization की बड़ी भूमिका होती है। 

आपकी हमारी दुनिया Public Welfare और Public Participation की धुरी पर घूमती है, इसलिए उसमें Skill Engagement Optimization की बड़ी भूमिका होती है। और दुनिया ऐसे लोगों को चाहती है जो Knowledge करे Apply करना जानते हैं, जो अपनी Skill के जरिए लोगों से, Client से Engage हो सके। जब आप लोग Skill Engagement Optimization पर ध्‍यान शुरू कर देंगे, देश को Demographic Dividend भी Development Dividend में बदलेगा। New India के लिए रास्‍ता और मजबूत करेगा। 

दोस्‍तों, आपको जो Task दिया गया है, अगले कुछ घंटों में आप उसका कोई न कोई Solution सजाने जा रहे हैं, लेकिन हमें सिर्फ इतने पर ही नहीं रुकना है। इस कार्यक्रम में केंद्र सरकार के 29 Ministries हिस्‍सा ले रहे हैं। और उन सभी को जिम्‍मेदारी है कि इस Hackathon से जो Solution निकलेंगे, उसे आखिरी Stage तक, Logical End तक पहुंचाया जाये। कुछ सुधार की गुंजाइश हो तो उसमें सुधार करके उसे system में उतारा जाये। आज के प्रयास में आप सफल हों, कुछ नया Solution दें, इसके लिए सभी को मेरी बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं।

                My dear friends you have been working since morning, you must be tired! We still need work for 36 hours, will you be more tired! You people might have thought that Prime Minister wouldn’t address you at the 10 in the night, you might have also thought that today is 1st April and Modi Ji might be just playing April fool with you people. Friends, I’m really very happy to connect with you people today.

Smart India Hackathon is the biggest experiment of its kind in India. In the country, where 65% population is below the age of 35, the country that is the youngest country of the world, today the youth power of that country has been engaged in finding solutions to some of the biggest problems of this society and the country. That enthusiasm is commendable with which all of you, all the youths have been participating in this programme to demonstrate your innovation and your creativity. There is no trace of fatigue despite constantly working for 15 hours. I see smiles on your faces. One gets the results when work is done with this kind of energy and commitment.

Friends, not only in recent times but for thousands of years our country always had a distinct identity in the field of knowledge. It is said that the zero was discovered in India only. Today, India is leading the world in the field of IT knowledge. The auspicious journey from zero to Mars gives us pride. Our journey has expanded from Upnishads (scriptures) to satellites. However, it is also true that today India needs to increase the use of information technology to solve its problems, to meet its requirements. In a way modern society is a technology driven society. Innovation and technology, they are providing energy and pace to the social life. And therefore, nearly five hundred such problems were identified for this Hackathon with the help of MyGov and the solutions for those problems were to be found and the solutions were to be found by the youth, it was to be found through technology. These problems have been given to you to find solution. For you, this is a challenge and an opportunity as well. And I believe that you will get more joy in doing this thing than what you would have got for doing some job work for your exam. Because once the work is finished then you will feel that your hard work is going to benefit some poor people of the country. When you will see that the solution found by you is going to become the part of the policy of government of India then you will feel the value of your life. Success of democracy lies in people’s participation. Democracy doesn’t mean mere casting of your vote that you award the contract to someone for five years to solve your problems. And if it can’t be solved in the five years then we can say that now we will look for a new contractor. This is not democracy, democracy means people’s participation. 1.25 billion people of the country will have to take the country forward together. It is a myth that the government knows everything, it alone can solve all the problems and it alone has solutions to all the problems. The government is full of people like you only. We can only solve all the problems by working together. Those people who are not part of the government also have good suggestions, they have got talent and they have a feeling for doing something. That is why I always tried to take the things forward with the help of people’s participation. And today 10 thousand youth of engineering profession, of IT profession have come together to find the solutions for the 500 problems faced by us on regular basis. People are working without food, without water, this in itself is a proof of a new strength. And therefore, I congratulate to all the participants, I offer my respect to all of you.

Today, we will certainly get very positive results when you will channelize your energy for the process of governance. I have always believed that we can bring about massive changes in the modern society with the help of technology, with the help of information technology. Technology provides us such solutions that were unthinkable few years ago. Who would have thought that one day there will be driver-less cars on road.

Artificial intelligence is going to expand very fast in near future. 3D technology, printing of three-dimensional objects, and the making of a new future, 3-D technology is going to be a big pillar in the making of future.

It is going to be used in manufacturing sector, in designing of houses. Now, it is an era of “Internet of Things”. A system is being developed in which a lot of things will be decided by Internet of Things. Today, this technology is being used in a very big way in those cities that are being converted into Smart Cities, the technology of Internet of Things is being applied everywhere be it smart parking or be it smart lighting or be it monitoring of air quality.

Friends, technology is transforming modern life. Some new things, some new traditions are being developed and at the same time some old things, old methods are slipping out of use. You see it yourself, things like floppy drive, tape recorder, walkman appeared and disappeared in your time. They did not last long; a new technology replaced them. There was a time when radio was of the same size of a modern microwave oven. And today, a radio is the size of a match box. Technology has helped in shrinking the size of the world and in expansion of facilities. You might have seen that how fast the use of cashless transactions has grown in our country. And new solutions have continuously been developed in this sector.

Friends, innovation alone is the basis for a better future. History is written by those who challenge the established norms, who change them. And one thing is very important for this and that is perseverance, commitment, constant effort. We have heard this thing since childhood, you must have also heard this that there was an ant that was carrying its food, a grain of sugar, it slipped out her grip several time, she wasn’t able to do it, she was required to scale the wall and finally she succeeded in carrying it there. An ant can be an example of constant effort and therefore we must keep this thing in our mind that sometimes you will encounter failures on the path of innovations. But you don’t have to concede defeat, that is why who moves ahead with a determination to succeed he also knows how to struggle in difficult circumstances, he also knows how to achieve success. And when you succeed then the people would say that your way was correct, your methods were correct. However, you must keep one thing in mind that the end product of your innovation must be quality.

No compromises should be made in terms of quality, and it can’t be done in any case. Quality is something that people remember. The change that your product, your innovation brings in other’s life, in the quality of their life is very important. Friends, your innovativeness, your energy and your approach to solve the problems of the country, to solve the problems of the society are going to strengthen the New India. As technology is changing several times faster in comparison with the earlier time, similarly today’s generation also thinks, also acts many times faster than the earlier one. Some people say today’s youth ask too many questions, it’s not a bad thing. It’s something that is very good. Today’s youth is not carrying any baggage, he wants to grasp everything from the beginning, from his point of view. Some people say that today’s youth are impatient.

And I tell this thing that this thing (impatience) becomes the basis for innovation in today’s generation. There should be patience in life, nobody can lead an impatient life, however, your patience should not prevent you from thinking new, it should not lead to stagnation. That’s why they are working faster and it’s my experience that this kind of youngsters are able to produce results. Some people say that today’s youth doesn’t like monotonous work, he doesn’t like it; he wants change. I believe that it is this thinking that is producing new ideas in automation. Had he wanted to lead the life as per the old ways then how new things could be developed? The person who wants to break out of the old, it is the same person who provides the new things. Some people also say that today’s youth want to do many things simultaneously. Some people think that this person is wasting his time.

However, sometimes I think that there are some youth who can handle multiple things simultaneously; I don’t consider it wrong. Now people should prepare themselves for multitasking. And everybody should try for this and should encourage who tries for this. Some people feel uncomfortable with the ambition of youngsters. They say that today’s youth want to progress very fast. Friends, I’m in favor of progress but some people want to earn a lot of money in very short time; this kind of people hardly succeed in life. Those who move fast and do things before time to achieve something they are able to do something for themselves and for the world. And when I talk about New India then talk about this thing with the same spirit.

The youth of my country wants to find solutions very fast, he wants rapid progress and I think these things are good. Today’s youth wants to develop himself in a way to offer jobs to other instead of working for others. He certainly needs capital for this purpose but what is more important is to have a purpose in life, to have a sense of mission and there is no dearth of these things in our youth. They want to implement their ideas, their innovation solutions on the ground in a way that things become more efficient and economically viable. The government has been running this Start-up India project due to this amazing capacity of millions of youths like you. The loans worth crores of rupees have been disbursed to millions and millions of youths like you without bothering them to worry about bank guarantee.

Friends, everyone is capable of dreaming. So many of you are sitting here, some of you must be able to dream a new thing every day. Everyone is capable of this thing. But you must have the capacity to convert dreams into goals. And one must be able to put his entire energy to achieve that goal.  There are some people whose dreams, whose goals and achievements provide inspiration to others. You must have seen this thing in the IT field that several big innovations took off from a small room, they started off from a garage from a very small level. People initially rejected them, but these people continued to work hard, continued to work with full force to realize their dreams and eventually they succeeded. Those ideas that were once considered worthless, today these ideas are driving billing dollar companies. That’s why I advise to you people that you have a lot of time and you have to achieve a lot. And you should not waste a good idea in your journey. It’s very much possible that one of your ideas grows into a billion dollar company tomorrow and can bring about changes in the lives of a billion people.

Friends, you people must understand the difference between knowledge and skill in today’s fast changing world. There is a huge difference between the two. Knowledge is all about understanding a concept, about understanding the basics of something, it’s about how an electric circuit functions, however, skill is all about applying that concept. There will be lot of people who have studied electronics or electrical engineering but they call mechanic from outside if the fuse burns out. Skill is all about sharpening and applying the knowledge. That’s why today the skill must grow as fast as fast knowledge is growing therefore I tell about Skill Engagement Optimization (SEO). The entire world of internet is revolving around search engine and Search Engine Optimization plays an extremely important role in that.

Yours and our world revolves around the pivot of public welfare and public participation that is why skill engagement optimization is very important in that. And the world needs those people who know how to apply knowledge, those who can engage the client with their skill. When you people will pay attention to skill engagement optimization then the demographic dividend of the country will also convert into development dividend. It will further strengthen the path for New India.

Friends, in the next few hours you are going to solve a part of the task that was given to you, however, we don’t have to stop at this only. Twenty-nine ministries of Government of India are participating in this programme and it is their responsibility to take all the solutions that will be found through this Hackathon to take them to the last stage, take them to their logical end. If there is a scope for improvement then after modification they must be implemented in the system.

                His Excellency Prime Minister Dato Sri Mohammed Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak,
Members of the media, 

It is a great pleasure to welcome His Excellency the Prime Minister of Malaysia to India.Excellency Najib, your visit gives me and the people of India an opportunity to reciprocate the warmth and goodwill that I enjoyed during my visit to Malaysia in November 2015.Your visit also comes at a historic time in our relations.We are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. And, Excellency, your personal attention and leadership has contributed much to the steady direction, strength and vibrancy in our ties. Your contributions have been instrumental in forging a wide-ranging Strategic Partnership with India.

Friends, 

Our links with Malaysia have been civilizational and historic. Our relationship is rich and diverse.Our societies bond at many levels.Ties of culture and religion provide a strong connect between our people. The contributions of a large Indian community in Malaysia are of special value. They have not only nurtured our shared heritage. They have also been a strong driver of economic and people to people connectivity between our two countries.Prime Minister Najib and I had jointly inaugurated the Torana Gate in Kuala Lumpur during my last visit. Modelled on the Torana Gates of the Sanchi Stupa this stands as a symbol of our abiding friendship.

Friends, 

In our extensive conversation today, Prime Minister Najib and I took stock of the full range of our cultural, economic and strategic engagement.We took note of the steady progress in implementation of key decisions taken by us during my visit to Malaysia in November 2015 and we agreed on a shared vision to enhance our strategic partnership. A vision that prioritizes an action oriented approach.In this effort, deepening the existing areas of cooperation, and charting new territory of engagement are among our key objectives.

Friends, 

India and Malaysia have built a thriving economic partnership.In our efforts to scale this up, as the fastest growing large economy in the world, India offers unparallel opportunities.And, to build new avenues of prosperity in our societies we are ready to expand trade and capital flows between our two economies. Infrastructure has been an area of fruitful partnerships between us.But, we can do much more.India’s infrastructure needs and our ambitious vision of developing Smart cities match well with the Malaysian capacities. Malaysian companies are participating in many of our infrastructure projects across different states in India. Indian companies too are extensively engaged and invested in the Malaysian economy.We are pleased that a high level business delegation is accompanying Prime Minister Najib. I am confident that the business partnerships that they forge will enhance the level and momentum of our commercial engagement. We are also converging efforts aimed at food security that are linked to the wellbeing of our farmers. The MOU on proposed development of a fertiliser plant in Malaysia and off-take of surplus urea from Malaysia to India is a welcome development.

Friends, 

The U.T.A.R. University of Malaysia has started Ayurveda degree courses in Malaysia for the first time.This is a welcome development. And, an Ayurveda Chair in the same University is in the pipeline.Its early finalization would further cement our cooperation in this field.Our educational exchanges have always been a strong promoter of people to people ties between our countries. The signing today of the MOU on Mutual Recognition of Degrees is a landmark development that will benefit the students and societies of both our countries. 

Friends, 

We live in times and in a region, where both conventional and non-conventional security threats are constantly on the rise.Prime Minister Najib and I agreed that these challenges threaten the stability and economic prosperity of our countries and the region. And, require us and other countries of the region to work together.In this context, I deeply appreciate our continuing cooperation with the Malaysian government in our joint anti-terrorism efforts.

Excellency, your own leadership in countering radicalization and terrorism is an inspiration for the entire region. Our wide-ranging defence partnership has already brought our armed forces closer.

We are cooperating in:


	training and capacity building;
	maintenance of equipment and military hardware;
	maritime security; and
	in Disaster response.



Prime Minister Najib and I are also conscious of our role and responsibility in promoting economic prosperity, freedom of navigation, and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, especially its Oceans.To secure our societies, and for the greater regional good, we have agreed to further strengthen our strategic partnership to shape an effective response to our common concerns and challenges.

Excellency Prime Minister Najib, 

Let me welcome you once again to India.I thank you for very productive discussions. I am confident that our decisions today will drive our strategic partnership to the next level. I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful stay in India.

Thank you. 
Thank you very much.

                        Cabinet approves permission to avail external assistance by State Government entities from bilateral agencies for implementation of vital infrastructure projects

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the policy guidelines to allow financially sound State Government entities to borrow directly from bilateral ODA (Official development Assistance) partners for implementation of vital infrastructure projects. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), a State Government entity, has also been allowed to borrow directly from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan for implementation of Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) project. The estimated project cost for Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) is Rs.17,854 crore, out of which JICA loan portion is expected to be Rs.15,109 crore. 

The guidelines will facilitate the State Government entities to directly borrow from the external bilateral funding agencies subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and all repayments of loans and interests to the funding agencies will be directly remitted by the concerned borrower. The concerned State Government will furnish guarantee for the Loan. The Government of India will provide counter guarantee for the loan.

External assistance today plays a supportive role in financing major infrastructure projects, social sector projects and in building up institutional capacity. The role of external assistance has gained further significance in view of the large gap in funding requirements for major infrastructure projects implemented by the State Governments in order to acquire competitive strength under the globalized economic framework. Presently, external development assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources is received by the Government of India (i) for projects/programmes in the Central sector; (ii) for projects executed by Central Public Sector Undertakings; and (ii) on behalf of the State Governments for State sector projects/programmes to be implemented by the State Governments and/or local bodies and public sector undertakings. The existing guidelines do not allow direct borrowings by the State Government entities from external agencies. 

Several State agencies are implementing major infrastructure projects of national importance. These projects, even if viable and sound, have huge funding requirements and borrowing by the State Governments for such projects may exhaust their respective borrowing limits. Therefore, in order to accelerate the pace of investment in major infrastructure projects in the country without compromising the need for external assistance for other sectors, an enabling provision in the existing guidelines was considered necessary to facilitate direct borrowing by the State Government entities from bilateral external agencies. This dispensation will allow the financially sound State entities to directly borrow and repay the loan required for major infrastructure projects without burdening the State exchequer. The approval of these guidelines reiterates Government’s commitment to promote inclusive growth and strengthen the economy.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved leave encashment up to 180 days in respect of those Defence personnel who died or were invalidated out of service between 30.12.1991 to 29.11.1999 with less than 15 years of service.

The decision will benefit the families of 9777 Officers and other personnel of Defence Services who died or were invalidated out of service during this period. This period is very significant as a large number of casualities took place during the Kargil conflict (“Operation Vijay”) and in counter insurgency operation in J&K and North East during the period.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of a Protocol amending the Convention between India and Portugal for avoidance of double taxation. The Protocol will also ensure prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.

Once the Protocol enters into force, both India and Portugal would be able to exchange tax related information, which will help tax authorities of both countries to curb tax evasion.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extending the validity of the existing Central Order dated 27.10.2016 in respect of sugar for a further period of six months from 29.04.2017 to 28.10.2017.

The main objective of the decision is to enable the State Governments to issue control order with the prior concurrence of Central Government, for fixing stock limits/licensing requirements in respect of sugar, whenever need is felt by them. This is expected to help in the efforts being taken to improve the availability of these commodities to general public at reasonable rates, and control the tendencies of hoarding and profiteering.

The current decision will be notified by the Government and communicated to all the States/UTs for further action at their end.

Background

The Cabinet in its meeting held on 27.10.2016, decided to enable the States to regulate supply, distribution, sale, production, stock, storage, purchase and movement etc, in respect of sugar for a period up to six months. Accordingly, S.O. 3341(E) dated 27.10.2016 was issued, for enabling administrative department, States & UTs to decide stock limits etc. on sugar upto 28.04.2017, by amending the Removal of Licensing Requirements, Stock limits and Movement restrictions on Specified Foodstuffs Order, 2016 dated 29.09.2016 notified as G.S.R. 929(E).

The prices of sugar are being monitored by the Department of Food & Public Distribution regularly at factory gate as well as in the domestic market. In September, 2016 it was noticed that the retail prices had shown a sudden spurt. The price rise appeared to be more on sentiment than actual shortage. In order to regulate supply of sugar and address issue of speculative prices, fixing of appropriate stock limit on need basis was essential. In addition, despite adequate availability of stocks for consumption in the current season, hoarding and consequent profiteering is anticipated due to drop in production over previous year and hence further extension of stock limit would be needed.

To support the sugar sector, the Government had recently extended soft loan assistance of Rs.4305 crore to the industry which has been directly credited to farmers account on behalf of sugar mills through banks benefitting about 32 lakh farmers. Also a performance based production subsidy has been extended @Rs.4.50 per quintal of cane crushed which was directly credited to the farmers account on behalf of sugar mills.

In order to maintain domestic prices at reasonable levels, the Government has allowed import of a restricted quantity of 5 lakh MT of raw sugar at zero duty by millers/refiners having their own refining capacity. This restricted quantity will help the sugar industry to augment their liquidity and enable them to pay cane dues of farmers.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for procurement of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) Units for use in the General Elections, 2019 for

a)    purchase of  16,15,000 Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) Units  at a tentative unit cost of Rs.19,650, and at a total estimated cost of Rs. 3173.47 crore (excluding taxes and freight as applicable) during the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 from M/s Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bangalore and M/s Electronics Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad;
b)    directing the Price Negotiation Committee to negotiate with M/s Bharat Electronics Ltd and M/s Electronics Corporation of India Ltd to rationalise the final unit price expeditiously;
c)    allocation of additional funds to the tune of Rs. 1600 crore in the current financial year in the supplementaries/Revised Estimates for meeting the cash outgo envisaged for purchase of EVMs (Control Units & Ballot Units) and VVPAT Units during  the year 2017-18, payment of 40% of the said amount as advance to the manufacturers and for provision of balance amount as may be required in the BE 2018-19; and
d)    placement of Order by the Election Commission to the two manufacturers depending upon their production capacity so that all the VVPAT Units can be procured by September, 2018.

The decision of the Government would enable the Election Commission of India to deploy VVPAT Units in all pooling booths in the General Elections, 2019,   which will act as an additional layer of transparency for the satisfaction of voters, allaying any apprehension in the minds of the voters as to the fidelity and integrity of the EVMs. This would also result in   compliance of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its Order dated 8thOctober, 2013.

Background:

The idea of an additional layer of transparency for the satisfaction of voters in the form of a ‘voter verifiable paper trail’ was suggested by the political parties in a meeting taken by the ECI on 4th October, 2010. Accordingly, introduction of the VVPAT was facilitated by amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 vide Notification dated 14th August, 2013.  Thereafter, 20,300 VVPAT Units were purchased by the ECI in 2013.  Since then, these units are being deployed in elections in select Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies.  Subsequently, order for 67,000 additional Units was placed in 2015, out of which 33,500 Units have been supplied by the manufacturers. Requisite funds for purchase of the aforesaid number of VVPAT Units were provided by the Government as and when requested by the Election Commission.

VVPAT device functions like a printer to be attached to the ballot unit and kept inside the voting compartment. When the voter presses the button against the name of the candidate of his choice on the Ballot Unit, the VVPAT unit generates a paper slip, called Ballot Slip.  This paper slip contains the name, serial number and symbol of the chosen candidate.  The voter can see this slip through a screened window where it stays for seven seconds, and then it automatically gets cut and falls down into a sealed drop box. In this process, the slip will not go into the hands of the voter nor will others be able to see it.

Civil Appeal No.9093/2013 was filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy pleading for directions to the Election Commission to use VVPAT Units in all polling booths. It wasalleged in the said Petition, that the Electronic Voting Machines are not reliable and that there should be some device by which the voter should get a confirmation that the vote cast by him has been recorded in favour of the candidate of his choice.     In deference to the plea of the petitioner in the aforesaid CA, the Election Commission submitted that it has no objection to the introduction of VVPAT Units for conduct of free, fair and transparent elections.  The Supreme Court in its Order dated 8th October, 2013 directed that for implementation of such a system of VVPAT in phased manner Government of India may provide required financial assistance for procurement of requisite number of VVPAT Units.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for Policy to provide Purchase Preference (linked with Local Content (PP-LC) in all Public Sector Undertakings under Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.

The Policy will be applicable for five years. A steering committee will be constituted to oversee implementation of the Policy and carry out annual review and recommend continuation of the policy from year to year basis.

Under the Policy, the targets of Local Content (LC) will be stipulated for certain oil and gas business activities. The manufacturers/ service providers who meet the local content targets and whose quoted price is within 10% of the lowest valid price bid would be eligible for purchase preference for a stipulated portion of the purchase order on matching such price.

The Policy is expected to encourage suppliers and service providers to progressively adopt 'Make in India' practices and add value to their goods and services within the country.

The Policy will apply to all the Public Sector Enterprises and their wholly owned subsidiaries, Joint Ventures that have 51% or more equity by one or more Public Sector Enterprises, attached and subordinate offices of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Background:

The ‘Make in India’ initiative was launched by Prime Minister in September, 2014 as part of a wider set of nation-building initiatives devised to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub. In tune with this campaign, the Government has decided to incentivize the growth in local content in goods and services while implementing oil and gas projects in India through a policy for providing Purchase Preference to the manufacturers/ service providers who meet the local content targets in oil and gas business activities.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh as ""an Institute of National Importance"" through an Act of Parliament. The Institute will have the governance structure as well as legal mandate to grant degrees in a manner similar to that enjoyed by IITs. A separate Act will also impart the required status to the Institute to become a ""Centre of Excellence"" in petroleum and energy studies.

The Cabinet has also approved Rs 655.46 crore as capital expenditure to set up IIPE and contribution of Rs 200 crore towards its Endowment Fund (in addition to a contribution of Rs 200 crore from Oil Companies towards the Endowment Fund).

As committed under the 13 Schedule of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, it has been decided to set up this Institute. The objective is to meet the quantitative and qualitative gap in the supply of skilled manpower for the petroleum sector and to promote research activities needed for the growth of the sector. The academic and research activities of IIPE will derive strength from the Institute's proximity to sector-related activities such as KG-Basin, Visakhapatnam refinery and the planned Petrochemical complex at Kakinada.

Background:

Andhra Pradesh Government has allocated 200 acres of land, free of cost, for setting up of IIPE at Sabbavaram Mandal in Visakhapatnam district. IIPE has been registered as a Society under the AP Society Registration Act, 2001 on 18/04/2016. A temporary campus of IIPE has been set up from academic session 2016-17 from the Andhra University Campus with two undergraduate programmes namely, Petroleum Engineering and Chemical Engineering (with capacity of 50 students each). IIT, Kharagpur has taken up the responsibility of mentoring the Institute.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the implementation of Supreme Court’s Judgment dated 27th October 2015 regarding Target Plus Scheme (TPS) 2004-09 in Civil Application No. 554 of 2006.

The revenue implication under the TPS arising from the Hon’ble Supreme Curt’s Judgment is about Rs. 2700 crore.

Benefit is being extended to all the applicant exporters eligible as per provisions of the initially notified TPS Scheme under FTP for the year 2005-06, and as per provisions of Foreign Trade Policy 2004-09 throughout the country.

The Target Plus Scheme (TPS) 2005-06 was already implemented partially. However, the claims which were denied as a result of retrospective Notification will be now settled as per direction of the Supreme Court in the CA No. 554 of 2006. The scheme has been discontinued w.e.f. 01.04.2006.

The claims will be considered as per original notifications till the date of the Notification No. 48 dated 20.02.2006 and Notification No. 8 dated 12.8.2006. The guidelines and modalities for processing the claims will be worked out by the DGFT HQs in consultation with Deptt. of Revenue and is proposed to be completed in one year from the date of approval of the Cabinet.

The corrective measure will bring an end to multiple litigations with the Government and the claims under the TPS will be issued as per original provisions under Foreign Trade Policy in compliance with the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

Background

In the Civil Appeal No. 554/2006 titled DGFT v/s Kanak Exports & Ors., the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its Judgment dated 27.10.2015 gave verdict on the Target Plus Scheme for Export Promotion. It held that the Notification No. 48/2005 dated February 20, 2006 (certain products were made ineligible) and Notification No. 8/2006 dated June 12, 2006 (rates were reduced to 5% from the earlier 5, 10 and 15%) related to the Target Plus Scheme (TPS) could not be applied retrospectively and they would be effective only from the date of their issue.

In this plan, under the ""BIMSTEC Trans-Power Exchange and Development Project"", it was decided that a Task Force led by Thailand, with representatives of member countries, will give a report on draft MoU for grid interconnections. Total five meetings Task Force for BIMSTEC on Trans-power Exchange were held and the draft MoU for establishment of BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection was finalized by the Task Force on 16th Mar 2015.

In the BIMSTEC Leaders' Retreat 2016, held in Goa on 16th October 2016, the Leaders decided to expedite the signing of the MoU on BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection. Eventually, during the 4th meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on Energy held on 11th-12th January 2017, the MoU was discussed and finalized.

Impact

This MoU will provide a broad framework for the Parties to cooperate towards the implementation of grid interconnections for the trade in electricity with a view to promoting rational and optimal power transmission in the BIMSTEC region. This MoU will facilitate:

(i) the optimization of using the energy resources in the region for mutual benefits on non-discriminatory basis subject to laws, rules and regulations of the respective Parties;
(ii) the promotion of efficient, economic, and secure operation of power system needed through the development of regional electricity networks;
(iii) the necessity of optimization of capital investment for generation capacity addition across the region; and
(iv) power exchange through cross border interconnections.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the transfer on lease of 6.5628 acres of Defence land to Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan(KVS) at Air Force Station Kanpur (AFS Kanpur). It will be used for construction of school building and other associated infrastructure in partial modification of its earlier decision on 16.06.2011 wherein it had approved transfer 8.90 acres of defence land to KVS at AFS, Kanpur.

The defence land is being transferred on lease basis at a nominal rent of Rs. 1/- per annum without any premium in terms of existing Government policy on the subject. The infrastructure for the school will be built by the KVS as per their norms and with their own funds.

Kendriya Vidyalaya at AFS Kanpur is functioning since August 1985 from a temporary barrack-type accommodation which does not fully meet the requirements of a school as per laid down specifications. The existing accommodation has become inadequate to accommodate the increased number of students and required facilities. The transfer of land would enable KVS to construct its own school building with all the required facilities and amenities for both students and teachers.

The formalities relating to transfer of land to KVS would be within a period of two months. KVS will thereupon construct school buildings etc. on the leased land as per their own specifications and at their own cost.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved measures to increase oil palm area and production in India.  These include:

 

     i.        Relaxation of land ceiling limit for oil palm cultivation under NMOOP (National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm).

 

The Cabinet approved relaxation in restrictions for providing assistance to more than 25 hectare area also under NMOOP to attract corporate bodies towards oil palm and derive maximum benefit of 100% FDI.

 

   ii.        Revision of norms of assistance under Mini Mission-II of NMOOP.

The Cabinet further gave its approval to revise the norms of assistance mainly for planting materials, maintenance cost, inter-cropping cost and bore-well to make oil palm plantations attractive.

 

The measures will yield following results:

 

·        To encourage oil palm plantation on large scale by corporate bodies and to utilize wastelands. By relaxing restrictions under NMOOP, private entrepreneurs/cooperative bodies/joint ventures will show their interest in investment in oil palm plantation and availing the NMOOP support.

 

·        To encourage farmers for oil palm cultivation in a bigger way. The revision of cost norms will motivate fanners for oil palm plantation.

 

Annual Action Plan (AAP) of the State / Agencies will be approved by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare on revised cost norms. The private entrepreneurs/ cooperative bodies/ joint ventures will be invited by the respective state Governments for oil palm plantation in their state.

 

At present, the programme is being implemented in 12 States, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu. Mizoram, Odisha, Kerala, Telangana. Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland & Assam. Nearly 133 districts are under oil palm cultivation in these 12 states, However, all the potential states of Oil palm are covered under NMOOP.

 

There will be some financial implication in relaxing restrictions of area and up-scaling the norms of subsidies but the same would be accommodated within NMOOP fund. Therefore, no additional funds would be required.

 

The year-wise physical & financial progress for the 12th five year plan is given below:

*up to December, 2016

 

At present, oil palm development programme is being promoted in individual farmer's field. There is no scope to provide assistance directly to private entrepreneurs/Cooperative bodies/Joint ventures for large scale plantation. The waste land/degraded land/cultivable land in the oil palm growing states can be given on lease/rent or bought by private entrepreneurs/ cooperative bodies/ joint ventures for oil palm plantation. However, financial assistance under NMOOP is available for 25 hectare. Therefore, there is a need for relaxation of restrictions under NMOOP to attract corporate bodies towards oil palm and derive maximum benefit of 100% FDI. A combination of individual farming, contract farming and captive plantation (by relaxing land ceiling norms) can only boost oil palm cultivation in the country.

The norms of assistance for various interventions were decided on the basis of prevailing prices at the time of formulation of the NMOOP programme. In view of large investment towards the cost of planting material, digging of pits, planting, manuring, irrigation and maintenance of plantation for four years without any income, farmers particularly small and marginal have shown reluctance in taking up oil palm plantation. Besides, in North Eastern States, which have good potential for oil palm needs additional investment in land preparation being hilly terrain.

 

Background:

 

Edible Oil is an important component of household food basket. The total production of edible oil in the country is about 9 million MT. while the domestic requirement is around 25 million MT. The gap between demand and supply is being met through imports, which amounted to Rs. 68,000 crores in 2015-16 (Prov.). Palm oil contributes 70% of vegetable oil import and is one of the cheapest oil due to high productivity per hectare.

 

Oil Palm is one of the world's most efficient crop in terms of yield of vegetable oil per ha and today it is largest source of vegetable oil in the world. Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Thailand and Columbia are the major oil palm producing countries. An average oil yield of 4-5 tonnes/ hectare has been recorded with oil palm against the highest oil yield of 1.3 tonnes/ hectare from rapeseed.

 

Government of India is promoting oil palm by implementing several programmes since 1986-87 and from 2014-15 through NMOOP. NMOOP aims to bring an additional area of 1.25 lakh hectare under oil palm cultivation by the end of 2016-17. The developmental efforts have resulted in area expansion under oil palm from 8585 hectare in-1991-92 to around 3 lakh hectare by the end of 2015-16. Similarly, production of fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) and crude palm oil (CPO) have increased from 21,233 ton and 1,134 ton respectively (1992-93) to 11,50,000 ton and 1,98,000 ton during the year 2014-15.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved closure of the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Suraksha Yojana (MGPSY) which was set up in 2012 to address the social security-related issues of the Emigration Check Required (ECR)-category workers going abroad for employment to ECR countries.

The subscription under the MGPSY was very low and no new subscription was received for more than a year. Closure of the scheme will, therefore, obviate the avoidable recurring administrative and record-keeping expenditure.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of the Collaborative Agreement with French National Research Agency (ANR), France for supporting the Belmont Forum Secretariat from January, 2015 to December, 2017 at a total estimated expenditure of Euro 40,000. The Cabinet also approved continued financial support to Belmont Forum Secretariat beyond 2017.

 

The Belmont Forum, created in 2009, is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils. It provides an opportunity to identify study and deliver international environmental research priorities, for the society, in an accelerated way through trans­national research collaboration between natural and social scientists and alignment of international resources

 

India is a member of Belmont Forum, besides Australia, Brazil, Canada, European Commission, France, Germany, Japan, Netherland, South Africa, UK and USA etc. Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), represents India in the Belmont Forum since 2012. 

 

In order to coordinate the activities of the Belmont, a Secretariat is hosted by one of the Belmont forum member on rotational basis. ANR, France is hosting the Secretariat from January, 2015 to December, 2017. Expenditure for hosting the Secretariat will be borne by Belmont Forum member countries in kind or cash contribution.

 

Impact:

 

The Agreement will help to maintain a certain degree of continuity in the operations of the Forum and also help in smooth coordination of the activities of Belmont Forum.  As India is already participating in 4 Collaborative Research Actions (CRAs) and Secretariat will be coordinating the activities of Belmont Forum, Indian scientific community will ultimately benefit from this agreement.

 

Background:  

 

Since the inception of Belmont Forum in 2009, its operations were being handled by a part-time secretariat associated with the respective Chairs of the Belmont Forum. As the Co-chairs are rotational, the Secretariat also rotates and some time co-chairs are from different Continents with different time zone.   In order to maintain a certain degree of continuity in the operations of the Forum, establishment of a Full-time Secretariat was agreed upon by Belmont Forum members, on rotational basis.   ANR, France has agreed to host the Secretariat from January, 2015 to December, 2017.

The Agreement between the two countries is based on latest International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) template keeping in view of developments in Civil Aviation sector and with an objective to improve the air connectivity between the two countries. Presently there is no Air Services Agreement between these two countries. ASA is the basic legal framework for any air operation between the two countries.

The agreement will help establish air connectivity between the two countries.

The features of the Air Services Agreement are as follows:

i. Both countries shall be entitled to designate one or more airline.

ii. Now the Indian carriers can operate to any points in Georgia from any points in India. Whereas the carriers of Georgia can establish direct operation to six points namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Goa. Apart from this through routing flexibility any intermediate and beyond point can also be served by the designated carriers of both sides.

iii. The designated airlines of either country shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other country for the promotion and sale of air services.

iv. The designated Airline of each party can enter into cooperative marketing arrangements with the designated carriers of same party, other party and that of a Third party. In view of this, it will not only facilitate the direct connectivity but also connectivity through 3rd country carriers. It will provide viable options for the carriers of both countries.

The Air Services Agreement between India and the Georgia has the potential to spur greater trade, investment, tourism and cultural exchange between the two countries bringing it in tune with the developments in the civil aviation sector. It will provide enabling environment for enhanced and seamless connectivity while providing commercial opportunities to the carriers of both the sides ensuring greater safety and security.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for listing of the following 11 CPSEs (Central Public Sector Enterprises) on stock exchanges:

 


	
		
			
			Sl. No.
			
			
			CPSEs

As approved, listing of CPSEs will be through public offer of shares upto 25 per cent of Government of India’s shareholding, which may include offer of fresh shares for raising of resources from market. However, actual disinvestment in respect of each CPSE alongwith the mode of raising resources has been delegated for decision on a case to case basis to the Alternative Mechanism, headed by the Hon’ble Finance Minister.

 

The CCEA has also approved reservation of shares for the eligible employees of 11 CPSEs in accordance with the extant provisions of SEBI Regulations.

 

With a view to ensure wider participation by small investors in the CPSEs’ disinvestment program, a price discount upto 5 per cent on the issue price has also been approved for the retail investors and eligible employees of 11 CPSEs participating in this offer.

From the economic and sectoral perspective, the decision to list 11 CPSEs on stock exchanges through public offer will have the following advantages for to the stakeholders:

 

                     i.        Post-listing, value of a CPSE has the potential to be unlocked in multiples of book value of its equity with respective increase in their market capitalization. Once the book value of 11 CPSEs is discovered through the listing process, it will facilitate raising of resources by these companies at comparable cost and hence, achieve higher growth through their expansion/diversification. This will also be reflected in the performance at the sectoral level and overall economic growth.

 

                    ii.        Listing of CPSEs will also promote ‘people’s ownership’ by encouraging public participation in CPSEs. Reservation of shares not exceeding 5 per cent of the       post-issue capital for the eligible employees of 11 CPSEs, with the further decision to allocate shares to retail investors and employees of CPSEs at a price discount will ensure wider participation of small investors in the CPSEs’ disinvestment program.

 

                   iii.        Listing of profitable CPSEs on the stock exchanges also triggers multilayered oversight mechanism, which not only enhances shareholders’ value but also promotes corporate governance norms in such companies. As per the listing requirements of SEBI/ Company Law/Stock Exchanges, CPSEs are required to comply with a number of mandatory disclosure requirements.

 

                  iv.        With general public becoming the shareholder in the company through the listing route, the management is open to public scrutiny and thus become more accountable to its shareholders, as per the extant disclosure norms and compliance for listed CPSEs.

 

Background:

The Government has made the following announcement in Budget 2017-18:

“Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster public accountability and unlock the true value of these companies. The Government will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time-bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges…………..”

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for raw Jute for 2017-18 season in order to protect the economic interests of the farmers. 

The CCEA has increased the MSP to a level of Rs. 3500/- per quintal for 2017-18 season which indicates an increase of Rs. 300/- (9.4%) over the previous year. During last three years (2015-16, 2016-17 & 2017-18), Government has increased the MSP for jute from Rs. 2700/- to Rs. 3500/- (29.6%) as compared to increase from Rs.2200/- to Rs. 2400/- (9.1%) in the preceding three years (2012-13, 2013-14 & 2014-15). 

Jute is mainly used as raw material for Packaging Industry. The increase in MSP would benefit the Jute industry which supports the livelihood of around 40 lakh farm families and provides direct employment to 3.7 lakh workers in organised mills and in diversified units including tertiary sector and allied activities. These farm families are mainly concentrated in the States of West Bengal, Bihar and Assam which account for over 95% of the area as well as jute production in the country.

New varieties of jute viz., JRO-204, JBO-2003, JRS-517, JRC-532 and JRO-2407 are being promoted by providing support for seeds production under National Food Security Mission (NFSM)-Commercial Crops. National Seeds Corporation Limited has entered into agreement for promotion of new varieties of jute seeds in the jute growing states.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of the Ministry of Home Affairs for extension of the implementation phase of the Crime and Criminals Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) Project for another year beyond 31st March 2017.

The extension would help in achieving the remaining objectives of the project comprehensively. The maintenance phase of the Project will continue till 2022 as approved earlier. With a total outlay of Rs. 2000 crore, a sum of Rs. 1550 crore, which was the total allocation to the project so far, has been spent till 2016-17.

The Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) aims to integrate the CCTNS project with the e-courts and e-prisons databases in the first instance and with the other pillars of the criminal justice system - Forensics, Prosecution, Juvenile homes and a nationwide Fingerprint data base of criminals in a phased manner. The integration will be achieved by providing access to the Judiciary, Police and Prisons through a desktop dashboard to facilitate expeditious and informed decisions and aid investigations.

Impact of the CCTNS Project will lead to:

i. Citizen portals in all states and Centre that will facilitate transparency and speed in police service delivery, online registration of complaints and reporting and search of missing persons and stolen goods in self-service mode.

ii. Pan-India search on complete National Crime and Criminal database that is accessible to the Investigating Officers throughout the country.

iii. Search facility will be available to Police in regional languages for improved inter-state tracking of criminal movement.

iv. Reliable network connectivity to all Police Stations in the country.

v. National level crime analytics that will be published at, increased frequency to help policy and law makers in taking data backed timely actions and in making appropriate policy interventions.

vi. Integration with various e-Governance projects such as Aadhaar, National Population Register, Vaahan Project of the Ministry of Surface Transport, Passport Seva and National Emergency Response System Project thus increasing the synergies and benefit accrued from these individual systems. It will expedite various kinds of police verification requests and investigation.

vii. Advanced features such as biometric based identification, trend and pattern analytics etc. that will be incorporated to enhance hi-tech investigation capability.

viii. ICJS that will be available to all pillars of the criminal justice system helping improve its service delivery.

Achievements under CCTNS Project:

In the last one year following significant outcomes have been achieved by the Project:

• More than 83% Police Stations in the country are entering 100% FIRs through CCTNS software.

• 120 lakhs FIR have been entered in CCTNS system till date. Legacy Crime records since 2004 have also been migrated to the CCTNS database. In all around seven crore records are now available in the national crime database.

• 31 States/UTs have launched their portals which provide various services like registration of complaints, verification of criminal antecedents/litigation of individuals/property, obtaining NOC from police for events for law and order clearance, search of missing person search, matching unidentified dead bodies, Vehicle related enquiries, antecedent verification for issue of passport etc.

• The ICJS dashboard has been implemented by integrating CCTNS with e-Courts and e-prisons and has been launched on a trial basis with select central investigation agencies. v • Software for Prosecutions and Forensics has been developed and is currently being rolled out in Bihar, Telangana and Puducherry.

Background:

Originally approved in 2009, the Project aims to:

a) deliver various web based police related services to citizens.

b) facilitate a pan-India search of crime and criminal records of individuals through a national database.

c) generate crime and criminal reports at the state and central level to inform policy interventions and

d) computerise police processes.

In 2015, an additional objective of establishing a basic platform for an Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) was added to the Project.

Two day Convention on World Homoeopathy Day concluded successfully in New Delhi today. Minister of State (Independent Charge), for AYUSH Sh. Shripad Yesso Naik, was the Chief Guest of the function. Member Parliament and Parliamentary Standing Committee of Ministry of AYUSH, Health and Family Welfare Dr. Manoj Rajoria presided over the function. The event was being organized to commemorate the 262nd birth anniversary of the founder of Homoeopathy, Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, who was a great scholar, linguist and acclaimed scientist. The theme of the convention was “Enhancing Quality of Research in Homoeopathy”. The convention was organised by Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH), an autonomous research organization of Ministry of AYUSH. 

On this occaccion the AYUSH Minister, recalled the great contribution of Hahnemann and how his scientific aptitude helped him to discover a healing system based on infallible laws of nature. He further shared that Ministry of AYUSH was committed to bring to surface more evidence in AYUSH systems and validate these systems through internationally recognised means. He appreciated that CCRH has made some decent leaps in credible homoeopathy research and is sensitising its scientists on contemporary methods of research regularly. He also informed the delegates that CCRH has collaborated with reputed international and national institutes that are known for their excellence in various streams of science like quantum physics, bioengineering, virology, chemistry, botany etc., which, in turn, have not only bought more recognition to homoeopathy, but also opened the eyes of the allied scientists to this method of healing to take up more research in yet underexplored links between Homoeopathy and science, like, nano-science and genomics. 

On this occasion, CCRH, for the first time ever, presented awards to incentivise the contributors in the field of Homoeopathy research. The awards were conferred upon by Shri Shripad Naik to Drs. A.R. Khudabukhsh for Lifetime Achievement for Best Researcher, to Prof. Chaturbhuja Nayak for Best Teacher, Drs. Kusum S. Chand and Archana Narang for Best research papers, Drs. C.R. Patil and Dr. Debadatta Nayak for Young Scientists. During the convention, Minister of AYUSH also announced the awardees of Scholarship for Quality M.D. Dissertations in Homoeopathy. 

In his address, Shri Manoj Rajoria, highlighted the importance of quality education and research in Homoeopathy for overall growth of the system. To standardise Homoeopathy, he said that National Commission for Homoeopathy (NCH) is being proposed as the regulatory body that will have four boards, one each for regulation of undergraduate education; postgraduate education; accreditation and assessment of institutions; and regulation of the practice of the profession. 

The deliberations, divided in five sessions, ranged from key areas of homoeopathic research, strengthening college infrastructure for undertaking research, along with latest trends in drug validation, prognostic factor research to role of Homoeopathy in public health and epidemics by means of high quality research, including NABH accreditation of homoeopathic hospitals. The main objective of these sessions, which were chaired and addressed by international and national resource persons, was to educate all stakeholders to understand the intricacies of Homeopathic research and to provide adequate exposure of quality research environment to all types of delegates, which included researchers, practitioners, policymakers, medical students and representatives of homoeopathy industry. 

Joint secretary Shri A.K. Ganeriwala and Joint secretary Sh. P.N. Ranjit Kumar, Ministry of AYUSH, Padma Shri Dr. V.K.

Minister of State (Independent Charge), for AYUSH Sh. Shripad Yesso Naik, will inaugurate the National Convention on World Homoeopathy Day on 10 April 2017 at New Delhi tomorrow. Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Standing Committee of Ministry of AYUSH, Health and Family Welfare Dr. Manoj Rajoria will preside over the function. The event is being organized to commemorate the 262nd birth anniversary of the founder of Homoeopathy, Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, who was a great scholar, linguist and acclaimed scientist. A special session is also being organised to pay tribute to him. 

The theme of the convention is “Enhancing Quality Research in Homoeopathy through scientific evidence and rich clinical experiences”. The convention will have around five scientific sessions where experts of national and international repute shall be deliberating on key areas of homoeopathic research, strengthening college infrastructure for undertaking research along with latest trends in drug validation, prognostic factor research, role in public health and epidemics by means of high quality research including NABH accreditation of homoeopathic hospitals. The main objective of sessions is to educate all stake holders to understand the intricacies of Homeopathic research and to provide adequate exposure of quality research environment to medical colleges, practioners, clinicians and researchers. 

The founder of Homoeopathy, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, was the real advocate of logical reasoning. He based his discovery of Homoeopathy not on hypothesis alone, but on repeated testing of his hypothesis on healthy subjects and scientific maintenance and keen analysis of all his observations. He deduced from what he observed, but not before he could critically analyse his own work, contemplate on the ‘whys’ and ‘why nots’ and then after enough introspection, and adequately convincing the rejectionist in him, he accepted his practical observations and deciphered time-tested theories from those. 

World Homoeopathy Day, celebrated the world over to commemorate the birth anniversary of this legendary scientist, provides an ideal opportunity to stress upon the new possibilities in the global health scenario if Homoeopathy is integrated in mainstream public health. With World Health Organisation emphasizing on the need of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Homoeopathy has a lot to offer to the world as it is economical, safe and effective. Homoeopathy is widely popular and recognized in India and has been integrated into the national health care systems. 

Meaningful recommendations coming out of the convention are expected to enrich the research base of Homoeopathy in India and abroad.

Further, the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 requires every local body to constitute a Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) within its area with the objective to prepare People’s Biodiversity Register in consultation with local people. The Register shall contain comprehensive information on availability and knowledge of local biological resources, their medicinal or any other use or any other traditional knowledge associated with them.

                As of now, 26 AYUSH Information Cells have been set up in 24 countries viz. Malaysia, Trinidad & Tobago, Mexico, Cuba, Hungary, Russia (2 Cells), Indonesia (2 Cells), Mauritius, Slovenia, Sweden, China, Dubai, Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Finland, Argentina, Serbia, Israel, Tajikistan, Peru, Tanzania, Switzerland, Venezuela and London. AYUSH Information Cells are set up in foreign countries under the aegis of Indian Embassies/ Missions and Cultural Centers set up by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) or at a venue suggested by the Indian Missions for dissemination of authentic information and to take up awareness building about AYUSH systems of medicine abroad. 

AYUSH Information Cells help in global promotion and propagation of AYUSH systems of medicine which would lead to signing of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with foreign Governments/ Universities/Institutes, for Country to Country cooperation in the field of traditional systems of medicine, setting up of AYUSH Academic Chairs and undertaking collaborative research.

At present, India has 13 earth observation, 3 meteorological, 13 communication and      7 navigational satellites in operation. 

 

The data from earth observation and meteorological satellites in conjunction with ground based information, and services derived from communication & navigation satellites are being used towards Disaster Management Support. The data obtained from meteorological satellites is used for cyclone track, intensity & landfall predictions and forecasting of extreme weather events. The data from earth observation satellites is used for monitoring disaster events and assessing the damages. The communication satellites help to establish emergency communication in remote and inaccessible areas and navigation satellites are used for providing location based services. The fishing sector is being supported through advisories on Potential Fishing Zones and the ocean state forecast generated using satellite data helps the shipping sector. 

 

ISRO has planned future satellite missions in earth observation, communication and navigation to ensure continuity of data and services for operational applications as well as to address emerging needs of disaster management.  

 

The funds allocated towards satellite missions during the last three years, year-wise are as under: 

 


	
		
			
			Year 
			
			
			Allocation (RE) 

			(Rs. in Crores) 
			
		
		
			
			2014-2015 
			
			
			614.71 
			
		
		
			
			2015-2016 
			
			
			720.53 
			
		
		
			
			2016-2017 
			
			
			657.24 
			
		
	


 

The capabilities of earth observation, meteorological, communication and navigational satellites are used to harness the benefits of space technology for developmental activities in various sectors, including strategic sector. Currently, ISRO is working towards the development of 23 satellites, approved by the government.

                In order to convert the functional independence of our national nuclear regulator, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), into de jure independence, the proposal for setting up a Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority (NSRA) has been under consideration. Accordingly, Government had introduced the Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority Bill, 2011 in the Lok Sabha in September 2011, which was subsequently referred to the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment & Forests. The amendments proposed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee were incorporated in the Bill in the year 2013. The Bill, however, could not be taken up for consideration before the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha. A fresh Bill similar to the one introduced earlier, is under examination. 

Government is fully conscious of the importance of the role of regulator for promotion of safe use of nuclear and radiation technology. While the process of setting up of NSRA is underway, it may be noted that as the national nuclear regulator, AERB is fully competent and geared to meet the requirements of enforcing safety standards and regulations of the functioning of nuclear power plants in the country. AERB is functionally independent from the Government and the facilities it regulates, and has adequate powers with respect to its mandate of enforcing safety regulation of nuclear and radiation facilities.

                National Centre for Compositional Characterisation of Materials (NCCCM), Chemistry Group, BARC, located at Hyderabad has developed a portable visual detection kit for detection of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] between 5 to 500 ng/ml ( ppb) range in water within 5 minutes. 

Chromium exists in the environment primarily in two valence states, trivalent chromium (Cr III) and hexavalent chromium (Cr VI). Cr (III) is biologically important element and needed for glucose and lipid metabolism. Cr (VI), however, is considered toxic and IARC (International Agency for Research in Cancer, WHO) has classified it as a group 1 agent, defined as carcinogenic to humans. 

According to the method developed, three reagents kept inside different bottles are to be added to the clear water sample. Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 are added and mixed for two minutes. The third reagent is then added and mixed thoroughly (shaken for 1-2 minutes). Within 5 minutes, a pink color develops in the top layer and the intensity of this is compared by visual inspection to obtain the Cr(VI) range in water. 

By this method Cr(VI) can be detected in drinking water sources such as ground water, lake water, river water, etc. According to Indian standard IS10500, maximum permissible limit for Cr(VI) in drinking water is 50 ng/mL and as per United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) it is 10 ng/mL and the kit meets the requirements of both the standards. The technology of this kit has been transferred to M/S LTek Systems, Nagpur for commercialization of the product for societal benefit.

                The MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh met with Australian Minister for Resources on March 8, 2017 in New Delhi during which both sides had general exchange of views regarding promotion of mutually beneficial cooperation between India and Australia in the field of civil nuclear energy.

Uranium Corporation of India Ltd., a Public Sector Undertaking under Department of Atomic Energy is engaged in mining and processing of uranium ore in the country. The company is currently operating seven uranium mines (Bagjata, Jaduguda, Bhatin, Narwapahar, Turamdih, Banduhurang and Mohuldih) and two processing plants (Jaduguda plant and Turamdih plant) in the state of Jharkhand. Construction of mine and plant has been started at Tummalapalle in Andhra Pradesh. UCIL has outlined a plan for massive expansion which includes plan to maintain sustained supply from existing facilities, capacity expansion of some existing units and construction of new production centers (mines and plants) in different parts of the country. Considering the resources already identified in different geological basins by Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), UCIL’s major production centers are planned in Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan and Meghalaya.

The details of sites accorded “in-principle” approval for setting up nuclear power   plants in the northern and eastern region are as follows:

 


	
		
			
			Location & State
			
			
			Capacity (MW)
			
		
		
			
			 

			Northern Region
			
		
		
			
			Gorakhpur, Haryana
			
			
			4 x 700
			
		
		
			
			Mahi Banswara, Rajasthan
			
			
			4 x 700
			
		
		
			
			 

			Eastern Region
			
		
		
			
			Haripur, West Bengal
			
			
			  6 x 1000
			
		
	


 

There is presently no proposal to set up nuclear power plants in the North Eastern region. The region falls in Seismic Zone V as per IS 1893. As per the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) code on Site Evaluation of Nuclear Facilities, Nuclear Power plants are not set up in Seismic Zone V.

Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued a letter of intent for purchase of 16,15,000 Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails( VVPATs) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,173.47 crore during 2017-18 and 2018-19 from PSUs BEL and ECIL. In its letter sent to CMDs of ECIL and BEL on Friday (21st April) , the Commission has communicated its intent for purchase 8,07,500 VVPATs from each PSUs by September 2018.

These VVPATs shall be manufactured by both PSUs only as per the design approved by the Commission based on recommendation of the Technical Experts Committee on EVMs constituted by the Commission & comprising of eminent technical professors from IITs. The Commission shall closely monitor the production of VVPATs for timely delivery well before General Elections 2019.

Explaining the importance of this step , the Chief Election Commissioner Dr Nasim Zaidi said "" This will enhance transparency and uphold the voters’ right to know which party he or she has voted, thereby increasing voters’ confidence in the free & fair electoral process. ""

On 19th April, 2017, in compliance of the order of Hon’ble Supreme Court and as per the recommendation of the Election Commission of India, the Government had approved Rs 3173.47 crore for the procurement of 16,15,000 VVPATs to be used in ensuing elections and General Elections 2019.

In the recent past, there have been some queries in the minds of common people about the security features of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) of Election Commission of India (ECI). The Election Commission has, time and again, stated that ECI-EVMs and its systems are robust, secure and tamper-proof.

 

The following FAQs give a detailed view of security features including latest technological features of EVMs and stringent administrative measures taken at every step of its usage from manufacturing to storage.

 

1. What is meant by Tampering of EVM?

 

Tampering means alteration in the software program written either on existing microchips of Control Unit (CU) or introducing malicious software program by inserting new microchips in CU and also making keys - pressed in Ballot Unit (BU) not record faithfully in the Control Unit.

 

2.  Are the ECI- EVMs hackable?

NO.

M1 (model one) of EVM machines were manufactured till 2006 and had all necessary technical features making M1 non-hackable contrary to claims made by some activists.

 

On the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Committee in 2006, M2 model of EVMs produced after 2006 and upto 2012 incorporated dynamic coding of key codes thereby enabling transfer of the key – press message from  Ballot Unit (BUs) to  Control Unit (CUs), in an encrypted form as an additional security feature. It also contains Real time setting of each key press so that sequencing of key presses including so called malicious sequenced key presses can be detected and wrapped.

 

Further, the ECI- EVMs are not computer controlled, are stand alone machines and not connected to the internet and /or any other network at any point of time. Hence, there is no chance of hacking by remote devices.

The ECI-EVMs do not have any frequency receiver or decoder for data for wireless or any external hardware port for connection to any other non-EVM accessory or device. Hence no tampering is possible either through hardware port or through Wireless, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth device because CU accepts only encrypted and dynamically coded data from BU. No other kind of data can be accepted by CU.

 

3. Can ECI-EVMs be manipulated by Manufacturers?

Not Possible.

There is very stringent security protocol at manufacturer level regarding security of software. The Machines have been manufactured in different years starting from 2006. After manufacturing, EVMs are sent to State and district to district within a State. The manufacturers are in no position to know several years ahead which candidate will be contesting from a particular constituency and what will be the sequence of the candidates on the BU. Also, each ECI-EVM has a serial number and the Election Commission by use of EVM – tracking software can find out from its database which machine is located where. So, any manipulation at manufacturing stage is ruled out.

 

 

 

4. Can Trojan Horse be incorporated into the chip in CU?

 

Sequence of voting in EVM eliminates the possibility of injection of Trojan Horse as mentioned below. The stringent security measures by ECI make it impossible to introduce Trojan Horse in the field.

Once a ballot key is pressed in CU, the CU enables BU for registering the vote and waits for the key pressing in the BU.  During this period, all keys in the CU become Inactive till the entire sequence of casting of that vote is complete.  Once any of the keys (candidates vote button) is pressed by a voter in BU, the BU transmits the key information to CU.  The CU gets the data and acknowledges it by glowing the corresponding LED lamps in BU.  After the enabling of ballot in CU, only the ‘first key press’ is sensed and accepted by CU.  After this, even if a voter keeps on pressing the other buttons that is of no use as there will not be any communication between CU and BU as the result of those subsequent key presses, nor will BU register any key press.  To put it in other words, there can be only one valid key press (the first key press) for every ballot enabled using CU.  Once a valid key press (voting process) is complete, until another ballot enabling key press is made there will not be any activity between the CU and the BU.  Hence, sending of any malicious signal, by way of so called ‘sequenced key presses’, is impossible in the Electronic Voting Machines being used in the country.

 

5. Are Old model ECI- EVMs still in use?

 

M1 model of EVM machines were produced up to 2006  and were last used in 2014 General Elections. In 2014, EVM machines which completed 15 years of economic life and also because M1 were not compatible with VVPAT (voter-verified paper audit trail) , ECI decided to discontinue use of all M1 EVMs manufactured upto 2006. There is a Standard Operating Procedure laid down by ECI to discard EVMs. The process of destruction of EVM & its chip is carried out in the presence of Chief Electoral Officer of the state or his representatives inside the factory of manufacturers.

 

 

 

 

6. Can ECI-EVMs be Physically Tampered with/ their components be changed without anyone noticing?

 

In addition to the existing security features in earlier models M1 & M2 of ECI-EVMs, the new M3 EVM produced after 2013 have additional features like Tamper Detection and Self Diagnostics. The tamper detection feature makes an EVM inoperative the moment anyone tries to open the machine. The Self diagnostic feature checks the EVM fully every time it is switched on. Any change in its hardware or software will be detected.  

A prototype of a new model M3 with above features is going to be ready shortly. A Technical Experts Committee will examine it and then production will commence. About Rs. 2,000 crores have been released by the Government to procure M3 EVMs with above additional features and new technological advancements.

 

7. What are the latest technological features to make ECI-EVMs tamper proof?

 

 

The ECI-EVMs use some of the most sophisticated technological features like one time programmable (OTP) microcontrollers, dynamic coding of key codes, date and time stamping of each and every key press, advanced encryption technology and EVM-tracking software to handle EVM logistics, among others to make the machine 100% tamper proof. In addition to these, new model M3 EVMs also have tamper detection and self-diagnostics as added features. Since, software is based on OTP the program cannot be altered, re-written or Re-read. Thus, making EVM tamper proof. If anyone make, attempt, the machine will become in operative.

 

8. Do the ECI-EVMs use foreign technology?

 

Contrary to misinformation and as alleged by some, India do not use any EVMs produced abroad.  EVMs are produced indigenously by 2 PSUs viz. Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bengaluru and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad. The Software Programme Code is written in-house, by these two companies, not outsourced, and subjected to security procedures at factory level to maintain the highest levels of integrity. The programme is converted into machine code and only then given to the chip manufacturer abroad because we don’t have the capability of producing semi-conductor microchips within the country.

Every microchip has an identification number embedded into memory and the producers have their digital signatures on them. So, the question of their replacement does not arise at all because microchips are subjected to functional tests with regard to the software. Any attempt to replace microchip is detectable and can make EVM in-operative. Thus, both changing existing programme or introducing new one are detectable making EVM in-operative.

 

9. What are the possibilities of manipulation at the place of storage? 
 

 

At the district headquarters, EVMs are kept in a double-lock system under appropriate security. Their safety is periodically checked. The officers do not open the strong room, but they check whether it’s fully protected and whether the lock is in proper condition or not. No Unauthorized person can get access to the EVMs at any point of time. During non election period, Annual Physical Verification of all EVMs is done by DEOs and report sent to ECI. Inspection & checking have recently been completed.

 

10.       To what extent are allegations of EVM tampering in local body polls true?

 

There is a misunderstanding in this regard due to lack of knowledge about jurisdiction. In case of elections to Municipal bodies or Rural bodies like Panchayat Elections, the EVMs used do not belong to the Election Commission of India. Above local bodies elections come under the jurisdiction of State Election Commission/s (SECs), which procure their own machines and have their own handling system. ECI is not responsible for functioning of EVMs used by SECs in above elections.

 

11.       What are the different levels of checks and balances ensuring tamper proofing of ECI-EVMs?

 

•      First Level Checking: BEL/ECIL engineers certify originality of components after technical and physical examination of each EVM, undertaken in front of representatives of political parties. Defective EVMs are sent back to factory. The FLC Hall is sanitized, entry is restricted and no camera, mobile phone or spy pen is allowed inside. Mock poll of at least 1000 votes is conducted on 5% EVMs selected randomly by reps of political parties and the result shown to them. The entire process is video graphed.

•      Randomization: EVMs are randomized twice while being allocated to an Assembly and then to a polling booth ruling out any fixed allocation. Mock Poll at polling station is conducted in front of polling agents of candidates on the poll day, before polls begin.

After Poll, EVMs are sealed and polling agents put their signature on the seal. Polling agents can travel upto strong room during transportations.

•      Strong Rooms: Candidates or their representatives can put their own seals on the strong rooms where polled EVMs are stored after the poll and also camp in front of strong room.  These strong rooms are guarded 24x7 in multilayers.

•      Counting Centres: The polled EVMs are brought to the Counting Centres and Unique IDs of the seals and CU are shown to reps of candidates before start of counting.

 

12.       Can a manipulated ECI- EVM be re-inducted in the polling process without anyone coming to know?

 

 

Question does not arise.

Looking at the above series of fool-proof checks and balances that are undertaken by the ECI to make EVMs tamper proof, it is evident that neither the machines can be tampered-with nor defective machines can get re-inducted into the polling process at any point of time because Non ECI -EVMs will get detected by the above process and mismatch of BU & CU. Due to different level of stringent checks and balances neither ECI-EVMs can leave the ECI system nor any outside machine (Non-ECI –EVM) can be inducted into the system.

 

13.       Why have Developed Nations like the US and European Union not adopted EVMs and some have discontinued?

 

Some countries have experimented with electronic voting in the past. The problem faced with the machines in these countries was that they were computer controlled and connected to the network, which in turn, made them prone to hacking and hence totally defeating the purpose.  Moreover, there were not adequate security measures and safeguards in their corresponding laws regulations for security, safety and protection. In some countries, Courts struck down the use of EVMs on these legal grounds only.

Indian EVM is stand-alone whereas, USA, The Netherlands, Ireland & Germany had direct recording machines.  India has introduced paper audit trail, though partly.  Others did not have audit trail. Source code is closed during polling in all of the above countries. India also has closed source burnt into memory and is OTP.

ECI-EVMs, on the other hand, are stand-alone devices not connected to any network, thus making it impossible for anyone to tamper with over 1.4 million machines in India individually. EVMs are most suited for India, looking at the country’s past poll violence and other electoral malpractices like rigging, booth capturing etc. during the polls.

It is worth mentioning that in contrast with countries like Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. Indian Laws & ECI regulations have in-built adequate safeguards for security & safety of EVMs  Besides, Indian EVMs are far superior on account of secured technological features. Indian EVMs also stand apart because VVPATs going to be used with EVMs in phases to make entire process transparent for voters.

In case of The Netherlands, rules regarding storage, transport and security of machine were lacking. Machines produced in The Netherlands were also used in Ireland & Germany. In a judgment in 2005, German Court found voting device ordnance unconstitutional on the ground of violation of the privilege of the public nature of election& the basic law. So, these countries discontinued the use of machines produced in The Netherlands.  Even, today many countries including USA are using machines for voting

ECI – EVMs are fundamentally different from the voting machines and processes adopted in foreign countries. Any comparison based on computer controlled, operating system based machines elsewhere will be erroneous and ECI – EVM cannot be compared with. 

14.       What is the status of VVPAT enabled machines?

The ECI has conducted elections in 255 assembly constituencies and nine Lok Sabha constituencies using Voters Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). The use of M2 and new-generation M3 EVMs along with VVPAT is the way forward for further confidence and transparency of the voters.

                Subject:Enquiry report on Bhind (MP) Episode

Special Enquiry teamled by Shri Bhanwar Lal, Chief Electoral Officer, Andhra Pradeshhas submitted its report to the Commission. The team has found no anomaly or tampering in EVM and VVPAT used during demonstration in Ater (Bhind) on 31st March, 2017. The enquiry was instituted by Election Commission of Indiato enquirein to all aspects of various allegations raised in the media and by the political parties.

2. The technical examination of the Ballot Unit (BU), Control Unit (CU) and VVPAT of 31stMarch demonstration, oral examination of the officials present during the demonstration, data retrieved from the CU have conclusively established that during the demonstration, 4 buttons of BU were pressed in the following order:

 

Button No.           Symbol                      Name of Candidate  

 

03                            Handpump                  Raju Pal

04                            Lotus                           SatyaDev Pachori

03                            Handpump                  Raju Pal

01                          Hand                           Ambuj Shukla

Therefore it is clear that on pressing of various buttons on EVMS during the demonstration, corresponding symbols were displayed.

 

3. The team in its reportconcludedthat it is completely false to say thatat multiple times slips of lotus were printedon pressing different buttons during the demonstration on 31st March as alleged.

 

4. The lapserelated to non-deletion of the pre-loaded data of Govind Nagar AC of Kanpur Nagar from where VVPATs (not EVMs) were received and reloading with the symbols/data of dummy candidate before demonstration as per the laid down protocol of the Commission.necessitate appropriate actionby the Commission.

 

The conclusion of the enquiry committee on the allegations are as follows:

 

1.         The EVMs used in the demo in Bhind was not brought from UP. However, the VVPAT used in the demonstration was brought from UP. Since the VVPATs are limited in number and had been used by all the poll going states during the last 5 states elections, the distribution of VVPATs for 10 states bye-elections was made by the Commission by allocating VVPATs from different poll-gone statesto different poll-going states. In this case, the VVPAT was allocated from UP and brought from Govind Nagar AC of Kanpur Nagar,UP.

2.         Bringing the VVPAT from UP is not in violation of law. As per the law, only the EVMs used in the Poll and the VVPAT slips contained in the box are required to be preserved for the period of 45 days in a secured manner for the purpose of Election Petition, if any. There is no bar on the movement of VVPATs machines as the same are not required to be preserved for Election Petitions as the paper slips printed through the VVPAT and contained in the Box are required to be preserved separately. In this case, however, further precaution was taken to move only the reserve VVPATs used as substitutes during poll on which no restriction applies.

The Committee has recommended that the enquiry conclusively establishes that

1. The accuracy of the functioning of the EVMs and VVPATs including the said EVM/VVPAT is beyond doubt.

2. Commission may like to fix responsibility on DEO and RO for the lapses brought out in the enquiry reports.

3. Commission may like to prescribe check list for handling each activity relating to EVM/VVPAT which should be mandatorily adhered to by the electoral authorities and the same should be monitored through MIS online by the Commission. The existing instructions issued from time to time may be compiled in the form of these checklists. The said revised checklistslaid down by the Election Commission of India regarding handling of various activities on EVMs/VVPATs, must be rigorously followed by the entire electoral machinery from the level of Presiding Officer to the CEO.

4. Commission may like to reiterate that there should be no room for casualness in handling the electoral matters, least of all, such unwarranted remarks, as the sanctity of electoral process forms the foundation of India’s democracy.

                Sub: Commission’s displeasure over use of frozen symbol “Two Leaves”

For the bye election to Tamil Nadu Assembly from 11-Dr. R.K. Nagar Assembly Constituency, the Commission issued its order dated 23.3.2017 allocating the party symbol “Hat” to the party All India Anna Dravid Munnetra Khazagam, AIADMK (Amma) and the other faction named All India Anna Dravid Munnetra Khazagam, AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), was allotted the symbol “Electric Pole”. By the said order the Commission has frozen the symbol “Two Leaves”, reserved for the undivided AIADMK party and hence use / representation/ drawing similarity with the said symbol, with any other party symbol or name of any party in whatsoever form, is illegal. 

2. The Commission received a number of complaints from the 11-Dr.R.K.Nagar Assembly Constituency that AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) party has put posters/ uploaded social media messages showing party symbol electric pole superimposed on symbol “Two Leaves”. It has also come to the notice of the Commission that the other faction of the party known as AIADMK (Amma), has continued to use symbol “Two Leaves” in its official website and in other party papers. It continued to use the symbol even after the Commission froze the symbol and it continued to do so during the filing of nomination of the candidature in the said bye election. 

3. Both the aforesaid parties were issued show cause notices for the said act which violates the Model Code of Conduct, comes within the ambit of corrupt practice as defined under Sec. 123(4) of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951 and also violates Sec. 171(G) of the Indian Penal Code. Replies filed by the said parties were considered by the Commission and found unsatisfactory and hence they have been conveyed its displeasure and advised not to repeat such acts in future. 

4. Both, the AIADMK (AMMA) Group and the AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) group, have been directed by the Commission to remove “Two Leaves” from all its official website/social media forthwith and submit compliance report by 4:00 P.M. of 8/04/2017. 5. The Commission, for the sake of clarity and to set the matter into right perspective, has clarified that the symbol “Two Leaves” has been frozen by the Commission and no party/faction/candidate/leader has any claim over the said symbol till further orders.

                Certain baseless observations and allegations have been made by a leader of a political party today in a press conference regarding the use of EVMs. It has been alleged that EVMs as per law cannot be taken out for 45 days from the date of declaration of results but still EVMs for the bye-polls in the Madhya Pradesh were taken out and shifted from Uttar Pradesh where the results have been declared on 11th March, 2017 and hence the 45 days period is still not over.

            The Commission would like to clarify the legal position. The EVMs comprising the Control Unit (CU) and Ballot Unit (BU) used in any election shall be kept in a strong room after declaration of results and shall not be accessed by anyone till the period of filing of election petition is over. The election petition has to be filed within 45 days. However, in case of VVPAT machines, the printed paper slips have to be retrieved at the time of counting and sealed in a paper envelope and only these sealed paper slips have to be kept inside the strong room alongwith the EVMs. The VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election. However, in the on-going bye-polls only VVPAT machines which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.

            Aspersions have also been cast on the Election Commission of India that EVMs from Uttar Pradesh were moved to Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. The Commission would like to point out that these allegations are completely baseless and made without verifying the facts. No EVMs have been moved from Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of Bye-polls in Madhya Pradesh.

            The Commission would like to clarify that in any election a certain percentage of EVMs and VVPAT machines are kept in reserve so that EVMs and VVPAT machines deployed on the poll day can be replaced, if required. The EVMs and VVPATs kept in reserve also go through the stringent protocol of First Level Checking, Randomization and Loading of Symbols during the candidates setting in the presence of representatives of candidates/political parties. Hence, the VVPATs that were sent to Bhind had the previous symbols loaded from Uttar Pradesh. This is a standard protocol and there was nothing amiss in this. According to standard protocol, the old symbols are erased only during First Level Checking before the next poll. However, it was not done when the demonstration was made on 31st March, 2017 at Bhind. As per the Commission’s instructions, any training or demonstration is commenced only after completing the First Level Checking which was missed out at Bhind for which Commission has replaced the District Election Officer.

            The report of special officer deputed to inquire into allegations of multiple printing of paper slips of a particular political party at Ater (Bhind) is awaited and would be made public.

The Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the central government is giving priority to agriculture sector by allocating maximum funds for the farmers’ welfare. Shri Singh said that the government aims at increasing the agriculture production, determining productivity and boosting dairy/livestock/fisheries while promoting agriculture education, research and extension organisation. It was stated by Shri Singh while inaugurating two-day National Conference on Agriculture for Kharif Campaign-2017, which started today in New Delhi.

The Minister of States for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Parshottam Rupala and Shri Sudarshan Bhagat and senior government officials were present on this occasion. Discussion at the conference was centred on last year’s agricultural production, how to increase the production of next year’s Kharif crop, raising agricultural productivity in consultation with the state governments, ensuring the availability of inputs before the cropping season, implementation of technology and new innovations in the agriculture sector.

Shri Singh said that to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of doubling farmers' income by 2022, Agriculture Ministry has written letters to the state governments urging them to strategise and work on it. Agriculture Minister said that while strategising, the state governments will have to closely monitor agricultural production and agricultural products processing activities.

Shri Singh said that the government has launched various schemes for the farmers. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Soil Health Management, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, E-Nam, Agroforestry (Medh Par Ped) and Neem coated Urea to name a few. To increase milk production, National Dairy Mission was initiated. Blue Revolution is emphasising on inland fisheries and deep sea fishing. The schemes aim to increase the agricultural productivity and improve farmers’ income.

Union Minister said that for the success of schemes, we will have to work together with dedication and sincerity. Shri Singh further informed that this year’s growth rate for the agriculture and allied sectors was about 4 percent.

For the welfare of agriculture sector, the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Ministry has converted all its schemes into special missions, schemes and programmes. With joint efforts of all stakeholders, the 2nd advance estimates predict about 271.98 MT production of food grain, which is 8.11 percent higher as compared to the year 2015-16. Shri Singh also said that the production of the foodgrains is 5.82 percent more than the last five years’ average production. There was a record foodgrains production in 2013-14, however, this year’s yield was 2.61 percent higher as compared to 2013-14.

Agriculture Minister said that the farmers have started reaping the benefit of the schemes initiated by the department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. The schemes include National Food Security Mission (NFSM), National Horticulture Mission (NHM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), and Total Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).

Shri Singh said that the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), one of the most important schemes of the agriculture ministry covers rice, wheat, pulses, cereals and other main crops. Before the current government came to the power, NFSM was being implemented in 482 districts of 19 states. When the NDA government came to the power, the implementation of NFSM was extended to 638 districts of 29 states. Apart from that, 2.70 lakh hectare area is being used for organic farming. While ensuring the overall growth of agriculture and allied sectors, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana or RKVY’s aims at achieving annual growth and maintaining the same during the 12th Plan.

Agriculture Minister said that the Ministry is focusing on the production and productivity of oilseeds and equal attention is also being given to the fruits, vegetables and horticulture. The government is also focusing on quality and availability of seeds. Apart from that national seed mission has been initiated under the scheme grants will be given for seed processing, seed storage, improving the quality of seeds and storing of seeds for the emergency.

Shri Singh said that the government is trying to safeguard farmers’ interest by announcing a minimum support price for main agricultural commodities. The thrust of the policy is to create a balanced and integrated structure to meet the overall needs of the economy. To support the prices, central nodal agencies such as FCI, CCI, JCI, NAFED, SFAC etc. start procurement process to ensure that the market price doesn't slip below the MSP fixed by the government. In case the market price of the commodity falls below the announced minimum price, govt agencies intervenes under Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) and procures the entire quantity offered by the farmers at the announced minimum price. During the period of 2014-15 to 2016-17, Indian government procured chilli, apple, ginger, potato, oil palm, grapes, onion betelnut, etc from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland. Any sharp rise or fall in prices not only causes harm to consumers but farmers too. To mitigate volatility in the prices of agricultural produce, a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs.500 Crore for agricultural commodities was announced, which has been now increased to Rs.1500 crore. To control the rising pulses price, 40,000 metric tonne pulses have been distributed to the states at their behest and meanwhile, the government is creating a buffer stock of 20 lakh metric tonne pulses. Simultaneously government is procuring 20,000 metric tonne onion for buffer stock.

Shri Singh also said that the Kharif season is around the corner, therefore, it is imperative for the state governments to make plans to procure high-quality seeds of several types of crops and fertilisers for the farmers. The state governments should ensure that there is no scarcity of inputs during the cropping season.

To ensure that the farmers avail the benefits of Fasal Bima Yojana, the government launched Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana from 2016 Kharif season after improvising the earlier insurance scheme. The insurance is vast and covers the pre-sowing to post-harvest losses. For soil health, the government has started Soil Health Card scheme. To promote organic farming, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana has been launched. To increase farmers’ income, the government is also focusing on agroforestry and bee-keeping.

In the end, Shri Radha Mohan Singh urged all the ministers to make efforts for the smooth and timely implementation of all the schemes so that the farmers get the funds on time to start their work. Shri Singh also stressed on transparency in governance.

So far traditional Mandis have done well, however, now it’s imperative for the Mandis to adopt new marketing strategies to address the demands for marketing of increased and diversified agricultural marketable surplus: Shri Singh

 

To meet the marketing sector challenges the Agriculture Ministry has formulated: Shri Singh

 

Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act 2017 and it is being shared with the state governments for implementation: Union Agriculture Minister

 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh addresses representatives in a meeting of Agri-Marketing Ministers

 

 

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that after independence, this is the first government, which is not only focusing on the economic development of farmers along with the agricultural development but also taking concrete steps at grass root level for the development of farmers. Shri Singh was speaking at a meeting organised for Agri-Marketing Ministers of the states.

 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that it is our Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream to double farmers’ income by 2022 and that farmers should be part of mainstream development. This can be possible only when the centre and the state governments would work in tandem. To double farmers’ income, work is being done on three levels.

 

Shri Singh said that the first level includes production cost reduction and to increase productivity. To achieve that, the states should make optimal use of the central government schemes - Soil Health Card and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana. Under Soil Health Card Scheme, the soil is tested and under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana water is made available to the fields.

 

Union Agriculture Minister said that second level to double farmers’ incomes includes diversification into allied activities such as livestock, poultry, bee-keeping, and agroforestry. The government has taken several steps in this regard.

 

Shri Singh said that the third and the most important level include providing regulated Mandis to ensure profitable returns to farmers for their produce.

 

Shri Singh said that so far traditional Mandis have done well, however, now it’s imperative for the Mandis to adopt new marketing strategies to address the demands for marketing of increased and diversified agricultural marketable surplus.

 

Considering the need, Agriculture Ministry prepared a Model Act on Agricultural Marketing in the year 2003 and this was circulated among the states to improve market laws as per the act. After 2003, for a long time, no major change was made in the Agriculture Marketing. In March 2010, an Empowered Committee of the state ministers’ in-charge of Agri-marketing was formed under the chairmanship of Shri Harshvardhan Patil. The committee submitted its interim report to the Agriculture Minister, Government of India, but no further action was taken after that.

 

Shri Singh said that after forming the government, we have taken several important decisions to improve the conditions of the farmers. To double farmers’ income, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved National Agriculture Market (E-NAM) Scheme on July 1, 2015, with a budget allocation of Rs.200 crore. Subsequently, under the pilot project, 23 markets from 8 states were integrated by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on April 4, 2016. This scheme provides an online trading portal to farmers and enables them to have an access to transparent sale transactions and price discovery. Under this scheme Rs. 30 lakh is sanctioned to each market to build essential infrastructure. The fund was increased to Rs. 75 lakh during budget 2017-18. So far 417 regulated markets from 13 states have been integrated into the scheme, which will be increased to 585 till March 2018. So far, 42.18 lakh farmers and 89,199 traders have been registered on E-NAM portal and the turnover is Rs.16, 163.1 crore from the trading of 63.17 lakh tonne produce. The main objective of the scheme is to give access to farmers about prices of various markets at one place so that the farmers can sell their yield under a transparent system to a buyer who offers the best price. One of the highlights of this scheme is that the farmers would get the price of their yields based on the quality of their product because before electronic bidding quality is tested. For the success of the scheme, the state governments have to make efforts and Hon’ble Ministers will play an important role in its success.

 

E-NAM is seen as a milestone in the government’s Digital India initiative. Also, E-NAM will boost Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by providing compost plants in the market.

 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that to meet the marketing sector challenges, our ministry has formulated Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act 2017, which was sent to the states and union territories for comments on Feb 6, 2017. The draft was also uploaded on the Agriculture Department’s official website for public comments. The final draft of the APMC Act 2017 has been prepared while including the inputs of all the stakeholders and is being sent to the state governments for implementation.

 

The APMC Act primarily includes following subjects: Establishment of private market yards/ private markets managed by a person other than a market committee; direct marketing - direct purchase of agricultural produce from farmers; consumers’/ farmers’ market  to facilitate direct sale of agricultural produce to consumers;  promote and permit  e-trading; single point levy of market fee; single registration/ license  for trade/ transaction in more than one market; removal of provisions of essentiality of shop in market premises; exclude fruits and vegetables from APMC Act etc.

 

Its implementation by the state governments will help in fulfilling our Prime Minister’s dream of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. 

 

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfares said that the act provides only one market provision at the state level and promotes “Ease of doing business” model to facilitate direct marketing and private sector markets. Shri Singh said that the new act allows farmers to participate in the market management by conducting elections. Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the electronic platform has been made competitive and Mandi fee and commission charges have been rationalised. Apart from this, interstate trade is also being promoted. Shri Singh said currently regularised market is available at every 462 sq km, but as per the recommendations of National Commission ideally, a regulated market should be available to farmers within a radius of 5 Km. To achieve the same, and to provide markets for the farmers’ at their farm gates provision of declaring godowns and cold storages as market have been made. If the state governments would implement it diligently, farmers will be empowered to decide who to sell and at what price to sell. Union Agriculture Minister said that one of the important points of this scheme is that the farmers would get the price of their yields based on the quality of their product because before electronic bidding quality will be tested.

 

Shri Singh said that another important decision taken by the government is the formulation of model contract farming law.It will help in providing marketing infrastructure, developing marketing skills and in reducing risks associated with diversity in production. It will also help in preparing a price list for all commodities and improving the share of producers in consumers’ money. To achieve that, the government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary (Marketing) on February 28, 2017.

 

To further strengthen crop and fundamental marketing infrastructure, our department held a meeting with the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA). After that a committee was constituted on April 9, 2017, to establish sub-market yard. Declaring warehouse/godowns as the market is an effort to bring markets closer to the farmers and facilitate them with pledge loans. Emphasis is being given to the investment in agriculture sector. This model act offers an investment opportunity in the market infrastructure from public and private sectors. In the end, the minister stressed that it is an achievable target if the centre and the state will work together.

Adulteration in Milk is harmful to health even while it is an unfair trade practices. Further, it is a market fraud and affects the honest efforts of the milk producers. Government of India has enacted Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act -2006 in August 2006 to consolidate the laws relating to food and to establish the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for laying down science based standards for articles of food and to regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import, to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 is implemented by the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India through the State Food Safety Commissioners in each State. The State Government machinery is equally responsible in controlling the menace of sale of adulterated/synthetic milk. 

Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries is regularly reviewing the availability of milk situation in the country with National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and State Milk Federations. The Department is observed that due to increase in the international and domestic prices there will be less availability of milk and milk products in the ensuing summer season which may effect the quality of milk and milk products. The issue of adulteration of milk have been discussed in the meetings held on 23.03.2017 and 31.03.2017, under the chairmanship of Secretary(ADF) with the officers from M/o Health& Family Welfare, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India(FSSAI), and National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, which have discussed about the measures/steps to be taken for effective enforcement of the provision of Food Safety and Standard Act (FSS Act) 2006 and to ensure availability of safe & quality Milk and Milk Products to the consumers in products in coming summer season, 2017. 

Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries vide letter dated 31st March, 2017 have requested Chief Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh to take the stock of the situation and ensure immediate drive to check sale of adulterated milk in the State especially in the Western District of Uttar Pradesh.

As part of the innovative initiatives under the “White Revolution” umbrella Schemes, the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has supported the National Dairy Development Board(NDDB) developed initiative of “Quality Mark” Award Scheme for dairy Cooperatives to promote and encourage enhancement of safety, quality and hygiene of milk and milk products manufactured by dairy cooperatives. It is aimed at bringing about process improvement in the entire value chain from producer to the consumer to ensure availability of safe and quality of milk and products both for the domestic and foreign market. The Quality Mark” Award Scheme for dairy Cooperatives in the country has been initiated to instill confidence in the consumers for the quality of milk being marketed by them by ensuring availability of safe and good quality milk and milk products. The quality mark scheme was rolled out on 6th January-2016 after deliberating on the process and award mechanism for over a year. The initiative does not propose any new/ additional system for Food Safety and Quality Management but lays down minimum standards against each link of the processes required for ensuring quality and safety. 

The NDDB is in the process of registering the quality mark logo under Trademarks Act, 1998. The Dairy units which meet the criteria for award of quality mark will be allowed to use the logo on the package containing milk and milk products and the award of the quality mark shall be specific for location of the dairy unit as well as for the process for a particular product. The mark may be applied to the packaging or printed on a label affixed to the package. The logo/symbol of quality mark on milk and milk product packages indicates that the dairy unit has adopted and implemented all the processes required as per the food safety and quality management system for manufacture of milk and milk products as per the set quality parameters. 

The assessment is a two-step process involving pre-assessment and a final assessment. The pre-assessment largely covers the village level procurement and processing infrastructure availability, training manpower and the retail sales. Only those dairy units that score over 70% in the preliminary assessment are considered for final assessment which is done by a team of three experts of which one is an external expert. The final assessment is made for the evaluation of 45 critical and 97 major parameters that influence the quality of the processed milk and milk products. The award of Quality Mark shall be valid for three years subject to maintenance of quality, food safety standards and compliance with terms and conditions of the agreement. 

The guideline document for award of quality mark was finalized based on the discussions of the working group in the meetings at Anand and Delhi in November, 2014 and August 11, 2015. Thereafter, comments were sought from the members which were discussed during the roll out meeting at Anand, on 6th January, 2016 by incorporating the feedback from different stakeholders. After the finalization of quality mark documents, it was circulated to the State Milk Federations & District Milk Unions. The interested State Milk Federations /Cooperative Dairies /Educational Institutions / Govt. Dairy Units are required to apply for the award of Quality Mark Management (QM) document. The document has been finalized after a series of deliberations which began in November, 2014 and was rolled out in January 2016. 

An eleven member Management Committee has been envisaged to oversee the activities of the Quality Mark. The Management Committee has members including the representatives of DADF, FSSAI and Managing Directors of four State Milk Federations representing the regions and two Experts in Dairying. The first meeting of the Management Committee of the Quality Mark was held at Anand on March 15, 2017. Representative of the Food Safety and Standards Authority & DADF also attended the meeting. In the meeting the formal nationwide launch of the Quality Mark was discussed and it was recommended to have a formal launch of the Quality Mark after the current Parliament Session by the Hon’ble Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. 

Since roll out of quality mark initiative by NDDB, on 6th January, 2016, NDDB has so far received 53 applications (comprising Karnataka-13, Mother Dairy-8, Punjab-4, Tamil Nadu-5, Haryana-4, Bihar-11, Maharashtra-4, MP-4) for award of the Quality Mark. Out of 53, 30 applications have been assessed and 13 Dairy Units have been found eligible for award of Quality Mark logo by NDDB.

                So far 39.75 lakh farmers and 88474 traders have registered and trade of Rs 15,009 crores has taken through the e-NAM portal

 

A national consultation to review the progress of adoption of reforms and other initiatives in the agri-marketing sector aimed at enhancing farmers’ income was held yesterday, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog. The meeting was also attended by Shri S.K. Pattanayak, Secretary DAC&FW, Dr. Ashok Dalwai, Additional Secretary, DAC&FW, senior officers from DAC FW, Niti Aayog, Ministry of   Environment, Forests & CC and Deptts. of Agricultural Marketing, Forest and Revenue from the State Govts /UTs.

 

DAC F&W has, in consultation with NITI Aayog, identified a set of 9 marketing reforms to be made in Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Acts of the States/UTs. These include 3 mandatory reforms enabling integration to e-NAM viz provision for e-trading, unified trading license and a single point levy of market fee, as well as setting up markets in the private sector, direct marketing, etc all aimed at reducing the intermediaries between producer and buyer so as to ensure remunerative prices to the farmer. The States were also advised to relax the felling and transit rules for trees being grown by farmers on their own lands so as to encourage agroforestry which has a huge potential for supplementing the income from agriculture.

 

The salient features of the new model Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act, 2017 drafted by DACF&W were also discussed. This encompasses the reforms being advocated for a transparent market enabling price discovery and competition where farmers would have multiple options to sell their produce, including the eNAM platform. This has been developed after extensive consultations with States/UTs, Ministries and the public and is in the final stages of approval. The Dept is also in the process of drafting a model Contract Farming Act and the States were requested to send their views to enable drafting of a wholesome Act. E-NAM which has barely completed a year of implementation is already proving to be very beneficial as evidenced by increasing number of States coming on board, traders and farmers registration and volume and value of trade being done online. So far 417 markets from 13 States have joined the online-portal, which targets integration of 585 markets by March 2018. So far 39.75 lakh farmers and 88474 traders have registered and trade of Rs 15,009 crores has taken through the e-NAM portal.

Laying great emphasis on the special issues confronting the States of the North East, it was decided that a dedicated meeting for the region would be convened at Niti Aayog very shortly.  

Dr. Ramesh Chand, Member NITI Aayog concluded the meeting by encouraging the State Governments to work on these reforms to fulfill the vision of Hon’ble PM for doubling the farmers’ income by 2022. Dr. Chand reiterated that agriculture and allied activities have a significant role to play in transforming rural India.

 

A meeting of Agriculture Ministers of the States/UTs is being convened by Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister on 24th April 2017 highlighting the importance being given by Govt to post harvest management in which agricultural marketing has a crucial role.

Realizing the immense scope for development of fisheries and aquaculture, the Government of India has restructured the Central Plan Scheme under an umbrella of Blue Revolution. The restructured Central Sector Scheme on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries (CSS) approved by the Government provides for a focused development and management of the fisheries sector to increase both fish production and fish productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources of the inland and marine fisheries sector including deep sea fishing. 

The scheme has the following components:
i. National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and its activities.
ii. Development of Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture.
iii. Development of Marine Fisheries, Infrastructure and Post-Harvest Operations.
iv. Strengthening of Database & Geographical Information System of the Fisheries Sector.
v. Institutional Arrangement for Fisheries Sector.
vi. Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) and other need-based Interventions.
vii. National Scheme on Welfare of Fishermen.
The Scheme Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries is being implemented in consultation with all States & UTs. Besides the activities undertaken under both the marine and inland sectors, no specific role for the coastal states has been defined. 

The Blue Revolution is being implemented to achieve economic prosperity of fishermen and fish farmers and to contribute towards food and nutritional security through optimum utilization of water resources for fisheries development in a sustainable manner, keeping in view the bio-security and environmental concerns. 

Under the scheme, it has been targeted to enhance the fish production from 107.95 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to about 150 lakh tonnes by the end of the financial year 2019-20. It is also expected to augment the export earnings with a focus on increased benefit flow to the fishers and fish farmers to attain the target of doubling their income. 

The Department has prepared a detailed National Fisheries Action Plan-2020(NFAP) for the next 5 years with an aim of enhancing fish production and productivity and to achieve the concept of Blue Revolution. The approach was initiated considering the various fisheries resources available in the country like ponds & tanks, wetlands, brackish water, cold water, lakes & reservoirs, rivers and canals and the marine sector. 

This information was given by the Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Sudarshan Bhagat, in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                A MoU was signed here today between Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) for geotagging of agriculture land in presence of Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh and Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Minister of State, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Development of North Eastern Region, Ministry of Personnel Public Grievances & Pensions. Shri Shobhna K Patnaik, Secretary DAC & FW, Dr. Kiran Kumar, President, ISRO, Director, NRASA DAC and senior officer of NRASA were also present on this occasion.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) works for the development of Agriculture & allied sectors by motivating the states. More than 1.5 lakh assets have been created/ developed under this scheme in agriculture, horticulture, livestock, fisheries and dairy sectors.  It is imperative to formulate a national index of the assets to understand them, systemize them and to reduce the gap between demand and supply. 

Agriculture Minister said that the government is committed to transparency in governance.  Shri Singh said that development of space-related technologies to prepare the list of the assets and their utilisation is a progressive step.  Being aware of the realistic status of assets will not only be helpful in monitoring and utilising, but also be extremely useful in formulating development schemes in the agriculture sector. Agriculture Minister added that it will also help in avoiding duplication and pave the way for harmonising a balance between the various schemes of the ministry.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh further added that there is unlimited scope for agriculture development by utilising satellite and remote sensing technologies. The government wants farmers to avail the benefits provided by these technologies. Shri Singh said that by utilising space-related technologies farmers will get timely information about pesticide/residue testing labs, storage infrastructure and agriculture markets. 

Agriculture Minister informed that the space technology needs to be developed in the areas such as land resource mapping, pesticides management, soil health mapping, crop yield estimation as well as the identification and assessment of floods like calamities, inland fisheries, animal species identification and sheep rearing and when the technology is developed, the farmers can enjoy quick and instant benefits. 

Shri Singh said very soon farmers would utilise the internet and mobile phones to obtain agriculture related information such as fertility of soil, the quantity of fertiliser to be used, condition for sowing potential pests aggression, estimation of yield, godowns, cold storage, agriculture markets as well as identification and availabilities of animal species.

Agriculture Minister showered both the teams as well as states with praise for applying space and remote sensing technologies to monitor agriculture-related assets under RKVY.

                1.    What is geo tagging? 

 

·         Geotagging- It is the process of adding geographical identification like latitude and longitude to various media such as a photo or video. Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. It provides users the location of the content of a given picture.

 

·         Geomapping-a  visual representation of the geographical location of geotagged assets  layered on top of map or satellite imagery

 

2.             Why is Geotagging important?

 

·       Several assets are created in the states under various schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Under RKVY also, states have been utilising substantial amount of funds for creation of infrastructure/assets in agriculture and allied sectors such as soil testing labs, pesticide testing labs,  bio fertiliser setting units, custom hiring centres,  vaccine production units , veterinary diagnosis labs , dispensaries , milk collection centres , fish production units, godowns, cold storage, shade nets, pandals for vegetable cultivation   etc. Monitoring of such wide spread activities is of paramount importance to states and Government of India to understand flow of funds, inventorising the assets, bringing in transparency, planning of assets for future, and finally informing the farmers about the facilities available.

·       PM on several occasions emphasised on use of technology for reporting of assets created through geo-tagging (example: drought review meeting held on 14/ 05/2016).Finance Minister also highlighted monitoring of MGNREGA assets through Geotagging in his budget speech.

·       Geotagging for monitoring of assets is already started in Ministry of Rural Development for MGNREGA and Department of Land Resources for monitoring of watershed activities in the states. Postal department has also geotagged the post offices using NRSC Bhuvan Platform.

 

3.             Who does it?

 

·           National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) , ISRO at  Hyderabad : This  centre of ISRO has a software platform, Bhuvan that allows users to explore a 2D/3D representation of the surface of the Earth. It also acts as a platform for hosting government data. Bhuvan Application Services that are diversified and relevant for many ministries were released.

 

·            NRSC is involved in mapping of resources (Postal, GAIL, Forest etc) as well as monitoring of assets created under various schemes of Ministry of water Resources, Ministry of rural development etc. 

 

·       The assets created under RKVY could be monitored by Geotagging them using BHUVAN, a geoplatforn of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of ISRO, Hyderabad. In future, the location of the infrastructure created and distances from each other could also be utilised for arriving at distribution of assets and optimum number of that particular asset required in a district or state.  The process involves development of a mobile app for mapping the assets through photographs and Geo-tagging (providing geo co-ordinates) before hosting on to DAC –RKVY platform that would be specially created for RKVY monitoring. 

 

Proposal for geotagging of infrastructure /assets created under RKVY: 

 

·         Therefore, it is proposed to prepare inventory of the assets created in the last one decade (2007-2017) under RKVY through Geotagging technique.  National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), wing of Indian Space Research Organisation is providing technical support to RKVY division and has come up with a detailed procedure for the same. The institute is involved in preparation of the required app, imparting training to the states etc..The trained officers at the field level will take the photographs (with details of latitude, longitude, year of creation etc.) of the assets and upload on to the Bhuvan-RKVY platform of NRSC. 

 

·         So far NRSC has developed RKVY app, training manual, imparted training to 17 states regarding use of the app. The organisation will provide technical backstopping till the Geotagging exercise is completed. Pilot work has been initiated in 4 sattes of Orissa, Maharashtra, Bihar and Karnataka.  

 

·         A formal MoU is proposed  to be signed between DAC&FW and NRSC regarding use of BHUVAN for launching BHUVAN-RKVY platform. It is proposed to sign the MoU on 6th April .Minsters of Agriculture, Department of Science, Secretary (DAC&FW), Director ISRO, Director NRSA and other senior officers from both the sides are expected to be present during the ceremony.

 Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed the people on the inauguration of International Centre for FMD (ICFMD) in Arugul, Jatni, Bhubaneswar.

Bhubneswar: Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that Government of India has taken a number of steps for the promotion as well as conservation of livestock extending benefits to the farmers. He further said that healthy livestock is conducive for the welfare of the farmers.  If livestock are healthy, the income of the farmers will increase.  It is a result of the initiative taken by the Government of India that country is enjoying the first rank in milk production in the world. Apart from this country has acquired third rank in egg production. The Minister of Agriculture stated it on the inauguration of International Centre for FMD (ICFMD) in Arugul, Jatni, Bhubneswar.

The Minister of Agriculture has narrated that for the first time in the country, a Pashudhan Sanjivani Nakul Swasth Patra Scheme has been launched for sustaining the health of livestock. Along with this UID is framing out the identity base of the livestock as well as a national data related thereof.  For the first time in the country, a new initiative entitled as Rashtriya Gokul Mission along with the allocation of Rs. 500 crores has been initiated in December 2014 for the conservation as well promotion of domestic species under National Bovine Genetic and Dairy Development programme. Under this mission 14 gokul villages are being established and 41 livestock zones are being made sophisticated with more allocated funds for the improvement in bulls species.  A National Bovine Genetic Centre has been established for the improvement in domestic species.  For the first time in the country e-livestock portal has been launched.

The Minister of Agriculture on this occasion realized that virus borne FMD as well as influenza like disorders pose serious challenges for the health of livestock. The bovines, buffaloes as well as pig species are mainly affected through these disorders. More than 50 crores livestock across the country are very much prone to these disorders. The Minister of Agriculture added that his government is doing his best for the prevention of FMD.

The Minister of Agriculture while expressing his expectations said that this International Laboratory will play an important role for the management of this disorder along with the infrastructures of bio security and bio-control in the arena of global as well as SAARC partnership. The Minister also praised the scientists and officers associated with this laboratory for their mention worthy performance.

The Minister of Agriculture laid the foundation of KVK in Orissa Agriculture and Technology University in Bhubaneswar. On this eve, Union Petroleum Minister Mr. Dharmendra Pradhan and VC, Orissa Agriculture & Technology University, Prof. S. Pasupalak were also present.

On this juncture, the Minister of Agriculture opined that Orissa Agriculture & Technology University had been established so as to meet the necessities of the farmers in the state. This is the second largest university in the country and the only agriculture university in the state.

                Rs 50,000 crores to be invested for revival of closed fertilizer plants and setting up of gas pipeline network to connect Eastern India to National Gas Grid: Shri Dharmendra Pradhan



 

Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananthkumar presided over a Joint review meeting on revival plans for closed fertilizer projects under Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers here today. The review was jointly held with Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan and Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Chemical & Fertilizer, Shri Mansukh Lal Mandaviya. Senior officers from the three Ministries were present during the meeting.

 

Addressing the media after the meeting, Shri Ananthkumar informed that with the revival of the fertilizer projects, Gorakhpur, Barauni, Sindri and Talcher, an additional annual production capacity of 75 LMT would be created making India self-reliant in meeting the annual domestic demand of around 320 LMT, from being a net importer currently. Financial allocations and the ground level work would start in 2017 and the five plants would become fully functional by 2020-21, he added.

 

Shri Kumar said that for realising Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Fertilizer Security for Food Security’, the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, in coordination with Ministries of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Power & Coal, is following a two-pronged strategy. This strategy includes existing fertilizer capacity augmentation by increasing the efficiency of the plants and revival of closed fertilizer projects. Shri Kumar mentioned that there has been highest ever production of urea, 245 LMT, in the country in the previous year without incurring any additional cost and utilising the existing capacity. He further mentioned that the 100% Neem Coating Urea has increased the per granule efficiency of urea by decreasing demand by 10% and increasing the yield by 10%.

 

Informing the media about the role of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas in the revival plan, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that a massive investment to the tune of Rs. 50,000 crores is being undertaken for revival of closed fertilizer plants and setting up of gas pipeline network to connect Eastern India to the National Gas Grid. Production from these four major Fertilizer plants will ensure enhanced domestic fertilizer production and availability which will give an impetus to the vital agricultural sector there by aiding the Second Green Revolution, he added.

 

Shri Pradhan informed that the progress of the construction of the pipeline network in eastern India, including the 2,650 km Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline, popularly known as ‘Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga’, and the 50 LMT Dhamra LNG terminal was reviewed in the meeting. A total investment of Rs. 13,000 crores for the pipeline and of Rs 6,000 crores for Dhamra LNG terminal is going to be undertaken, he added.

 

The Minister said that this pipeline network would provide uninterrupted feedstock linkage to the revived fertilizer plants, wherein Gorakhpur, Barauni and Sindri plants would be natural gas based and Talcher would be coal gasification technology based, for which coal linkages have already been provided. Shri Pradhan added that the foundation stones for the five fertilizer plants would be laid down post monsoon this year and would be completed by 2020-21.

 

The Talcher Unit is being revived by a consortium of PSUs namely Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers (RCF), Gas Authority of India (GAIL), Coal India Ltd. (CIL) and FCIL by investing Rs. 8,000 crores.  Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), CIL & National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) have registered a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) by name Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL) for revival of closed urea plants of FCIL at Gorakhpur and Sindri and of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (HFCL) at Barauni, by an investment of Rs. 20,000 crores. An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) has also been constituted to oversee the revival process.

                Government focusing upon Multi modal publicity campaign to spread awareness about the use of generic drugs in the country 
 


Minister of State for Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, while giving a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today on steps taken by the Government to spread awareness about the use of and increase access to generic drugs in the country, said that as on 05.04.2017, 1110 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) Kendras are functional in the country.

 Further, the Minister informed the House that in order to promote the use of generic drugs in the country and with the objective of making available quality generic drugs at affordable prices to all, a countrywide campaign in the name of PMBJP has been started. However, to ensure coverage across the entire country, especially in rural areas, various steps have been taken by the Government such as:

·         In order to spread awareness about the use of generic drugs in the country, BPPI has initiated publicity campaigns around PMBJP Kendras through hoardings, bulk SMS, mobile exhibitions, distribution of pamphlets, etc. for spreading awareness about the scheme and its objective of providing affordable and quality generic medicines. Also, a 15 days Radio/FM campaign was also launched in various States of the country.

·         Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), the implementing agency of PMBJP, has released advertisements in various newspapers in the country during December 2016 inviting applications from private individuals for opening of PMBJP Kendras. The response has been overwhelmingly encouraging and as on 05.04.2017, 28,301 applications have been received out of which in-principle approval has been given to 24,049 applications.

·         Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) have been signed with various State Government/Organisations/NGOs to promote opening of PMBJP Kendras across the country.

·         The scheme guidelines have been amended to enable opening of PMBJP Kendras in various Government owned buildings like Municipalities/Panchayati Raj Institutions/Post Offices, etc. and incentivizing of weaker sections to participate in the scheme.

 

The PMBJP scheme provides more than 600 medicines and 154 surgicals and consumables at affordable prices in all therapeutic categories such as Anti-infectives, Anti-diabetics, Cardiovasculars, Anti-cancers, Gastro-intestinal medicines, etc. For impeccable quality assurance, each batch of drug supply to PMBJP Kendras is tested at National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited laboratories empanelled by the BPPI.

 

The Minister also stated that Public Health being a State subject, the primary responsibility of supply of medicines including lifesaving medicines free of cost to the patients in public/Government Healthcare Centres primarily lies with the State/UT Governments. Under the National Health Mission (NHM), support is provided to the States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare delivery system including for provision of free essential drugs to those who access public health facilities, based on the requirement posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation is committed to providing air connectivity to currently underserved and unserved airports. To make air travel accessible to citizens in regionally important cities, the Ministry launched ‘Ude Deshka Aam Naagrik’ (UDAN) Regional Connectivity Scheme in October, 2016. The UDAN Scheme was developed through extensive consideration of various issues and consultations with stakeholders. This is a first-of-its-kind scheme globally to stimulate regional connectivity through a market-based mechanism. 

The UDAN Scheme is a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) which was released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 15th June, 2016. The AAI followed a transparent bidding process by inviting interested bidders and airline operators to submit their Initial Proposals under the provisions of Regional Connectivity Scheme and subsequently inviting counter proposals against such Initial Proposals. The routes and networks are awarded to bidders who submitted valid proposals and quoted the lowest viability gap funding (VGF) from the government for such routes and networks.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency, have issued Letter of Awards for 27 proposals received under RCS-UDAN. Key features of the proposals awarded by AAI include:


•    Airports to be connected: 27 currently served airports, 12 currently underserved airports and 31 currently unserved airports (for a total of 70 airports) will be connected through these 27 proposals.


•    Geographical spread: There is a good geographical spread in the proposals: 24 airports in the western, 17 in north, 11 in south, 12 in east and 6 in north-eastern regions are proposed to be connected. 22 states and 2 Union Territories will be connected through these 27 proposals.


•    Routes and network: 16 awarded proposals are for single routes (connecting two cities) and 11 are for networks (connecting three or more cities). Six proposals have been bid with zero viability gap funding (VGF) reflecting the fact that there is potential latent demand.


•    VGF Outflow: 27 proposals will required a VGF of around Rs. 200 crores and will provide around 6.5 lakh RCS seats.

The airfare for a one hour journey of appx. 500 km on a fixed wing aircraft or for a 30 minute journey on a helicopter would be capped at Rs. 2,500, with proportionate pricing for routes of different stage lengths and flight duration. The selected airline operator would have to provide 50% of the flight capacity (subject to a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 40) as RCS Seats for operationsthrough fixed wing aircraft and a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 13 RCS Seats on the RCS Flights for operations through helicopters and would be given a three years exclusivity of operations.To reduce the cost of operations of airlines on flying such routes, a financial stimulus in the form of concessions from Central and State government, airport operators and the Viability Gap Funding to the interested airlines would be provided to kick-off operations from such airports, so that the passenger fares are kept affordable. State Government will provide a certain share of VGF (20% for States other than North-East States where the ratio will be 10% of VGF determined). In this regard, till now 19 States and 3 UTs have signed MoU whereas 5 more States have given consent to sign MoU.

As per the statistics furnished by Airports Authority of India (AAI), total passenger traffic (both domestic and international) at all Indian Airports during 2016-17 (Apr’16-Feb’17) witnessed a growth rate of 18.9%. Total air cargo at all Indian Airports during 2016-17 (Apr’16-Feb’17) witnessed a growth rate of 9.3%.

 

Main steps taken by Government for growth of air cargo are as follows:

 

(i)    The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has got the Dwell-Time study conducted at six major airports in the recent past to identify the reasons for higher dwell time in Indian Airports and corrective action(s) required. The free period for air cargo has been reduced from 72 hours to 48 hours w.e.f. 1st April, 2017.

(ii)   The concept of 24x7customs clearance of Import/Export Cargo has been initiated at 13 airports.

(iii)  The concept of ''Single Window'' has been launched by Customs w.e.f. 1st April,2016 in phased manner which inter-alia ensures on-line clearance from various regulatory agencies.

(iv)    For handling International Cargo at its airports, AAI has provided Automatic Storage & Retrieval System (AS&RS) as well as Elevated Transfer Vehicle (ETV) facilities for handling both import and export cargo respectively at Chennai & Kolkata Airports.

(v)   All the International Air Cargo Terminals managed by AAI are well equipped with sufficient storage space, cargo handling equipment, cold rooms for perishable cargo and other basic facilities.

(vi)  The Common User Domestic Cargo Terminal (CUDCT) concept has been introduced for maximum utilization of facilities.

(vii)  AAI has prepared a road map to create cargo infrastructure and facilities at 24 AAI Airports initially provide impetus to economic growth and development on pan-India basis to ensure harmonious growth of all regions in India.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, presided over the inaugural session of the day-long Workshop on ‘Quality of Coal’ as Chief Guest here today.The workshop included brainstorming and technical sessions among the stakeholders of the coal and power sectors so as to bring in greater efficiency and self-sufficiency in the two sectors in India.

 

During his inaugural address, Shri Goyal encouraged the distinguished gathering of stakeholders of the coal and power sectors to work in a mission mode to make India self-reliant in Coal reserves, bring in transparency, remove corruption and serve every Indian by ensuring Affordable, Quality, 24x7 Power for All. The Minister said that the “Difference between the Possible and Impossible lies in a Man’s determination and I am delighted to see firm determination in everyone in this gathering to achieve the above mission.”

 

Emphasizing on the importance of high quality coal, Shri Goyal said that the country has achieved an important milestone of adequate quantity of coal, now it is a quest for quality and preventing grade slippages. The Minister informed that there has been a reduction of about 8% in the per unit coal consumption for power generation, which is a significant achievement in India’s coal history.

 

The Minister said that the Government is fast opening up the coal sector to competition in near future and private miners would be coming into the sector to bring in competition. he also said that we are working towards bring linearity in pricing of coal between lower and higher grades.

 

Shri Goyal also informed the gathering that after sustained dialogue, the Tamil Nadu government has finally communicated to the Centre its willingness for setting up the Cheyyur UMPP based on domestic coal instead of imported coal. This will lead to a step further in achieving self-reliance on domestic coal based thermal power in India and would generate confidence in our own capacities.

 

Appreciating the importance of the current session, the Minister said that there is a need to have inclusive brainstorming sessions like this which involve all stakeholders of the coal and power sector, with the focus on the underprivileged section of the society, for whom electricity is a necessity and not a luxury. Shri Goyal added that every stakeholder should keep a picture of this section of society in mind and should work hard to provide Affordable, Quality 24x7 Power for All.

 

The Minister directed officials of the Ministry to develop a whistleblower mechanism to address the complaints of the coal grade slippages and to rein in corruption in the coal and power sectors. Further, he encouraged all the stakeholders present during the session to take their job as a mission to serve every Indian rather than a performance linked incentive based task.

 

In his valedictory address, Shri Goyal reviewed the results of the day-long deliberations and gave some action points to all stakeholders present. These include developing responsibility and timelines matrices for the implementation of the action points, quantifying the gains of this process, developing a monitoring mechanism to ensure accountability, bringing out a whistleblower policy to check corruption in the sector, inter alia.

 

The Minister laid stress on the coal sector achieving cost effectiveness, improving viability of mines by effective and efficient mining, ensuring safety measures, continuing the quality thrust and foremost on customer satisfaction. He strictly directed all the officials to weed out red tape and facilitate rationalization of coal linkages and to clear pending requests for third party sampling from both public and private sector players on a priority basis. Finally, Shri Goyal stressed that the hallmark of CIL should be concern and responsiveness towards the customer.

 

Speaking in the inaugural session, Secretary, Coal, Shri Susheel Kumar informed the gathering that from 1stApril, fresh grades of coal have been issued for each mine and coal dispatch centre. With this step, he said that the grade slippage in coal supplied to consumers will become minimum. In case if the grade slippage exceeds the determined cap, senior officials will be held responsible for it, he added. The ministry is focusing on 4 important areas including safety, quality, environmental protection and diversification into new areas using latest technology. Shri Kumar said that he would be personally tracking progress on these 4 parameters every 15 days and was of opinion that with such preventive measures taken proactively, the country would not need third party sampling after 6 months.

 

Shri Sutirtha Bhattacharya, Chairman, CIL, during the inaugural session, said that in October 2014 there were many thermal power plants with critical shortage of coal stocks that were enough to meet only 5-6 days of power demand. Today, thermal power plants in the country are coal surplus and have 100 million tonnes of coal stocks which is enough to meet the minimum inventory requirement of 22 days. CIL is working towards a quest for quantity only with the adherence to strictest quality benchmarks, he added.

 

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Suresh Kumar, Additional Secretary Coal, Shri R.K. Verma, Chairman CEA, along with senior officials of the Ministries of Power & Railways, CIL, coal producers & consumers and quality rating agencies.

Department of Commerce, Government of India in collaboration with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) and other knowledge partners is organizing the 4th National Standards Conclave on 1-2 May 2017 at New Delhi. 

            The objective of the two day Conclave is to bring awareness and prepare Industries, Central Government Ministries, State Governments, regulatory/standards setting and conformity assessment bodies on the growing importance of “Standards” in the changing scenario of global trade.

          The Standards Conclave is being held in the backdrop of diminishing importance of tariffs and rising influence of standards and regulation both in goods and services trade.

             It must be recognized that the days of differential standards – low for domestic market and high for exports - are over and if the Indian industry has to survive and thrive, it has to adopt global standards. The Ministries/regulators/state governments have to also realize that their initiatives and schemes have to be built around global standards if they have to succeed in their objectives.

             A good standards regime shall fulfill the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister for “Make in India” campaign. It would also help in preventing flooding of domestic market with unsafe/sub-standard imports at the expense of our domestic industry as well as consumers.

             Our collective endeavor has to be in creating an ecosystem where adoption of appropriate standards leads to a sense of pride and has in-built incentive for the Industry. The Conclave would also aim at preparing an Indian National Strategy for Standardization (INSS) document to  enable the development of  a harmonized, dynamic, and  mature standards ecosystem in India 

 The conclave will have 9 sessions spread over 2 days:

             i.            Inaugural session

ii.            Session 1: Theme paper on National Strategy on Standards

iii.           Session 2: Standards as drivers/disruptors of international trade

iv.            Session 3: MSME’s and Standards – gap analysis for an Indian National Standards Strategy

v.             Session 4: Standards in goods: Addressing issues in a policy framework

vi.            Session 5: Risk assessment in agri-food trade and policy options

vii.         Session 6: Services Sector: A robust standards ecosystem and conformity assessment within a policy framework: (Tourism, Medical Value Travel, and Education)

viii.          Session 7: Digital and IT standards: Meeting Future Challenges

ix.            Session 8: Standards for Skills and skills based services

x.             Session 9: Way Forward

Dr A. Jayathilak, Chairman, Spices Board informed that the Board has been trying to aggregate the small and marginal farmers at village in Arunachal Pradesh and other north-eastern States and is encouraging farmers to adopt spice cultivation and processing as an agribusiness activity by initiating the formation of entities like SFPCs and establishing links with the buyers and exporters. 

The SFPCs would aim at aggregation of the farmers in the identified spices growing districts to establish direct market linkages with exporters, processors and institutional buyers through buyer-seller meets, while aiding the farming community in better price realization consorted and scientific post-harvest management, primary processing, value addition, packaging and direct marketing. The SFPCs will also facilitate participation of cultivators of spices in national and international trade fairs.

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman will inaugurate the orientation programme for establishment of SFPCs and buyer seller meet on 26th April 2017 at Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, a Government of India’s initiative to benefit the small and marginal spice farmers in the North Eastern States. 

In the event, more than 100 spice farmers, NGOs, farmers association, primary processors from Arunachal Pradesh and 35 big exporters from across the country will be coming together for a one day orientation programme and buyer seller meet organized by Spices Board at the Banquet Hall of the city. Officials from the concerned Department/Organizations of the State as well as Central Government will also be a part of the programme. 

The objective of the programme is to operationalize SFPC on pilot basis in 3 districts viz. Ziro in Lower Subansiri District for large cardamom and Namsai in Namsai District for ginger in Arunachal Pradesh & West District in Sikkim for large cardamom for empowering the farmers, especially women farmers in the identified spices growing districts, for better price realization through post harvest management, primary processing, value addition, packing, aggregation, organic certification etc. 

Each SFPC will have 500 farmers as members in a sub-division or district. The farmers will be identified on cluster basis in a village, taluk or district by forming Farmer Interest Group(FIGs), each consisting of 20 farmers. 25 such FIGs will be formed to establish a SFPC.

                The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM)in collaboration with the International Trademark Association (INTA) kicked off the IPR Awareness campaign for schools across the country in New Delhi at Kendriya Vidyalaya, RK Puram Sector 2. 

The National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, which was approved by the Union Cabinet on 12th May 2016, is a significant move forward to encourage creativity and stimulate innovation in the country. 

Joint Secretary Rajiv Aggarwal from DIPP said IPR Awareness: Outreach and Promotion is the first and foremost objective of the National IPR Policy and is critical to shaping an IP environment that is conducive to fostering creativity & innovation in the country. He said that one of the key focus areas is children in schools, as it is essential to nurture creativity and the ability to innovate from a young age. Mr Aggarwal said a streamlined system is being worked out to conduct over 3500 awareness programmes in schools, universities and the industry across the country including Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities as well as rural areas along with translating the content to various regional languages for a wider reach. 

The programme was an hour long interactive session with a presentation delivered by the INTA Working Group which included various games and activities to keep the kids engaged. Along with the presentation, colorful and vibrant posters on different IPs were put up and mementos including a brochure on IP designed for kids was given to all students in attendance of the session.

                Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has reiterated that GeM is the most transparent, accountable and efficient public procurement portal and has already resulted in savings of crores of Rupees to the Government. In a press conference today she strongly denied the charges levelled against GeM by the Congress Party. 

In the Press conference held on 21st April 2017 by Congress spokesperson Sh. Randeep Surjewala, he levelled charges of irregularities against the Government e-Marketplace (GeM). The basis of Sh. Surjewala’s allegations were the alleged letters written by a Union Minister and few BJP MPs to the Hon’ble Union Commerce & Industry Minister. 

Department of Commerce strongly denies the baseless, motivated and malafide charges levelled by Sh Surjewala against GeM. 

Sh Ajay Nishad, Hon’ble MP(LS) has already denied in writing for having written the said letter to Hon’ble Commerce & Industry Minister and has instead complimented her for setting up a transparent portal for public procurement. It is pertinent to mention that the letters of Sh. Nishad and Sh. Ashok M Nete (MP)(LS) are exactly similar. In addition, the letters written by 6 Hon’ble MPs (LS), Sh Harish Dwivedi, Sh Arjun Lal Meena, Sh Alok Sanjar, Sh Rajesh Verma, Sh Radheshyam Biswas and Sh Kaushal Kishore, have all put in the similar request of extension of Software, Storage, Networking, Security items on DGS&D Rate Contract. Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Hon’ble MoS Health and Family welfare, in his letter to Hon’ble Commerce and Industry Minister has just forwarded the representation of a company which lost out a big order due to timely intervention by GeM. 

The above-mentioned facts clearly indicate that there are vested interest operating behind this malicious campaign against GeM and in all likelihood, it appears to be the handiwork of certain interested group who have been badly hit owing to discontinuation of RC and development of a transparent platform. It is unfortunate that the Congress Party is supporting an opaque system and is against transparency in public procurement and good governance and has allowed its spokesperson to speak against GeM without verifying facts. 

The items for which Sh. Surjewala has given GeM rates and e-Commerce portal rates are different items and they cannot be compared. On the contrary, GeM rates are much lower than the market rates and it has been worked out that Government has made a saving of over Rs 100 Crore in the total procurement of about Rs 450 Crore that has so far taken place through GeM. 

Government as a policy is reducing the items on RC and bringing them on GeM which is a transparent portal. RC system has a number of limitations. 

The processes on GeM are completely transparent and GeM is the first Government portal that places all the procurements- big or small- by Government organizations in public domain, with details about the buyer, seller, item, quantity and price. 

GeM has removed all the registration restrictions on businesses for supplying to the Government. For the first time, vendors from small towns are getting an opportunity to do business with the Government, in contrast to the erstwhile RC system where not more than 2500-3500 suppliers were holding monopoly to supply to the Government at fixed rates. There are adequate checks and balances in place on GeM which do not allow suppliers to get away with supplying at a higher price to the Government, than the prevailing market or Last Procurement Price (LPP). A number of advisories issued by GeM in this regard to Government buyers along with action taken against a few delinquent suppliers speak volumes about the high transparency and accountability standards on GeM.

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has said that Government believes in active sharing of ideas and responding to citizen’s queries. On completion of one year of Twitter Seva/MOCI Seva she said Today marks the one full year of Twitter Seva/ MOCI Seva, which is Ministry of Commerce & Industry Seva. The Minister said It was a hashtag that we created for the ministry, just so that we would be able to answer any query related to the ministry or complaints that people want us to look into and serve the cause. 

Smt. Sitharaman said she was glad that people had approached in quite a big number and 99% had been served within the limitation that we had set for ourselves that is 2 working days. She said the number of queries were more that complaints and she would request anyone who would want to approach the Commerce and Industry Ministry to feel free to use the ‘Seva’. The Minister thanked the people for using the ‘Seva’ and looked forward to serving in even more and better way. 

MOCISEVA was launched on 21st April, 2016. It is a girevance redressal mechanism via twitter where grievances are addressed pertaining to various divisions of Ministry of Commerce & Industries. Through this Seva the Ministry has not only responded to queries that pertain to its own Divisions but has responded to almost 1000 queries that belonged to other ministries.

                The Indian delegation led by the Commerce and Industry Minister of State Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, participated in day-long India conference in Nagoya city, in Aichi Prefecture of Japan.

Governor of Aichi Prefecture, Hideaki Ohmura thanked the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for establishing the Aichi Desk in 2016 within the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). Governor Hideaki acknowledged that the India Conference will further encourage the companies in Aichi Prefecture to invest in India.

Smt. Sitharaman commended the contribution of Aichi Prefecture towards manufacturing value addition despite high savings rate among the Prefectures in Japan. It was discussed that India could learn from Aichi Prefecture as to how manufacturing can grow along with savings. The Minister acknowledged the increase in FDI from Japan in recent years. Although Japan is the 3rd largest foreign investor in India (USD 25.2 Billion in cumulative FDI during the April 2000 – December 2016), behind Mauritius and Singapore (ranked 1 and 2) , it can be considered a top investor as the other two countries are used by companies from across the world to route investments.

Smt. Sitharaman urged the Governor to consider diversification of investment in other sectors such as Food Processing, Textiles, Medical Equipment, Electronics, Information Technology, etc. Both sides agreed for deeper engagement in future.

The Minister invited Governor Hideaki to lead a delegation of Japanese companies to MSME clusters in India to explore partnership and investment opportunities. It was discussed that the delegation could visit before the expected visit of Japanese Prime Minister in second half of 2017. Governor Hideaki mentioned that Aichi Prefecture companies have an appetite to grow their business overseas and hoped the partnership would bring prosperity to both sides.

The Minister reiterated the potential for huge synergies between India and Aichi Prefecture. She highlighted key reforms undertaken to ease the business operations in India including passage of Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill, advancement of the Budget session, introduction of a new Insolvency and Bankruptcy code, reduction in corporate tax and commitment to level it with international benchmarks, etc.

Smt. Sitharaman also emphasized the importance of flagship initiatives including Digital India, Start-Up India, and JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhar, and Mobile) trinity in driving the future growth. She said India wants to increase the contribution of manufacturing sector to GDP to 25% and Japan is a natural partner in our goals.Ambassador of India to Japan Sh Sujan Chinoy termed Commerce and Industry Minister's visit as a rare opportunity to review economic relations between the two countries.

A presentation on 'Make in India’ was made by Secretary DIPP, Mr. Ramesh Abhishek. The Secretary highlighted the unparalleled opportunities and advantages that investors could leverage by Making in India. The Secretary stressed on the recent reforms undertaken on Ease of Doing Business, the investments being made and planned for skilling under the Skill India program, and strengthening of Intellectual Property Regime.

The Indian economy is more open than ever with 100% FDI allowed in most sectors and the impact was shown in the comparison of FDI data from before and after the launch of 'Make in India' initiative. Total FDI increased by 56% from USD 83.7 Billion during July 2012-September 2014 period to USD 130.4 Billion during October 2014-January 2017 period; during the same period equity FDI increased by 69% from USD 57 Billion to USD 96.1 Billion. Secretary further highlighted the huge investments India is making in Infrastructure development .

Several meetings with leading Japanese companies were held to explore areas of mutual cooperation. The Minister also held interaction with the Japanese and Indian media.

                The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in partnership with the World Bank Group, released the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2017 for implementation by States/UTs on 13.04.2017.

       The BRAP includes 405 recommendations for reforms on regulatory processes, policies, practices and  procedures spread across 12 reform areas, that is, labour regulation enablers; contract enforcement; registering property; inspection reform enablers; single window system; land availability and allotment; construction permit enablers; environmental registration enablers; obtaining utility permits; paying taxes; access to information and transparency enablers and sector specific reforms spanning the lifecycle of a typical business.

       This year there are 103 new set of reforms (out of 405) focusing on central inspection system, online land allotment system, online single window system for granting construction permits, registration under Inter State Migrant Workmen (RE&CS) Act, 1979, approval for boiler manufacturer and boiler erector etc.  BRAP 2017 also includes two new sectors i.e. Healthcare and Hospitality. The last date to implement the reform is 31.10.2017.

      DIPP will carry out a comprehensive business-to-government (B2G) feedback exercise this year whereby feedback will be taken from businesses on the quality of implementation of the reforms claimed by the States and UTs. For each State/UT, the scores will be aggregated over all the surveys conducted to yield an overall score for the State/UT.

      The feedback scores will be used to generate a ranking of States/UTs in terms of reform implementation. Such a ranking will be different from the last year’s ranking, which was a ranking of de jure reforms (or reforms based on evidence submitted by States).

       The online portal shall soon be enabled to allow States/UTs to upload the reforms implemented along with the evidence.

                Various tax exemptions have been given to Startups in the recent past -

            Following direct tax incentives were provided in Income-tax Act,1961 (‘the Act’) to promote Start-ups through Finance Act,2016:

 

·                     Introduction of new section 54EE in Income-tax Act, 1961 to exempt   investment  of long term capital gains by an investor in a fund notified by Central   Government.

 

·                     Amendment of section 54GB to provide exemption of capital gains arising out of sale of residential property, on investing the same in shares of Start-up   company.

 

·                     Introduction of new section 80-IAC to provide 100% deduction for three consecutive years out of five years, to profits of start-ups which are approved by Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification notified by DIPP.

 

            To prevent incidence of “Angel Tax” on  angel investors investing in approved start-ups, CBDT vide Notification No.45/2016 dated June 14,2016 notified that Angel investors funding to approved start-ups shall be exempt from incidence of tax under section 56(2)(viib).

 

            Further, vide Finance Act,2017, following benefits have been provided to start-ups: 

 

·                     Amendment of section 79 of the Act to provide that in the case of a company being an eligible start-up, loss shall be carried forward and set off against the income of the previous year, even if a change in shareholding has taken place in a previous year subject to all the shareholders of such company on the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred, continuing to hold shares on the last day of such previous year. The restriction of fifty one percent of shareholding of company to remain unchanged in order to carry forward and set-off the loss of earlier years has therefore been relaxed in the case of start-ups.

 

·                     Amendment to provide that deduction under section 80-IAC can be claimed by    an eligible start-up for any three consecutive assessment years out of seven  years beginning from the year in which such eligible start-up is incorporated as  against three years out of five years provided by Finance Act, 2016.

 

            The above exemptions would encourage seed-capital investment in Startups, facilitate their growth and meet the working capital requirements during the initial years of operation. Further, they would also promote investments into Start-ups by mobilizing the capital gains arising from sale of capital assets.

                The Agricultural and Processed Food Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Commerce, under its 12th Plan Central Sector Scheme titled “Agriculture Export Promotion Plan Scheme of APEDA” has been providing assistance to the exporters of the agricultural and processed food products under the various components of the scheme viz. Infrastructure Development, Market Promotion, Quality Development and Transport Assistance. Moreover, the exporters of the agricultural and processed food products have also been getting assistance under various export promotion schemes of the Department of Commerce viz.

Benefits derived by the small and marginal farmers from such schemes would be indirect in nature and hence cannot be assessed.

 

            Exporters of agricultural and processed food products from the State of Rajasthan are eligible for availing assistance under the various export promotion schemes of Department of Commerce and APEDA.

                Gems and Jewellery export sector has been contributing  about 13%-15% to India’s total merchandise exports during the last five years. As per industry estimates, this sector employs more than 4.64 million employees.

 

The Gem and Jewellery exports was showing down turn since the year 2012-13 due to global economic slowdown.  However, during the year 2016-17 (Upto February, 2017), the Gem and Jewellery exports has shown a growth of 10.3% over the corresponding period in previous year.   With a view to strengthen the Gems & Jewellery industry in the country, the Government has taken a number of steps such as establishment of Special Notified Zone (SNZ); announcement of separate ITC HS Code for lab-grown diamonds; introduction of Gold Monetisation Scheme; amendment of wastage and value addition norms for gems and jewellery items; approved scheme for setting up of Common Facility Centres for gem and jewellery sector; and providing financial assistance for participation in international fairs, organizing buyer-seller meets etc. under Market Development Assistance (MDA) and Market Access Initiative (MAI) Schemes of the Department of Commerce to boost the industry.

                As per Rule 149 of the GFR-2017, procurement of Goods and Services by Ministries/ Departments of Central Government has been made mandatory for Goods or Services available on GeM.

 

GeM is an online end to end procurement portal. All the activities from registration of Buyers and Sellers to purchase and even payment to the Sellers through Public Financial Management Service are completely online. Three methods of procurement are followed as per Rule 149 of GFR-2017. The prices listed by any seller are visible to all the Registered Buyers and Sellers. Moreover, to promote transparency, the Bidding and Reverse Auction notices are sent to all the Sellers who are available for that product on GeM through email/SMS and notice on the homepage of GeM. All the contracts are available in public domain. The complete Audit trail is available for viewing at any time.

GeM is not mandatory for State Governments. It is left to their discretion to procure through GeM. However, some State Government organizations are making procurement through GeM viz Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tripura, Haryana and Uttarakhand.

GeM, being a technology driven platform, has better functionality and capability to centrally drive and monitor compliance of various Government policies towards promotion of domestic manufacturers, in public procurement.

            ITPO has established two exhibition Centres, one at Chennai and the other at Bengaluru through its two joint ventures – Tamil Nadu Trade Promotion Organisation (TNTPO) and the Karnataka Trade Promotion Organisation (KTPO) respectively. These joint ventures are in collaboration with the respective State Governments. As an expansion plan for KTPO, the Board of Directors (BoD), KTPO has recently approved a proposal to construct a new Exhibition cum Convention Hall of 4000/5000 sq. mtrs. The BoD of TNTPO has also recently approved expansion plan to construct 16000-17000 sq. mtrs. of exhibition space at TNTPO.

            The BoD of ITPO has further approved setting up of a Joint venture between ITPO and Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) at Kochi.

            The Government, on 23.03.2016, also gave its approval for creation of a state-of-the-art Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (ECC) at Dwarka, New Delhi. The ECC comprises of a host of independent and mutually beneficial facilities like exhibition halls, convention centres, banquet halls, auditoria, hotels, Food & Beverage (F&B) outlets & retail services. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has transferred 89.5832 Ha. of Land to DIPP for the purpose in September, 2016.

(b):     Presently, there is no proposal, under consideration, from Government of Gujarat to construct exhibition centres in Gujarat State. 

(c):       During India International Trade Fairs (IITF) 2016 itself, ITPO has introduced e-Governance facilities like online space booking of stalls and online purchase of tickets. Following digital services have been informed by ITPO during the IITF 2016 :-

i.                        Online booking of stalls by exhibitors using payment gateway services.

ii.                        Sale of ticket online using payment gateway. The number of online ticket sales       increased from 2,896 nos. in IITF 2015 to 41,640 nos. in IITF 2016.

iii.                        Point of Sales (POS) machines were installed at ticket counters, i.e. Gate No.         1 and 2 to facilitate digital sale of entry tickets.  

iv.                        To assist small scale enterprises, artisan and Exhibitors/ participants, ITPO tied-up with SBI, AXIS bank, Paytm and Free-Charge for enabling cashless            transactions by the visitors. Around 2250 swipe machines (POS) and e-wallet    services were provided to participants during IITF 2016.

v.                        In addition, ITPO also facilitated 18 ATM machines for the convenience of the     visitors during IITF 2016. 

 

            The outcome of India’s participation as the Partner Nation in INNOPROM-2016 in Russia is that 229 business enquiries were generated amounting to US $ 5.142 Million and 6 MoU were negotiated/ signed. In addition, the following benefits have been envisaged:

i.                        Showcasing India’s engineering capabilities before the business community of       Russia.

ii.                        A general broadening and bolstering of bilateral collaboration between Russia        and India in the industrial, trade and economic sectors.

iii.                        Possible areas for potential investment and economic collaboration.

 

            There is a campaign named Brand India Engineering, launched by Government of India which aims at creating true brand value in international markets for Indian engineering products & services. India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), a Trust established by the Department of Commerce and the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC), an apex national body representing engineering industry, are steering the campaign in coordination with national associations & industry stakeholders. The Brand India Engineering campaign has been projected at major international and domestic events over the past two years including INNOPROM (Russia), Big 5 (Dubai), Arab health (Dubai) and JIMEX (Amman). Currently, the brand campaign caters to sub-segments like pumps and valves, electrical equipment & machinery and medical devices. Potential  is also envisaged in segments like auto components, steel and textiles machinery among others. The identification has been done on the basis of the export potential and current standing of a particular segment. The campaign continues to improve and increase awareness about India’s competencies in the overall engineering sector.

            An important component under the initiative is a catalogue of the best in class companies, which is given priority for global showcasing. As a pre-requisite, the enrolling companies are required to meet certain standards before they can be empanelled in the catalogue. Through this initiative, the government is encouraging members to adopt global product and system standards. The utility of the catalogue was given further thrust by envisaging development of E-catalogue version. The E version aims to enhance Interactivity, Dynamic interface, universal compatibility (including offline save options), ease of access for manufacturers and clients. The new e-catalogue carries separate domain www.ingineering-brands.com.

            This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.

                The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry  had  circulated to all States/Union Territories  in October 2015, a 340 point Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) with an objective to increase transparency and  efficiency of various Government regulatory functions and services for business in India.  The result of the Assessment of Implementation of Business Reforms 2015-16 by States/UTs was released  on 31.10.2016. The Assessment studies the extent to which States/UTs  have implemented DIPP’s 340-point  BRAP, covering the period July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The BRAP includes recommendations for reforms on 58 regulatory processes, policies, practices and  procedures spread across 10 reform areas, that is, access to information and transparency enablers; single window; environmental registration enablers; obtaining electricity connection; availability of land; construction permit enablers; inspection reform enablers; labour regulation enablers;  online tax and  return filing and commercial dispute resolution enablers spanning the lifecycle of a typical business.    



 

            Data for assessment of Implementation of Business Reforms  was collected from States/UTs  on the BRAP portal http://eodb.dipp.gov.in.  The portal, among the first of its kind globally, allowed States and UTs  to submit evidence of implemented reforms. At least 32 States and UTs submitted evidence of implementation of 7,124 reforms.

                Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) through Invest India, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) organized a joint workshop in Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi on 5th of April, 2017, on the subject ‘Investment Policy and Investment Climate’ of India. This workshop was attended by participants from various Ministries/Departments including Ministry of Mining, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry of Labor & Employment, Department of Economic Affairs and Department of Commerce. Regulatory bodies such as RBI, SEBI, Competition Commission of India and IRDAI were also represented in the workshop. Other participants in the workshop included industry bodies such as CII, FICCI, NASSCOM and Law/Consultancy firms. 

In the last three years, the Government of India has undertaken a number of FDI Policy reforms with the result that India has been recording highest ever foreign direct investment in recent years. Ms. Irene Hors, Head of OECD Strategic Partnerships and New Initiatives introduced that the workshop was aimed at shedding light on how the FDI policy reforms can be evaluated as per the benchmarking of the OECD and discussing related areas which impact investment such as trade policy; competition policy; tax policy; public governance; corporate governance; policies for enabling responsible business conduct; human resources development etc. and to demonstrate as to how they relate to one another. 

Shri Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary DIPP, in his keynote address highlighted the importance of liberalized FDI policy regime and ease of doing business in the country. It was pointed out by the Secretary that enabling regulatory framework, whether on the front of FDI policy or on sectoral regulations are two main pillars to make a country attractive destination for investment. However, investment decisions are also to be seen in the larger context of performance of the host economy, availability of skilled manpower, attractive consumer market, and most importantly, stable and decisive political establishment. Secretary, DIPP mentioned that India is favorably placed on all these parameters and provides great place for foreign investment. Workshop began with the presentation by Shri Atul Chaturvedi, Additional Secretary, DIPP, on FDI Policy and Investment climate to set the context for day long discussions. 

Ms. Isabelle Joumard, Senior Economist and Head of the India desk, OECD Economics Department presented key takeaways of the OECD Economic Survey of India during the session on ‘Developing the right ecosystem for investment’. Mr. Stephen Thomsen, Head, Investment Policy Reviews, OECD made presentations on the subjects of ‘OECD policy framework for investment and its applications’ which focused on the different policy areas which help to shape the investment climate, and ‘OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index and its application to India.’ OECD presented the methodology developed to allow countries to measure the degree of openness to foreign direct investors and its evolution over time with the OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index. Presentation on ‘Making the most of FDI - Policies supporting linkages and spillovers and to foster integration in global value chains’ was made by Ms. Hildegunn Nordas, Senior Policy Analyst, Trade and Agriculture Directorate. The session looked at how to encourage linkages between multinational enterprises and local firms within global value chains. It also discussed the policies to maximise spill overs, including human capital and physical infrastructure development, drawing on the experiences of other countries. Presentation on ‘Responsible Business Conduct’ was made by Ms. Jennifer Schappert, Policy Analyst, Responsible Business Conduct, Investment Division, Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs. The session discussed international standards, regulatory developments and industry efforts being taken globally on these subjects; and also showcased country experiences on inclusion of RBC standards in national legislation on FDI. 

Experts from OECD welcomed efforts to liberalize the foreign investment regime and recognized India as a top reformer. OECD supported the ambitious and continuing reforms by the Government of India to improve the FDI policy regime and the business climate of India. DIPP extended its gratitude on participation of OECD in this very high level workshop.

India is negotiating a Broad-based Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) with the European Union (EU) and Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). India is committed to a pragmatic and balanced outcome of both the negotiations. India is awaiting the response of the EU side to resume the BTIA negotiations. 15 rounds on TEPA have been held. It is expected that greater trade and investment flows will result from these agreements in many sectors, including textiles.

The Government has been working continuously to increase export competitiveness of India in Europe as well as in other markets. Government has introduced special package for apparel and made-ups sector in June, 2016 and December, 2016, respectively. The government is also implementing schemes like Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS), Pradhan Mantri Paridhan Rojgar Protsahan Yojna (PMPRPY), Scheme of Rebate of State Levies (RoSL) on export of garments, Schemes for Technical textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Integrated Skill Development Scheme, etc. to modernize textile industry, increase production and global competitiveness. Apart from the steps taken by the Government mentioned above, the Government has taken following initiatives to augment the textile exports:- Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) Scheme under new Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20; expanding its scope; restoring interest rate subvention for pre and post shipment credit for the textile sector; increased Duty Drawback rates for some textile articles; Market Access Initiative Scheme; Market Development Assistance Scheme; and Duty Free import of trimmings, embellishments and other specified item under Export Performance Certificate Entitlement Scheme.

	Recruitment has been completed for 459 posts of Examiners of Patents and   Designs,   of which 396 new appointees have started examination work  after undergoing   training, in addition to the existing 130 Examiners. 


 


	Further, 76 new posts of Patent Controllers have also been created.


 


	The number of Examiners of Trade Marks and Geographical Indications has   also been augmented through 100 Examiners on contract.


           


	IP awareness and training programmes are regularly conducted at Rajiv  Gandhi  National Institute of Intellectual Property Management    (RGNIIPM) Nagpur.


 


	Patent Rules have been amended and notified on 16.05.2016 to simplify procedures  for disposal of patent applications.  The salient amendments      include:


 


	Provisions have been included for condonation of delay due to war/ natural   calamities.


 


	For the first time, refund of fees in certain cases has been permitted, as also  withdrawal of application being permitted without any fees.


 


	Timelines have been imposed to ensure speedy disposal, while the number of  admissible adjournments has been limited


 


	Applications can be transferred electronically from any of the Patent Office  branches   to another, utilizing specialized technical manpower more  efficiently.


 


	Expedited Examination is now permitted on certain grounds.


 


	Hearing through video conferencing has been permitted.


 


	IPO website has been updated to make it more interactive, informative, user-   friendly  and transparent. 


 


	In order to facilitate the examination work and optimise the speed and quality       of             examination, number of measures viz., computerised work-flow,  automation and IT   enablement in the functioning has been implemented. 


 


	The process of registration and renewal of Trademarks has been automated  by  uploading the registration certificate electronically in the electronic   register and   dispatching the same to the applicant’s registered email id.


 


	A ‘Pre-Hearing Module’ has been devised to ensure that show-cause hearings   are not   scheduled except in cases where the office objections cannot be    waived on the basis   of the reply submitted by the applicant and   material available on record.


 


	The Government has notified the new Trade Mark Rules, 2017 on 6th March,  2017 to  streamline and simplify the processing of trade mark   applications. Some of the salient features of the new Trade Mark Rules, 2017  are as under:


 


	Number of Trade Mark (TM) Forms has been reduced from 74 to 8.


 


	To promote e-filing of trade mark applications, a 10% rebate is provided for e- filing  of Trade Mark applications vis-à-vis physical filing. 


 


	Modalities for determination and maintenance of well-known trade marks have    been introduced.


 


	The provisions relating to expedited processing of an application for  registration of a trade mark have been extended right up to registration  stage (hitherto, it was only up to examination stage).


 


	Over all fees have been rationalized by reducing the number of entries in  Schedule I   from 88 to just 23.


 


	Hearing through video conferencing on request has been introduced.


 


	Number of adjournments in opposition proceedings has been restricted to a  maximum   of two by each party, which will help in timely disposal of  matters.


 


	Procedures relating to registration as Registered User of trade marks have  also been  simplified.

From above table, it may be seen that India’s trade with China during April-February 2016-17 decreased marginally by 0.87% and amounted to US$ 64.57 billion.During this period,India’s exports to Chinagrewby 8.69% to US$ 8.94 billion while India’s imports from China saw adecline of2.26% to US$ 55.63 billion resultingin a decline in India’s trade deficit with China by 4.1%.

            Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and Ministry of Commerce & Industry of the Republic of India jointly developed and signed in September 2014 the Five-Year Development Program for Economic and Trade Cooperation in order to lay down a medium term roadmap for promoting balanced and sustainable development of economic and trade relations between China and India, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

          The Five Year Program recognizes and states “that trade deficit with China is a matter of high concern for India. Against this background and in the spirit of mutual benefit, India and China shall endeavour to strengthen cooperation and gradually achieve bilateral trade balance over the next 5 years. India and China shall further endeavour to increase bilateral trade in services particularly Information Technology (IT) & Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) in the next 5 years.”

            The Government has also taken various measures to extend support to exporters to increase exports to all countries including China, which are indicated below:

 

i. The New Foreign Trade Policy (2015‐20) was announced on 1st April, 2015 with   a focus on  supporting both manufacturing and services exports and improving    the ‘Ease of Doing Business’. The FTP introduced two new schemes, namely,   ‘Merchandise Exports from India Scheme’ (MEIS) for incentivising export of       specified goods to specified markets and ‘Service Exports from India Scheme’             (SEIS) for promoting export of notified services from India, by consolidating      earlier schemes.

 

ii. In the light of the major challenges being faced by Indian exporters in the backdrop of the global economic slowdown, the envisaged revenue outgo         under MEIS was increased from Rs. 18000 Crore to Rs. 21000 Crore in October             2015 with accompanying enhancement in benefits on certain products and    inclusion of certain additional items.

 

iii. A new scheme called Special Advance Authorisation Scheme for export of          Articles of Apparel and Clothing Accessories of chapter 61 & 62 of ITC(HS)          Classification of Export and Import has been introduced with effect from 1st      September 2016 wherein exporters are entitled to authorisation for duty free      import of fabrics, including inter lining on pre-import basis and All Industry Rate     of Duty Drawback for import of non-fabric inputs on the exports

 

iv. By way of trade facilitation and enhancing the ease of doing business      Government has reduced the number of mandatory documents required for         exports and imports. The trade community can file applications online for various trade related schemes.

                A recent accident during display of fireworks at Paravoor, Kerala has brought out several discrepancies such as lack of effective enforcement of the Explosive Rules 2008 on the part of the district administration, use of unauthorized fireworks, viz. Amittus, Kuzhiminnal, Palm leaf crackers, multishots, gundus etc., use of unauthorized chemicals i.e. potassium chlorate in fireworks, unauthorized storage of fireworks at public display site and non-adherence of prescribed safety distances between display site and spectators, etc.                                                                                                        

 

            To prevent such incidents in future, there is an urgent need of tightening of enforcement of the Explosives Rules 2008 by District Authorities. For the same, following directives are issued under Rule 126 of the Explosives Rules 2008 to be implemented by District Authorities for safe public display of fireworks:-

 

(i)                 District Magistrate’s office will be the single window for granting licenses in Form LE-6 of the Explosives Rules, 2008 for public display of fireworks. Application for license for public display of fireworks shall be submitted to the District Magistrate’s office two months prior to scheduled date of display and if approved, permission will be granted at least one month prior to the display date;

 

(ii)               District Magistrate may take appropriate decision on relaxation of timing for display of fireworks in the light of Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order dated 26.03.2007 in the case of Prevention of Environmental and Sound Pollution Forum Vs Union of India and others [Writ Petition (Civil) No. 72 of 1998];

 

(iii)             Only authorized fireworks approved by Chief Controller of Explosives shall be used for public display of fireworks (Rule 6 and condition 4 of licence in Form LE-6 of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(iv)             For authorization of traditional fireworks viz. Amittus, Kuzhiminnal, Palm leaf crackers, multishots, gundus, etc. manufacturers shall apply to Chief Controller of Explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), Nagpur as per Rule 6 of the Explosives Rules 2008, accompanied by  particulars  namely   nature, composition, percentage of ingredients, dimensions, process of manufacture and performance characteristics of the fireworks. PESO  will approve the  fireworks within 10 days  and after submission of fireworks samples, authorization will be accorded within 30 days;

 

(v)               Storage licenses to store fireworks, if required, near the display site shall be taken from the Office of Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, PESO at Ernakulam. The store house (magazine) should be shown in the drawing along with display site (Rule 71 and Schedule IV of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(vi)             The District Magistrate shall ascertain that 100 meters safety distance between the fireworks display site and spectators and 250 meters from hospitals, schools and nursing home shall be strictly complied. Barricading shall be provided at 100 meters around the display site to prevent entry of general public in the display area (conditions 3 and 11 of licence in Form LE-6 of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(vii)           Wherever these safety distances are not available, the display site should be shifted to a suitable area.  Even if safety distances are available but the display site is congested, that may make evacuation of people in case of an accident difficult/ problematic, it should be shifted to an open area;

 

(viii)         District Authority shall ensure presence of experienced manpower for conducting fireworks display (condition 24 of licence in Form LE-6 of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(ix)             District Magistrate shall instruct festival organizers to conduct risk assessment by reputed organizations to identify potential hazards arising on account of fireworks display prior to applying for display licence and ensure that relevant provisions of the Explosives Rules, 2008 are complied with. Based on the risk assessment study, disaster management plan shall be prepared by the District Administration before the fireworks display;

 

(x)               Strict action should be taken against unauthorized manufacturers and display of fireworks (Rules 6 and 7 of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(xi)             District/Police Authorities shall collect samples of fireworks from the premises of manufacturers and submit the same to Regional Chemical Examiner’s Laboratory at Ernakulam well in advance to be tested for potassium chlorate or any other chlorate.  Fireworks containing chlorate or prohibited chemicals shall not be used for public display (Rule 128 (c) and condition 6 of licence in Form LE-6 of the Explosives Rules 2008);

 

(xii)           District Magistrate will have to send a report every 15 days to the State Government regarding display of fireworks, starting one month prior to start of festival season till the end. The report shall include particulars like no. of applications received, no. of licenses granted, suitability of display site, compliance of the Explosives Rules 2008, etc.

                Department of Posts has revamped the existing compassionate engagement scheme offered to the dependent family members of Gramin Dak Sevak. A GDS who dies in harness, the dependents of such GDS will benefit from a liberalized and time bound procedure for engagement on compassionate grounds. Henceforth, any death of a Gramin Dak Sevak while on engagement would be compensated by a compassionate engagement to a dependent family member irrespective of the circumstances or indigence. Upper age limit of the applicant could also be relaxed wherever found to be necessary. Thus the new scheme of compassionate engagement will provide greater relief to the members of the family of the deceased GDS who belong to weaker and poorer sections of the society and are thrown into penury and hardship. 

 

The ambit of dependent family member has also been expanded to include:

•Married son living with parents and dependent for livelihood on the GDS on the date of death of the GDS

•Divorced daughter wholly dependent on the GDS at the time of death of the GDS

•Daughter in law of the deceased GDS who is wholly dependent on the GDS, if the only son of the GDS is pre deceased.

 

This expansion of definition of family members aims to bring greater relief to women in our society who are subjected to difficult circumstances in the unfortunate event of demise of their spouse/parent. 

 

The present system of relative merit points to ascertain the degree of indigence has been dispensed with. Keeping in view the unique and distinct service conditions, socio economic aspects and to relieve the family from financial destitution, the time consuming process of consideration by Circle Relaxation Committee has been done away with. Henceforth, a request received for compassionate engagement would be considered and decided within three months from the date of receipt of the application. 

 

Further to ensure least displacement, it has been decided that to the extent possible, compassionate engagement would be offered to the dependent of the deceased GDS, to a GDS post near the place where the family of the deceased normally resides.

                In order to obtain direct feedback from subscribers about Quality of Mobile Services, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) launched an Integrated Voice Response System (IVRS) in a phased manner between December 2016 and March 2017 covering all states in the country, through which, subscribers received an IVRS call from short code 1955 and were asked a few questions on the Quality of Mobile Services including problem of call drop, if any. The subscribers have been facilitated by the system to send a toll-free SMS to the same short code 1955, containing the name of city/town/village, where they face frequent call drops.


Since its launch, the IVRS system has made 26.97 lakh calls to subscribers of all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) across the country, out of which 3.56 lakh subscribers (about 13%) participated in the survey. Remaining 87% subscribers, who did not participate, were either not willing or did not have problem of frequent call drops. Among those who participated, 2.15 lakh (about 60%) subscribers have reported experiencing frequent call drops. From the feedback it has been observed that the complaint is mostly indoors. The feedback is shared with the TSPs to take corrective action in a time bound manner and submit the action taken report (ATR) to DoT Task Force every fortnight. TSPs contact each subscriber, who has reported frequent call drops, through telephonic calls and SMS in English and locallanguages to collect further details required for resolution of the complaint.


On cumulative basis, since launch of IVRS, TSPs have resolved 13,631 cases related to call drop problem and also resolved another 7975 cases which were reported as frequent call drop problem but were found to be having other issues related to data, roaming, billing, MNP, mobile device etc.Out of these,1406 cases were resolved through optimization, rectifying hardware/power problems, through field visits etc. during the fortnight 15-31March 2017.
The results obtained through the IVRS platform and follow up efforts of DoT & TSPs are quite encouraging. The call drops reported by subscribers have dropped from 64% in Dec-2016 to 57% at the end of Mar-2017, a drop of nearly 7% in 3 months. In addition, the said initiatives of the Government have facilitated TSPs to identify black spots and plan new sites/ infrastructure to improve their services. TSPs have planned 987 new sites/boosters out of which 109 have been already installed and commissioned (Airtel-11, Idea-29, Reliance Jio - 69).


The Ministry of Communications regularly reviews the efficacy of the system and suggests further areas of improvements. This system has provided a win-win situation for all stakeholders.

The Union Minister for Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that present day telecommunication and networking is expanding its boundaries and voice based network are getting changed to data oriented networks. Speaking at the India-EU ICT Standardisation conference at C-DOT here, he said that this has been possible because of the standardisation of telecom equipment and interconnectivity. He said that India has planned 100 smart cities and it is necessary to take care of our citizens in terms of quality of life, security and well-being. He said that standardisation of machine to machine communication will ensure that there is participation of many players in realization of smart city ICT infrastructure and it will be a platform on which new applications like e-health, e-traffic control, e-waste management, e-mandi, e-education and many other new applications will evolve. Shri Sinha said that it is good trend that European standard development organization is collaborating with Indian telecom standard development organization who are developing standards and a premier telecom R&D institution like C-DOT is developing systems on these standards. He said this is an important direction for standard way of implementing smart sensor and applications for a Smart City. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Executive Director of C-DOT Shri Vipin Tyagi said that Public Data Office, PDO that the Minister has launched today will go a long way in providing internet access to the rural masses at affordable cots. He said that this will also help in realizing the dream of the Prime Minister for Digital India and will bridge the gap between haves and have nots. He is this is truly a revolution of sorts for its journey from PCO to PDO. 

C-DOT PDO is ready to bring yet another revolution by taking internet connectivity to every nook and corner of the country like it did in the 1980s when PCOs changed the Indian telecom scene in by taking telephones to rural India. C-DOT hopes that PDOs would bring next telecom revolution by taking internet connectivity to the masses. Like PCOs, the PDOs would enable small shop owners increase their income by selling data vouchers. This will also encourage village-level entrepreneurship and provide strong employment opportunities, especially in rural and semi urban areas.

Government of India’s announcement of Smart Cities project in mission mode has generated a lot of interest.  The concept of smart cities is incomplete without intervention of communication and Information Technology.   

A network of wireless sensors, a reliable public communication infrastructure and innovative applications working on big data and analytics will help us realise smart cities. Innovative local solutions will have to be found for local problems. Though this offers great opportunities to industry, including, MSMEs and start-ups. But adoption of standards will ensure that solution developers do not reinvent the wheel but devote their energies to the actual building of product and on innovations. Further, the interoperability will be another dividend of a standards based approach.

Telecommunications Standards Development Society, India (TSDSI), the Indian telecom Standards Development Organisation (SDO) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), an established and highly respected, 29 years old telecom SDO have joined hands to unroll a collaboration project on ICT Standardisation in an endeavour of creating awareness about telecom standards and promoting their wider adoption that

Recognising C-DOT’s R&D strengths, an India - European Union project called ‘India-EU Cooperation on ICT-Related Standardisation, Policy and Legislation’ is organising a workshop on “Future proof smart cities with a common service layer: a standards driven approach” at C-DOT campus at Mehrauli, New Delhi on 21st April 2017.  Some of the global smart cities will be sharing the standards driven approach they have adopted for building smart cities in their countries.

The workshop aims to provide a platform where foreign and Indian experts from IoT and M2M forums, academia, R&D, industry and senior officials from Ministries of Communications, Urban Development and Electronics and Information Technology and cities named in Indian Smart Cities project can interact to share knowledge and experiences. It is also planned to enrich the interaction by inviting City Councillors from Europe and Korea who have actually implemented smart city projects in their respective cities.

C-DOT’s offering:

C-DOT has developed CCSP(C-DOT Common Service Platform), the oneM2M standards compliant common service platform which can be deployed on any off-the-shelf generic server platforms or cloud infrastructure. The business application providers can deploy their oneM2M compliant applications in either co-located infrastructure or on any public or private cloud.

Using the CCSP platform from C-DOT, the smart cities can reap all the benefits of using a standards compliant horizontal service layer and thus be more efficient, economical and future proof.

Along with the CCSP C-DOT has also developed various oneM2M indigenously designed hardware nodes like AND (Application Dedicated Node), ASN (Application Service Node) and MN(Middle node).

To effectively showcase the strength of the platform, C-DOT has also developed various applications like Smart Living, Smart Street Light, Carbon Footprint Monitoring Application and Power Monitoring which are fully oneM2M compliant.

C-DOT has also participated in two international interoperability events where the CCSP and the ADN were tested for interoperability with many other oneM2M compliant nodes from various international organisations like Interdigital, Herit, Huawei, HPE, NTT, KETI, LAAS-CNRS etc. C-DOT also participated in the conformance testing with ETSI.

 

Brief on P.D.O. (Public Data Office)

C-DOT PDO is ready to bring yet another revolution by taking internet connectivity to every nook and corner of the country like it did in the 1980s when PCOs changed the Indian telecom scene in by taking telephones to rural India. C-DOT hopes that PDOs would bring next telecom revolution by taking internet connectivity to the masses. Like PCOs, the PDOs would enable small shop owners increase their income by selling data vouchers. This will also encourage village-level entrepreneurship and provide strong employment opportunities, especially in rural and semi urban areas.

                Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been taking various initiatives to address the problem of call drops in mobile networks. The Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have installed about 2,12,917 additional BTSs (Base Transceiver Stations) across the country during the period from June 2016 to February 2017. 

However, in order to obtain direct feedback from subscribers, DoT had launched an Integrated Voice Response System (IVRS) system in Delhi, Mumbai, UP, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Goa on 23rd December 2016, which was extended to other states on 12th January 2017 except in Punjab and Manipur. IVRS system was launched in Punjab and Manipur on 16th March 2017. Through this system, subscribers receive an IVRS call from short code 1955 and are asked a few questions on the call drop problem. They can also send a toll-free SMS to the same short code 1955, containing the name of city/town/village, where they face frequent call drops. 

Since the launch of the IVRS system on 23/12/2016 till 28/02/2017 16,61,640 successful outbound calls have been made to subscribers of all TSPs across the country. About 2,20,935 subscribers participated in the survey out of which, about 1,38,072 (62.5%) subscribers have reported call drops. From the feedback it has been observed that the problem of call drops is more severe indoors. The feedback is shared with the Telecom Service Providers every week for taking action in a time bound manner. The TSPs have set up an elaborate mechanism for using the IVRS feedback data sent by DoT. 

TSPs are submitting action taken report (ATR) to DoT Task Force every fortnight. For the fortnight 15-28 Feb 2017, 43,403 feedback cases were taken up for investigation by TSPs. After telephonic calls and SMS to the subscribers to seek additional information on their call drop problem, 7,210 cases were identified for resolution. During the fortnight, 2467 cases were resolved through optimization, rectifying hardware/power problems, through field visits etc. and on cumulative basis, since launch of IVRS, 9,328 cases have been resolved through this initiative. 

In addition, 5529 cases which were not related to call drop problem but other issues like problem related to data, roaming, billing, MNP, mobile device etc., were also identified by the TSPs for taking necessary action. About 603 new sites/boosters have also been planned by TSPs for installation in due course. DoT Task Force is also meeting with the TSPs once every month to discuss various issues related to the IVRS system. Regular reviews are also being held by the office of Hon’ble Minister about the operation of the IVRS system.

Based on representations received from sugar mills/trade associations, Government has extended the time line for availing TRQ benefit (duty free) of 5 Lakh MT of raw sugar import from 12th June to 30th June, 2017. This would mean that prospective mill/refiner can complete the import of raw sugar on or before 30th June, 2017. Further, to facilitate the imports from logistic point of view, Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Gangavaram (Andhra Pradesh) and Karaikal (Puducherry) ports in the South Zone have been added. However, the zone-wise import quantity restrictions shall remain unchanged. In order to ensure timely availability of sugar in the country and to maintain domestic price at reasonable level, the importing mills/refineries have been given a time line of two months from the date of bill of entry or the date of entry inwards, whichever is later, to convert raw sugar into white/refined sugar in their respective mills/refineries. The detailed notification is available on the website of DGFT (www.dgft.gov.in) and on the website of CBEC (www.cbec.gov.in).

The Department of Consumer Affairs has collaborated with Google India on raising awareness about internet safety amongst Indian consumers. The proposed outcome of the campaign is to integrate the internet safety message into everyday tasks that the consumers undertake over the internet such as financial transactions, using e-mails, doing e-commerce or simply surfing the internet for information. Activities proposed under the campaign include training of selected VCOs, Government officials and counselors of National Consumer Helpline. Various awareness material pertaining to digital safety has been uploaded in the website of the Department. There is no financial implication on the part of the Department under the collaboration with Google India.

There is already a National Consumer Helpline (1XXX-XX-4000 and short code 14404) where a consumer can lodge his grievance and get assistance.

The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), which came into force w.e.f. 5th July, 2013 seeks to provide for food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach, by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity. NFSA provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population at the all India level thus covering about two-third of the population, for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). Under the Act, foodgrains are allocated @ 5kg per person per month for priority households and @ 35kg per family per month for Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households at highly subsidized prices of Re.1/-, Rs.2/- and Rs.3/- per kg for coarse grains, wheat and rice respectively.

As of 1st November, 2016 all the 36 States/UTs have implemented NFSA and are being allocated foodgrains as per their entitlement under NFSA.

In order to eliminate the problem of hunger/starvation/malnutrition and to provide food security to the vulnerable population, the Government has also been providing food-grains at highly subsidized prices to the targeted population through State Governments/Union Territory Administrations under Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) as well besides allocation under NFSA, such as Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, Annapurna Scheme etc.

The Act also has a special focus on nutritional support to women and children. Pregnant women and lactating mothers are entitled to receive meals as per nutritional norms. Children upto 14 years of age are also entitled to nutritious meals or take home rations as per the prescribed nutritional standards. In case of non supply of entitled foodgrains or meals, the beneficiaries receive food security allowance.

During the year 2015-16, the Govt. of India has allocated 611.10 lakh tons of foodgrains under TPDS, NFSA and OWS. During the year 2016-17, the Govt. of India has allocated 628.91 lakh tons of foodgrains under TPDS, NFSA and OWS.

No State Government/Union Territory Administration has reported any incident of death due to starvation so far.

                At present no separate permission is required for online sale of essential commodities including foodgrains and grocery items falling under category of essential commodities, because online as well as offline trade of essential commodities are treated legally on the same footing for trade purpose, those traders who have license for offline sale of essential commodities including foodgrains may also sale them online.



 

To ensure the availability of essential food items in the general retail market, the States being enforcement agencies for EC Act, 1955, take action against black marketing, hoarding, profiteering and speculative trading and unscrupulous traders. Food Corporation of India sells surplus stocks of wheat and rice out of Central Pool under Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) through e-auction to the registered Bulk Consumers/Roller Flour Mills/Private Traders from time to time to enhance supply and thereby moderate the open market prices. Higher MSP has been announced so as to incentivize production and thereby enhance availability of food items. The quantities of wheat and rice sold under OMSS (D) during the last two years 2015-16 and 2016-17 are as under:

                The Department of Food and Public Distribution has prepared guidelines for Fair Price Shop (FPS) automation, which have been shared with all States/UTs. FPS automation involves, installation of Point of Sale (PoS) devices at FPS for authentication of beneficiaries, recording of sales to beneficiaries at the FPS; and uploading of transaction data in central server. There are 5.26 lakh Fair Price Shops in the country out of which 1.86 lakh FPSs have been automated so far installing ePoS devices/mobile terminals across 22 States/UTs. A statement showing the total number of FPSs in each States/UTs including Andhra Pradesh and automation of FPSs is given below.

 

Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments wherein operational responsibilities including the issuance of licenses to the Fair Price Shops (FPSs) rest with the concerned State/UT Governments.

                Government has issued following instructions to State Governments / Union Territories and Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ensure supply of good quality foodgrains under Public Distribution System (PDS). 

(i) Only good quality foodgrains free from insect infestation and conforming to Food Safety Standards are to be issued under PDS. 

(ii) Ample opportunities are to be provided to the State Government to check the quality of foodgrains prior to lifting the foodgrains stocks from FCI godowns. 

(iii) Samples of foodgrains are to be collected and sealed from the stocks of foodgrains to be issued under the PDS jointly by FCI and State Governments/UT Administrations. 

(iv) An officer not below the rank of Inspector is to be deputed from State Government to take the delivery of foodgrain stocks from FCI godowns. 

(v) Regular inspection to check the quality of foodgrains is to be carried out by the officers of State Government. 

(vi) It is the responsibility of the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations to ensure that during transportation and storage at different stages in the distribution chain, the foodgrains retain the required quality specifications. 

(vii) The State Government, where the decentralized procurement is in operation, should ensure that the quality of foodgrains issued under PDS and other welfare schemes should meet the desired standards prescribed by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). 

PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments. Central Government is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the Food Corporation of India. The operational responsibilities for intra-state allocation and distribution of foodgrains within the States/UTs, identification of eligible beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards and supervision and monitoring of the Fair Price Shops (FPSs) etc. rest with the concerned State/UT Governments. Therefore, as and when complaints are received, these are referred to the State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. Five complaints about supply of poor quality foodgrains distributed under PDS were received during 2016-17.

Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of all the food products are undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check that they comply with the standards laid down under Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006 and the Rules & Regulation made thereunder. In cases where food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter-IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The implementation and enforcement of norms under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules & Regulation made thereunder primarily rests with the State/UT Government. 

No separate enforcement data regarding samples taken from foodgrains distributed under PDS by Food Safety Authorities of the States/UTs is maintained centrally by FSSAI. However, based on information made available by the States/UTs, details of all food samples received, analyzed, found non-conforming to the norms and action taken under provision of FSS Act, 2006. 

This information was given by Shri C.R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had introduced e-form INC-32 - SPICe (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically), in October 2016. The Ministry has since then received positive feedback from stakeholders and professional chambers on SPICe. Ink signed signatures have been replaced with Digital Signatures in the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association which are submitted as linked forms to SPICe. Authenticity of information submitted in the eform is ensured by obtaining declaration to that effect from the professional, such as an advocate/ chartered accountant / cost accountant / company secretary in practice, who certifies that the particulars mentioned in the form including the attachments have been verified from the original/certified records maintained by the applicant and found them to be true, correct and complete. The professional then digitally signs and submits the e-form. In addition, the person named in the Articles of Association as a director/manager/secretary of the company also has to give a declaration confirming the fulfilment of all requirements for registration under the Companies Act and Rules thereunder. Any false statement in this regard is punishable under section 448 of the Companies Act, 2013. Detailed Instruction Kit and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on SPICe form are available on the Ministry’s website for the information and guidance of the stakeholders.

                Non-banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), incorporated under the Companies Act, are regulated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As informed by RBI, the interest rates of lending have been deregulated for banks and NBFCs.  A cap on interest rate is specified only for NBFC-MFIs. In respect of NBFCs, the RBI has issued guidelines through the Fair Practices Code that require the Board of NBFCs to adopt an interest rate model taking into account relevant factors such as cost of funds, margin and risk premium and determine the rate of interest to be charged for loans and advances. Further, the rate of interest and the approach for gradations of risk and rationale for charging different rate of interest to different categories of borrowers is required to be disclosed to the borrower or customer in the application form and also to be communicated explicitly the in sanction letter. This ensures transparency in computation and communication of interest rates charged by NBFCs.

 

The details provided by RBI are Annexed.

However, in view of non-availability of such deposit insurance products, companies were allowed to raise deposits without any deposit insurance till 31st March, 2017, as per proviso to rule 5(1). 

The Act read with Rule 2 of the above mentioned Rules inclusively defines ‘deposits’ with specific exceptions, thereby requiring compliance of the aforesaid provisions for receipts of monies by whatever name called, and protect the investors from the operators of fraudulent money collection schemes. Further, the Companies Act and the aforesaid deposit Rules limit the acceptance of deposits from public to only public companies having a net worth or turnover above prescribed thresholds, prescribe norms for issue of advertisements, credit rating for companies accepting deposits, creation of security, appointment of trustee for depositors and their duties, punishment for contravention of the provisions etc. for safeguarding the interest of investors.

A news item has been published and getting circulated that on the 19th April 2017, lady tourists were allowed entry into Taj Mahal only after making them remove the saffron scarves inscribed with Ram naam. 

Government has received reports from the CISF and ASI in this connection. As per the reports, such an action had not been taken either by any CISF personnel or by any employee of the ASI. There is no such provision in the said rules nor has ASI issued any such circular nor any circular to this effect is in vogue. Commandant CISF, Taj Mahal unit has informed that from the security angle, cigarettes, lighters, chewing gums, chocolates etc. were got deposited in the cloak room but no scarf was sought to be removed. The CCTV footage related to this incident is in the custody of the CISF and it is evident from the CCTV footage that the lady tourist had been granted entry into the Taj complex while wearing the saffron scarf with Ram naam written on it. 

Superintending Archaeologist, Agra has confirmed that the persons seemingly collecting the scarf from a lady tourist are neither any employee of ASI nor of CISF. Prima facie it appears that these persons could be guides or members of the group of the lady tourists. This angle is being enquired into separately. Local police has also been directed to enquire in to this aspect. 

Archaeological Survey of India has not put any restriction on colour or religious design or inscriptions on the scarf or dress of the visitors coming to see the Taj Mahal.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated ‘‘Swachhagraha “Bapu Ko Karyanjali”-A Mission, An Exhibition’ to mark 100th Anniversary of Champaran Satyagrah at the National Archives of India (NAI), here today. He also launched an Online Interactive Quiz “Karyanjali”, which will continue for 30 months till October, 2019. Minister of State (I/C) for Culture and Tourism Dr. Mahesh Sharma and many dignitaries were present. A musical and dance programme based on the banned literature on Mahatma Gandhi and Swachhagraha entitled “Satya, Swachh, Sur” was presented on the occasion. 

Addressing the gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi reached Champaran and witnessed the hardships of people living there. Gandhi Ji showed them the path to and power of peaceful Satyagrah. Champaran Satyagraha catapulted Gandhi Ji to the forefront of India’s freedom struggle. He said that the exhibition, interactive quiz and dance performance are not only formalities, but are pious occasions to dedicate ourselves to the nation. “Along with Shraddhanjali, we should also offer Karyanjali to Mahatma Gandhi”, the Prime Minister added. Shri Modi emphasised that Gandhi ji was basically a Swachhagrahi and was awakening the thought process of the people of India. He pointed out that Champaran can be described as the place of origin of Swachhata Andolan and Champaran Satyagrah gave a new impetus to the freedom struggle and Gandhi ji accorded equal regard to women. ‘Champaran played an important role in the development of Khadi. Swachh Bharat Mission is a movement to fulfil the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and is fast becoming a mass movement in our country’, the Prime Minister said. 

In his address, Dr. Mahesh Sharma said that Mahatma Gandhi used Satyagrah as the main weapon in freedom struggle. He called upon people to focus on Swachhta movement for their overall development. This exhibition links Gandhi Ji’s core principles of Satyagraha with contemporary issues, a movement to improve conditions through Swachhagraha, he added. 

This exhibition is a humble tribute to Gandhi Ji on hundred years of his first experiment of Satyagraha in India, in Champaran and is an attempt to sensitize future generations to fulfill Gandhi’s dream of ‘Swachh Bharat’, where society’s reflection would be as clean as the thoughts within, of every citizen of India. This digital and experiential exhibition strives to connect the essential principles of Satyagrah ‘Jeevan-Chakra’ evolved by Gandhi Ji, with the elements of Swachhagraha, the movement. The exhibition will be open for public in NAI campus for one month and later on, it will be taken to other cities of the country as Mobile exhibition. 

Gandhi Ji was initially reluctant to visit Champaran. Rather, he had hardly knew where Champaran was and was unaware of the conditions of the farmers who cultivated Indigo. Upon his arrival in Patna on 10th April 1917 and thence to in Motihari on 15th April, he immediately realized that his stay there would be a long haul. The drama of Champaran has been succinctly depicted in this exhibition. During his stay, Gandhi Ji delved in detail with the problems of people. Social practices of scavenging, illiteracy, issues covering women and health were found to be the main impediments. These obstacles were common to the political issues that Gandhi Ji confronted. Satyagraha was the weapon he employed to overcome hurdles on both these fronts. 

The Champaran Satyagraha changed the dynamics of Indian politics, catapulting Gandhi Ji to the forefront of India’s freedom struggle. For the first time, people of India realized the power of non-violence and passive resistance, based on action. 

Gandhi Ji’s freedom struggle culminated in India’s independence on 15th August 1947. Though politically independent, India has long since grappled with the same vital issues that Gandhi Ji came face to face with in Champaran, that of health, sanitation, clean water, cleanliness, lack of awareness and education etc. This exhibition is an attempt to link Gandhi Ji’s core principles of Satyagraha with contemporary issues, a movement to improve conditions through Swachhagraha. The younger generation of India needs to understand its importance. In fact we all need to.

                Museum collections are being digitized by various museums under the Scheme for Financial Assistance for Digitisation of Museum Collections. Under the Scheme, the Government has so far provided financial assistance to 18 museums. No proposal is pending with the Government for grant of financial assistance under the scheme. 

The scheme aims at developing a National Database of all art objects and antiquities available with museums at various levels i.e. National level, State level and regional and local museums all across the country in order to provide enhanced accessibility to scholars, researchers and informed visitors.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the exhibition entitled ‘‘Swachhagraha “Bapu Ko Karyanjali”-A Mission, An Exhibition’ on the occasion of 100th Anniversary of Champaran Satyagrah tomorrow in National Archives of India (NAI) Janpath, New Delhi. Briefing media persons here today, Shri Raghvendra Singh, Director General, NAI said that this exhibition is a humble tribute to Gandhi Ji on hundred years of his first experiment of Satyagraha in India, in Champaran and is an attempt to sensitize future generations to fulfill Gandhi’s dream of ‘Swachh Bharat’, where society’s reflection would be as clean as the thoughts within, of every citizen of India. This digital and experiential exhibition strives to connect the essential principles of Satyagrah ‘Jeevan-Chakra’ evolved by Gandhi Ji, with the elements of Swachhagraha, the movement. The exhibition will be open for public in NAI campus for one month and later on, it will be taken to other cities of the country as Mobile exhibition. He informed the media persons that the Prime Minister will launch an “Online Interactive Quiz” on the occasion which will continue for 30 months till October, 2019. 

Gandhi Ji was initially reluctant to visit Champaran. Rather, he had hardly knew where Champaran was and was unaware of the conditions of the farmers who cultivated Indigo. Upon his arrival in Patna on 10th April 1917 and thence to in Motihari on 15th April, he immediately realized that his stay there would be a long haul. The drama of Champaran has been succinctly depicted in this exhibition. During his stay, Gandhi Ji delved in detail with the problems of people. Social practices of scavenging, illiteracy, issues covering women and health were found to be the main impediments. These obstacles were common to the political issues that Gandhi Ji confronted. Satyagraha was the weapon he employed to overcome hurdles on both these fronts. 

The Champaran Satyagraha changed the dynamics of Indian politics, catapulting Gandhi Ji to the forefront of India’s freedom struggle. For the first time, people of India realized the power of non-violence and passive resistance, based on action. 

Gandhi Ji’s freedom struggle culminated in India’s independence on 15th August 1947. Though politically independent, India has long since grappled with the same vital issues that Gandhi Ji came face to face with in Champaran, that of health, sanitation, clean water, cleanliness, lack of awareness and education etc. This exhibition is an attempt to link Gandhi Ji’s core principles of Satyagraha with contemporary issues, a movement to improve conditions through Swachhagraha. The younger generation of India needs to understand its importance. In fact we all need to.

The Minister of Defence, Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley attended the 6th Moscow Conference on International Security on 25 and 26 April 2017 and spoke at the plenary session. 

The Defence Minister had a warm and productive meeting with his Russian counterpart Mr. Sergei Shoigu. 

In his remarks to the media after his meeting with the Russian Defence Minister, Shri Jaitley said, “India has traditionally been participating in the Moscow Conference on International Security. This year it was decided that Indian Defence Minister will participate in the Conference. Both in the Conference and also bilaterally with the Defence Minister of Russia, I had very fruitful discussions”. 

“Diplomatic relations between India – Russia are in the 70th year. This is a relationship which goes far beyond just the relations between the Governments. Russia has been a true and trusted friend of India, which is regarded so by the people of India, and there has been a much greater cooperation at the level of Defence. It is a cooperation which extends to Joint Military exercises, training cooperation and also with regard to supply of equipment which India purchases from Russia. We have future plans to set up manufacturing units in India and these are subjects of discussion which came up in my bilateral meeting with the Defence Minister and I am sure with the level of engagement we have, this relationship will continue to grow”, Shri Jaitley stated.

Following is the speech delivered by the Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley at the 6th Moscow Conference on International Security in Moscow, Russia, today. 

“Mr. Alexander Fomin, Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Mr Hamid Karzai, fellow Ministers, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

It is indeed a pleasure for me to address the Sixth Moscow Conference on International Security. I am honoured to represent India at this important event and thank Deputy Minister Fomin for his invitation. 

At the outset, I felicitate the organisers for the excellent arrangements and the programme drawn up for this conference. 

The participation this year is impressive, with representation from a large number of countries. The Moscow Conference has established itself as one of the most important global forums for discussions on contemporary security matters. 

The theme of the current session covers emerging trends in global security. It is appropriate that we discuss this subject in Moscow, which is one of the key centres for decision-making on global security issues in keeping with Russia’s significance and influence in world affairs. 

As a long-standing friend and strategic partner, India supports an expanded role by Russia in global affairs, especially in our shared neighbourhood. 

The fact is that the problems confronting the world today cannot be solved by any one country or group of countries but require an inclusive approach. 

I welcome the Russian Defence Minister’s Opening Address to the Conference, which underlined Russia’s intent to seek new avenues for regional and global stability and a constructive approach towards resolving conflicts. 

India and Russia share a special and privileged strategic partnership, which has stood the test of time. Our cooperation in defence and security matters in particular has been robust. Russia is India’s foremost defence partner. 

I look forward to my meeting with Deputy Minister Fomin later today to discuss how we can together further deepen our defence ties. 

Over the past few months, India and Russia have taken steps to further strengthen the engagement between our armed forces. We will shortly negotiate a new armed forces training agreement. 

Later this year, Indian and Russian Armed Forces will hold the INDRA tri-services joint military exercises in Russia. This would be a historic occasion as it will be the first time that India and Russia are taking part in joint exercises in such a format with each other or with any other country. 

India deeply appreciates Russia’s support at difficult periods in our history. This unwavering support from Russia is reflected in the depth of public support in India for building a stronger partnership with Russia. 

I am confident that India and Russia can continue to work together on all issues of mutual interest, whether bilaterally or multilaterally in the framework of BRICS, SCO and other forums. 

Friends, 

Ours is an age of rapid and unpredictable change. Nowhere is the pace and direction of these changes faster and more complex than in the geopolitical and strategic arena. 

The continued unpredictability in ties between major powers recently has brought new uncertainties to the fore. The implications of these developments are difficult to fully ascertain at this stage. 

On the one hand, these reflect a wider diffusion of power in the international system, which by itself is a positive development. However, we need to manage this change effectively for our mutual benefit. 

There are also worrying signs of economic protectionism. New barriers to migration and the closing of borders are other elements of such an approach. However, such efforts are unlikely to be able to address the complex issues involved. 

The growing role and importance of Asia is a striking aspect of the changed international environment. For the foreseeable future, Asian economies will continue to be the drivers of global growth. Asia could also be emerging as the stage for competition between large and rising powers. 

Europe appears pre-occupied with the future of the EU project. We are also witnessing a sharpening of divisions in the European continent not seen since the Cold War. 

In West Asia, turmoil thrown up by rapid political changes in the region has yet to be fundamentally resolved. These changes have also led to the rise of groups with extremist, fundamentalist or terrorist ideologies, whose activities have forced open sectarian fissures and violence. 

The situation in Afghanistan continues to be challenging. Facile assessments that imply there is a choice between the evil forces at play in that country are endangering the gains made by the brave Afghan people with the support of the international community over the past decade and more. The recent condemnable and dastardly attack on the Afghan national security forces in Mazar e Sharif was a sharp reminder of this. 

A policy of zero tolerance towards violence and terrorism and continued efforts to consolidate the capacity of the Afghan government to deal with violence as well as promote development are essential. 

India believes that a secure, stable and peaceful Afghanistan is achievable with the continued commitment of the international community. India has provided assistance and support to the friendly people of Afghanistan. We will continue to do as much as we can. We also look forward to working in tandem with all parties that share similar objectives in Afghanistan. We welcome recent efforts by Russia to hold consultations on Afghanistan, in which India had also actively participated. 

Ladies and gentlemen, 

The scourge of terrorism remains the primary security challenge for all peaceful countries. Russia continues to be a target, with the attack in St Petersburg still fresh in our memory. I wish to convey India’s strong solidarity with Russia and our sympathy for the victims and the families affected by of this dastardly attack. 

Terrorism is being reinvented in newer and even more dangerous manifestations. The manipulation of young minds by fundamentalist groups using new technologies and social media has already caused long-term damage to our societies. One manifestation of this is the recent string of lone-wolf attacks in many countries. 

On the positive side, the territory acquired by ISIS in the Middle East has begun to be effectively challenged by several countries. This is reassuring and should be taken to its logical conclusion. Cooperation between major powers in this effort can become a template for similar steps elsewhere. 

However, even as we work to eliminate the breeding grounds of terrorism in West Asia, the dangers of such elements returning to their home countries has become a major challenge. We need to encourage closer information exchanges and intelligence cooperation to address this threat. 

We should also resolutely resist opportunistic efforts by some states to support terrorist proxies by training, funding or providing safe havens to such groups for their limited objectives. 

Distinctions are still sought to be made between good and bad terrorists, despite all the evidence and experience to the contrary. Terrorism will recoil on those who nurture it. 

The global nature of this menace and the need for a coherent and sustained international response to it is now widely acknowledged. Nearly all countries present at this conference are taking proactive steps to counter international terrorism. 

India will steadfastly partner all friendly countries confronted with the challenge of terrorism. We have successfully addressed this threat for over three decades. We will continue to strengthen ongoing cooperation in counter-terrorism with our partners. 

Friends, 

Another serious challenge facing us today is the resurgence of territorial disputes in the maritime domain. 

Maritime territorial disputes are particularly complex and need to be managed effectively, lest they undermine the regional order as well as structures and processes that help maintain peace and stability. 

In the Asia Pacific, the past decades of peaceful growth have transformed that region into one of the most dynamic engines of the global economy. We need to ensure that the continued prosperity of the region is not put at risk. 

India believes that the rights of freedom of navigation and over-flight as well as unimpeded commerce should be ensured. These are vital to India’s own economic engagement with the Indo-Pacific region. 

The recent escalation of tensions in the Korean peninsula is a matter of concern. The linkages between proliferation in that region with the deterioration of India’s own security environment is widely known. Addressing the current situation should acknowledge this aspect and address issues from a broader perspective to be fully effective. 

Another aspect of the current security scenario is the growing salience of non-traditional threats to security. Effective management of cyber-space has emerged as a key national security challenge for many countries. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief requirements are also increasing, fuelled both by man-made and natural causes. 

Ladies and gentlemen, 

India will continue to play its due role in the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability. India’s rapid growth over the past two decades has also helped elevate the economic trajectory of our smaller neighbours. With our renewed emphasis on regional connectivity, the focus on Act East, the ongoing effort to engage with Gulf countries, Africa as well as the wider Indian Ocean Region, India is now at the centre of a dynamic web of partnerships. 

Our economic and diplomatic engagement with the Eurasian region is also a top priority for India. Building on our strong ties with Russia, we also hope to steadily enhance our linkages with Central Asian countries. 

Defence and security cooperation is an increasingly important aspect of India’s diplomatic engagements. We are building greater military to military ties, sharing best practices, enhancing our training cooperation as well as tie-ups in defence industry and research & development for mutual benefit. These efforts are making significant progress. 

I am confident that these partnerships will contribute to a more stable and peaceful environment as well as spur greater economic growth and shared development in India, our region and beyond. 

Thank you!”

                In continuation of the Indian Navy’s overseas deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and West Coast of Africa, three Indian warships INS Mumbai, Trishul, and Aditya, arrived at Toulon for a three day visit today. The ships were warmly received by the Administration in Toulon and the French Navy at Toulon Naval Base in coordination with the Embassy of India. The visiting ships are a part of the Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command and the Task Group is headed by Rear Admiral RB Pandit, the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet, who is flying his flag on the guided missile destroyer, INS Mumbai.

On completion of the visit at Toulon, bilateral exercise Varuna between the Indian Navy and the French Navy is scheduled from 24 to 30 Apr 17. The VARUNA series of exercises began in 2000 and have grown into an institutionalised form of interaction between the two navies. The last VARUNA exercise was held off the Indian coast.

The current visit seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and like minded countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen the existing bonds between India and France. The visit of Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command to France, coinciding with the visit of the IN ships to France and conduct of Exercise VARUNA, amply demonstrate the Indian Navy’s engagement with the French Navy.

The FOC-in-C West is scheduled to visit the French frigate FNS Auvergne, a French Nuclear Submarine Unit, as well as an Underwater Weapons Facility. He would also call on senior official in France, including Vice Admiral Charles-Henri du Che, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Sea Area (CECMED).

Relations between India and France have traditionally been close and friendly. Defence cooperation between India and France has grown substantially in the recent past and the interaction between the Indian Navy and the French Navy has been one of the cornerstones of this framework. With the establishment of the strategic partnership in 1998, there has been significant progress in all areas of bilateral co-operation including defence, nuclear energy and space. A high level committee for defence cooperation between the two countries at the level of Defence Secretaries met in Paris in 2015. Bilateral exercises such as Garuda, Shakti and Varuna have been a regular feature between the two nations.

The IN warships will engage with the French Navy during their stay in the country and a number of professional interactions including the bilateral exercise VARUNA, sports and social engagements are planned. The visiting IN ships will host a reception onboard tomorrow. The interaction between two professional navies will go a long way in enhancing co-operation and understanding between the two.

                In a solemn ceremony on 24 Apr 17, the Su30 MKI aircraft was inducted into 221 Squadron, ‘Valiants’, of the IAF. Air Marshal C Hari Kumar AVSM VM VSM ADC, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Air Command IAF was the chief guest for the occasion. Among the distinguished guests were Mr Daljeet Singh, CEO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and other officials from HAL.

The ‘Valiants’ which flew Mig-23 aircraft till 2009, is now equipped with the formidable Su30 MKI aircraft. The Su 30 MKI is a state of the art all weather multi role fighter aircraft capable of undertaking varied air combat and ground attack missions.

The ’Valiants’ were formed as an offensive fighter squadron on 14 Feb 1963 at Barrackpore with Sqn Ldr N Chatrath as the first Commanding Officer. The Squadron was than equipped with three types of aircraft namely the Vampires, Spitfire, Hurricane and Su-7 aircraft. The squadron has changed many bases during its fifty four years long journey and has taken part in 1971 War and Kargil operations. Su-7 aircraft of the Valiants roared over East Pakistan in support of the Indian Army’s blitzkrieg advance in 1971. The ‘Valiants’, operating the MiG-23s, were the first ones to fire weapons on the enemy during the Kargil war. Many of the squadron pilots have been decorated with gallantry awards over the years.

Personnel from the Air Force Station and their families witnessed a well organised ceremony on this occasion. Air Cmde DV Khot VM, Air Officer Commanding of the Air Force Station and his team have worked hard for the smooth induction of the new Su-30 Squadron. The induction of the Squadron will boost the offensive capabilities of the Indian Air Force in this sector. The Flight Commander of the Squadron performed an impressive Low Level Aerobatic Display.

Air Marshal C Hari Kumar formally handed over the official documents of the Squadron to Wing Commander HS Luthra, the Commanding Officer of the Squadron. In his address, the Air Marshal congratulated the air warriors of the Squadron on the timely induction of the mighty Su 30 MKI. He appreciated the tireless efforts put in by all the personnel of the base. The Air Marshal and his wife Mrs Devika Hari Kumar interacted with the squadron personnel during the tea after the ceremony.

Army Commander Conference came to an end on 22 April 17 with the closing remarks of General Bipin Rawat. The Biannual Army Commanders’ Conference had commenced on 17 April 2017.

 

During his closing address the Chief of Army Staff impressed upon the need to work in a collaborative manner for maintaining combat effectiveness of the Army. He expressed his confidence at the way the Army has been adapting itself to the dynamic internal and external operational environment. He added that there is a need for sustained and holistic modernisation of the Army wherein combat and manoeuvre arms, Air Defence and Aviation are on high priority.

 

    It has been decided to give heft to the modernization plan of the Army. A comprehensive plan to speed up land acquisition for infrastructure development has been decided to be addressed through the State Governments. The Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshall BS Dhanoa and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba had also addressed the Conference emphasising on evolving a joint operational philosophy. During the deliberation a session was dedicated to discussion with Ministry of Defense to evolve a more wholesome action plan on administrative and modernization issues.

 

During the deliberations, important issues having HR policy ramifications have been discussed. There is an impetus to evolve a more pragmatic HR plan. The core values of Army though haven’t changed; rapid societal changes and discernible impact of socio-economic aspirations on Army have been a focus area of the just concluded Conference. The Army unlike most Government departments has a highly pyramidal structure, which results in over 50 percent personnel not being promoted despite being highly competent thus necessitating optimum utilisation of this pool of competent personnel. The Conference deliberated measures to enhance transparency and inclusiveness leading to greater equability. The proposals to make Short Service Officers entry scheme more popular, streamlining the intake pattern, employment of Women Officers and grant of Honorary ranks to Junior Commissioned Officers and Non Commissioned Officers have been deliberated with positive roadmaps.

 

The Chief during the course of the deliberation highlighted the need for a more participative form of policy formulation. Concerned branches of the Army HQ have accordingly been directed to interact with wide cross-section of offices, branches, and personnel.

 

Army Commanders’ Conference is an important event in the planning and execution process of Indian Army. To ensure due diligence, decisions are taken through collegiate system comprising Army Commanders and Senior Officers.

India and the Republic of Korea (RoK) signed an Inter-governmental Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Defence Industry Co-operation in Shipbuilding here today. The MoU was signed by Secretary (Defence Production), Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta from the Indian side and Minister of Defence Acquisition and Programme Administration (DAPA), Mr. Chang Myoung-Jin from the RoK side. The MoU will help the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India. 

The salient points of the MoU are as follows:- 

• Develop and strengthen defence industry co-operation between Republic of India and the Republic of Korea. 
• The two sides will recommend the organisations for collaborating in the implementation of specific projects. 
• The organisations recommended for co-operative projects may conclude separate agreements (contracts) between them to implement the specific projects. 
• The MoU will come into effect from the date of signature by both sides and will be initially valid for a period of five years and would be automatically extendable for further successive five year at a time. 

The Inter-Governmental MoU, was conceived under the overall umbrella of the ‘Special Strategic Partnership’ between both sides as declared in the Joint Statement of the Prime Minister of India and the President of RoK in May 2015. 

To substantiate the ‘Special Strategic Partnership’, the two sides had inter-alia agreed to encourage greater co-operation between their shipyards in the defence sector. Accordingly, it was decided to sign an inter-governmental MoU on ‘Defence Industry Co-operation in Shipbuilding’. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has accorded its approval for signing the above MoU with RoK and also for nominating Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL), Visakhapatnam from the Indian side for the collaboration. RoK will indicate the name of its recommended organisation for the collaboration in due course of time. 

The co-operation with the recommended Korean Shipyard would enable HSL to upgrade and modernise its facilities and execute naval shipbuilding projects in a timely and cost effective manner. HSL would be able to imbibe best practices in shipbuilding leading to effective project management. 

As a result of the proposed partnership, the production of HSL is expected to grow substantially, leading to creation of more employment avenues. Further, in consultation with the recommended Korean partner, it is planned to identify and develop indigenous sources/vendors for the supply of majority of the material and equipment that would be needed in co-operative naval projects, thus paving the way for the development of ancillary industry /maritime cluster in the region.

                Indian Navy successfully undertook the firing of BrahMos Land Attack Supersonic Cruise Missile from a ship today. This variant of Long Range BrahMos Missile was fired from Indian Naval Ship Teg, a Guided Missile Frigate, on a target on land. BrahMos Missile has been jointly developed by India and Russia, and its Anti Ship variant has already been inducted into Indian Navy. Majority of the frontline ships of Indian Navy, like the Kolkata, Ranvir and Teg classes of ships, are capable of firing this missile. Land Attack variant of BrahMos Missile provides Indian Naval Ships the capability to precisely neutralise selected targets deep inland, far away from coast, from stand-off ranges at sea. 

This successful maiden firing of BrahMos Land Attack Supersonic Cruise Missile has significantly enhances the prowess of Indian Navy and has placed India into the club of select few nations.

                Major General (Retired) Somnath Jha, aged 58 years, after serving the Army for 37 years, remains a man on the mission. This third generation soldier took up the daunting task of cycling throughout the Nation for 183 days as his tribute to around 21,000 Armed Forces martyrs since Independence. He cycled 11000km in 43,528 minutes, dedicating two minutes of cycling to each martyr. Asked as to ‘why two minutes of cycling’ and the Veteran replied ‘we observe two minutes silence for each of our martyr’. 

On this journey, Major General Jha was pleasantly surprised at the support from individuals, local government offices, police and citizen groups. He was overwhelmed by the fact that most people he met related to the sentiment of his mission and joined in to pay homage to the martyrs for whom he was riding. 

Gen Jha concluded his homage journey by laying of wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti on 19 Apr 2017 and vowed to undertake similar endeavour once the National War Memorial is dedicated to the Nation.

                As part of the Indian Navy’s Overseas Deployment (OSD) to the Mediterranean Sea and the West Coast of Africa, four warships, namely Indian Naval Ships Mumbai, Trishul, Tarkash and Aditya, arrived at Souda Bay, Greece for a three-day visit yesterday. The warships will engage with the Hellenic Navy during their stay in the country. Apart from professional interactions, a number of sports and social engagements are planned, which would go a long way in enhancing co-operation and understanding between the two navies. 

The visiting ships are part of the Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command and are based in Mumbai. The Task Group is headed by Rear Admiral RB Pandit, the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet, who is flying his flag on the indigenous guided missile destroyer, INS Mumbai. 

The current visit seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and like-minded countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen the existing bonds between India and Greece. 

India and Greece are two of the world’s ancient civilisations with a long history of close contact. Building upon the rich and longstanding relations that have existed between India and Greece, both nations have developed warm relations in several spheres. A number of bilateral agreements for co-operation and cultural exchange exist between the two nations with the majority of them being signed in 2007 during the visit of President APJ Abdul Kalam. Trade between India and Greece remains vibrant with many Indian corporate houses having strong interests in Greece. A MoU for defence cooperation between India and Greece was signed in 1998. The Greek defence minister Mr Pannos Kammenos visited India in December 2015 and held discussions with his Indian counterpart Mr Manohar Parrikar, on various issues such as naval cooperation, training and regional security. 

Over the last few decades India has made substantial advances in terms of designing and building warships indigenously and the visiting ships bear testimony to these capabilities. INS Mumbai and Aditya have been designed by the design bureau of the Indian Navy and constructed at Indian shipyards, namely, the Mazagon Dockyard Limited (in Mumbai), and, the Garden Reach Ship Builders and Engineers Limited (in Kolkata). The destroyer Mumbai and the frigates Trishul and Tarkash are equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors. 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region, including piracy off the coast of Somalia. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with Hydrographic Survey, Search and Rescue, EEZ Surveillance and other such capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment in the Mediterranean Sea will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas.

Indian Air Force is embarking upon a mountaineering expedition to Mt Dhaulagiri in Nepal from 15 Apr to 03 Jun 2017. Mt Dhaulagiri is the seventh highest mountain in the world at 8167 M (26795 Ft) and is the peak which was conquered last among the peaks above 8000 meters.

A team of 12 IAF mountaineers led by Gp Capt RC Tripathi, would attempt to summit the peak. Earlier, in 2005, IAF had created history by hoisting tricolour and IAF flag on top of the World during its first ever expedition to Mt Everest and again in 2011 during the all women Everest expedition. Keeping the spirit of its motto ‘Touch the Sky with Glory’, IAF is poised to hoist the national and IAF flag on summit of this mountain. This exposes the air warriors to varied operational environments, and is aimed to promote mountaineering in IAF and thereby motivating the Indian youth to join Indian Air Force.

                The UK Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon is on a four-day visit to India from April 11, 2017. The India-UK delegation level talks were held here today where the UK side was led by Sir Michael Fallon while the Indian delegation was headed by the Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley. 

Following is the text of the Joint Statement issued after the talks: 

“Minister of Defence Shri Arun Jaitley and Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon set out a shared vision for the India-UK Defence Partnership. 

At the invitation of Minister of Defence Shri Arun Jaitley, the Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon visited India for the India-UK Strategic Defence Dialogue during 11-14 April 2017. The visit reaffirmed and consolidated UK-India defence cooperation in the framework of the Defence and International Security Partnership, agreed in November 2015, and the subsequent Joint Statement between the Governments of India and the UK in November 2016. 

This enduring defence partnership will encompass not only cooperation in defence industry but also stronger military to military engagement, including training and advanced joint exercises. 

The renewed engagement will place capability and technology development at its core and seek to harness the complementary strengths of both nations in defence manufacturing and use the combined strengths of their respective private and public sectors to develop defence solutions for use in both home and shared export markets. 

The Defence Ministers will also continue to consult and co-ordinate policies across a range of global security challenges, especially those intended to eliminate the scourge of international terrorism, in pursuit of their shared goal of a more secure world. 

AN ENHANCED DEFENCE PARTNERSHIP

Based on the Defence and International Security Partnership (DISP) and building on existing Defence Consultative Group (DCG) mechanisms, both sides will explore additional areas for institutional engagement. 

The Ministers agreed to further strengthen their naval and maritime interactions, including enhanced Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) through the bilateral technical agreement to exchange information to track terrorist and pirate vessels, a key deliverable of the DISP. The two Ministers also agreed to further develop cooperation between the UK Hydrographic Office and the Indian Navy Hydrographic Office. 

India and the UK will endeavour to build a range of Capability Partnerships focussing on varied aspects of military effectiveness such as specialised training interactions and exchange of best practices in the following areas – Counter Terrorism (CT), Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (CIED), Air Force Training, Air Total Safety, Aircraft Carriers, Maritime Safety, Shipbuilding and UN Peacekeeping. Efforts are already underway with exchanges of subject matter experts to discuss air safety collaboration and future CT requirements. The Ministers tasked the relevant Executive Steering Groups (ESGs) to finalise proposals for consideration at the next DCG meeting scheduled later this year. 

As India and the UK continue to transform and modernise their defence structures with a shared desire to maximise the efficiencies and operational benefits of establishing joint force structures, the two Ministers agreed to share relevant experience in this domain. 

DEFENCE INDUSTRY

Whilst acknowledging the progress being made, the two Ministers recognised the potential for further cooperation in defence manufacturing between the UK and Indian companies under the ‘Make in India’ framework. 

Shri Jaitley welcomed the UK’s interest in manufacturing in India as evidenced through recent announcements including the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Bharat Dynamics Ltd. and Thales UK on technology transfer opportunities for missile systems and efforts to develop an Advanced Hawk jet trainer jointly by the BAE Systems and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). 

To further encourage and facilitate cooperation between the UK and Indian companies, the two Ministers agreed to extend the current Defence Equipment Cooperation MOU and work towards early completion of an expanded MOU, that will provide a platform for the UK and Indian industries to collaborate on and support transfer of technology on projects in areas of mutual interest. 

The two Ministers welcomed measures to ensure life cycle support and sustenance of UK-origin defence platforms used by India, which may include setting up joint ventures and other collaborative arrangements. 

The UK and India will encourage interactions between the Indian Army Design Bureau and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S)/Army Capability Branch through their Defence Equipment Sub-Group. 

The UK and India will explore establishing a secure communications method in order to share classified material. The two countries will also consider upgrading their bilateral General Security Arrangement. 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

The two Ministers recognised the need for stronger R&D cooperation, including access to Defence R&D training, to enable new and vibrant technology partnerships across the Defence domain. 

They noted recent progress made on Defence Science and Technology collaboration with the signing of the Phase 2 follow-on research Collaborative Project Agreement on Human Sciences, signed at Aero India 2017. 

CONCLUSION

The above commitments will better enable the UK and India to meet the evolving threats and challenges that face democracies in the 21st Century. Both countries recognised their shared perspectives on the regional and international security situation and agreed to maintain their close interaction in this regard. 

Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon thanked Minister of Defence Shri Arun Jaitley for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation and looked forward to a return visit by the Minister of Defence to the UK.”

A distress call was received from a foreign merchant vessel MV OS 35 (Tuvalu registered vessel), which was attacked and boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden late night on 08 April. Indian Navy ships Mumbai, Tarkash, Trishul and Aditya proceeding on deployment to the Mediterranean and passing through the Gulf of Aden, responded to the call and rapidly closed the merchant vessel by the early hours of 09 April. The Indian warships established contact with the Captain of the merchant vessel, who along with the crew had locked themselves in a strong room on board (citadel), as per standard operating procedure. An Indian Navy helicopter undertook aerial reconnaissance of the merchant vessel at night, and at sunrise, to sanitize the upper decks of the merchant ship and ascertain the location of pirates, if still on board. Emboldened by Indian Navy's helicopter cover, and on receiving the 'all clear signal' that no pirates were visible on the upper decks, some crew members gradually emerged from the strong room and carried out a search of the ship and ascertained that the pirates had fled the ship at night. Subsequently, in a show of international maritime cooperation against piracy, a boarding party from the nearby Chinese Navy ship went on board the merchant ship, while the Indian Naval helicopter provided air cover for the operation. It has been established that all 19 Filipino crew members are safe. The Captain of the merchant vessel profusely thanked the Indian Naval ships for their response and for providing air cover.

                Hon’ble Chief of Andhra Pradesh Shri Nara Chandrababu Naidu welcomed the TU-142M Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft of the Indian Navy which landed at INS Dega for the last time this morning.  A special ceremony organised at INS Dega to formally welcome the aircraft at Visakhapatnam was attended by Shri P Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Hon’ble Union Civil Aviation Minister, Govt. of India, Vice Admiral HCS Bisht, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, MPs, MLAs and host of other Civil Dignitaries.  On arrival of the TU, the Hon’ble CM interacted with the crew members and exchanged mementos.

            Govt. of Andhra Pradesh had earlier requested the Ministry of Defence for allotment of one de-inducted TU-142M for converting it into a museum. The request of Govt. of Andhra Pradesh is being processed at the Ministry of Defence, New Delhi.  Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) would be coordinating all activities related to aircraft museum on behalf of Govt. of AP.  The TU is likely to be dismantled and transported by road on trailers and re-assembled on the Beach Road near Kursura Submarine Museum.

            With the imposing looks and a lethal punch to match, the TU-142M aircraft which have been nothing short of a ‘Flying Destroyer’, was given an impressive welcome as it landed for the last time at Visakhapatnam by a flypast of three Chetak helicopters, two Kamov  helicopters, two Dorniers, and one P-8I Aircraft. After having served the Indian Navy with pride and élan for 29 years, during which it accomplished 30,000 hrs of accident free flying, the TU-142M aircraft were given a befitting farewell on 29 March 2017 at INS Rajali, India’s premiere Naval Air Station in Arakkonam, Tamil Nadu. Over the years, the TU-142M has rendered yeoman service to the nation and has taken part in all major exercises and operations including Operation Cactus in Maldives, Op Vijay in 1998, Op Parakram in 2002 and Anti-piracy Operations. The Squadron was awarded Unit Citation by the Chief of Naval Staff in the year 2002 for outstanding professionalism and momentous contribution to the Service and adjudged the Best Frontline Squadron on numerous occasions over the years.

             Earlier, the Hon’ble Chief Minister interacted with the family members of Shri B Sambha Murthy, Chargeman, Shri P Nagendra Rao, Shri RV Prasad Babu both Highly Skilled (HSK) Grade II, Shri N Chinna Rao and Shri G Srinivas both Tradesman Mate (TMM) of NAD who went missing in Indian Air Force AN-32 aircraft last July and distributed Cheques of Rs. 5 Lakhs as ex-gratia.

                The Technology of processing Nickel Free High-Nitrogen Steel (HNS) has been developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). HNS has been found to have potential for use in armour applications. Non-exclusive Transfer of Technology (ToT) has been given to M/s Jindal Stainless Hisar Limited, a private industry, on 1st March, 2017. This being a non-exclusive ToT, the technology can also been transferred to any other private or public industry, interested in absorbing this technology. However, the ToT does not involve a supply agreement. 

The development of HNS was initiated as a basic Research & Development (R&D) and the technology fits to the policy of ‘Make in India’ initiative. 

HNS has potential for use in all armour applications. However, for material to be qualified and used in a specific combat vehicle application, it has to undergo many types of tests by the designers of the vehicle, including ballistic testing against specific ammunitions. The qualification of any material for its introduction into any armoured application is a long process and HNS has not yet been qualified for use in these applications. 

This information was given by Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in a written reply to Shri B. Senguttuvan in Lok Sabha today.

                Defence being a technology and innovation driven sector, latest technology and inventions are crucial to achieve self-reliance in defence sector. 

The goal of acquiring advanced technologies from foreign countries is pursued through bilateral arrangements with various countries, industrial policy and Defence Procurement Policy. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has bilateral and multilateral international cooperation with countries such as Russia, Israel, USA, South Korea, Singapore, UK etc, for the development of strategic, unique, transformative, advanced technology / systems / platforms in alignment with ‘Make in India’. Apart from this, in the last two years, Indo-US Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) and a Joint Working Group (JWG) on Defence Equipment and Technology Cooperation with Japan have been started with a view to promote cooperation in the field of defence equipments and technology. 

In order to facilitate collaborations between Indian and foreign companies so as to have technology transfer from foreign to Indian companies, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for defence has been revised and under the revised policy, FDI upto 49% is allowed through automatic route and beyond 49% under Government approval route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded. 

In the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), under ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ categories of capital acquisition, foreign companies and Indian companies are encouraged to work together to produce defence equipment in India as part of Make in India. The objective of these categories of capital acquisition is to encourage technology partnerships between Indian and foreign companies. 

This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Rajesh Pandey in Lok Sabha today.

                Re-settlement training courses are being conducted for retiring personnel of Armed Forces since more than four decades.  A Memorandum of Understanding between Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship has been signed on 13th  July, 2015.  Resettlement training of Directorate General Resettlement

(DGR) has now been linked to:


	
		
			
			(i)
			
			
			National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) based skill training for Ex-servicemen.
			
		
		
			
			(ii)
			
			
			Assessment and certification by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) – NSDC Certification will equip Ex-servicemen with required standards and better certification which would help them in securing suitable jobs in Government / Private sector.
			
		
		
			
			(iii)
			
			
			Placement linked training – with NSQF skill based training and Common Norms, placement of trainees is expected to improve substantially.
			
		
	


Resettlement courses are being conducted in Government as well as private training institutes that are certified by NSDC.

55 private training institutes were engaged for skill training in Financial Year 2016-17.

There is no such proposal at present.

                The Government has recently approved a Defence Innovation Fund (DIF) which aims at creation of ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development in Defence, by engaging R&D institutes/academia and industry including start-ups & individual innovators and provide them the funding to carry out innovative development which has the potential for future commercialization. The DIF is initially proposed to be funded by two Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), M/s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and M/s Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). Later on, the Fund can also receive grants from Government and from other not-for-profit organisations in public or private sector.

In addition, the Government has also launched a scheme of Technology Development Fund (TDF) which aims at funding the development of defence and dual use technologies that are currently not available with the Indian defence industry, or have not been developed so far, thus creating an ecosystem for enhancing cutting edge technology capability for Defence applications. The TDF scheme is implemented by DRDO and provides for assistance in the form of grant to public and private industries for design and development of key defence technologies.

                The Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)-2016 has provision for capital acquisition of defence equipment under categories of ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’, ‘Make’, ‘Buy & Make’ and ‘Buy (Global)’. Under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy(Indian)’, ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Make’ categories, the contracts are signed with Indian vendors, and for ‘Buy & Make and ‘Buy (Global)’ categories, the contracts are signed with foreign vendors. During the last two years and the current year till Dec 2016, the Government has signed 141 contracts with total value of approx. Rs 2,00,011 crore for capital procurement of defence equipment, out of which, 90 contracts worth approx. Rs 83,345 crore have been signed with Indian vendors under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)', ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Make’ categories, while 51 contracts worth approx. Rs l,l6,666 crore have been signed with foreign vendors under ‘Buy (Global)’ and ‘Buy & Make (Global)’ categories of capital acquisition.

The defence equipment for which contracts have been signed inter-alia include rockets, radars, artillery guns, helicopters, aircraft, missiles, ammunition and simulators. The timelines for operationalization of a contract are governed by the terms and conditions of the contract. The time taken to undertake capital procurement of defence equipment depends on the nature, size and complexity of the equipment.

As the projects are executed by the respective firms, post award of the contract, the data related to the employment generation in the projects is not maintained in the Department.

The factual data shows marginal shortfall in achieving the targets, which is on account of reasons like delay in receipt of inputs from trade sources both indigenous and import origin, capacity constraints in some areas,  Non realization of advance from Police units and civil market for arms and weapons, delay in indents for logistic vehicles, Non receipt of Bulk Production Clearance, etc.  However, in terms of value of Issue, the year 2015-16 achieved a growth of 14.80%.

CAG audit has indicated instances of advance issue of vouchers.  The cases of advance issue vouchers mentioned by CAG audit have been examined in consultation with OFB for corrective action.  Principal Controller of Accounts (Factories) has instructed Branch Account Offices not to accept issue vouchers without dispatch details.  With the introduction of payment of Excise Duties (ED) by the Ordnance Factories on their products from 1st June, 2015, Issues of the items are linked with Excise Gate Pass thereby eliminating instances of advance issue vouchers.

This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri B. V. Naik in Lok Sabha today.

A total of 41 participants from 27 different countries are attending the course to derive benefit from it and to be available to the United Nations for deployment in field areas. CUNPK is the pioneer institute to conduct this training and has continued training such officers since 2015.

                The Delhi Horse Show has been in existence since the early part of 20th century. In the days of Raj, it was considered one of the main events in the Indian social calendar and everyone descended on Delhi from all part of the Country. After Independence, the tradition continued and it remained India’s premier Horse Show till it was discontinued in 1979. 

In 1986, the erstwhile Delhi Polo Club decided to revive the Show, which is the only equestrian show in India that has events involving Tent Pegging, Dressage and Show Jumping events for serious riders to fun gymkhana events for little tots and teenagers. Army’s Polo & Riding Club has been organizing this biggest and most popular Horse Show in India for the past 31 years. 

This year Delhi Horse Show saw over 500 horses and competitors in action from 26 Mar to 02 Apr 2017 from across the country in four categories – senior, young rider, junior and children. Participants included the 61st Cavalry, President’s Bodyguard, RVC, ASC, Army Commands, National Defence Academy, Assam Rifles, Punjab Police, BSF, Delhi Police, MP Police, ITBP and prominent senior civilians. Reputed schools and colleges including Rashtriya Indian Military College, Mayo College, Punjab Public School, Nabha also had a formidable representation. 

Lt Gen Ashok Ambre, Quartermaster General and President of Army’s Polo & Riding Club gave away the major prizes during a grand Ceremony on 02 Apr 2017.

                The responsibility of dealing with law and order problem rests primarily with the respective State Governments. However the efforts of State Government of Manipur were supplemented by the Central Government. As per the information received from Ministry of Home Affairs, the following steps were taken by the Government of India to clear up the blockade imposed by UNC, of National Highways leading into Manipur since 01.11.2016. Ministry of Home Affairs provided additional Central Armed Police Force companies to assist the State Government of Manipur for maintenance of law and order and security coverage for movement of essential supplies, including movement of petroleum products on National Highways, into Manipur.

Besides movement of goods/POL products under security convoys, POL products were airlifted to Manipur.

There was intervention at the level of Union Home Minister who held a meeting with the Chief Ministers of Nagaland and Manipur to impress upon the urgency of opening of National Highways in Manipur.

Ministry of Home Affairs took initiative to hold tripartite meetings with Government of Manipur and UNC to resolve the issue. Meetings were held on 15.11.2016, 03.02.2017, 07.02.2017 and 19.03.2017. The blockade has since been lifted by UNC with effect from 19.03.2017.

Government of Manipur has intimated that six (6) cases have been registered in respective police station jurisdictions where incidents of arson/damages were reported and investigated into.

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Baijayant Jay Panda in the Lok Sabha today.

                Construction of ten roads (and some major bridges) of a total length of 433.225 Km under the North Eastern States Roads Investment Programme (NESRIP), an Asian Development Bank (ADB) assisted road project,  is presently under implementation. 

 

The State Public Works Departments in the six states are the implementing agencies.  In Assam, the work has been completed (Bilasipara to Fakirgram NH-31) and under the second project (Barpeta to Kalitakuchi) in Assam and (Garobadha to Dalu NH-51) in Meghalaya, more than 50% of the work has been completed. As for the remaining projects, progress is at different stages of construction ranging from 10% to 42%.  

 

  Reason for delay are as under:

1.         Delay in land acquisition.

2.         Delay in utility shifting and tree cutting.

 

Four roads under Tranche-I are likely to be completed by 30th June, 2019 and the remaining roads by March 31, 2020.  

 

The      Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved loan of US$200 million for NESRIP, but release is on reimbursement basis after the submission of necessary documents. The withdrawal from ADB stands at US$25.75 million for Tranche-1 and US$20.28 million for Tranche-2 as on 31.3.2017.

The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region compiles expenditure figures from non-exempted Ministries/Departments on annual basis. The allocation and actual expenditure figures in respect of these Ministries/Departments are forwarded to Ministry of Finance for vetting.

The Ministry-wise lump-sum allocation to the North Eastern Region is made through the Union Budget. While some schemes have State-wise allocation, others are sectoral. Through a system of continuous monitoring, review and follow-up, all attempts are made to ensure that the amount allocated to the State under the NLCPR Scheme of this Ministry is spent by the State Government.

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Ram Nath Thakur in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Union Minister, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, and eminent film personality, Shri Akshay Kumar, today undertook a toilet pit emptying exercise in Reghwan village, in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh. The Minister and Shri Kumar personally led a team of senior officers of State and Central government, to a household in the village that has adopted a twin pit toilet model in their toilet, and proceeded to empty the filled pit of the toilet and held up the compost found in the toilet in their hands to demonstrate that the exercise is perfectly safe and that there should be no stigma attached to it. 

In his Mann Ki Baat in February 2017, Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, had appreciated a similar exercise conducted in Warangal district of Telangana. He had also called upon public personalities from various walks of life to join in creating awareness about safe, “waste to wealth” toilet technology. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that, under Swachh Bharat Mission, twin pit toilet technology is the most preferred, safe and low-cost technology, promoted among all rural households. He said that a pit in a standard twin-pit toilet fills up in roughly 5 to 6 years, and the waste may then be easily re-directed to the second pit by the members of the household. He added that in another 6 months to 1 year, the waste in the filled pit decomposes completely, and turns into safe-to-handle compost, which is rich in NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients, which makes it ideal for use in agriculture. He heralded this as a great example of creating wealth from waste. 

He encouraged State government and influential figures in society to generate awareness about the above facts as part of their grassroots information, education and communication (IEC) efforts and public appearances, respectively. He appreciated the laudable beginning made by Shri Kumar in this regard. 

Shri Akshay Kumar spoke about the myths, biases and stigma against handling of decomposed human waste that continue to pervade most rural communities. He said that such safe toilet technologies must be adopted and made a plea to all citizens of India to stand up against discrimination and to take pride in installing, maintaining and cleaning their own household toilets for the health and dignity of their families. 

Following the Minister and Shri Akshay Kumar, Member of Parliament from Madhya Pradesh, Shri Subhash Patel, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Additional Chief Secretary (Panchayat and Rural Development), Madhya Pradesh; and other senior district officials also proceeded to empty a toilet pit in the village. The exercise was followed by a Swachh Bharat Mission review meeting with the district and State officials in Indore.

Union Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar today inaugurated the one day National Consultation on Revised Accreditation Framework here in New Delhi. Highlighting the importance of quality education the Minster said any accreditation process or any certification or assessment process must also take into account the final product of it. Subject knowledge is one thing, the delivery of subject knowledge, infrastructure and building skill component in a student are another part. But ultimately the aim of education should be to build a good human being and only that kind of education could be termed creative that is capable of doing so and hence it should also be checked whether the parameters of intention, policy and schemes are getting reflected in the very institution, he said.

 

 



 

Shri Javadekar appreciated the observations of MoS Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey in this connection and emphasised to think of education in totality and said it must reflect in the ranking of institutions He said quality of education imparted by any institution will be reflected in its adaptability to change.

 

The Minister referred to the recent advertisements of institutions citing its NAAC ranking, its certifications and assessment reports and on its basis the trend of students in selecting institutes for further education. He said now the institutes have also added up NIRF ranking as a feather in their caps. The Minister said now the students as well as the society can’t be misguided any more as the pressure of quality is now working. He said there is no substitute for quality and it must be sharpened regularly. Shri Javadekar said our government exists not merely on the majority mandate we have got, rather we are here to reform, transform and perform. He said complete transformation of education is a dire need now. He advised NAAC authorities to expand its team in order to make inroads into reaching out more and more institutions. He also stressed upon the cross checking of data collected and ensure sanctity and authenticity of Data Base created in this area.

 



 

The Minister said the system created for this purpose must be transparent with clear cut rules and regulations and there should be no scope for fraudulent means. He hoped that today’s deliberations will pave way for a new transparent accreditation system. Shri Javadekar also pressed for using Aadhar linking and gave examples of stopping of malpractices in LPG distributions, Neem coated urea distributions to farmers thereby savings checking of syphoning of funds. He also cited the example of 4.5 lakh fake registrations in Mid Day Meal schemes in Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh after the scheme was linked with Aadhar. He said so far 112 crore Aadhar cards have been made which is a glaring proof of our nation’s changing and marching ahead.

 

The Minister also suggested for having more than 4-5 agencies for issuing rankings of higher education  institutes as it will give more credibility. The Minister informed that in the forthcoming meeting of IIT Council on 28th April this month we will see whether IITs can also have a say in granting accreditation to institutions. Shri Javadekar said “If we want to reach institutions in a time bound manner and assess them properly we need more valuators and therefore we want to build at least 3-4 more institutes and we should also give a message to institutions in this regard”.  He further said that the commitment of Modi Government towards quality of education is unmatched and final as only the quality improvement will lead the nation in marching ahead. He said research and innovations are possible only there we respect the talent. He said the new ranking assessment system being chartered today is very important. The Minister urged the participants to complete this process in next three months preferably before next Independence Day. 

 

Today’s meeting was also addressed by MoS HRD Shri Mahendra Nath Pandey and Secretary Higher Education Shri K.K.Sharma.

 

The National Consultation is being organized to discuss the revised Accreditation Framework developed recently by the NAAC. The foci of the revised framework are augmented use of technology, greater objectivity, and transparency of the process. Working groups of experts have deliberated and developed the formats for universities, autonomous colleges and affiliated colleges. The outcome of pilot study to validate the framework and feedback by stakeholders will also be considered in National Consultation. Approximately 100 experts comprising of eminent educationists, current and former Vice Chancellors / Directors, Statutory Bodies, Academics, Principals of Colleges will participate in the National Consultation. The inputs of the National Consultation would be used to fine-tune and finalise the revised Accreditation Framework which is slated to be launched from July 2017.

                Union Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar today launched the Fund and Reform Tracker developed by Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) here in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion the Minister said the Fund and Reform Tracker, as the name suggests, will monitor RUSA projects from the minute they are sanctioned and track their progress till their final completion. The Reform Tracker, on the other hand, will be a sort of a report card of states with details of their higher education policies, plans and best practices. These have largely been reflected in their commitment given to the central government.



There has never been a more exciting time in the education sector as now. To re-imagine our classrooms, be in sync with time and technology and engage stakeholders in constant conversation to do and achieve more, is the aim of this App, Shri Javadekar added.

He said this interface will be available for the central government, the state higher education stakeholders and institutional leaders, apart from thousands of vendors panned across India. Each will get a varied level of access to the App depending on their role and functionality.



Some of the key highlights of the App are;

It will capture the fund allocation as per the Project Approval Board, the instalment-wise fund release by the centre and the state, the institution-wise key project, vendors appointed and the payment made to them as also stage-wise photos and time stamps of payments made and comments entered.

Component-wise details give a quick snapshot into the funding of RUSA projects. Whether it is infrastructure grants of equity initiatives, this window gives a peek into the funds approved, the amount released, the sum utilized and the percentage of work completed.

Stakeholders can also get granular details on the money released from the centre and the state. The date stamps give a picture on the timelines followed and the pictures provide the ground reality.

Tracking projects is the soul of this App, and every initiative is tagged with a unique ID number, thus providing the entire story of how an idea germinated and matured.

A powerful Dashboard gives an overall picture of the scheme and the state-wise performance of the impact that the programme has made.

Shri Javadekar said RUSA has invested and will continue to infuse resources in state universities. With over 94% of India’s student population in state institution, the two-year-old RUSA scheme has made its impact felt at thousands of campuses. As India’s youth demands high quality education and a rich campus experience, it is imperative that states pick best practices from each other.

Hence, it is only critical that RUSA expands in breadth and deepens in its reach. And at the MHRD, this reliance on technology will pave the way for smarter governance in the New Digital India our Prime Minister speaks of, the Minister further added.

Today this is a unique event as well as experiment wherein we have inaugurated 17 facilities created under Rashtriya Ucchatat Shiksha Abiyan (RUSA) in one go in 14 states”. He said that Centre and State Government will be deliberating and discussing upon the modalities for bringing improvement further. Under the concept of RUSA the quality of education can go up by improving the research labs infrastructure and creating smart class rooms and various other programmes by which the quality enhancement and value addition to the students happen, Shri Javadekar added. The Minister said ‘RUSA is a success and during the last three years Modi Government has increased the expenditure to the tune of Rs. 2800 crore for this. He said we have created infrastructure in many universities, colleges and model colleges. We have also provided Rs. 1300 crore in this year’s budget. Since this is happening for the first time, we are very hopeful and excited and I am sure this scheme will be a great success towards enhancement of higher education’ he added.

The Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is going to launch its own portal and mobile app tomorrow (the April 17, 2017) by Union HRD Minister Shri. Prakash Javadekar here in New Delhi. 

The portal is a one-stop for States’ Higher Education Plans, decision of the States’ Higher Education Councils and details of the resources under this scheme. Also, the gallery is a rich repository of the projects initiated under RUSA. 

Present on the occasion will be 12 State Education Ministers, Secretaries, RUSA Nodal officers, apart from those who will be present for the launch here; others will witness the launch through digital telecast. 

Seventeen RUSA projects will also be launched tomorrow digitally. They include a cluster university in Jammu and Kashmir, micro ATM facility at the RUSA centre for intelligent systems in Pune University, solar power facility in Shree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, Kerala; language laboratories in Ghatsila College, Jharkhand, among others. 

Mr. Javadekar will also launch the Fund and Reform Tracker for this centrally sponsored scheme. The mobile application will ensure that all projects under RUSA are tracked 24x7. 

States and UTs have responded very well to this scheme; 29 States and 6 UTs are participating in RUSA. Over 2000 State Universities and Colleges have been supported so far. The National GER prior to the launch of RUSA was 20.8 (2012), with Male GER at 22.1 and Female GER at 19.4. RUSA assistance has been critical in witnessing a growth in the GER. A substantial increase in the National GER has been recorded at 24.5, with male GER at 25.4 and female GER at 23.5 in 2015-16 (Source: AISHE 2015-16). 

Inside thousands of classrooms across India, teaching-learning has once again been revived. Given the commitments made by the States under RUSA on removal of ban on recruitment and filling up of vacant positions, many States have started the process of filling faculty positions. 

States are also planning their education outlays in a better way. Prior to the formation of RUSA, 9 State Higher Education Councils were created by an Act of the legislature. The States joined RUSA with a commitment to create State Higher Education Councils within a stipulated time indicated by them. To date, 21 more States/UTs have already created State Higher Education Councils through an executive order and 5 more States have established State Higher Education Councils through an Act of the legislature. Till date, out of 36 States and UTs, 34 States and UTs except Delhi and Lakshadweep have submitted their Higher Education Plan. Each State has to prepare a State Higher Education Plan through a bottom-up approach in consultation with their key stakeholders.

                The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has created a website, namely, swayam (www.swayam.gov.in) and swayam mobile app for iPhone Operating System (iOS), Android and Windows Platform to make study material available online to students.  In addition, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has also launched a web portal and a mobile app, namely, e-Pathshala (http://epathshala.nic.in & http://epathshala.gov.in), which provides access to textbooks and other resources developed by the NCERT.  The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has started e-CBSE website and mobile apps to make the study material of CBSE available online to students.

 

With a vision of “Improving children’s education by enhancing interaction between schools as well as parents and providing data driven decision support system to assist them in taking best decisions for their children’s future”, the CBSE has developed an in-house decision support system called ‘SARANSH’.  The system provides the following facilities:

 

·         Data driven analysis empowering Schools and Parents to take best decisions for students.

·         All the performance metrics are presented through numbers as well as charts/ graphs for easy understanding.

·         Equip schools and parents to review student's performance in various subjects.

·         It helps school to look performance in scholastic areas at an aggregate level and at the level of each student.

 

The Saransh website, inter-alia, provides comparative information regarding the performance of students at State and National level.

 

Education, being a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of the State/Union Territory Governments, it is for the respective State/ Union Territory Governments to take appropriate measure for the use of technology to bring transparency in school education system and to reduce the burden of examinations. No time-limit can be set by the Central Government in this regard. 

 

Ministry of Human Resource Development has developed an online platform, namely, SHAGUN for monitoring Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the flagship programme of the Government of India supporting Universalization of Elementary Education. It, inter-alia, provides a Management Information System (MIS) to evaluate state level performance and progress against key performance indicators and enables the public, State Governments, Teachers and Learners to get a ‘hands-on’ experience of the achievements registered through use of SSA funds.  Further, the CBSE has also been using technology to instil transparency and convenience in the schools affiliated to it through various portals/websites, namely, परिणाममंजूषा,   ई-सी.बी.एस.ई, परीक्षा, पंजीयन,अध्यापक, पुनर्निवेशन,   छात्रवृत्ति,  पुनरावेक्षण,  e-Prac and e-Grades. As per the affiliation bye laws of the CBSE,  every CBSE affiliated school has to establish its website and important information about the school such as vision of the school and the list of the prescribed textbooks in various classes should be posted on its website.

                The recruitment and service conditions, including monitoring of teachers’ attendance are primarily in the domain of State Governments and UT Administrations.

The World Bank took up a research project in 2004 on teacher absenteeism in 6 countries, including India and conducted a survey in 3700 schools in 20 States.  The report, inter alia, concluded that twenty-five per cent of teachers in Government primary schools remained absent from work on any given day, and only 50% of teachers present in schools were actually engaged in teaching.  As per Annual Status of Education report  (ASER )2016,  the teachers’ attendance was 85.4% at primary level and 84.7% at upper primary level 

The Central Government has also conducted two studies of teachers’ attendance in 2006 and 2013. According to these two studies, the overall attendance of teachers improved from 81.7% to 84.3% at primary level and from 80.5% to 81.3% at upper primary level.  As per the study conducted in 2013, the main reasons for teacher absenteeism include: illness of a family member, health reason of teacher, residence far away from school, lack of transport suited to school timing, engaged in other economic activities (e.g. agriculture, business, tuitions, etc.), posting in a school not of the teacher’s liking, participation in political/social activities, etc. 

Section 24 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates that a teacher appointed under sub-section (1) of the Section 23 shall perform the following duties, namely (a) maintain regularity and punctuality in attending school and (b) complete entire curriculum within specified time.  The steps taken by the Central Government to improve teachers’ attendance include, inter alia, monitoring teachers’ attendance through School Management Committees/School Management Development Committees/Block Resource Centres/Clusters Resource Centres and encouraging States and UTs to use digital technology like installation of Bio-metric attendance system in schools.

The MHRD has advised all the HEIs which are funded by the Central /State Government and all institutions approved by the regulatory bodies, to adopt clusters of backward Gram Panchayats / villages in their vicinity and apply their knowledge and expertise to improve the infrastructure in the Gram Panchayats (GPs). HEIs in the districts are expected to carry out detailed field study, participate in conceptualising & preparation of community-level development plans along with the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj personnel by providing technical, managerial inputs and by suggesting innovative solutions to the issues faced in the day-to-day lives of the households therein, in the areas of livelihoods, energy security, environment and basic living amenities.  The institutions have been advised to continue their engagement with chosen Panchayats and offer assistance to the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj personnel.  The programme is to be implemented over the next two years, with additional clusters. No time frame can be assigned for coverage of all districts in the country, at present. Funds (Budget Estimate) allocated to the UBA during 2016-17 is 10 Crore.

The role of the three Ministries are as follows:

 Ministry of Human Resource Development to oversee that selected Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) adopt (5) panchayats each in consultation with the District Collectors and use their knowledge base to find solutions for the issues of basic amenities & livelihood opportunities faced by the rural communities and thereby help in bringing about a qualitative change in the economic change in the economic and living standards of the people. As per the Tripartite Agreement, the role of the Ministry of Rural Development is to facilitate effective participation of District Collectors, DRDAs and other authorities to assist the institutions in preparation of the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) and convergence of plan resources wherever possible.  The role of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is to issue instructions to all State Governments and local bodies regarding the involvement of knowledge institutions in the GPDP process to operationalise the tie up between the organizations in the interest of quality GPDP preparation in the selected clusters.

Few leading Private Educational Institutions and deemed Universities are involved in the programme.

                With a view to improve the standards of technical education and to provide competent technical manpower for the Make-In-India campaign, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has approved the following package of measures to be implemented by all the technical institutions: 

1.    Induction training: Every student, on admission, shall be put through a mandatory Induction training to reinforce the fundamental concepts and the required language skills required for the technical education. 
 
2.    Revision of curriculum:  Every affiliating Technical University shall constitute subject-wise industry consultation committee (ICC) with the mandate of examining the existing curriculum and for making suitable changes in the curriculum every year. This process shall be completed in the month of December each year for the courses to be offered in the coming Academic year. Each institution, while applying for approval, shall certify completion of this process, which will be ma  ndatory.   

3.    Mandatory internships: Every student in technical institution shall do three internships each spanning 4 to 8 weeks before completion of the under-graduation. The responsibility will be on the institution for helping the students in finding suitable industry or organisation for the internship. 
4.    Industry readiness: All students passing out of the undergraduate courses shall be imparted technical and soft skills required for working in the industry encompassing – managerial skills, entrepreneurial skills, leadership skills, communication skills, team-working skills and technical skills.  

5.    Promoting innovation/start-ups: There shall be efforts at every level for promoting innovation and creativity in the students. The innovation drives like Hackathon shall be promoted, so that innovative ideas would emerge that can be incubated in the start-up centres. 

6.    Exam reforms: The final exams being conducted by the institutions shall test the understanding of the concepts and the skill – rather than the subject knowledge. A model exam format would be prepared and shared with the institutions and the technical universities for suitable adoption. This aspect would be reviewed at the time of approval.   

7.    Training of teachers: Every teacher in each of the technical education disciplines shall mandatorily undergo an annual refresher course delivered through SWAYAM portal, encapsulating all the major advances in the field of their study. Online courses would also be prepared and delivered through the SWAYAM platform for improving the pedagogical techniques of the teachers. The participation in the courses by atleast 50% of the faculty would be a mandatory condition for approval of the institution. Similarly, there should be leadership training to the heads of the institutions once in 2 years. These trainings would also be hosted through the SWAYAM platform. 

8.    Mandatory accreditation: At least half of all the programmes in the technical institutions shall be accredited through the NBA before 2022. Unless there is credible progress each year, the approval of the institutions can be refused. In order to assist the institutions in meeting the mandatory requirements for applying for accreditation, a separate mechanism will be put in place.

                The University Grants Commission (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil./ Ph.D Degrees), Regulation, 2016, mandates that after successful completion of the evaluation process and before the announcement of the award of the M.Phil./Ph.D. degree(s), the Institution concerned shall submit an electronic copy of the M.Phil. dissertation /Ph. D. thesis to the Information and library Network (INFLIBNET), for hosting the same so as to make it accessible to all Institutions/Colleges. To implement this provision of the UGC Regulations, 2016, Shodhganga repository was set up. The task of setting-up of this repository was assigned to INFLIBNET Centre, Gandhinagar – an Inter-University Centre of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

 

 The main objectives of Shodhganga are to:

(i)     develop a national repository of theses and dissertations with an intuitive interface which enables submission of electronic version of theses and dissertations by Universities in India and facilitates search, browse and downloading of theses available in the repository;

(ii)   avoid unnecessary duplication and repetition that, in effect, is wastage of huge resources, both human and financial;

(iii) providing access to Indian theses and dissertations in open access to world-wide academic community and making visibility of Indian research to other countries;

(iv) extend access to plagiarism detection software to eligible universities; and

(v)   fund eligible Universities (that are under purview of the UGC) for digitization of back lists of theses submitted to their universities.  

 

The salient features of Shodhganga are as follows:

 

·         Shodhganga facilitates Universities to deposit their theses in the respective Departments / Centres.

·         The system also permits online or offline submission of theses by students on voluntary basis.

·         Shodhganga interface supports basic search, advanced search and subject-wise browsing.

 

So far, 1,35,942 theses have been uploaded onto Shodhganga. 

 

INFLIBNET Centre, Gandhinagar has informed that no University has, so far, responded negatively or shown reluctance to join the scheme.

                Environment education is already an integral part of school curriculum. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 infuses the components of environmental education as part of different disciplines in the treatment of content in Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Political Science, Health and Physical Education, Art, Music, etc. As a follow-up of NCF-2005, syllabi and textbooks for all the stages of school education have been developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). For Classes I and II, Environmental Studies (EVS) components are integrated with language and mathematics. For classes III to V, the NCERT has developed EVS syllabus and the textbooks integrating Science and Social Science components. For classes VI onwards, essential EVS components are integrated across subject areas. Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has also issued directives to schools to impart environmental education to students.

                The University Grants Commission (UGC) has implemented the scheme of Autonomous Colleges with a view to bring in quality reforms in higher education. The Scheme of Autonomous Colleges offers academic and operative freedom to the Colleges. The autonomy so awarded under the scheme enables a College to determine and prescribe its own courses of study and syllabi and restructure and redesign the courses to suit local needs and to devise innovative methods of teaching, examination and evaluation.

The scheme of Autonomous Colleges is open for all Colleges. Any number of Colleges under a University can apply for award of autonomous status to UGC under this scheme. However, Colleges are granted autonomous status only when they fulfill conditions as prescribed in the guidelines of the scheme of Autonomous Colleges.

                The University Grants Commission (UGC) implements various fellowship schemes on behalf of Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, Ministry of Minority Affairs and Ministry of Tribal Affairs. UGC has intimated that it has brought all fellowship schemes under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode with a view to ensure effective administration and smooth disbursement of fellowships to the students. Under the DBT disbursement process, the fellowship awardees are required to upload continuation certificates, HRA certificates on quarterly basis in designated bank branches. Payments are made into the Student Beneficiary Accounts through Public Financial Management System (PFMS).

 

As informed by the UGC, it has taken following initiatives to address grievances, if any, of fellowship holders regarding delay in administration and disbursement of fellowships:

 

1.      a dedicated web portal (https://scholarship.canarabank.in/AdminLogin.aspx) has been created for migration of legacy cases on DBT platform.

2.      a fellowship tracking portal has been developed https://scholarship.canarabank.in/scholar/Login.aspxwhere the students can check the status of payment, date of upload of documents etc.

3.      a dedicated email-id ugcfellowships.ugc[at]gmail[dot]com is created to facilitate the redressal of student grievances especially relating to disbursal of fellowship/ scholarships.

4.      a dedicated telephone number has been provided to attend to calls from students relating to grievances/complaints/ problems on disbursal of grants under various fellowship/ scholarship schemes.

                The Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar , released the India Rankings 2017 for the Educational Institutions and dedicated it  to the nation in New Delhi today. Speaking on the  occasion  he said that this step is a sequel of our  Government’s commitment towards bringing landmark changes in the quality of education provided to students across the country for which we are working relentlessly. Shri Javadekar said this ranking is meant to have beginning of a fair competition among the institutions for achieving excellence in their efforts. This has recorded success beyond any doubt and is bound to march ahead. 

 

The Minister said so far no one has raised fingers on the ranking charted out by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), working under his Ministry. And  this has proved  its worth on the stipulated Parameters. He said until now NAAC and NBA used to assess Educational Institutions but now in our government this is the unique modification for bringing transparency and credibility. He said besides institutions now parents and students will also have worth information’s about the ranking and quality of a particular university, college or  vocational institution. This has led to the global scaling up of our credentials. 

 

The Minister on this occasion also announced that government will extend more help to quality education institutions. It’s a vital change of policy and will motivate all the institutions to perform and excel. Factors regarding number of research papers submitted, patents obtained and campus placement figures will also count for seeking government support. He said importance to public perception, employer perception and academic perception will also be accorded. 

 

Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey Minister of State (HRD)  in his address said this exercise has evoked a sense of transparency and accountability and the sole purpose is to march ahead for quality education.  

 

Secretary Higher,  Education Shri K.K.  Sharma elaborating  ‘INDIA RANKINGS 2017’ said that  in this second edition of India Rankings, a total of 2995 institutions have participated this time. This includes 232 Universities, 1024 Engineering Institutions, 546 Management Institutions, 318 Pharmacy Institutions and 637 General Degree Colleges, and others. Many of these have participated in multiple disciplines, adding to a total of 3319 participants across disciplines.

“India Rankings 2017” have ranked institutions in the disciplines/categories mentioned above, and have also provided a common overall rank across all disciplines for those institutes which either have more than 1000 enrolled students, or which are centrally funded. 

The parameters used for India Rankings 2017 are broadly similar to those used last year. However, at the level of detail, some of the sub-parameters have been tweaked for a more robust system of rankings. In particular for evaluating Research Impact, parameters for quality of publications have been enhanced to include the number of highly cited papers, in addition to the usual parameters of publications per faculty and citations per paper. Innovations have also been made in improving the scoring metrics, where the “percentile” metric has been replaced by a more discriminating metric. All research related information, including publications, citations, highly cited papers and even patent information about institutes was collected from third party databases (from our industry partners) to obtain an objective and unbiased picture. For this year’s Perception inputs, a large data base of academic and industry peers and employers was deployed, in addition to getting inputs from members of general public. Finally, some provision has also been made for the scale of operations of an institute in terms of the size of its student population and graduated doctoral students, he added.  

Shri Sharma said that the data received from both institutional and third party sources were subject to extensive scrutiny for consistency and correctness by a team of experts. As per the declared time-schedule, the rankings are being announced on the first Monday of April. The Rankings List includes 100 institutions each in the Overall, University, Engineering and General College Categories, and 50 each in Management and Pharmacy Disciplines. Additional rankings in suitably bunched forms are also being provided.

Although the Central Government funded institutions, in general continue to do well, some of the state-funded universities also are prominent. Some private institutions and universities have also been quietly climbing up to take high positions, thus offering value for money to their students, going by their ranks. Some of these institutions have consistently maintained or improved their positions of last year, clearly indicating that it was not a one-time fluke event. This is clearly a satisfying development in Higher Education.

Finally, a very exciting feature of this year’s Rankings is the ranking of General Degree Colleges in Arts and Sciences from across the country. While many of the names appearing in the top-100 list are well known and famous, there are many others who may not be so well known but have fared well. Clearly these need to be watched out for in future. There are also a few notable absentees here as also in other categories, due to their non-participation. We hope that there will be more enthusiastic participation in the years to come, he added.

                The first stage forecast  of Southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall was issued by Indian Meteorological Department(IMD) in New Delhi today.  IMD has forecast that quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with an error of ± 5%. Forecast assessment suggests 38% of probability for near normal monsoon rainfall.

 

 IMD issues various monthly and seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the southwest monsoon season (June to September). Operational forecasts for the southwest monsoon season rainfall are issued in two stages. The first stage forecast has been issued today and the second stage forecast will be issued in June. These forecasts are prepared using state-of-the-art Statistical Ensemble Forecasting system (SEFS) that is critically reviewed and improved regularly through in-house research activities. Since 2012, IMD has been using the dynamical global climate forecasting system (CFS) model, which was developed under the Monsoon Mission. The original coupled ocean-atmospheric model framework of CFS was adopted from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), USA. The CFS model was further modified to provide improved rainfall forecasts over the Indian monsoon region through research efforts taken up under the Monsoon Mission.

 

The forecast for 2017 southwest monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole based on both the SEFS and the Monsoon Mission Climate Forecasting System (MMCFS) are as follows. IMD’s SEFS model for the April forecast uses the following 5 predictors that require data monitored up to March.

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Conditions in the equatorial Pacific & Indian Ocean

 

The weak La Nina conditions developed in the later part of the last monsoon season peaked in December 2016 and started weakening thereafter. Currently, neutral conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific. The atmospheric conditions over the Pacific also reflect neutral El Nino conditions. The latest forecast from MMCFS indicates weak El Nino conditions to develop during the latter part of the monsoon season. However, there is no one to one relationship between El Nino and Indian Monsoon. For example, during 34% of El Nino years, monsoon season rainfall was normal or above normal.

 

At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The latest forecast from the MMCFS indicates weak positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the middle of the monsoon season and to persist for some more months subsequently. Positive IOD conditions are likely to be favourable for a normal/above normal monsoon.

 

As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over the Pacific particularly El Nino conditions over the Pacific (El Nino or La Nina) and positive IOD development over the equatorial Indian Ocean are known to have strong influence on the Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over the Pacific and Indian oceans.

 

Forecast For the 2017 Southwest monsoon Season (June – Season) rainfall over the Country as a whole  

 

·                     Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) based Assessment

 

For generating the forecast for the 2017 southwest Monsoon season rainfall, atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions during March 2017 were used. The forecast was computed as the average of the 44 ensemble members. The forecast based on the MMCFS suggests that the monsoon rainfall during the 2017 monsoon season (June to September) averaged over the country as a whole is likely to be 96% ± 5%of the Long Period Average (LPA).

 

·                     Forecast Based on the Operational Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS)

 

Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%. Further, forecasts for the seasonal rainfall for the country suggest 38% probability for near normal rainfall scenario.

 

Summary of the Forecast for the 2017 southwest monsoon Rainfall

 

1.                  Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with an error of ± 5%.

 

2.                  Forecast assessment suggests 38% of probability for near normal monsoon rainfall

 

IMD will issue the update forecasts in early June, 2017as a part of the second stage long range forecast of monsoon rainfall. Along with the update forecast, separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) rainfall over the country as a whole and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over various geographical regions of India will also be issued. By that time, more information on the evolution of El Nino and IOD will be available.

                At present National Centre of Seismology (NCS) , Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), maintains a National Seismological Network (NSN) comprising of 84 (eighty four) digital (Electronic) permanent seismological field stations. 

NCS is in process of installation of 31 more new seismological observatories. The new seismological observatories state-wise are Haryana (4), Uttarakhand (1), Delhi (3), Jammu & Kashmir (2), Himachal Pradesh (3), Uttar Pradesh (5), Jharkhand (1), Bihar (4), West Bengal (1), Punjab (1) Rajasthan (2), Madhya Pradesh (2), Chhattisgarh (1) and Lakshdweep (1). These observatories will have digital broadband seismograph system with VSAT communication. However, there is no proven scientific technique available anywhere in the world till date, to forecast the occurrence of earthquake with reasonable degree of accuracy with regard to space, time and magnitude. The Ground motion data recorded by the digital seismograph are used for estimation of magnitude and other earthquake parameters. It may be reiterated that the present set up is not used for forecasting earthquakes. New (31) seismological observatories will be installed by March 2018. 

Guidelines have been published by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) and Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) etc for design and construction of earthquake resistant structures to minimize loss of life and damage to property caused by earthquakes. These guidelines are in wide circulation amongst the public and administrative authorities responsible for design and construction of earthquake resistant houses / structures in earthquake prone areas. 

National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) under Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), other state Disaster Management Authorities, have also taken up various initiatives to educate and bring awareness amongst general public and school children on the general aspects of earthquakes, their impacts and measures to mitigate losses caused by them.

GKMS of IMD is rendered twice a week to farmers in collaboration with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Institutions of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), IITs etc. District level weather forecast for next 5-days in respect of Rainfall,    maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and clouds,  weekly cumulative rainfall forecast and Crop specific advisories are provided to farmers. GKMS of IMD has been successful in providing crop specific advisories to farmers through different print/visual/Radio/ IT based media including short message service (SMS) and Interactive Voice Response Service (IVRS) facilitating for appropriate field level actions. Weather forecast based agrometeorological advisories are disseminated through Kisan portal launched by Ministry of Agriculture and also under public private partner.

 

All the districts of Kerala have been covered under the scheme. Details of the districts in Kerala covered under the scheme are given below:

Presently IMD is providing Agromet services to farming community at District level. Research efforts are initiated by IMD to explore possibility of generating sub district scale Agrometeorological forecast with acceptable level of verification skill in a pilot mode.

 

There is mechanism for dissemination of Agromet Advisories through multi-mode communication channels including mass and electronic media and also through SMS and IVR (Interactive Voice Response Technology) through Kisan Portal launched by Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India as well as private companies under PPP mode. At present 21.16 million farmers are receiving the information through SMS on regular basis.

 

Under modernization plan, IMD has installed 550 AWS and 127 Agro-AWS throughout the country, so that the observational network would be strengthened. These AWS data would be useful in generating high resolution weather forecast. At present the scheme is implemented at district level covering 636 districts in the country.

                India supports better international cooperation in cyber security to fight against growing cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Union Minister for Electronics & IT and Law and Justice expressed these views at the bilateral meeting held in Germany during G20 Digital Ministers meeting on Digital Economy.  He also offered to share India’s experience in carrying out digital India initiatives with other digital economies. He said that India is also of the view that multi stakeholders model is the best option for the spread of digitalization and added that border should not be an impediment in the way of mobility of professionals and information. Bilateral engagements were held with representatives of Russian federation, Indonesia, Germany, United Kingdom, Argentina, Singapore, China, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and International Telecommunication Union ITU)

 

The G20 Digital Ministerial Meeting was held in Dusseldorf, Germany. G20 cooperation on the Digital Economy has become a special priority, subsequent to the adoption of Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative in the 2016 Hangzhou Summit, under the Chinese Presidency. The German Presidency has carried this forward, and, realizing the potential of digital technologies and its wide impact on the overall economy, has elevated the Digital Economy Task Force to the Ministerial level.

 

The G20 Ministers expressed their warm appreciation for the accomplishments of the Digital India programme. They noted how Digital India is provisioning a unique digital identity – cheaply, securely, and with privacy – to 1.1 billion citizens via Aadhaar. They appreciated India’s historic digital payment push through innovative and indigenous solutions like UPI, DBT, BHIM and AADHAR enabled payment systems, based on easily accessible mobile platforms. They observed how India has leveraged 250,000 Common Service Centres to drive digital inclusion, entrepreneurship, digital services, and productivity across rural India’s grassroots, empowering India’s less privileged citizens. The G20 Ministers particularly noted how Digital India’s digital literacy mission is transforming digital accessibility for 60 million households.  OECD, as an invitee, made a special mention of how India has emerged as one of the world’s most vibrant e-commerce environments and startup nations.


The Hon’ble Minister, in his interventions, highlighted how India – as the world’s fastest growing major economy – was harnessing digital technology as a major inclusion and growth mechanism. He emphasized how Digital India is bringing a transformative change through various schemes, harnessing the potential of a young Indian demography, and so driving a successful Digital Economy. He explained the Government’s driving motivation in advancing the Digital India programme, “Digital technologies and the internet, which represents some of the finest creations of the human mind are today a ‘global common good’; which we can harness for bridging the digital divide, empowering and improving the quality of life for our citizens.”

 

The Hon’ble Minister also highlighted Digital India’s unprecedented effort to drive affordability in digital technologies, including creation of low cost digital identity infrastructure called AADHAR, laying down an optical fibre infrastructure to reach all Gram Panchayats under BharatNet, developing Apps and solutions for digital payments, ensuring participative Governance through MyGov and using these digital technologies while ensuring privacy and security through a robust cyber infrastructure.

 

The Hon’ble Minister emphasized how India is advancing in the knowledge economy by catalyzing innovation. He said: “We believe that innovation is key to our success as a digital economy.  India today has one of the most vibrant startup ecosystems with over 4000 startups every year working in emerging technology areas including IoT, data analytics, Block Chains and machine learning. Many of these startups are also in the forefront of developing solutions to many of our grand challenges in areas such as health and education.”

 

The Hon’ble Minister particularly emphasised that India, as a leading supplier of IT/ITeS services and skilled technology manpower to the world, would be happy to share its experience and knowledge with its partners across the developing world. He noted that the Digital India model – engaging, as it does, issues of digital inclusion and divide that are experienced across the developing world – may offer insight and input to emerging nations’ digital programmes.

 

Noting the Hon'ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's description “that cyber attacks are akin to a bloodless war”, Hon’ble Minister called for G20 countries to actively cooperate in combating cyber crimes and cyber terrorism.  

 

India’s interests have been effectively conveyed to the G20 forum, and suitably reflected in the Ministerial Declaration and Roadmap.  This includes unleashing the potential of Digital Economy to drive digital inclusion and reducing digital divide, improved connectivity, digital literacy and skills. India’s essential interests in a strong digital economy, open and secure internet with localized content, free flow of information and mobility of professionals across borders have also been highlighted.

                An inter-ministerial Indian delegation headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha, will participate in the 2017 Conference of Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm (BRS) Conventions. The delegation will include representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)/Permanent Mission of India (PMI) to UN in Geneva, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers (MoC&F), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW) and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW).  

The three COPs to BRS Conventions will be held jointly and back-to-back from April 24-May 5, 2017 in Geneva, Switzerland. This year the meetings will also feature a high-level segment to be attended by Ministers of the Parties. The high-level segment is scheduled for the afternoon of May 4 and the morning of May 5, 2017. The theme of the meetings and the high-level segment will be - ""A future detoxified: sound management of chemicals and waste"".

India is committed towards its obligations of BRS Conventions.  It is also important, at the same time, to safeguard the country’s interest. In this context, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is playing an instrumental role in environmentally sound management of hazardous chemicals and waste, keeping in view the overall objectives of sustainable development and growth.

Conference of Parties (COPs) to the BRS Convention include - the 13th meeting of the Conference of Parties to “Basel Convention (BC COP 13); the 8th meeting of the Conference of Parties to “Rotterdam Convention (RC COP 8) and 8th meeting of the Conference of Parties to “Stockholm Convention (SC COP 8).  While the Basel Convention will discuss the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the Rotterdam Convention will deliberate on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade” and the Stockholm Convention is on persistent organic pollutants (POPs)”.  

 

The meetings of COPs 2017 to BRS conventions will feature separate sessions on issues pertaining to the three Conventions, as well as joint sessions on common issues of the three Conventions. The agenda of the 2017 BRS COPs meetings cover a wide gamut of issues including - technical guidelines on transboundary movements of electrical and electronic waste and used electrical and electronic equipment; technical guidelines for environmentally sound management of wastes, consisting of, containing or contaminated with low persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Basel Convention, national reporting, capacity building and technical assistance; listing of chemicals viz chrysotile asbestos,  paraquat dichloride, fenthion, trichlorfon, short chain chlorinated paraffins, tributyltin compounds, carbofuran and carbosulfan under Annex III to the Rotterdam Convention and listing of chemicals viz short chain chlorinated paraffins, decabromodiphenyl ether and Hexachlorobutadiene under Annex A, B, and C to the Stockholm Convention. The meetings are highly technical and scientific in nature.  The subject matter during negotiations and deliberations in the COPs are of vital importance, which can have far-reaching ramifications on trade and industry in the country in particular, industrial chemicals and electronic and electrical industry.

The most important matters to be deliberated during COPs include - listing of chemicals under Rotterdam and Stockholm Convention may have an impact on industrial growth.  The inclusion of chemicals under Rotterdam Convention does not ban the chemical.  However, importing countries need to follow the PIC procedure. Listing of hazardous chemicals may lead to an increase in the trade cost, as well as delay the import/export process. Listing of chemicals under Stockholm convention bans/restrict the chemicals for trade, import, export and use along with minimizes unintentional release of POPs.

 

BRS Conventions – Brief Background

The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions are multilateral environmental agreements, which share the common objective of protecting human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals and wastes. To enhance cooperation and coordination among the BRS Conventions, their respective conferences of the Parties have taken a series of decisions. This ""synergies process"" aims to strengthen the implementation of the three conventions at the national, regional and global levels by providing coherent policy guidance, enhancing efficiency in the provision of support to Parties to the Conventions, reducing their administrative burden and maximising the effective and efficient use of resources at all levels, while maintaining the legal autonomy of these three multilateral environmental agreements. In addition to initiating reforms to the secretariats of the three Conventions on an administrative as well as operational level, this process is changing the way in which the implementation of the Conventions are undertaken at the national and regional levels. Parties to the Conventions and entities supporting countries in the implementation of the Conventions, such as regional centres, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, also undertake efforts to increase coherence in the implementation of the Conventions.

 

Basel Convention

The Basel Convention was adopted on March 22, 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry, following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad. Environmental awareness and tightening of environmental regulations in the industrialised world during 1970s and 1980s had led to  an increasing public resistance to the disposal of hazardous wastes – in accordance with what became known as the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome – and to an escalation of disposal costs. This in turn led some operators to seek cheap disposal options for hazardous wastes in the developing world, which was lagging in environmental awareness regulations and enforcement mechanisms.

Against this background, the Basel Convention was negotiated in the late 1980s, and at the time of its adoption its thrust to combat the “toxic trade”. The overarching objective of the Basel Convention is to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, including “other wastes” - the household waste and incinerator ash.  The Convention also covers hazardous wastes that are explosive, flammable, poisonous, infectious, corrosive, toxic, or eco-toxic. The Convention aims towards restricting transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and its disposal with environmentally sound management (ESM). The Basel Convention was adopted in 1989 and entered into force on May 5, 1992. India ratified the Convention in June 24, 1992.

 

Rotterdam Convention

 

The Rotterdam Convention is a multilateral environmental agreement which prescribes obligations on the importers and exporters of certain hazardous chemicals. Parties are empowered to make informed decisions about the chemicals they wish to import. The Convention's objective is to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among parties in the international trade of listed chemicals in the Rotterdam Convention, to protect human health and the environment, and to contribute to the environmentally sound use of chemicals. The Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure is the mechanism for formally obtaining and disseminating the decisions of importing Parties, as to whether they wish to receive future shipments of those chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and for ensuring compliance with these decisions by exporting Parties. As of now, a total of 47 chemicals are listed in Annex III of the Convention.  Out of these, 33 are pesticides and 14 industrial chemicals, which are subject to PIC procedures. The Convention was adopted on September 10, 1998 and entered into force on February 24, 2004. India ratified the Convention on May 24, 2005.

Stockholm Convention

The Stockholm Convention is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from a class of chemicals known as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). These remain intact in the environment for long periods (persistent), become widely distributed geographically (long range transport), accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife (bioaccumulation), and have a harmful impact on human health, or on environment (toxic). Under the Convention, the chemicals can be listed for complete elimination from production, use, export and import (Annex-A), Restriction in use and production for specific purpose only (Annex-B) or Unintentional production (Annex-C). The implementation of the Convention requires the parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of these POPs into the environment. Till date, 26 chemicals are listed as POPs under the Stockholm Convention. As of now, India has ratified only the 12 initially listed POPs. The Convention was adopted on May 22, 2001 and entered into force on May 17, 2004. India ratified the Convention on   January 13, 2006.

Meetings of the COPs of BRS Conventions are generally held every alternate year. India has participated in the earlier meetings of the COPs of the BRS Conventions. Previously, COP 12 of Basel Convention and COP 7 meetings of Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions were held in Geneva, Switzerland from May 4-15, 2015.

Earlier, in a meeting with the Secretary, Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha, Ms. Espinosa acknowledged India as an important partner in pursuing the agenda of climate change and expressed interest in engaging with Indian institutions playing a major role in climate action in India.  She dwelt upon the synergy between the Sustainable Development Goals and climate actions.  Shri Jha highlighted India’s actions to address climate change, including the goals to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030, increasing the share of non-fossil fuel sources in the electricity mix, afforestation efforts and world’s largest renewable energy programme being pursued in India. He also underlined the climate change governance structure to monitor climate change actions in India, which includes PM's Council on Climate Change chaired by the Prime Minister and Executive Committee on Climate Change, chaired by Principal Secretary to Prime Minister.

The issues of adequate means of implementation including climate finance, capacity building and technological support to developing countries were also flagged during the meeting. It was also highlighted that the core principles of equity and CBDR-RC need to be operationalized in the Paris Rule Book.

Ms. Espinosa is on a two-day visit on April 18-19, 2017. This is the first visit of UNFCCC Executive Secretary to India.

“Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) / Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitors air quality across the country under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). The NAMP network comprises of 680 monitoring stations located in 300 cities/towns covering 29 states and 6 union territories. State-wise details of funds released to various monitoring agencies during the years 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 for ambient air quality monitoring as operational and maintenance cost under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) (See Annexure).

United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) proposal regarding monitoring of air quality in the country largely entails exchange of technical expertise. Technical discussion with USEPA in this regard is an ongoing process and two meetings with USEPA in regard have already been held.

The Government has formulated the environmental regulations and statutes for management and control of pollution.  The Government has also laid down National Ambient Air Quality standards and notified 115 emission/effluent standards for 104 different sectors of industries, besides 32 general standards for ambient air.  The compliance and implementation of these provisions and standards by the polluting industries is mandatory and binding.  In so far as scheme for abatement of pollution is concerned, it allows for participation of Public as well as Private Sector.”

          This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                Following is the text of the External Affairs Minister's Statement in Rajya Sabha on case of Shri Kulbhushan Jadhav, Indian Citizen, awarded death sentence by a Pakistani military court (April 11, 2017)

Hon’ble Deputy Chairman Sir, 

1.                  I rise to share my concern with the House regarding the report that an Indian citizen, Shri Kulbhushan Jadhav, has been awarded a death sentence by a Pakistani military court martial on concocted charges, I repeat on concocted charges.

2.                  I would like to inform the House that Shri Jadhav was doing business in Iran and was kidnapped and taken to Pakistan. The exact circumstances are unclear and can only be ascertained if we have consular access to him. Accordingly, from the time his abduction was known, our High Commission in Islamabad has continuously pressed Pakistani authorities for such access. Although this is provided for by international law and is deemed a norm in international relations, the Government of Pakistan did not permit it. That itself should tell us much about the strength of the case against Shri Jadhav. Hon’ble Members would also recall that a senior Pakistani leader has himself expressed doubts about the adequacy of evidence in this case.

3.                  Deputy Chairman Sir, earlier this year, the Pakistan Government sought our assistance to obtain evidence and other materials for the investigation process. In doing so, they levelled ridiculous charges against senior Indian officials who had no connection to this issue. Thereafter, they linked providing consular access to our acceptance of their position. Nevertheless, in the hope that some forward movement could be made, our response was constructive. We pointed out that consular access to Shri Jadhav would be an essential pre-requisite in order to verify the facts and understand the circumstances of his presence in Pakistan.

4.                  Given this exchange, it is extraordinary that yesterday, a decision is suddenly announced awarding a death sentence in this case when previous exchanges with India itself underlines the insufficiency of evidence. To make matters even more absurd, three hours after the death sentence was announced, the Indian High Commission received an official communication from the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan reiterating the Pakistani proposal for conditional consular access. That tells us a lot about the farcical nature of the alleged proceedings which have led to an indefensible verdict against an innocent kidnapped Indian.

5.                  Our position on this matter is clear. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Shri Jadhav. If anything, he is the victim of a plan that seeks to cast aspersions on India to deflect international attention from Pakistan’s well-known record of sponsoring and supporting terrorism. Under these circumstances, we have no choice but to regard the sentence, if carried out, as an act of pre-meditated murder.

6.                  Deputy Chairman Sir, yesterday, Foreign Secretary conveyed our position to the High Commissioner of Pakistan. Let me state clearly that the Government and people of India would view very seriously the possibility that an innocent Indian citizen is facing death sentence in Pakistan without due process and in violation of basic norms of law, justice and international relations. I would caution the Pakistan Government to consider the consequences for our bilateral relationship if they proceed on this matter.

7.                  Deputy Chairman Sir, I would also like to tell the House that I have been in touch with the parents of Shri Jadhav and we are extending our fullest support to them in this difficult situation. A strong sense of solidarity expressed by the House will give them more courage at this time.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into two Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) with Indian taxpayers, strengthening the Government’s commitment to foster a non-adversarial tax regime. Both the agreements also have a “Rollback” provision in them.

The 2 APAs signed yesterday pertain to Information Technology and Banking & Finance sectors of the economy. The international transactions covered in these agreements include Software Development services, IT enabled services and KPO services.

With these, the total number of APAs entered into by the CBDT has reached 154, which includes 11 bilateral APAs and 143 unilateral APAs. The CBDT expects more APAs to be concluded and signed in the near future. The approach and functioning of the officers in the APA teams have been appreciated and acknowledged by the industry in India and abroad.

The APA Scheme was introduced in the Income-tax Act in 2012 and the Rollback provisions were introduced in 2014. The scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and determining the arm’s length price of international transactions in advance for the maximum of five future years. Further, the taxpayer has the option to rollback the APA for four preceding years. Since its inception, the APA scheme has attracted tremendous interest among Multi National Enterprises (MNEs) and that has resulted in more than 800 applications (both unilateral and bilateral) having been filed in just five years.

                The Committee on Allowances, constituted by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India to examine the 7th CPC recommendations on Allowances, submitted its Report to the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley yesterday. The Committee was headed by Shri Ashok Lavasa, Finance Secretary and Secretary (Expenditure),M/o Finance, Government of India and had Secretaries of Home Affairs, Defence, Health & Family Welfare, Personnel & Training, Post and Chairman, Railway Board as its Members and Joint Secretary (Implementation Cell) as its Member Secretary.


The Committee was set-up in pursuance of the Union Cabinet decision on 29.06.2016 when approving the 7th CPC recommendations on pay, pensions and related issues were approved. The decision to set-up the Committee was taken in view of significant changes recommended by the 7th CPC in the allowances structure and a large number of representations received in this regard from various Staff Associations as well as the apprehensions conveyed by various Ministries / Departments. The 7th CPC had recommended that of a total of 196 Allowances, 52 be abolished altogether and 36 be abolished as separate identities by subsuming them in another allowance.


The Committee took note of all the representations received from various stakeholders on the 7th CPC recommendations on Allowances. Representations and demands for modifications were received in respect of 79 allowances which have been examined in detail by the Committee. In doing so, the Committee interacted with all the members of the Standing Committee of National Council (Staff Side), Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM) as well the representatives of various Staff Associations of Railways, Postal employees, Doctors, Nurses, and Department of Atomic Energy. It also interacted with the representatives of the Defence Forces, DGs of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) namely CRPF, CISF, BSF, ITBP, SSB, and Assam Rifles as also senior officers from IB and SPG to understand the viewpoint of their personnel.  As mentioned in the Report, the Committee held a total of 15 meetings and was assisted by a Group of Officers headed by Additional Secretary (D/o Expenditure) in examining the representations. 


Based on such extensive stakeholder consultations and detailed examination, the Committee has suggested certain modifications in the 7th CPC recommendations so as to address the concerns of the stakeholders in the context of the rationale behind the recommendations of the 7th CPC as well as other administrative exigencies. Modifications have been suggested in some allowances which are applicable universally to all employees as well as certain other allowances which apply to specific employee categories such as Railway men, Postal employees, Scientists, Defence Forces personnel, Doctors and Nurses etc.


The Report, now being examined in the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, will be placed before the Empowered Committee of Secretaries (E-CoS) set-up to screen the 7th CPC recommendations and to firm-up the proposal for approval of the Cabinet. It may be recalled that while recommendations of the 7th CPC on pay and pension were implemented with the approval of Cabinet, allowances continue to be paid at old rates. After consideration by the E-CoS, the proposal for implementation of 7th CPC recommendations on Allowances after incorporating the modifications suggested by the Committee on Allowances in its Report shall be placed before the Cabinet for approval.

                            The Minister of State (MoS) for Finance Shri Santosh Gangwar said that there is a need for creating awareness on pension at the grassroots level and expressed satisfaction that the National Pension System (NPS) is now gaining recognition. He was speaking on the occasion of the “Third Pension Conference on Implementation of National Pension System (NPS)” of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) in New Delhi today. The conference was organised with the theme of ‘Towards a Pensioned Society: The Road Ahead’.

 

After inaugurating the event, the MoS for Finance released a report titled “Financial Security for India’s Elderly” prepared by PFRDA in association with CRISIL. The report brings to the fore the concerns of demographic transition, existing pension provisions, need to expand the voluntary pension coverage through awareness and developing annuity market and alternatives.

 

During the function, the top three performing Points of Presence (POPs) under NPS and Atal Pension Yojana - Service Providers (APY- SPs) were awarded for their contribution in bringing subscribers under the social security net of NPS and APY.

 

Shri Hemant Contractor, Chairman, PFRDA, in his key note address stressed on the need to provide old age income security through mass awareness and training programmes and increase financial literacy among the population of India, especially among the informal sector, which is largely out of the social security net.

 

NPS has been uniquely designed in a manner to cater to both the organised and heterogenous unorganised sector characterised with seasonal /sporadic employment with migration, uncertain level of income and limited capacity to save. During his address, Shri Hemant Contractor informed that PFRDA is also considering an auto enrolment programme/system under National Pension System. He further assured that PFRDA will ensure to take all steps to increase the outreach of NPS and APY to meet the mandate under PFRDA Act.

 

Dr. B. S. Bhandari, Whole Time Member (Economics), PFRDA, in his address, highlighted the need to expand the coverage of NPS in an efficient and sustainable way and also informed the participants about the new initiatives undertaken during last financial year including the launch of two new life cycle funds and eNPS - an online platform for registration. He also informed about the growth of 47% in Asset under Management (AUM) and 25% in number of subscribers in the last financial year. He also threw light on the investment pattern and NPS architecture.

 

During the course of the event, Shri Suchindra Misra, Joint Secretary, Department of Financial Services, stressed that pension was not just about old age security but also about old age dignity.

 

The conference was followed by discussion on topics related to pension annuities financial literacy, financial behaviour studies, researches, market performance & challenges, risk mitigation strategies to safeguard market anomalies and old age income security through technical sessions.

 

The technical sessions were graced by panellists including Mr. Leo Puri (MD, UTI AMC), Mr. C Parthasarthy (Group Chairman, Karvy), Mr. Ashwin Parekh (Trustee, NPS Trust) Mr. Sandeep Ghosh (Director, NISM), Prathit Bhobe (Sr. GM, ICICI Bank), Mr. Mukul Asher (Professor) and Mr. Sandeep Bakshi (MD, CEO ICICI Prudential life insurance). Senior representatives and dignitaries from various financial institutions, Banks and NBFCs also graced the conference.

 

Currently, the National Pension System (NPS) has more than 1.57 crore subscribers with total Asset under Management (AUM) of more than Rs.1.72 lakh crores.

In order to smoothen the process of registration of Retirement Advisers, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has transformed the process of submitting application from physical mode to online mode. 

The applicants can now submit their application online and upload scanned images of all the required documents. This will reduce the application processing time. PFRDA is registering Retirement Advisers for widening the coverage of NPS by facilitating on boarding of the subscribers and also providing advisory services to them for allocating assets under NPS and choosing Pension Fund Managers. 

“Retirement Adviser” can be any individual, registered partnership firm, body corporate, or any registered trust or society, which desires to engage in the activity of providing advice on National Pension System or other pension schemes regulated by PFRDA to prospects / existing subscribers or other persons or group of persons and is registered as such under the PFRDA (Retirement Advisers) Regulations. 

NISM and FPSB India are providing necessary certification in order to become eligible for registration as Retirement Adviser. However, Investment Advisers registered with SEBI are exempted from the requirement of such certifications and they can directly submit their application to PFRDA for registration.

With a view to digitally empower the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) subscribers and improve the quality of service, the facility of online viewing of the statement of transaction(e-SOT) and also the e-PRAN card have been launched. More than 45 lacs APY subscribers are likely to be benefitted. The APY subscribers can visit the website: www.npscra.nsdl.co.in or www.npstrust.org.in under the Atal Pension Yojana Section to avail these value added facilities.

 By providing the APY/PRAN Acct details and Savings Bank Account number details, the APY subscriber can view one's APY Account Statement. Even for the APY subscriber who does not have his APY PRAN number readily available can also avail these facilities by providing one's Date of Birth and Savings Bank Account number details. This online tool enables the Subscribers to view his complete details of APY account like transaction details, pension amount, pension commencement date, nominee name, associated bank name etc. Even though the feature is a self-servicing tool but the service providers can also access the feature on behalf of their customer to improve the quality of customer service. APY Subscribers can print their e PRAN card and get it laminated for their future reference if needed. In case of any changes in the demographic details in the APY account, the subscribers can re-print their e-PRAN which shows the updated subscriber records.

 The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) Scheme is being implemented through 235 APY-Service Providers all over the country consisting of 27 Public Sector Banks (PSBs), 19 private banks, 1 foreign bank, 56 Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), 109 District Cooperative Banks (DCBs), 16 State Cooperative Banks(SCBs), 6 Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and the Department of Posts. All the APY-SPs are partners in achieving the APY outreach through-out the length and breadth of the country. Presently, there are more than 45 lacs subscribers registered in the Scheme. About 10000-15000 APY subscribers are getting enrolled into the Scheme every day.

 

 The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) was launched by the Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi on 09th May, 2015 and became operational from 1st June, 2015. APY is available for all citizens of India in the age group of 18-40 years. Under the APY, the subscribers would receive a minimum guaranteed pension of Rs. 1000 to Rs. 5000 per month from the age of 60 years, depending on their contributions, which depends on the age of the subscriber at the time of joining the APY. The Same amount of pension is paid to the spouse in case of subscriber’s demise. After the demise of both i.e. Subscriber & Spouse, the nominee would be paid with the pension corpus. There is option for Spouse to continue to contribute for balance period on premature death of subscriber before 60 years, so as to avail pension by Spouse. There are tax benefits at entry, accumulation and pension payment phases. If the actual returns on the pension contributions during the accumulation phase are higher than the assumed returns for the minimum guaranteed pension, such excess returns are passed on to the subscriber, resulting in enhanced scheme benefits.

GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST)


1.             Benefits:


	GST is a win-win situation for the entire country. It brings benefits to all the stakeholders of industry, government and the consumer.  It will lower the cost of goods and services, give a boost to the economy and make the products and services globally competitive. GST aims to make India a common market with common tax rates and procedures and remove the economic barriers thus paving the way for an integrated economy at the national level. By subsuming most of the Central and State taxes into a single tax and by allowing a set-off of prior-stage taxes for the transactions across the entire value chain, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading, improve competitiveness and improve liquidity of the businesses. GST is a destination based tax. It follows a multi-stage collection mechanism. In this, tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a set off at the next stage of transaction. This shifts the tax incidence near to the consumer and benefits the industry through better cash flows and better working capital management.
	GST is largely technology driven. It will reduce the human interface to a great extent and this would lead to speedy decisions.
	GST will give a major boost to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India by making goods and services produced in India competitive in the National as well as International market. Also all imported goods will be charged integrated tax (IGST) which is equivalent to Central GST + State GST. This will bring equality with taxation on local products.
	Under the GST regime, exports will be zero-rated in entirety unlike the present system where refund of some taxes may not take place due to fragmented nature of indirect taxes between the Centre and the States.  This will boost Indian exports in the international market thus improving the balance of payments position. Exporters with clean track record will be rewarded by getting immediate refund of 90% of their claims arising on account of exports, within seven days.
	GST is expected to bring buoyancy to the Government Revenue by widening the tax base and improving the taxpayer compliance. GST is likely improve India’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index and is estimated to increase the GDP growth by 1.5 to 2%.


 


	GST will bring more transparency to indirect tax laws.  Since the whole supply chain will be taxed at every stage with credit of taxes paid at the previous stage being available for set off at the next stage of supply, the economics and tax value of supplies will be easily distinguishable. This will help the industry to take credit and the government to verify the correctness of taxes paid and the consumer to know the exact amount of taxes paid.


 


	The taxpayers would not be required to maintain records and show compliance with a myriad of indirect tax laws of the Central Government and the State Governments like Central Excise, Service Tax, VAT, Central Sales Tax, Octroi, Entry Tax, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc. They would only need to maintain records and show compliance in respect of Central Goods and Services Tax Act and State (or Union Territory) Goods and Services Tax Act for all intra-State supplies (which are almost identical laws) and with Integrated Goods and Services Tax for all inter-State supplies (which also has most of its basic features derived from the CGST and the SGST Act). 


2.             Salient Features of GST

The salient features of GST are as under:      

(i)                 The GST would be applicable on the supply of goods or services as against the present concept of tax on the manufacture or sale of goods or provision of services. It would be a destination based consumption tax. This means that tax would accrue to the State or the Union Territory where the consumption takes place. It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying tax on a common tax base. The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods or services would be called the Central tax (CGST) and that to be levied by the States including Union territories with legislature/Union Territories without legislature would be called the State tax (SGST)/ Union territory tax (UTGST) respectively.

(ii)               The GST would apply to all goods other than alcoholic liquor for human consumption and five petroleum products, viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel. It would apply to all services barring a few to be specified. The GST would replace the following taxes currently levied  and collected by the Centre:

a.                   Central Excise Duty

b.                  Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations)

c.                   Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance)

d.                  Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products)

e.                   Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD)

f.                   Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD)

g.                  Service Tax

h.                  Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services

(iii)             State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST are:

a.                   State VAT

b.                  Central Sales Tax

c.                   Luxury Tax

d.                  Entry Tax (all forms)

e.                   Entertainment  and Amusement Tax (except when levied by the local bodies)

f.                   Taxes on advertisements

g.                  Purchase Tax

h.                  Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling

i.                    State Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services

(iv)             The list of exempted goods and services would be common for the Centre and the States.

(v)               Threshold Exemption: Taxpayers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year up to Rs.20 lakhs would be exempt from tax. Aggregate turnover shall be computed on all India basis. For eleven Special Category States, like those in the North-East and the hilly States, the exemption threshold shall be Rest. 10 lakhs. All taxpayers eligible for threshold exemption will have the option of paying tax with input tax credit (ITC) benefits. Taxpayers making inter-State supplies or paying tax on reverse charge basis shall not be eligible for threshold exemption.

(vi)             Composition levy: Small taxpayers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year up to Rest. 50 lakhs shall be eligible for composition levy. Under the scheme, a taxpayer shall pay tax as a percentage of his turnover during the year without the benefit of ITC. The rate of tax for CGST and SGST/UTGST each shall not exceed -

·         2.5% in case of restaurants etc

·         1% of the turnover in a state/ UT in case of a manufacturer

·         0.5% of the turnover in state/UT in case of other suppliers.

A taxpayer opting for composition levy shall not collect any tax from his customers nor shall he be entitled to claim any input tax credit.  The composition scheme is optional. Taxpayers making inter-State supplies shall not be eligible for composition scheme. The government, may, on the recommendation of GST Council, increase the threshold for the scheme to up to rupees one crore.

(vii)           An Integrated tax (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services. Accounts would be settled periodically between the Centre and the States to ensure that the SGST/UTGST portion of IGST is transferred to the destination State where the goods or services are eventually consumed.

(viii)         Use of Input Tax Credit: Taxpayers shall be allowed to take credit of taxes paid on inputs (input tax credit) and utilize the same for payment of output tax. However, no input tax credit on account of CGST shall be utilized towards payment of SGST/UTGST and vice versa. The credit of IGST would be permitted to be utilized for payment of IGST, CGST and SGST/UTGST in that order.

(ix)             HSN (Harmonised System of Nomenclature) code shall be used for classifying the goods under the GST regime. Taxpayers whose turnover is above Rs. 1.5 crore but below Rs. 5 crore shall use 2-digit code and the taxpayers whose turnover is Rs. 5 crore and above shall use 4-digit code. Taxpayers whose turnover is below Rs. 1.5 crore are not required to mention HSN Code in their invoices.

(x)               Exports and supplies to SEZ shall be treated as zero-rated supplies. The exporter shall have an option to either pay output tax and claim its refund or export under bond without tax and claim refund of Input Tax Credit.

(xi)             Import of goods and services would be treated as inter-State supplies and would be subject to IGST in addition to the applicable customs duties. The IGST paid shall be available as ITC for further transactions.

3.             GST Council

The mechanism of GST Council would ensure harmonization on different aspects of GST between the Centre and the States as well as among States. It has been specifically provided that the GST Council, in its discharge of various functions, shall be guided by the need for a harmonized structure of GST and for the development of a harmonized national market for goods and services. The GST Council shall establish a mechanism to adjudicate disputes arising out of its recommendation or implementation thereof.

4.             Minimal Interface

The physical interface between the taxpayer and the tax authorities would be minimal under GST. Certain important provisions in this regard are illustrated as under:

a)      There will be cross-empowerment of officers belonging to Central and State Governments.  Officer of CGST will be empowered to act as proper officer of SGST and vice versa.

b)      Registration will be granted on line and shall be deemed to have been granted if no deficiency is communicated to the applicant within 3 common working days by the tax administration which has been allotted the examination of the application. Such allotment is to be done one each alternately between the Central and the State Tax administration.

c)      Taxable person shall himself assess the taxes payable (self-assessment) and credit it to the account of the Government. The return filed by the tax payer would be treated as self-assessed.

d)     Payment of tax shall be made electronically through internet banking, or also through credit card and through the modes of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). Smaller taxpayers shall be allowed to pay tax over the bank counter. All challans for payment of tax shall be generated online on the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN).

e)      The taxpayer shall furnish the details of outward supplies electronically without any physical interface with the tax authorities. Inward supply details would be auto-drafted from the supply details filed by the corresponding suppliers.

f)       Taxpayers shall file, electronically, monthly returns of outward and inward supplies, ITC availed, tax payable, tax paid and other prescribed particulars. Composition taxpayers shall file, electronically, quarterly returns. Omission/incorrect particulars can be self-rectified before the last date of filing of return for the month of September of the following year or the actual date of filing of annual return, whichever is earlier.

g)      For mismatched invoices, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit shall be done electronically on the GSTN portal without any tax payer contact. This electronic system would also prevent, inter alia, input tax credit being taken on the basis of fake invoices or twice on the same invoice.

h)      Taxpayers shall be allowed to keep and maintain accounts and other records in electronic form.

5.             Input tax credit

Taxpayer is allowed to take credit of taxes paid on inputs (input tax credit), as self-assessed, in his return.  Taxpayer can take credit of taxes paid on all goods and services, other than a few items in the negative list, and utilize the same for payment of output tax. Credit of taxes paid on inputs can be taken where the inputs are used for business purposes or for making taxable supplies.  Full input tax credit shall be allowed on capital goods on its receipt as against the current Central Government and many State Government practice of staggering the credit in more than one installment. Unutilized input tax credit can be carried forward. The facility of distribution of input tax credit for services amongst group companies has been provided for through the mechanism of Input Service Distributor (ISD).

6.        Refund

Time limit for claiming online refund has been increased from one year to two years. Refund shall be granted within 60 days from the date of receipt of complete application. Interest is payable if refund is not sanctioned within the stipulated period of 60 days. If the refund claim is less than Rs. 2 lakhs, there is no need for the claimant to furnish any documentary evidence to prove that he has not passed on the incidence of tax to any other person. Only a self-certification to this effect would suffice. Refund of input tax credit shall be allowed in case of exports or where the credit accumulation is on account of inverted duty structure (i.e. where the tax rate on output is higher than that on inputs).

7.        Demands

A new concept of sunset clause for tax disputes has been introduced. It provides that Adjudication Order shall be issued within 3 years of filing of annual return in normal cases and the time limit is 5 years (from the date of filing of annual return) in fraud/suppression cases. SCN will have to be issued at least 3 months prior to the time limit prescribed for issue of adjudication order in normal cases and at least 6 months prior to the time limit prescribed for issue of adjudication order in cases involving fraud/suppression etc. Penalty is Nil or minimal if the tax short paid / non-paid is deposited along with interest at the stage of audit/investigation.

8.    Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism - Advance Rulings

Advance ruling mechanism has been continued under the GST law. The salient features are as under:

a)      Advance ruling can be sought in respect of more subjects than allowed at present. The subjects are: classification of goods/or services, time and value of supply, rate of tax, admissibility of input tax credit, liability to pay tax, liability to take registration and whether a particular transaction amounts to a supply under GST law.

b)      Advance ruling can be sought not only for new activities but also for existing activities. The facility of appeal, which is not there under the Central law, has been provided in the GST Law.

c)      The applicants or the Department, if aggrieved by the advance ruling, would henceforth get the opportunity to file an appeal before the Appellate Authority for revision of the ruling. Advance Ruling can be obtained more easily as there will be one Advance Ruling Authority (as also the Appellate Authority) in every State.

9.             Other provisions of GST

The provisions worth mentioning here are:

(i)                  Valuation of goods shall be done on the basis of transaction value i.e. the invoice price, which is the current practice under the Central Excise and Customs Laws. Taxpayers are allowed to issue supplementary or revised invoice in respect of a supply made earlier.

(ii)               New modes of payment of tax are being introduced, viz. through credit and debit cards, National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).

(iii)             E-Commerce companies are required to collect tax at source in relation to any supplies made through their online platforms, under fulfilment model, at the rate notified by the Government.

(iv)             An anti-profiteering measure has been incorporated in the GST law to ensure that any benefits on account of reduction in tax rates results in commensurate reduction in prices of such goods/services. 

10.         IT preparedness

Putting in place a robust IT network is an absolute must for implementation of GST. A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, taxpayers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST. The functions of the GSTN would, inter alia, include: (i) facilitating registration; (ii) forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities; (iii) computation and settlement of IGST; (iv) matching of tax payment details with banking network; (v) providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the taxpayer return information; (vi) providing analysis of taxpayers’ profile; and (vii) running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit. The target date for introduction of GST is 1st July, 2017.

The GSTN will also make available standard software for small traders to keep their accounts in that, so that straight away it can be uploaded as their monthly returns on GSTN website. This will make compliance easier for small traders.

The Union Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs of India, Shri Arun Jaitley participated in the Plenary Meeting of the Development Committee (DC) in Washington D.C. yesterday. The Development Committee (DC) is the ministerial-level forum of the World Bank Group and the IMF for inter-governmental consensus building on development issues. The meeting comprised of discussion sessions on the ‘Forward Look’ exercise carried-out by the World Bank focusing on ‘A Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030 - Progress and Challenges’, Progress Report on the Shareholding Review and a paper on ‘A Stronger World Bank Group for All’.

The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley called for renewing the commitment to reach a decision on Selective Capital Increase (SCI) and General Capital Increase (GCI) by Annual Meetings 2017 in line with the 2015 Lima roadmap.  Addressing the debate between a bigger bank and a better bank, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the bank unequivocally needs to do more on both to achieve its goals. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley further expressed hope that the implementation of the new safeguards and procurement policies would be characterized by adoption of country systems, a shorter processing time for all clients and hands on implementation support in fragile and low capacity countries.

The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley is currently on an official tour to Washington D.C., USA to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He is accompanied by Dr. Urjit Patel, Governor RBI, Mr. Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), M/o Finance, Dr. Arvind Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) and other officials.

Following is the Text of the Statement made by the Minister of Finance, Corporate Affairs and Defence of India Mr. Arun Jaitley, (representing the Constituency consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka), at 95th Meeting of the Development Committee in Washington D.C. yesterday(22nd April, 2017):

 

“Let me begin by complimenting the World Bank Group for achievement of the historic IDA 18 Replenishment package. We are sure that IDA 18 would touch the lives of people in the world’s poorest countries by providing them resources to grow and by creating opportunities for their upliftment. India is happy to pledge to this replenishment and thereby contribute to the ambitious developmental impact IDA 18 envisages to create.

 

We have all gathered here to take a step forward in the direction of the mandate of Development Committee to advise the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the Fund on critical development issues and on the financial resources required to promote economic development in developing countries. Thus, our agenda of Forward Look and Shareholding Review are very pertinent and timely for discussing how to make the World Bank Group stronger for marshalling the financial resources required to promote economic development in developing countries.

 

Questions are raised today in certain quarters about the global compact, which we have developed over the years- multilateralism driving the rule-based flow of goods and services- to deliver growth, development and poverty reduction for all and achievement of global public good. The attempt to change the discourse from opening up and focusing on competitive advantage to increased protectionism will only hurt the global economy and welfare of people. We need to bond together and renew our compact to protect the World from falling into spiral of slow economic growth, rising inequality and irreversibly altered climate, conflict and fragility. I would thus like to call upon this august gathering today to reaffirm our full commitment to the mandate of the Development Committee and to deliver Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and our own twin goals.

 

The global economy is expected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 and slightly better at 3.6% in 2018.  Recent estimates confirm that, at least in the short term, the global growth is likely to be better than these estimates.  The South Asia region, especially the countries in our Constituency, continues to deliver on its promise. India’s growth is expected to be 7.1% in 2017 and 7.5% in 2018. Bangladesh is expected to grow at 6.8% and 6.5% respectively. Sri Lanka is expected to climb to an average of 5.1% growth in 2017-19 period. Bhutan is expected to grow at an average of 11% over the same period. We, in India, continue to undertake significant reforms and stay focused to promote investment to ensure that the region continues to grow at these rates in the near future.

 

India’s optimistic growth rates can be attributed to the committed political will, efficient governance and successful implementation of economic reforms. India has successfully implemented one of the largest currency reform initiatives ever implemented, which will move the Indian economy to a less cash trajectory, increase tax compliance and reduce the threats from counterfeit currency which acts as a source of terror funding. This initiative has also laid the foundation of a vibrant digital economy and a financial system based on universal unique identity and mobile platform. The government has also taken all steps to ensure an integrated Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country to make India a single common market and free the tax system from multiplicity of levies and controls. This is in continuation with the country’s reform agenda that allows private capital and entrepreneurial spirit to flourish. Successful design, building a national consensus, and a strong technical platform make GST in India a historic tax reform of global significance.

 

In terms of specific agenda items, we are considering three updates/ progress reports covering the Forward look, Shareholding Review, and need for a Stronger World Bank Group.

 

There is no doubt that the developing world needs large and growing resources for achieving SDGs and the twin goals of our institutions. This necessity is the underlying argument of the billions to trillions discourse. All the developing countries also know that mobilization of larger domestic resources and creating conditions for better flow of investment finance from both domestic and international private sector would be necessary for achieving their development ambitions. At the same time, it would be necessary for the multilateral system, especially the World Bank Group, to be stronger than ever to play a meaningful and decisive role in translating this development agenda into reality. I endorse the statement in the paper on -A Stronger World Bank Group for All- that a minimum 50% increase in historical average of $24 billion per annum in the case of the IBRD and a 100% increase in case of IFC would be quite necessary to make the World Bank deliver a commitment level of $100 billion a year to make the WBG play a meaningful and leadership role in global development landscape.

 

In this direction, we have also taken note of the Progress Report of the Shareholding Review as part of the Lima Roadmap.  We appreciate the work done so far for Selective Capital Increase (SCI) in the case of IBRD.  We have always supported that to better reflect the increasing weight of the Developing and Transition Countries (DTC), their share and voice in the ownership and management of these institutions need to grow.  We support SCI to bring about voice reform to ensure higher representation to the under-represented and support the use of the dynamic formula based allocation.  We must fulfill our commitment to consider and reach a decision on Selective Capital Increase and General Capital Increase by Annual Meetings 2017 in line with the Lima Roadmap.

 

I am quite in agreement with the conclusions of the Forward Look and take note of actions taken so far and the progress made. While the Bank Group will need to stay engaged with all client groups, progressive building up of the IBRD portfolio for its low-income blend members and lower middle-income member countries without adversely affecting its AAA status would contribute to Bank Group serving its twin goals and SDGs. The countries in our Constituency are facing a large youth bulge requiring millions of jobs to be created every year. We take note of the commitment in the Forward Look that the World Bank Group would work to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, strengthen skills and education outcomes and strengthen employment service delivery. We would look forward to work with the WBG to make our demographic advantage translate into a real demographic dividend. I would also urge that the World Bank group does its best by allocating substantive resources, measuring and incentivizing South-South learning and cooperation.

 

While a bigger bank is the first condition for the WBG to play its leadership role in development, we must also work hard and be imaginative to make it a better Bank.  In this endeavor, there is a scope of aligning a wide range of activities to the best standards of efficiency. Considering the significant global responsibility that the Bank Group is entrusted with, the Bank should provide leadership in setting global standards in terms of financing, process efficiency, benchmarking, operations, monitoring and evaluation. We also sincerely hope that the implementation of the new safeguards and procurement policies is indeed characterized by adoption of country systems, a shorter processing time for all clients and hands on implementation support in Fragile and low capacity countries.

Further, the World Bank Group, as a global repository of development knowledge, is in a unique position to fill the knowledge gaps in the development landscape. Thus, the Bank with its large pool of skilled manpower and experts should take up this opportunity to emerge as a pioneer in knowledge management.

 

The enormity of the development challenges, its financing and the required knowledge support are continuously changing.  This calls for a development approach which is constantly evolving and is based on real partnership.  The sustainability of developmental reforms relating to infrastructure, energy, human capital, resource mobilization and knowledge development can be ensured in partnership mode on a long-term basis. Therefore, to achieve our development ambitions, we support a strong World Bank Group, which should be adequately resourced to contribute meaningfully and substantially in this task.  We look forward to the transformation of the Bank into an agile, nimble and a bigger bank group that will serve all the developmental needs of the member countries efficiently and help them achieve their Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.”

                The Union Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs of India, Shri Arun Jaitley participated in the Restricted Session of the International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC) and the Plenary Session of World Economic Leaders (IMFC Plenary) in Washington D.C. yesterday.  The event was attended by the select Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. The discussions centred on the global economic outlook, the resource base and governance framework of IMF and the importance of inclusiveness in terms of distribution of the benefits from global integration.

In the IMFC Plenary, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley spoke about the Global Economy, Indian Economy and the role of IMF. He stressed that the emerging risks to the global economy, calls for the enhanced surveillance by the IMF to address the rising vulnerabilities in the global monetary and financial systems. 

Welcoming the emphasis on inclusiveness in the Global Policy Agenda (GPA) as a positive development, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that India firmly believes that finding ways to simultaneously accelerate growth and make it more inclusive is the right note to strike. However, as the voices against integration become louder across a range of countries, he said that it is critical that the multilateral institutions stand firm in their commitment to helping member countries consolidate on the gains from integration, while finding ways to achieve more equitable distributions of those gains. He further added that the process of 15th General Review of Quotas should remain on track and that the commitments made in the IMFC Communiqué to increase the quotas of dynamic emerging economies should be adhered to. The Finance Minister said that it would indeed be ironic if an emphasis on inclusiveness on the policy front co-existed with a lack of it on the Governance front.

The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley is currently on an official tour to Washington D.C., USA to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He is accompanied by Dr. Urjit Patel, Governor RBI, Mr. Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), M/o Finance, Dr. Arvind Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) and other officials.

Following is the Text of the Intervention made by the Minister of Finance, Corporate Affairs and Defence of India Mr. Arun Jaitley, (representing the Constituency consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka), at  the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) in Washington D.C. yesterday(22nd April, 2017):

 

Mr. Chairman,


	Since we met in October 2016, global economic outlook has changed for the better with some silver linings finally emerging. This momentum in global growth is expected to strengthen in 2017 based on gradual improvement in economic conditions in Advanced Economies (AEs), particularly the US, as well as due to the pick-up in growth in some large Emerging Markets (EMs).  However, the confidence in global recovery remains weak owing to the risks associated with the future course of economic policies and monetary policy stance of AEs; resurgence of commodity price pressures; and the increasing recourse to protectionism.
	In these circumstances, it is imperative to fortify efforts to support global recovery by committing ourselves to growth friendly policies and ensuring free and fair trade practices as called for by G-20 leaders at the Hangzhou Summit in September last year. Advanced economies have an important role in stimulating global demand with supportive fiscal and monetary policies and eschewing protectionism. 
	Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) are vulnerable to external shocks and must take ample caution to safeguard ongoing economic recovery. Structural reforms and building buffers constitute the keystones of policy agenda in EMDEs that would ensure sustained growth. Improving the flexibility of labor markets and increasing competition in factor and product markets along with incentives for skill building and innovations are important structural efforts required for boosting productivity and potential growth.             


The Role of IMF – Architecture of Global Cooperation


	The emerging risks to the global economy call for enhanced surveillance by the IMF. The IMF needs to be sufficiently resourced to be able to fully discharge this responsibility. It also needs to function as a quota based institution. Given that there is broad agreement on maintaining the current overall lending capacity of the Fund and that the Fund’s existing resource pool is excessively tilted toward borrowed resources, there is a dire need for increasing quotas. Recent work by the Fund also points to the need for realigning quota shares to reflect the changed economic realities. All these must be achieved as part of the 15thGeneral Review of Quotas. We are disappointed that the deadline for completing the 15th GRQ has been pushed back to no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings. Any further delay in the 15th GRQ will erode Fund’s legitimacy and credibility, and will be against the spirit of the Articles of Agreement.  I do hope that the deadlines now set will be honored and adhered to.
	We look forward to further work on reforming IMF’s toolkit for improving its effectiveness. We fully support any reform of the IMF lending toolkit which better addresses the needs of the EMDEs. We also encourage the Fund to continue working on addressing gaps in the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN), including improved integration of the different layers of the GFSN for the purpose of establishing a credible crisis prevention mechanism. The IMF should play proactive role by productive engagement with Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) by way of sharing information and joint mechanisms for surveillance and policy signaling to build confidence among creditors. Moreover, co-financing arrangements between the IMF and regional financing element(s) would help in mitigating stigma and delay in program financing. We also support IMF’s work on prequalified state-dependent lending tools for swift and reliable provision of liquidity provision for member countries for the full duration of external shocks faced by them.
	We welcome IMF’s role in fostering multilaterally consistent macroeconomic re-balancing and improving the analytical coverage of spillovers from domestic policies to the global economies.
	In view of the adverse implications of mounting protectionist pressures on global recovery, I call upon the IMF to lend strong and unambiguous voice in support of free trade and raise awareness about the benefits of rule based open multilateral trading frameworks.


 

Developments in the Constituency

Bangladesh


	Bangladesh has demonstrated resilience amidst global headwinds and domestic challenges. The preliminary estimate of real GDP growth is 7.1 percent in FY16 (ending in June 2016) and 7.2 percent in FY17. Headline inflation eased further in FY16, with annual average CPI inflation reaching 5.9 percent in June 2016, compared to 6.4 percent in June 2015. In FY17 so far, inflation has further moderated to 5.4 percent in February 2017 – a five-year low and well within the FY17 ceiling of 5.8 percent.
	Monetary policy stance will continue to remain prudent, and the authorities remain vigilant against upside risks to inflation. Excess liquidity in the banking system has been declining in recent months, as credit growth has picked up. Both food and non-food CPI inflation has moderated, aided by favorable agricultural production, modest rise in global commodity prices, and growth-focused yet cautious monetary policy stance. Projected rise in global commodity prices in 2017, however, may exert some upward pressure on domestic prices.
	On the external front, the current account balance recorded a small deficit of US$ 1.12 billion during July-February FY17 as against a surplus of US$ 2.3 billion during the corresponding period in FY16 on account of strong import growth (10.15 percent) coupled with a moderate growth in exports (3.31 percent during July-February) and a slowdown in remittance inflows. The recent decline in remittance reflects a combination of global and local factors, but mainly driven by weaker economic activity in the Middle East, which is expected to recover as oil prices stabilize and manpower exports from Bangladesh increase. Besides, Bangladesh Bank has taken some measures to reduce costs of sending remittance through the formal channels. Bangladesh Bank projects the FY17 overall balance surplus at US$ 2.9 billion, which would help the coverage to remain around 7-8 months of prospective imports of goods and services in FY17. Despite some moderation, garment exports growth has held up well relative to peers.


 


	Fiscal deficit (excluding grants) in FY17 is expected to remain broadly unchanged at around 5.0 percent. The increase reflects mainly the increase in public sector wages. Budget financing was mainly done through National Savings Certificates (NSCs). Gross investment as percent of GDP has risen in FY16 to 29.7 percent but is expected to be around0 percent in FY17. Subsidies as a share of GDP have come down, helped in part by a lower fuel subsidy. With the rolling out of VAT from July 1, 2017, the scope to increase revenue will increase along with improvement in compliance and reduction in tax evasion across the board, and serve as a key building block for future tax policy reforms.
	In the banking sector, financial stability continues to receive a high priority with intensive monitoring of banks remaining within the statutory limits on their capital market exposures. To improve corporate governance, Bangladesh Bank is further strengthening its supervisory scrutiny, including by IT-based online supervision tools and placement of observers in banks with governance challenges.
	The Government's reform initiatives to improve the business climate and ease infrastructure bottlenecks, including by developing special economic zones, should help crowd in both private domestic and foreign direct investments that can create more jobs, raise productivity, and potential growth. To undertake the increases in public investment and social spending, so as to boost growth and poverty reduction, while keeping fiscal policy sustainable, the Government is committed to boosting revenue and fully implement the VAT by FY18.


Bhutan


	The year 2015/16 saw an acceleration in growth to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent in 2014/15 and 4 percent in 2013/2014. As in the previous year, the acceleration of growth was mainly driven by a pick-up in services, mining and hydropower-related construction. The medium-term outlook is also promising, with the commissioning of new hydropower projects expected to provide further impetus to output and exports, as well as to fiscal revenues.
	Consumer price inflation fell further to 3.3 percent in 2015/2016 from 5.2 percent in 2014/15. On account of a gradual pick-up in capital spending, the 2015/2016 fiscal deficit was 1.3 percent of GDP, in contrast to the fiscal surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2014/2015. In 2016/17, because of further acceleration in capital expenditures toward the end of the 11thFive Year Plan, the deficit is projected to reach 5 percent of GDP.
	The 2015/16 current account deficit increased by about one percent of GDP to 29.1 percent of GDP. The large deficit in 2015/16 and previous years is a result of the imports for the construction of hydropower projects.  It is expected to decline after 2017/18 with the commissioning of new power plants and the resultant export of power. In the longer run, the current account balance is likely to return a surplus.
	Credit growth picked up to 14 percent in 2015 and has approached 17.4 percent by the end of 2016.


India


	India continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. As per provisional estimates, real GDP grew by 7.9 percent in 2015-16 compared with 7.2 per cent in 2014-15. The   second advance estimate for GDP growth for 2016-17 is placed at 7.1 percent. The currency reform initiative will move the Indian economy to a less cash trajectory, increase tax compliance and reduce the threats from counterfeit currency which acts as a source of terror funding. Growth is expected to gain strength in the following years due to externalities derived from deep structural reforms implemented by our Government and robust aggregate demand.   
	CPI inflation which has been easing since August 2016 increased modestly to 3.65 percent in February2017 against 3.17 percent in January 2017.Though it has marginally risen to 3.81% in March, 2017,it is well within the medium term CPI inflation target of 4%.
	At the system level, our banks are adequately capitalized. At the same time, we are deeply aware of the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs) which are in the process of being effectively resolved. Policies for resolution of NPLs including optimal structuring of credit facilities, change in ownership/management, deep restructuring of stressed assets and facilitation of speedy exit from unviable accounts have been put in place. Additionally, the amendments to debt recovery laws as well as the enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 would provide enabling infrastructure to deal effectively with the recovery of non-performing assets (NPAs) in a time bound manner.
	The Government is infusing capital in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) to meet their capital requirements in line with global risk norms and to spur credit growth. Recent announcements made by our Prime Minister for the provision of cost effective credit to farmers and housing loans to the poor including enhanced access of credit for MSMEs would enlarge the scope of institutional credit delivery to the hitherto under-banked segments of the economy.
	The progress of our financial inclusion efforts has been remarkable with 282 million accounts opened by banks under the no-frills PMJDY so far. The objective of the scheme is to provide all households in the country with financial services, with special focus on empowering the weaker sections of society, including women, small and marginal farmers and laborers, both rural and urban. Attractive low cost life and health insurance and pension plans introduced by the Government have expanded the social safety net for weaker sections of the society. Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) is active in facilitating structured microcredit deliveries to small scale entrepreneurs for productive activities. Supported by AADHAR, the biometric based unique identity system for individuals, the ongoing rapid expansion of digital payment mechanisms will provide large push to our financial inclusion efforts.
	The wide ranging liberalisation of the FDI policy in recent years is expected to provide major impetus to employment and job creation. Most of the sectors, except a small negative list, are now under the automatic approval route. India is now the most open economy in the world for FDI.  Net FDI inflows during April-December 2016-17 increased to US $ 31.18 billion from US $ 27.22 billion during the same period in the previous year. The increasing strength of economic fundamentals have made India the most sought after destination for investments.
	India’s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US $ 367.93 billion as of 24 March 2017.The current account deficit (CAD) was very much at sustainable level of 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent in 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. The CA deficit for the three quarters of 2016-17 improved further to 0.7 percent of GDP.
	As envisaged, the Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) was contained at 3.5 percent in 2016-17 following a steady path of fiscal consolidation without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy and spending on programs for poverty alleviation. The quality of fiscal adjustment is reflected in the improvement in revenue deficit to 2.1 percent in the revised budgetary estimate vis-à-vis 2.5 percent in 2015-16. Next year the revenue deficit will be reduced further to 1.9 percent to below that of 2 percent mandated by the FRBM Act. The GFD for the year 2017-18 is pegged at 3.2 percent with a commitment to achieve 3 percent in the following year. The steady approach towards fiscal consolidation is being judiciously adopted to avoid excessive curtailment of public investment- in view of the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and subdued global growth. 
	For the current financial year, the Union Budget 2017-18 has significantly increased resource allocation for infrastructure as well as rural, agricultural and allied sectors. The allocation for the rural employment guarantee scheme has also been increased substantially. The government would continue to increase fiscal resilience through greater focus on the quality of expenditure and higher tax realizations including those that would accrue from large cash deposits made in banks due to demonetization. The Budget for 2017-18 shows our firm resolve to boost investment in agriculture, social sector, infrastructure and employment generation on the one hand and simultaneously pursue the path of fiscal consolidation on the other. The delivery of AADHAR based direct benefit transfers (DBT) has succeeded in plugging unwarranted leakages resulting in substantial savings to the Government. We are also fully on course to implement the Goods & Service Tax (GST) by 01 July 2017. The GST will deliver significant externalities by way of improved taxation efficiency and the ease of doing business and will convert India into one common market.
	Since 2014, we have taken efforts to implement deep structural reforms to unlock the full potential of our economy. Widely encompassing reforms have been put in place which, inter alia, include the Goods and Services Tax Act, AADHAAR (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act 2016, rationalization of subsidies, enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 and operationalization of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) for new corporate insolvency framework. Other policy initiatives include implementation of the hybrid annuity model for PPP, passage of Mines and Mineral Amendment Act, announcement of National Capital Goods Policy, directions to PSEs for expediting arbitration in construction sector, roadmap for rapid adoption of digital payments system, extensive liberalization of the FDI regime and improvements in governance processes in the infrastructure delivery. Alongside steady progress in India’s ranking in Ease of Doing Business, the Government’s flagship program ‘Make in India’ encourages new processes, new infrastructure, new sectors and new mindset to boost entrepreneurial energy. Affirmative policies to arrest declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and empowerment of women over the life-cycle continuum and those for enhancing female employment are being vigorously pursued.  


  

Sri Lanka


	The Sri Lankan economy grew by 4.4 per cent in 2016 compared to the 4.8 per cent growth in 2015. During the year, the highest growth of 6.7 per cent was recorded in the industrial sector supported by the increase in construction related activities. Meanwhile, the services sector grew by 4.2 per cent with the expansion of financial services, insurance, and telecommunications. However, agriculture related activities contracted by 4.2 per cent impacted by supply side disruptions due to floods in the second quarter and drought conditions during the final quarter of 2016. GDP is projected to grow by around 5.5 per cent in 2017.
	Inflation as measured by National Consumer Price Index remained at 4.2 per cent at end 2016. However, it showed an upward trend recording 8.2 per cent in February 2017 which was largely due to the impact of prevailing drought conditions and adjustments to the tax structure. Despite the monetary policy tightening in 2016, the decline in monetary and credit aggregates was slower than expected.  The Central Bank having considered these developments, its policy interest rates were further increased by 25 basis points in March 2017, to contain the buildup of adverse inflation expectations and the possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressures through excessive monetary and credit expansion. The Fiscal Deficit of the Government was reduced to 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2016, from a deficit of 7 per cent in 2015 through a bolstering of tax revenues and containing recurrent and capital expending. Accordingly, the fiscal sector performance was largely on track of the IMF’s 3-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 1.5 billion which was entered in to in 2016. 
	On the external front, the deficit in the trade account of the balance of payments (BOP) increased with expenditure on imports increasing and earnings from exports declining in 2016. The declines in export commodity prices, particularly tea and rubber prices as well as low external demand for export commodities lowered the earnings from exports. Earnings from tourism and workers’ remittances continued to cushion the adverse impact of trade deficit on the BOP. In the meantime, outflows of foreign investments from the government securities market which was observed late 2016 and early 2017 appear to have subsided by March 2017. In fact, marginal inflows have been experienced despite the increase in policy interest rates in the United States.   The government could raise USD 2,150 million through issuance of international sovereign bonds during the year.   Nevertheless, the overall Balance of Payments is estimated to have recorded a deficit of US dollars 500 million in 2016.  Meanwhile, gross official reserves were estimated at US dollars 6.0 billion by end December 2016, which is equivalent to 3.7 months of imports. The rupee, which depreciated against the US dollar by 3.8 per cent in 2016, recorded a further depreciation of 1.1 per cent by end March 2017. The financial sector stability and soundness improved, supported by adequate capital and liquidity levels and contained non-performing loan ratios.

                The Central Government has successfully divested 9.2% of paid-up capital in National Aluminum Company Ltd. (NALCO) to raise Rs. 1,200 crore to begin FY 2017-18 with a bang. Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance, Government of India is set a record target of realizing Rs. 72,500 crore through disinvestment. This follows an all-time high achievement of Rs. 46,247 crore during 2016-17. 

Originally, the disinvestment in NALCO OFS was pegged at 5% of paid-up capital, but seeing the overwhelming response from the market, DIPAM exercised the green shoe option to retain over-subscription and raised the offer to 9.2% on Wednesday,19th April, 2017. With this transaction, the Government of India shareholding in NALCO has come down to 65.37%.

If the original OFS offer of 5% is considered, the issue is over-subscribed by 2.56 times and if the revised offer of 9.2% is taken, the issue is subscribed 1.43 times. The green shoe option (over-subscription option) was used by the Government for the first time, since the modified OFS procedure spanning 2 days (T and T+1 day) was put in place by SEBI in 2016. 

The retail investor continues to back disinvestments of CPSEs by DIPAM. For the fourth time in a row, retail investors out-performed institutional investors. This is particularly satisfying to DIPAM, as one of the objectives of disinvestment policy is to make PSU shareholding broad-based so that nation’s wealth is shared by its citizens. 

Encouraged by the successful completion of NALCO OFS, DIPAM is gearing

- up for a series of disinvestments throughout the year to meet its target.

Once the Protocol enters into force, both India and Portugal would be able to exchange tax related information, which will help tax authorities of both countries to curb tax evasion.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the policy guidelines to allow financially sound State Government entities to borrow directly from bilateral ODA (Official development Assistance) partners for implementation of vital infrastructure projects. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), a State Government entity, has also been allowed to borrow directly from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan for implementation of Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) project. The estimated project cost for Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) is Rs.17,854 crore, out of which JICA loan portion is expected to be Rs.15,109 crore.

The guidelines will facilitate the State Government entities to directly borrow from the external bilateral funding agencies subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and all repayments of loans and interests to the funding agencies will be directly remitted by the concerned borrower. The concerned State Government will furnish guarantee for the Loan. The Government of India will provide counter guarantee for the loan.

External assistance today plays a supportive role in financing major infrastructure projects, social sector projects and in building up institutional capacity. The role of external assistance has gained further significance in view of the large gap in funding requirements for major infrastructure projects implemented by the State Governments in order to acquire competitive strength under the globalized economic framework. Presently, external development assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources is received by the Government of India (i) for projects/programmes in the Central sector; (ii) for projects executed by Central Public Sector Undertakings; and (ii) on behalf of the State Governments for State sector projects/programmes to be implemented by the State Governments and/or local bodies and public sector undertakings. The existing guidelines do not allow direct borrowings by the State Government entities from external agencies.

Several State agencies are implementing major infrastructure projects of national importance. These projects, even if viable and sound, have huge funding requirements and borrowing by the State Governments for such projects may exhaust their respective borrowing limits. Therefore, in order to accelerate the pace of investment in major infrastructure projects in the country without compromising the need for external assistance for other sectors, an enabling provision in the existing guidelines was considered necessary to facilitate direct borrowing by the State Government entities from bilateral external agencies. This dispensation will allow the financially sound State entities to directly borrow and repay the loan required for major infrastructure projects without burdening the State exchequer. The approval of these guidelines reiterates Government’s commitment to promote inclusive growth and strengthen the economy.

                Loans extended under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) during 2016-17 have crossed the target of Rs. 1,80,000 crore for 2016-17. Sanctions currently stand at Rs. 1,80,087 crore with final data still awaited from some of the smaller non-banking lenders. Of this amount, Rs. 1,23,000 crore was lent by banks while non-banking institutions lent about Rs. 57,000 crore. Data compiled so far indicates that the number of borrowers this year were over 4 crore, of which over 70% were women borrowers. About 20% of the borrowers were from the Scheduled Caste Category, 5% from the Scheduled Tribe Category, while Other Backward Classes accounted for almost 35% of the borrowers.

The achievements of both public sector banks and private banks have been extremely encouraging. The robust growth in bank loans to unfunded and underfunded segments is an indication of the emergence of this category of borrowers as a key driver of demand for credit.

The Union Budget has announced a target of Rs. 2.44 lakh crore for Mudra Loans during 2017-18. There would be a special focus within the Mudra Scheme on convergence with other government schemes, deepening connect with borrowers and meeting credit requirements of trainees completing skilling course.

Mudra Loans are available for non-agricultural activities upto Rs. 10 lakh and activities allied to agriculture such as Dairy, Poultry, Bee Keeping etc, are also covered. Mudra’s unique features include a Mudra Card which permits access to Working Capital through ATMs and Card Machines. Evaluation studies show that banks have been proactive in identifying and disbursing loans to first time borrowers thereby weaning them away from money lenders. Borrowers particularly value three attributes of Mudra Loans viz, non-insistence on guarantor or collateral, simple documentation and quick processing.

In year 2015-16 the net profit of CPSEs stood nearly 1.16 lakh crore. Currently there are about 12 lakh employees in our CPSEs. He said we should feel proud that our PSEs are continuously striving for setting the bar of excellence at highest level.

The Bharatiya Mahila Bank (BMB) was created to enhance access to financial services at affordable rates, promote asset ownership, entrepreneurship for the purposes of inclusive growth and empowerment of women in general.

 

The objectives of affordable credit to women as well as propagation of women-centric products need to be quickly achieved through a wider network and lower cost of funds which is not possible for a new bank and that is why to achieve this, BMB has been merged with State Bank of India.

 

In the three years since BMB was established, the Bank has financed a mere Rs 192 crs to women borrowers, while SBI group, with its large outreach of more than 20,000 branches and lowest cost of funds, has provided loans of about Rs.46,000 crore to women borrowers. Out of its workforce of around 2 lakh employees, 22% are women. SBI group already has 126 exclusive all-women branches across the country while BMB has only seven. The proportion of administrative and managerial cost in BMB is much higher to reach the same coverage. For the same cost, a much higher volume of loans to women could be given through SBI.

 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

Tax on sale or purchase of goods within a State as per Entry List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is a State subject, and accordingly, VAT was been introduced by the concerned States, in place of turnover taxes. The introduction of VAT ensured that credit of taxes paid on the inputs were available to a tax payer while discharging his output tax liability. This helped in minimizing cascading of taxes at the State level and in increasing compliance because of the in-built mechanism of transfer of input tax credit. VAT led to a simplification of taxes at the State level.

 

Presently, the Constitution empowers the Central Government to levy excise duty on manufacturing and service tax on the supply of services. Similarly, it empowers the State Governments to levy sales tax or value added tax (VAT) on the sale of goods. This exclusive division of fiscal powers has led to a multiplicity of indirect taxes in the country. Further, central sales tax (CST) is levied on intra-State sale of goods by the Central Government, but collected and retained by the exporting States. In addition, many States also levy an entry tax on the entry of goods in local areas.

 

This multiplicity of taxes at the State and Central levels has resulted in a complex indirect tax structure in the country that is ridden with hidden costs for the trade and industry. Firstly, there is no uniformity of tax rates and structure across States. Secondly, there is cascading of taxes due to ‘tax on tax’. No credit of excise duty and service tax paid at the stage of manufacture is available to the traders while paying the State level sales tax or VAT, and vice-versa. Further, no credit of State taxes paid in one State can be availed in other States. Hence, the prices of goods and services get artificially inflated to the extent of this ‘tax on tax’.

 

The introduction of GST would mark a clear departure from the scheme of distribution of fiscal powers envisaged in the Constitution. The proposed dual GST envisages taxation of the same taxable event, i.e., supply of goods and services, simultaneously by both the Centre and the States. Therefore, both Centre and States will be empowered to levy GST across the value chain from the stage of manufacture to consumption. The credit of GST paid on inputs at every stage of value addition would be available for the discharge of GST liability on the output, thereby ensuring GST is charged only on the component of value addition at each stage. This would ensure that there is no ‘tax on tax’ in the country.

 

GST will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country. It is expected to reduce cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making the Indian trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. It is also expected that introduction of GST will foster a common or seamless Indian market and contribute significantly to the growth of the economy.

 

Further, GST will broaden the tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.

The provision that the withdrawal from National Pension Scheme is taxed to the extent of 60 per cent has been introduced into the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’) vide Finance Act, 2016 by inserting clause (12A) in Section 10 of the Act.

  Prior to Finance Act, 2016, National Pension Scheme (NPS), referred to in section 80CCD, was under Exempt, Exempt and Tax (EET) regime i.e., the monthly/periodic contributions during the pension accumulation phase were allowed as deduction from income for tax purposes; the returns generated on these contributions during the accumulation phase were also exempt from tax but the terminal benefits on exit or superannuation, in the form of lump sum withdrawals, were taxable in the hands of the individual subscribed or his nominee in the year of receipt of such amounts unlike PPF and EPF which have been enjoying EEE regime i.e. Exempt, Exempt, Exempt.

 In order to rationalize the taxability of receipts from pension plans, vide Finance Act, 2016, section 10 of the Act was amended to provide that any payment from National Pension Scheme to an employee on account of closure or his opting out of the NPS shall also be exempt from tax, to the extent it does not exceed forty percent of the total amount payable to him at the time of closure or his opting out of the scheme. Further, Finance Act, 2017 has amended section 10 of the Income-tax Act to exempt partial withdrawals by employees (to the extent of 25% of the employee’s contribution) from their NPS accounts in accordance with the guidelines prescribed under Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 2013.

 Digital financial transactions are a part of the Government’s strategy to create histories of transactions, including the associated credit, and thereby enable small and micro enterprises to access formal credit, improve tax compliance, and mainstream financial savings into the banking system, which will help mobilise such savings for economic growth.

 

All payment systems including currency entail costs, which are borne among transacting parties and payment service providers, and the cost structures of various systems differ. Payment systems also differ in the advantages they offer to transacting parties. E.g., digital transactions can be made without having to access cash, and they offer an opportunity to make payments anytime and from anywhere, without loss of interest income. Transacting parties select a payment system not only on the basis of cost but keeping in mind such advantages as well.

 

State Bank of India has apprised that three cash deposit transactions at branches are available to savings bank accountholders free of charge.  Thereafter, a charge of Rs. 50 plus service tax per transaction is to be levied.  In addition to the free cash deposit transactions at branches, accountholders can also deposit cash using ATM/debit card, into the card-linked account, at cash points (Cash Deposit Machines / Cash Recyclers), any number of times, free of charge.

 This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

                In order to improve the Ease of Doing Business for newly incorporated corporates, CBDT has tied up with Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to issue Permanent Account Number (PAN) and Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) in 1 day.

 

Applicant companies submit a common application form SPICe (INC 32) on MCA portal and once the data of incorporation is sent to CBDT by MCA, the PAN and TAN are issued immediately without any further intervention of the applicant. The Certificate of Incorporation (COI) of newly incorporated companies includes the PAN in addition to the Corporate Identity Number (CIN). TAN is also allotted simultaneously and communicated to the Company.

 

Till 31st March 2017, 19,704 newly incorporated Companies were allotted PAN in this manner. During March, 2017, of the 10,894 newly incorporated companies, PAN was allotted within 4 hrs in 95.63% cases and within 1 day in all cases. Similarly, TAN was allotted to all such companies within 4 hrs in 94.7 % cases and within 1 day in 99.73% cases.

 

CBDT’s initiative in starting of a business is expected to significantly improve the ranking of India in the Ease of Doing Business Study conducted by World Bank by reducing the number of processes of registration before various authorities under law, reducing the time taken for allotment of the registration number (CIN, PAN, TAN) and making the entire registration process for new companies much simpler.

 

CBDT has also introduced the Electronic PAN Card (E-PAN) which is sent by email, in addition to issue of the physical PAN Card, to all applicants including individuals where PAN is allotted.  Applicant would be benefited by having a digitally signed E-PAN card which they can submit as proof of identity to other agency electronically directly or by storing in the Digital Locker (https://digilocker.gov.in).

                The Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with USA for implementation of FATCA entered into force on 31st August 2015. Under the alternative procedure provided in Rule 114H(8) of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, the financial institutions need to obtain self-certification and carry out due diligence in respect of all individual and entity accounts opened from 1st July 2014 to 31st August 2015. Such self-certification and documentation was required to be obtained by the financial institutions by 31st August 2016, otherwise they were required to close the accounts and report the same if found to be a ""reportable account"" as per the prescribed due diligence procedure for pre-existing account. 

In view of the difficulties highlighted by stakeholders in following the provision for ""closure"" of financial accounts, it was informed vide Press Release dated 31st August 2016 that the financial institutions may not close the accounts by 31st August 2016 in respect of which self-certifications have not been obtained under the alternative procedure and a revised time line shall be notified in due course. The financial institutions were also advised to continue to work on completing the required due diligence, including obtaining self-certifications. 

Queries are being received from the financial institutions regarding the revised time lines for completion of due diligence. The financial institutions are advised that all efforts should be made by the financial institutions to obtain the self-certification. The account holders may be informed that, in case self-certifications are not provided till 30 April 2017, the accounts would be blocked, which would mean that the financial institution would prohibit the account holder from effecting any transaction with respect to such accounts. The transactions by the account holder in such blocked accounts may, thereafter, be permitted once the self-certification is obtained and due diligence completed.

Under this policy, the National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) have been conceived as giant industrial green field townships to promote world-class manufacturing activities. Focus sectors for the new manufacturing policy include textiles and garments, leather and footwear, gems and jewellery, food processing industries, capital goods sector industries, aerospace, shipping, IT hardware & electronics, telecommunication equipment, defence equipment, solar energy, automobiles, pharmaceuticals & medical equipment, small & medium enterprises and public sector enterprises.

Corrective steps under the ‘Make in India’ programme include creation of Investor Facilitation Cell under ‘Invest India’ programme; launch of E biz online portal to improve business environment in the country and to facilitate efficient access to Government –to- Business (G2B) services; development of a unified web portal ‘Shram Suvidha’ to facilitate allotment of Unique Labour Identification Number (ULIN) to units, filing of single self-certified online return, random computerized inspections, and uploading reports by inspectors post inspection and launch of ‘Start Up India’ scheme to encourage entrepreneurship in the country.

                The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is mandated to protect the interests of investors in securities, and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market. In pursuance of the same, SEBI has framed Regulations for the securities market, inter alia, to ensure that the interest of the investors is protected by way of disclosures, transparency and fair treatment to investors.

 

In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 30, read with clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992, SEBI has framed the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 and Circulars issued thereunder. In terms of these regulations, inter-alia, the following requirements have been laid down for mutual funds (MFs):

 

i.    Segregation of accounts – Trustees of Mutual Funds and asset management companies (AMCs) are required to ensure scheme-wise segregation of bank accounts and securities accounts. An AMC needs to separately maintain proper and separate books of account, records and documents for each scheme so as to explain its transactions and to disclose, at any point of time, the financial position of each scheme and in particular, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the fund.

ii.     Appointment of Custodian – The Mutual Fund is mandated to appoint a Custodian to keep custody of securities and other assets held by the Fund.

iii.    Disclosures in Offer Document – The offer document is required to contain disclosures with respect to asset allocation, investment strategies, associated risks etc. to enable investors to make informed investment decisions.

iv.     Due Diligence – The Board of the AMC is required to have in place a mechanism to verify that due diligence is being exercised while making investment decisions, particularly in cases of investment in unlisted and privately placed securities, unrated debt securities, Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), transactions in which associates are involved and instances in which the performance of the scheme/ schemes is poor. Further, AMCs are required to report compliance with these requirements in their periodical reports to the Trustees and the Trustees shall report the same to SEBI in the Half Yearly Trustee Reports. Trustees also check compliance with these guidelines through independent auditors or internal and/or statutory auditors or other systems developed by them.

v.   Portfolio Disclosures – SEBI has mandated Mutual Funds/AMCs to disclose the portfolio of all schemes on a monthly basis on their website as well as publish the same in newspapers on a half yearly basis.

 

In addition, in order to curb irregularities in Mutual Funds, periodic inspections of Mutual Funds are undertaken by SEBI-appointed auditors. Besides, theme-based inspections are also undertaken to examine specific issues in the operations of Mutual Funds. Pursuant to these inspections, in case of any non-compliance with the Regulations, SEBI takes action as deemed fit and appropriate.

 

The work of collecting funds under mutual funds has not been entrusted to public sector banks. In terms of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, any entity, including public sector banks (PSBs), private companies, etc. which satisfies the eligibility criteria can obtain registration from SEBI and set up a Mutual Fund. Accordingly, public sector banks fulfilling the criteria so prescribed by SEBI, may apply to SEBI for registration and thereby undertake such activities. Currently, the following seven public sector banks are sponsors of Mutual Funds:

Mutual Funds are mandated to provide regular plans (investments routed through Mutual Fund distributors) and direct plans (investments directly with Mutual Funds) for all their schemes. For selling mutual fund schemes and garnering funds, Mutual Funds can empanel distributors. Currently, Mutual Fund distributors are required to obtain an Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) Registration Number (ARN) before selling any Mutual Fund product. Currently, the following twenty six public sector banks hold ARN and are empanelled as distributors:

                The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (Retirement Adviser) Regulations were notified in the year 2016. The objective of the Regulations is to provide a framework for eligibility of Retirement Advisers, their registration process, fees etc. of Retirement Advisers (RA) and to define the scope of work and responsibility of the Retirement Advisers to ensure orderly growth of pension sector

In order to expand the National Pension System (NPS) to NRIs, PFRDA has decided to amend the PFRDA (Retirement Adviser) Regulations, 2016 in order to facilitate RA to provide onboarding and advisory services to the NRIs. 

Non Resident Indians (NRIs) between the ages of 18-60 years are eligible to join NPS on voluntary basis. NRIs have also been provided the online facility to open account under NPS besides the conventional mode of account opening through the Points-of-Presence (PoPs). 

As on 30.03.2017, 2611 NRIs have subscribed to NPS, out of which 1401 NRIs have joined NPS during the financial year 2016-17. 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                According to the World Bank Group, India’s GDP (in current US$, 2015) is US$ 2.095 trillion vis-a-vis the World GDP (in current US$, 2015) of US$ 74 trillion. Thus India’s share in the global economy is about 2.83%.

 

For the above calculation, the World Bank Group has used the GDP at purchaser''s prices, which is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It has been calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. The data used are in current U.S. dollars which have been converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor has been used by the World Bank Group.

 

According to the World Bank Group, assuming a simple linear extrapolation of growth rates and assuming India’s GDP grows at 8% in US dollar terms, and France and the UK grow at 2.5% in US dollar termjls, India’s contribution to the global economy may surpass France in 2018 and the United Kingdom in 2021. However, these estimates given by the World Bank are just extrapolations and not forecasts.

                Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation stood at 5.2 per cent in January 2017, which was the highest in the last 29 months. Consumer Price Index (combined) declined to 3.2 per cent in January 2017 from 3.4 per cent in December 2016. The rise in WPI inflation during January 2017 was mainly due to rise in inflation of Fuel and Power.

The Government has been successful in bringing down the prices of essential commodities through astute food supply management. The Government has taken a number of measures to control inflation. The steps taken, inter alia, include (i) increased budgetary allocation for Price Stabilization Fund in the budget 2017-18 to check volatility of prices of essential commodities, in particular, of pulses; (ii) created buffer stock of pulses through domestic procurement and imports; (iii) announced higher Minimum Support Prices so as to incentivize production; (iv) issued advisory to States/UTs to take strict action against hoarding and black marketing under the Essential Commodities Act 1955 and the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980; (v) imposed 20 per cent duty on export of sugar; and (vi) reduced import duty on potatoes, wheat and palm oil.

                Foreign investment is one of the important components of India’s capital/finance account of balance of payments. During 2016-17 (April-December), the current account deficit of US$ 11.6 billion was more than covered by the net capital inflows of US$ 25.9 billion resulting in the accretion of foreign exchange reserves of US$ 14.2 billion. Of this, net foreign investment inflows were US$ 27.4 billion. FDI, a more stable component of capital inflows increased to US$ 30.6 billion in 2016-17 (April-December) from US$ 27.2 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. 

During 2016-17, the Indian rupee depreciated by 2.4 per cent and by 1.8 per cent against the US dollar and Euro and appreciated by 12.6 per cent against the Pound sterling. However, in February and March 2017 the rupee appreciated against all the above three currencies with significant capital inflows, both portfolio and FDI. Net FII flows picked up significantly since February 2017 after turning negative during the period October 2016-January 2017. FDI inflows also continued to be robust during 2016-17 (April-January). 

Positive sentiment generated by good growth prospects of the Indian economy, sound macroeconomic fundamentals with low inflation, low current account deficit, adequate forex reserves, etc. are driving capital inflows contributing to the strengthening of the rupee. 

This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

As per the quarterly estimate released by the CSO, the growth rate in the real for the third quarter (October-December quarter) of 2016-17 was 7.0 per cent. The growth of GDP in the third quarter of 2016-17 was estimated to have been boosted by a 6 per cent growth in the real GVA in agriculture & allied sectors, which is higher than the corresponding growth rates of 1.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of the year. The growth rate in the real GVA of manufacturing in the third quarter of 2016-17 was 8.3 per cent, as compared the corresponding growth rates of 9.0 per cent and 6.9 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of the year.

 

 As per the quarterly estimates brought out by the CSO, real GDP grew by 7.2 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of 2016-17. The real GDP growth was estimated to be 7.0 per cent in the third quarter of the year—the period during which the demonetisation of high denomination currencies occurred. On the basis of the estimates of national income for first three quarters of 2016-17 and the second advance estimates for 2016-17 by the CSO, the implied growth of real GDP for the fourth quarter would be robust at 7.0 per cent.

Concerted & co-ordinated actions of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) under the Department of Revenue have achieved phenomenal success in fighting the menace of black money during the last three years. 

The period has witnessed unprecedented enforcement actions in direct & indirect taxes. While 23064 searches / surveys have been conducted (Income Tax 17525; Customs 2509; Central Excise 1913; Service Tax 1120); more than Rs. 1.37 lakh crore of tax evasion has been detected (Income Tax 69434; Customs 11405; Central Excise 13952; Service Tax 42727). Simultaneously, criminal prosecutions were launched in 2814 cases (Income Tax 1966; Customs 526; Central Excise 293; Service Tax 29) and 3893 persons were placed under arrest. (Customs 3782; Central Excise 47; Service Tax 64)

The Enforcement Directorate intensified its anti money laundering actions by registering 519 cases and conducting 396 searches. Arrests were made in 79 cases and properties worth Rs.14,933 crore were attached.

The Benami prohibition law which remained in-operative for last 28 years was made operational through a comprehensive amendment with effect from November, 2016. More than 245 benami transactions have already been identified. Provisional attachments of properties worth Rs.55 crore have already been made in 124 cases.

Relevant laws and rules have been streamlined & tightened, plugging the loopholes and strengthening the penal provisions. Effective steps were taken to track & curb cash transactions through various means like penalising cash transaction of more than Rs.2 lakh; limiting allowable cash expense up-to Rs.10000 only; making Aadhaar mandatory for obtaining PAN & filing of income tax returns; making PAN mandatory for cash deposits above Rs.50,000; compulsory linking of PAN with bank accounts; prohibiting cash of Rs.20,000 or more in transfer of immovable property by imposition of a penalty of an equal amount and mandatory reporting of cash deposits above Rs.2.5 lakh in savings accounts and Rs.12.5 lakh in current account during 9 November to 30 December 2016.

Crackdown against thousands of shell companies engaged in nefarious activities was effected through enforcement actions (searches, surveys, arrests, prosecutions) by the LEAs (IT/ED/MCA/SFIO/CBI). During the last three financial years (2013-14 to 2015-16), Income Tax investigations led to detection of more than 1155 shell companies / entities used as conduits by over 22,000 beneficiaries. The amount involved in non-genuine transactions of such beneficiaries was more than Rs. 13,300 crore. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued more than a lakh notices for striking off names of defunct / non-compliant companies. A High powered group has been set-up for co-ordinating and monitoring the actions taken by departments concerned with the objective of eliminating the conduits of black money generation and application.

The relentless crusade against black money will get further intensified in the coming days making the tax evaders & money launderers realise that they have to pay a heavy cost for their deviant behaviour.

The Government of India and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a $175 million loan agreement to support construction of high voltage transmission systems to evacuate power generated from new mega solar parks to the interstate grid, and improve reliability of the national grid system here yesterday. 

The loan will be given to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) and will include subprojects in various locations in India. As an innovative feature, the project is designed to adopt the country systems on both safeguards and procurement at the agency level. This will be the ADB’s first breakthrough of the country system’s application to a specific project. 

Mr. Raj Kumar, Joint Secretary (Multilateral Institutions), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance signed the agreement on behalf of the Government of India while Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission signed for ADB. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Raj Kumar, Joint Secretary said that by supporting the construction of interstate transmission systems for the mega solar power projects, the project will enable transmission of surplus solar energy from States with surplus power to power-deficit States. 

After signing the loan agreement, Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB for India said that the project will support the continued expansion of solar energy in India in line with the Government of India’s objectives, and contribute to climate change by increasing share of clean energy in the power mix besides increasing overall efficiency of the power system. He said that the adoption of POWERGRID’s safeguard and procurement systems will improve its operational flexibility and autonomy, and reduce the transaction costs and time for project preparation and implementation. As laid-out in the ADB Safeguards Policy, country safeguard systems constitute a country’s legal and institutional framework on environment and social safeguards. 

In addition to the ADB loan of $175 million, the project includes $50 million co-finance from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) – a $5.8 billion component of the Climate Investment Funds aimed at providing developing countries resources to expand efforts in utilizing low carbon technologies and transitioning to clean, renewable energy sources. 

POWERGRID will make an equity contribution of $135 million equivalent to support the total project cost of $450 million. The $175 million loan will be from ADB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and will have a 20-year term, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The $50 million CTF loan financing will come with a 40 year term. 

The project will improve the capacity and efficiency of interstate transmission networks, particularly in transmitting the electricity generated from the new solar parks to the national grid. Apart from the evacuation of 2,500 megawatts(MW) of power from solar parks in Bhadla, Rajastha, and 700 MW from Banaskantha, Gujarat, POWERGRID is also including two additional subprojects that will increase solar power generation by 4.2 gigawatt and lessen carbon emissions by over 7 million tons every year.

India and the UK announced the launch of an Early Market Engagement for the joint UK-India Fund, namely a Green Growth Equity Fund which aims to leverage private sector investment from the City of London to invest in green infrastructure projects in India. 

 

Both governments reaffirmed their commitment to anchor invest up to £120 million each (i.e. totally £ 240 million) in the joint fund which will be established under the NIIF framework. To begin with, the fund aims to raise around £500 million, with the potential to unlock much more in future. This was announced at the bilateral meeting between Shri Arun Jaitley, the Hon’ble  Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs, Government of India, and Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Government of UK in Delhi yesterday. The two Finance Ministers announced that initial investments will focus on India’s rapidly growing green energy and renewable market and that a Fund Manager is expected to be selected in the next few months. Progress will be accelerated through early market engagement via the publication of a blueprint, with the aim to identify additional and complementary sectors for fund investments.

Following is the full Text of the Joint statement made by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Philip Hammond and the Finance Minister of India Shri Arun Jaitley at the 9th UK-India Economic and Financial Dialogue held here today inDelhi

 

“We, the Finance Ministers of the UK and India, met here today in Delhi for the 9th round of Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD). At today’s meeting, we discussed how, notwithstanding the UK’s triggering of Article 50, India and the UK can work together to: strengthen our existing economic partnership in order to further boost trade and investment and; build on the bold vision for the India-UK Strategic Partnership set out by our Prime Ministers during Prime Minister May’s November 2016 visit to India.

Global economy and policy responses

We welcome the strength of the economic outlook for both countries. Whilst economic confidence has increased and global growth is forecast to rise in 2017, we recognise that political risk and policy uncertainty in some parts of the world remain heightened and share concerns around policy space to respond to future shocks. The UK and India agree that globalisation has had positive impact on the world, and remain strong advocates for free markets and free trade. We agree that international cooperation is vital to make the global economy work for everyone and address shared global challenges. Both sides commit to work together to strengthen our co-operation in the G20, IMF, World Bank and other multilateral bodies to that end.

 The UK and India share a common commitment to addressing cross-border tax evasion and avoidance and agree to collaborate in determining the status of wealth deposited in foreign financial accounts by nationals of both countries. We look forward to enhanced cooperation in this area. The two sides encourage timely implementation of the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project outputs and call on other countries to meet their commitments. The UK and India have committed to the Common Reporting Standards on Automatic Exchange of Tax Information and will begin to exchange information in 2017.

              We also support work to strengthen the Global Financial Safety Net, with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We urge all members to work towards the IMF completing the 15th General Review of Quotas by Spring or no later than the Annual Meetings of 2019. We will also work with the World Bank to ensure progress of commitments under the Forward Look as per the roadmap agreed at the 2015 Annual Meetings. We recognise the importance of international cooperation on financial stability, and remain committed to supporting the implementation of agreed reforms under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board and Basel Committee of Banking Supervision. We also look forward to finalising the remaining elements of the regulatory framework.

 India and the UK reiterate their concern at the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and underline the need to explore evidence-based ways to mitigate resistance. Both sides agreed to work together to ensure effective implementation of FATF’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards globally.

 India and the UK have agreed to continue sharing economic knowledge and expertise, including through the India-UK Economic Policy and Prosperity Partnership (EPPP). Under this Partnership Programme, both countries welcomed the success of the first annual Exchange Programme between officials from the Indian Economic Service and UK Government Economic Service. They committed to developing EPPP so that it further deepens institutional ties and helps to improve economic policymaking in both countries. It is proposed to co-host an economic conference in India this year, which will provide a forum for exchanging ideas and taking forward shared priorities.

 The UK and India also welcomed the selection of the first Chevening Standard Chartered Financial Services Fellows - eight top Indian financial services leaders of the future - who will attend an eight week intensive course in financial services in London in the spring; and the inauguration of the IMF’s South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre (SARTTAC) in February 2017. India and the UK are both founder members of this centre. This centre will further strengthen macroeconomic and financial capacity. 

Trade and investment 

The trade and investment relationship between India and the UK is flourishing and continues to expand and deepen. We reaffirmed our Prime Ministers’ commitment to building the ‘Closest possible commercial and economic relationship’.

 We reviewed progress made since Prime Minister May’s visit to India in November 2016. In particular, we noted the success of the Joint Working Group on trade, which held its second meeting between senior officials in March 2017. Both sides were encouraged by the work of the Joint Trade Review, which seeks to identify steps to strengthen our trade relationship, now and as the UK leaves the EU.

 Investment is a particularly important part of this economic and commercial partnership. The UK and India reaffirmed non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investors and committed to ensure an environment in which investors can continue to invest with confidence. The UK and India agreed to work together swiftly to encourage sustainable bilateral investment that benefits both countries, including through the Joint Working Group.

 Both sides welcomed the recent launch of a Fast Track investment promotion mechanism, which provides a single window to help UK companies when establishing and expanding their business in India.

Improving the business environment

 We are committing to taking forward measures to improve the regulatory environment in India, following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in November 2016. Reforms in India, including the GST and Insolvency legislation, are significant steps towards improved business conditions in India. Both sides welcomed UK's support to India in implementing these reforms, drawing upon the UK's experience to share knowledge, best practices and build capacity in areas including regulation, Insolvency and tax administration.

 The UK and India recognise the social and economic benefits of a dynamic, vibrant and balanced national Intellectual Property regime including as a driver for growth. Both countries exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding to commence bilateral cooperation in November 2016 and look forward to now agreeing to a work plan setting out a range of bilateral activities aimed at improving administration, outreach, use and enforcement of IP.

Financial services relationship

 Both governments welcomed the impressive progress by the India-UK Financial Partnership (IUKFP), under its co-chairs Mr Uday Kotak and Sir Gerry Grimstone, since its establishment as part of the 2014 Economic and Financial Dialogue. The two Finance Ministers recognised the success of this government initiated and private-sector led partnership in deepening links between our countries and generating commercial opportunities for both sides. Both sides welcomed the publication of further reports on financial inclusion, responsible shareholder engagement, rupee internationalisation and green finance. The Finance Ministers also agreed to renew the IUKFP’s mandate and looked forward to future papers on bank restructuring, fintech, disinvestment, India-UK trade and investment relationship – recommendations from financial and professional services – and ease of doing business in financial and professional services.

 Recognising the crucial role of insurance and reinsurance to manag

​e complex risks in the economic system, the UK and India welcomed the opening of Lloyd’s of London’s first Indian branch to underwrite re-insurance business. Both sides also agreed to work to boost cooperation and collaboration between the regulatory authorities and industries in both countries to foster sharing of best practices.

 Both sides recognised the importance of developing strong pension systems, agreeing that India and UK can share experiences in this area.

Financing India’s growth

 Both sides recognised London’s position as the world’s leading financial centre and the crucial role its markets will continue to play in raising capital for investment in India. We applauded the successful issuances by HDFC (INR 3,000 crore or £366 million) and NTPC (INR 2,000 crore or £244 million), the first ever masala bonds to be issued by Indian entities. Both sides also welcomed the issuance in London by the Canadian province British Columbia, the first foreign sub-national entity to issue rupee-denominated bonds. 

 The two Finance Ministers welcomed that the proposal of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to issue a Masala Bond in London in next few months. They also welcomed IREDA’s plans to issue a green bond in London and list their masala bonds on the London Stock Exchange within six months. They also looked forward to other Indian entities, including Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and Indian Railway Finance Corporation(IRFC) preparing to issue Masala Bonds in London in the coming months.

 Given the increasingly important role the rupee will play in the global economy in years to come, we also welcomed the City of London Corporation’s establishment of a Rupee Initiative to bring together market experts and leverage the UK’s position as the world’s number one foreign exchange centre to further develop this market.

 The two Finance Ministers were pleased with the strong progress being made to establish the joint India-UK fund under the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). Technical Assistance from the UK has played an important role in the initial phase of the NIIF and in establishing its readiness to raise and manage funds. The joint UK-India fund aims to leverage private sector investment from the City of London to finance Indian infrastructure projects. Both governments reaffirmed their commitment to anchor invest up to £120 million each in the joint fund which aims to raise around £500 million, and has the potential to unlock much more in future. The two Finance Ministers announced that the fund will focus initial investments on India’s rapidly growing energy and renewables market and that a fund manager is expected to be selected by the Autumn. Progress will be accelerated by starting the process of appointing a fund manager now with early market engagement via the publication of a blueprint, with the aim to identify additional and complementary sectors for fund investments.

 The UK and India recognised the importance of combating climate change, supporting the mobilisation of finance from a variety of sources, instruments and channels to mitigate its effects alongside generating economic opportunities. We welcome the work of the G20 Green Finance Study Group promoting green finance and encouraging the issuance of green bonds, among other forms of green finance, to aid this objective. The UK welcomed India’s efforts to promote green finance, including the steps taken by the Securities and Exchange Board of India by issuing a concept paper on issuance of Green Bonds and the issuance of the first ever green masala bond by an Indian entity, NTPC. As such we agreed to set up a Forum to share experiences and best practices, with representation from the RBI, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Power, Ministry of Renewable Energy, SEBI, Bank of England and HM Treasury, with a view to extending membership in due course.

 The Ministerial India-UK Energy for Growth Dialogue on April 7th, 2017 will identify further opportunities for the UK to engage in the India's highly successful green finance sector.

Developments in FinTech

 The UK and India highlighted the vital role of technology in improving the provision of accessible, secure, high-quality financial services. In an era of unprecedented technological change, FinTech can improve outcomes for consumers, increase financial inclusion, and monitor and stem flows of black money. Both sides recognised the important role that FinTech will play in supporting both Digital India and Make in India, particularly following India’s move towards a less cash society.

 Both sides agreed to deepen bilateral collaboration on FinTech and explore the possibility of a regulatory cooperation agreement between the FCA and the RBI in the second quarter of 2017, which will enable the regulators to share information about financial services innovations in their respective markets, including emerging trends and regulatory issues. The feasibility of a UK-India FinTech Bridge would also be explored.

 Both sides welcomed the FinTech delegation joining the Chancellor in India and highlighted the major India-UK Fintech Conference due to take place in Mumbai on 5 April,2017.

 The UK and India look forward to the next dialogue in London in 2018.

                Section 10(38) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’), prior to its amendment by Finance Act, 2017, provided that the income arising by way of a transfer of long term capital asset, being equity share in a company, shall be exempt from tax if such transfer is undertaken after 1st October, 2004 and chargeable to Securities Transaction Tax (STT) under Chapter VII of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004.

 

In order to curb the practice of declaring unaccounted income as exempt long term capital gain by entering into sham transactions, the Finance Act, 2017 amended the provisions of section 10 (38) of the Act to provide that exemption under this section for income arising on transfer of equity share acquired or on after 1st day of October, 2004 shall be available only if the acquisition of share is chargeable to STT. However, to protect the exemption for genuine cases where the STT could not have been paid like acquisition of share in IPO, FPO, bonus or rights issue by a listed company acquisition by non-resident in accordance with FDI policy of the Government etc, it was also provided that the Central Government shall notify the acquisition for which the condition of chargeability to STT shall not apply.

 

 In view of the above, it is proposed to notify that the condition of chargeability to STT shall not apply to all transactions of acquisitions of equity shares entered into on or after the first day of October, 2004 other than the specified transactions. In order to have wider consultation in this matter, the draft of notification proposed to be issued under section10 (38) of the Act has been uploaded on the website www.incometaxindia.gov.in. The stakeholders are requested to submit their comments/suggestions on the draft notification by 11th April, 2017 at the email address dirtpl2[at]nic[dot]in.

Following is the text of the opening remarks of Shri Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance at the Curtain Raiser Event of the 52nd Annual Meeting of African Development Bank (AfDB), 2017 in New Delhi today:

 

“

·         Mr. J N Singh, Chief Secretary, Government of Gujarat,

·         Ambassadors of African Missions in India,

·         Representatives of FICCI and CII,

·         Colleagues from the Government of India and Government of Gujarat,  

·         Ladies and Gentlemen,

 

It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for me to address you in the backdrop of the upcoming 52nd Annual Meetings of the African Development Bank. I am thankful to the African Development Bank for having given the opportunity to us to host the Annual Meetings of the Bank.

 

I would like to inform you that we have requested Hon’ble Prime Minister of India to inaugurate the Annual Meetings of the Bank.

 

As you are aware, India and Africa share a great relationship, and have a great degree of commonalities in terms of a shared history, and current challenges. In the recent past, we have taken a number of initiatives to further deepen our association.

 

India Africa Forum Summit 2015 was a great success. The announcement of a US$ 10 billion line of credit by the Prime Minister of India marked a new beginning in our approach to engage with African countries in a more constructive manner.

 

India’s support through lines of credit have not only helped finance the projects in African countries, but have also contributed to capacity building, IT education, and higher education.

 

While Annual Meetings of the bank this year would be another opportunity to discuss the issues facing the regional member countries, we are looking forward to leverage this occasion to further deepen our economic cooperation with the African countries through various other events that have been planned.

 

On the occasion of the Annual Meetings, we are organizing an India-Africa Dialogue in partnership with Confederation of Indian Industries. The sessions would primarily focus on Agriculture, Healthcare, e-Governance, Renewable energy, Skill development and education, and Manufacturing.

 

Government of India is also organizing an exhibition in partnership with FICCI during the Annual Meetings of the Bank with the objective to showcase the capabilities of Indian companies in terms of technology, innovation, and start-ups, which could be relevant for African countries. The theme of the exhibition is centred around priority areas of the Bank, i.e., the “High 5s” (Energy, Healthcare and Pharma, Agriculture, Industrialization, e-Governance ect). We are confident that this exhibition, where a wide spectrum of industry leaders from India will showcase their technology and enterprise would be of a great value to your country.

 

I am happy to note that the theme of AfDB Annual Meetings this year is “Transforming Agriculture for wealth creation in Africa”. As a country, where a majority of population lives in rural areas, and is still dependent upon agriculture for their livelihoods, India attached a great importance to rural development and agricultural transformation.

 

We have undertaken a number of new initiatives to transform the agricultural landscape: such as setting up a target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022, a new crop insurance scheme, Prime Minister Agriculture Irrigation Scheme, integration through an electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) etc. combined with 100% rural electrification by 2018, Prime Minister Rural Roads Scheme, and our financial inclusion scheme; such initiatives have a potential to transform the rural settings.

 

Therefore, there is a great scope for a greater synergy between India and Africa in order to achieve our shared goal of rural and agricultural transformation, which would go a long way in reducing rural poverty and improving the quality of lives of rural people.

 

Through our seminars and exhibitions during the annual meetings of the Bank, we would showcase some of these initiatives, which would be of great interest to your country. 

 

I am happy to inform that India has taken a lead in establishing an International Solar Alliance, and is working closely to get it ratified soon. I am sure, we can explore the possibilities of mutual cooperation in this area, which is fast becoming a dependable source of energy, and both India and Africa have a great advantage here.   

 

Healthcare is another area, where our exhibition and India-Africa dialogue would seek to open new avenues for enhanced cooperation between India and Africa. Considering that a number of African countries are keen to leverage India’s affordable and state-of-the-art healthcare facilities, I am sure this would interest you all.

 

The purpose of these events is primarily to reinforce our shared commitment, and further deepen our cooperation framework. Given the perfect alignment between Bank’s priorities and India’s growth experience and engagement with Africa, there is tremendous potential for collaboration.

 

It is for us as policy planners and administrators, in partnership with the captains of industry, to come together and create a conducive environment for a deeper engagement with each other. I am confident that the deliberations during the AMs will prepare the stage for a more constructive and collaborative engagement.  

 

I would, therefore, request the Ambassadors from the African countries present here today to help us create a widespread awareness in your respective countries, especially about the initiatives and programmes that we have planned for the delegates and participants, and encourage a wider participation for these events. ”

Following is the text of the opening remarks of Shri Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance of India at the meeting of the Finance Ministers of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) countries today:

 

“

·         His Excellency, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, Finance Minister of Bangladesh, 

·         His Excellency, Lyonpo Namgay Dorji, Finance Minister of Bhutan, 

·         His Excellency, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Finance Minister of Nepal, 

·         His Excellency, Ravi Karunanayake, Finance Minister of Sri Lanka;

·         Hon’ble Finance Minister of India,

·         Mr. Ahmed Mazin, Permanent Director, Government of Maldives,

·         Ms. Nwe Nwe Win, Director General, Government of Myanmar,

·         Mr. Wencai Zhang, Vice President (Operations), Asian Development Bank,

·         Officials from ADB, Government of India and State Governments,

·         Ladies and Gentlemen;

 

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you on the occasion of launch of the SASEC Vision.  As you are aware, Myanmar has kindly decided to join the SASEC group, and has become a full member of SASEC.  We are thankful to the Government of Myanmar, and welcome them to the Group.

 

I thank ADB for facilitating the launch of the SASEC Vision, and welcome them to this event.

 

In May 2016, the SASEC member countries endorsed a SASEC Operational Plan 2016-2025, which shapes the strategic objectives and operational priorities for the Group.  This is the first-ever long term plan to guide SASEC’s operational priorities in the three sectors of cooperation – transport, trade facilitation and energy --- as well as economic corridor development as a new area of focus. 

 

SASEC member countries decided that a Vision should be developed to frame the SASEC program in the larger context of collective growth and development objectives of the participating countries. A confluence of factors bodes well for the realization of this collective vision— SASEC: Powering Asia in the 21st Century. This collective vision would be achieved through regional cooperation that focuses on generating synergies between three levers—natural resources, industrial potential, and connectivity. 

 

The decision of the SASEC countries to develop a Vision for the Group marks a turning point in SASEC’s journey. The Vision document:

-        Articulates the shared aspiration of the SASEC countries and the broad strategies to attain them; and specific interventions will largely be driven by participating countries themselves

-        Identifies economic sectors/industries where regional synergies can be generated among SASEC countries 

-        Estimates the macro-impact of potential regional synergies that have been identified 

 

The gains realized from over a decade and a half of fruitful collaboration have laid solid foundation for the SASEC countries to work together for:

-        Enhancing market connectivity beyond physical connectivity

-        Designing policy initiatives at home to generate positive externalities beyond national borders 

-        Intensifying engagement with the private sector as a key growth driver 

 

I am happy to note that ADB has facilitated an extensive national consultation process, where key stakeholders of SASEC countries had participated actively in the formulation of the Vision. The Vision will integrate national efforts with regional initiatives within a coherent framework of cooperation.  These synergies are expected to generate a combined annual output of approximately $70  billion, and an additional cumulative employment of nearly 20 million by 2025, of which, about 9 million would be direct employment in the sub-region.

 

Moving forward, the Vision will be implemented through a process of active bilateral and regional cooperation. Today’s event will mark the beginning of a new chapter of regional cooperation and integration in South Asia. We will work together to realize our potential that will help develop this sub-region as one of the leaders in Asia.

 

Thank You.”

                Following is the text of “Summary of the Joint Ministerial Statement” delivered by the Union Minister of Finance of India Shri Arun Jaitley, who chaired the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Finance Ministers’ meeting today:

“In the Joint Ministerial Statement (JMS), we recall the SASEC Program’s journey, from its establishment in 2001 to the present. Now comprising seven members, we welcome Myanmar as the newest member, to play a key role in linking South Asia with Southeast and East Asia.

We recall the gains of the program - in terms of improved transport connectivity, better trade facilitation, and enhanced electricity trade and energy security. The recently adopted SASEC Operational Plan, 2016-2025, further sharpens the strategies and priorities in these areas and for economic corridor development.

Our collective Vision is for SASEC to power Asia in the 21st Century, sustaining growth that synergizes the subregion’s natural resources, industry and infrastructure potentials through enhanced cooperation. This can possibly generate incremental $70 billion GDP and 20 million employment annually by 2025.

We direct the SASEC Nodal Officials to develop a Road Map to implement the Vision in a participatory and consultative manner. We note recent hard and soft initiatives in support of the Vision, the pursuit of which will be a means to achieve our Sustainable Development Goals - spreading the benefits of growth and delivering better social services to remote and poor communities. Our unwavering commitment to SASEC cooperation will help us realize our Vision of powering Asia in the 21st century.

We recognize the important role of the Asian Development Bank in supporting SASEC, and look forward to strengthening this partnership, as well as improving our engagement with other regional programs such as BIMSTEC, ASEAN and SAARC.

On behalf of the Finance Ministers and Heads of Delegations present here today, I hereby declare the Joint Ministerial Statement earlier considered, as formally adopted by this Meeting of the Honorable Ministers of Finance of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and Heads of Delegations of Maldives and Myanmar, held here in New Delhi, India, on this Monday, the 3rd of April 2017.”

                We, the Minister of Finance of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; the Minister of Finance of the Kingdom of Bhutan; the Minister of Finance, Defence and Corporate Affairs of the Republic of India; the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal; the Minister of Finance and Planning of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka; the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Republic of Maldives; and the Director General of the Ministry of Planning and Finance of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, met in New Delhi, India on 3 April 2017 to discuss the imperatives of a new way forward for subregional economic cooperation among our countries under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program. 

 

We recall the shared purpose, which laid the foundation for SASEC in 2001 when four countries—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal—agreed to a program of cooperation to accelerate economic growth in the subregion. Adhering to the same purpose, the Maldives and Sri Lanka joined SASEC in 2014, spurring economic cooperation further along strategic sea routes. 

 

We welcome Myanmar, which recently joined the SASEC family. We recognize Myanmar’s important role in linking South Asia, and Southeast and East Asia—a vital imperative in boosting economic activity in Asia in this time of subdued global growth. 

 

We take pride in the significant gains achieved under the SASEC program over the past 16 years, especially in transport, trade facilitation, and energy. Infrastructure connectivity has improved our countries’ access to key markets and gateway ports and improved prospects for participating in regional and global value chains. Trade processes and procedures are becoming more efficient. Electricity trade is making steady progress and helping to promote energy security. To further align and focus our interventions, we adopted the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016-2025, which defines the strategic objectives and operational priorities in transport, trade facilitation, and energy, as well as for economic corridor development. 

 

Notwithstanding the gains we have made so far, we want SASEC to become better, stronger, and faster. South Asia is forecast to be one of the fastest growing subregions in the world. SASEC stands at the threshold of a demographic dividend that can be harnessed to create more employment opportunities, and enhance productivity. Progressive reforms are ongoing. More importantly, we all share the common aspiration for sustainable and inclusive growth, which will ultimately improve our people’s well-being. 

 

We envision SASEC to be powering Asia in the 21st century. We will accelerate and sustain the growth momentum of recent years by unlocking the hitherto untapped potential of the subregion’s natural resources, industry and infrastructure through subregional cooperation. We will leverage natural resource-based industries by tapping into latent industrial demand within the subregion. We will promote subregional industry-to-industry links to develop regional value chains and enhance the subregion’s competitiveness. We will enhance the connectivity within countries and between countries to improve the productivity of economic activities, including trade and tourism. We will take advantage of our common heritage and cultural ties to improve people-to-people contact. We will develop gateways and hubs to expand the subregion’s trade and commerce to regional and global markets. We believe that these synergies can generate annually, an estimated $70 billion in incremental GDP and 20 million in incremental aggregate employment by 2025. 

 

We are pleased that our SASEC vision and strategy has identified potential flagship initiatives, which could unleash new opportunities in various sectors across natural resources, industry, infrastructure and tourism. We instruct the SASEC Nodal Officials to undertake the necessary consultations on the potential synergies identified by the SASEC vision document with the view to formulating a road map for implementing the SASEC Vision. 

 

We applaud recent efforts to contribute to the SASEC Vision. SASEC road connectivity projects in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal are under way to help strengthen transborder trade; and industrial, social, and cultural exchange among them. India and Nepal are also exploring to pilot an electronic cargo tracking system to improve transit facilitation between them. We are encouraged to know that several capacity building activities are ongoing and planned to improve the capacity of customs officials in accordance with international standards and best practices using the expertise in the subregion and within the framework of South-South Cooperation. We hope that ongoing efforts to promote mutually beneficial exchanges of gas and petroleum between our countries would succeed to realize significant savings and help ensure energy security. 

 

We will ensure that SASEC’s pursuit of becoming Asia’s economic powerhouse will also be a journey to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Our investments in infrastructure will reach not only to trade gateways, but also to the hinterlands to help improve people’s access to economic opportunities, increase productivity and variety of the goods and services, and provide them with better access to social services. Connectivity between our countries will help promote inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth by connecting remote and landlocked areas to economic centers and providing opportunities for low-income populations. Economic synergies leveraged by the countries in the subregion can potentially create additional employment opportunities and augment government revenue that can support more social expenditures. 

 

We recognize and appreciate the important role that has been played by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in supporting SASEC as secretariat, advisor, and lead financial supporter since 2001. We look forward to further strengthening this fruitful collaboration with ADB as our key development partner to implement the SASEC Vision. We will continue our active engagement with other regional cooperation programs, especially, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This would complement our efforts and promote other beneficial linkages to hasten the process of South Asia’s wider integration with other subregions of Asia. 

 

We greatly appreciate Government of India for the excellent arrangements made for this Meeting, and the gracious hospitality extended to all of us.

 

We believe that now is the time to reinvigorate and deepen SASEC as a key means to accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth, build economic resiliency, and promote shared prosperity. We reaffirm our strong commitment to regional cooperation and integration. Through mutual understanding, enduring goodwill, and unwavering commitment, we are confident that together, we can realize our vision of powering Asia in the 21st century.

“

·         His Excellency, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, Finance Minister of Bangladesh, 

·         His Excellency, Lyonpo Namgay Dorji, Finance Minister of Bhutan, 

·         His Excellency, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Finance Minister of Nepal, 

·         His Excellency, Ravi Karunanayake, Finance Minister of Sri Lanka;

·         Mr. Ahmed Mazin, Permanent Director, Government of Maldives,

·         Ms. Nwe Nwe Win, Director General, Government of Myanmar,

·         Mr. Wencai Zhang, Vice President (Operations), Asian Development Bank,

·         Officials from ADB, Government of India and State Governments,

·         Ladies and Gentlemen;

 

It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for us to launch a vision for the SASEC initiative. In the last 16 years, SASEC initiative has made a significant progress in developing regional cooperation and integration. I am happy to know that the SASEC member countries have come forward to identify opportunities and synergies, which would help us better harness our immense potential in all fields.  

 

Today, we welcome Myanmar, the newest member of the SASEC. With Myanmar joining this initiative, SASEC will facilitate a credible link between South Asia and South East Asia. 

 

The SASEC initiative, supported by an Operational Plan, and now guided by a vision, would help the member countries in optimally utilize their resources, and facilitate access to trade gateways and linkages with global markets. Improved connectivity and infrastructure development could substantially spur economic growth in the region. Enhanced cooperation among the member countries would also give an impetus to small and medium enterprises in the region. Collaboration in knowledge sharing would facilitate innovation and research.   

 

Following the Leaders' Retreat hosted by India in Goa in October 2016, BIMSTEC is pursuing a vigorous Agenda for Action to enhance connectivity, trade and commerce and people - to – people contacts in our region and promote socio-economic development which are our shared objectives. We are also part of a number of other regional initiatives such as Indian Ocean Rim- Association of Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC), BCIM, SAARC, Mekong-Ganga Initiative that have significance in South Asia. Our neighbours are also part of one or more such regional groupings. 

The SASEC vision, complemented by the Operational Plan, would help the member countries overcome the problems and challenges associated with unemployment, macroeconomic and structural vulnerabilities, access and integration, and limited investment and growth. 

 

India is following a policy of ‘Act East’ to improve connectivity and relations with countries of South East Asia and East Asia. Our policy will definitely receive a fillip with Myanmar’s participation in SASEC. Improved access to gateway ports particularly in Bangladesh and Myanmar may help unleash the latent potential of agro and forest based industries in India’s North East region. 

 

India’s “Sagar mala” initiative along the coastal States also aims to promote port-led direct and indirect development and provide infrastructure to and from ports quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. The “Bharat mala” programme of India aims at developing robust and credible road links in the border areas to provide last-mile connectivity to major border points and trade routes connecting our neighbours.

 

Power trade in the sub region also presents a significant opportunity with gains and savings for the member countries, and may collectively help us move towards our energy security goals. We have developed a power transmission link with Bangladesh through which we are supplying 500 MW of electricity to Bangladesh. We are also engaged with Bangladesh to develop transmission link to the eastern part of the country.

 

Power trade between India and Bhutan has a long history. With Nepal, we are building new cross-border power transmission lines to help in the distribution of electricity from power projects being developed in Nepal. I am confident we will be able to fully harness the hydropower potentials of the region and act as a bridge connecting power surplus and power deficient regions. 

 

We need to stand together in times of crisis. India has always played a pro-active role to support the neighbours. In the face of the recent earthquake in Nepal or tsunami in Sri Lanka or cyclone in Bangladesh in last decade, it has always a matter of great happiness for us to lend a helping hand to rebuild and rehabilitate affected people. Last year, during the visit of Hon’ble Prime Minister of Nepal to India, both countries signed a credit line agreement of USD 750 million for post-earthquake reconstruction. 

 

We have undertaken a number of initiatives bilaterally. India-Bangladesh standard operating procedure on coastal shipping, Bilateral Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWTT), India-Nepal MoU for project management consultancy services for upgradation/ improvement of road infrastructure in Terai of Nepal, India-Sri Lanka agreements on developing Trincomalee as a petroleum hub, on building and improving railway network in the island country are some of the recent examples of bilateral cooperation.

 

The SASEC Vision has set the stage for an increased cooperation among us going forward. I am sure the combined strength of the Group would lead to a greater synergy and help us transform the economic landscape of the region. I wish the initiative a great success.”

The Central Government is concerned at prevailing drought situation in the States of  Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. After the receipt of detailed memoranda from these States, Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT) were deputed to visit the drought affected areas for the spot assessment of the calamity. The High Level Committee (HLC) had recommended the quantum of assistance to the States based on the extant norms of assistance and the report of the IMCT.
 
Based on the approval of the High Level Committee (HLC), the Central Government has sanctioned Rs.1793.63 crore to State of Tamil Nadu and Rs.1,782.44 crore to State of Karnataka for drought relief from NDRF. 
 
Based on the above sanctions, a sum of Rs.1447.99 crore has been released to the State of Tamil Nadu by the Central Government from NDRF after adjusting Rs.345.64 crore available with the State as balance in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
 
For State of Karnataka, after adjusting Rs.96.92 crore available with the State as balance in the SDRF and earlier release of Rs.450 crore by the Central Government, sum of Rs.1,235.52 crore has been released from NDRF.
 
The HLC has also advised the State Governments to take utmost care and ensure that all the individual beneficiary-oriented assistance are mandatorily disbursed through the bank account of the beneficiaries. 
Further, the Central Government has released Rs.264.11 crore from NDRF for providing the Central assistance to the State of Tamil Nadu for the cyclonic storm ‘Vardha’ during December, 2016. This amount has been approved by the HLC on the basis of the report of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team sent by the Central Government to assess the damage.
 
These releases are over and above the releases made to States as devolution of 42% of Central Taxes as per the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission. For the year 2016-17, a sum of Rs.6.08 lakh crore has been released to all States as devolution of Central Taxes. Tamil Nadu has received Rs.24,538 crore and Karnataka has received Rs.28,750 crore under devolution formula during 2016-17.
 
During 2016-17, the Central Government has also provided Rs.48,869 crore to all the States as grant for Rural and Urban Local Bodies to primarily meet the requirement of  basic necessities for people living in these areas.
 
For the benefit of farmers, Rs.13,240 crore has been provided under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana (PMFBY) in 2016-17.
 
Also, Rs.2,45,435 crore has been provided under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) for transfer to the States from the Central Government during 2016-17. This includes Rs.47,499 crore for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which is used for employment generation and water conservation works.
 
In view of onset of the summer season, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has instructed that in the next three months, all the States should focus on water conservation related works by utilizing the funds available under various Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and MGNREGS etc.

                Minister of Food Processing Industries Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal today held an Interaction with promoters of newly-allotted Integrated Cold Chain Projects in New Delhi. Addressing them, the Minister emphasized the need to set up Integrated Cold Chain Projects on war scale in the country for all-round development of India and for fast-tracking transformation of the Indian economy.

Smt. Badal said given the challenge of post-harvest losses which currently are Rs.92,000 crores annually, the facilities set up by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries like 42 Mega Food Parks and 234 Cold Chain Projects (including 101 newly sanctioned Cold Chain Projects) have created preserving and processing capacity of 139 lakh Metric Tonnes of Agro Produce with a value of Rs.35,000 crores which means that setting up of these Cold Chain Projects and Mega Food Parks already undertaken would reduce post harvest losses substantially. She said apart from reducing wastage, the projects will generate employment for 3.5 lakh persons and benefit 15 lakh farmers.

The Minister also informed about the steps being taken by the Ministry to build a strong, efficient and integrated supply chain for agri-produce involving backward linkages with the farm, processing to add value to the farmer’s produce and creation of forward linkages through organised modern retail.

Formulation and implementation of a National Food Processing Policy is also under consideration of the Ministry. The vision of the Policy is to position India as a World Food Factory by creating an enabling framework for the sustainable growth of the food processing industry. The Policy is based on the principle of inclusive growth in partnership with the States with the overarching goal of providing remunerative return to farmers. The model Food Processing Policy focuses development of clusters based on production strength of different region to enable a targeted and coordinated approach for developing the food processing industry and bringing down wastages. As a step in this direction, the Ministry proposes to undertake mapping of areas of fruits &vegetables and other perishable production in different States with the target to set up agro processing clusters.

To achieve the vision of National Food Processing Policy,the Ministry will be shortly launching a revamped National Mission on Food Processing called SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Produce Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) to complete theon-going Mega Food Parks, take up more cold chain and also to launch 3 new schemes – Creation/Expansion of Food Processing and Preservation Capacities, New Agro-Processing Clusters and Backward and Forward Linkages.

Shri J P Nadda also announced the finalization of India’s comprehensive and multi-sectoral National Action Plan at the function. Shri Ram Vila Paswan, Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Smt. Anupriya Patel, MoS (Health & Family Welfare) were also present. The Ministers later signed a ‘Delhi Declaration’ for collectively strategizing to contain AMR. It pledges to adopt a holistic and collaborative approach towards prevention and containment of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in India. It calls on all stakeholders including UN, WHO, FAO and other UN agencies, civil society organizations etc., to support the development and implementation of the national and state action plans on AMR. 

Shri J P Nadda said that under the guidance of the Hon. Prime Minister who has stressed on the need to converge actions across ministries and departments and not work in silos, so as to not have segmented outcome: “We are working in the direction of pulling out malaise of AMR from the root. Health Ministry is at the receiving end as there are various layers and every layer needs to be addressed”. He further added that the action plan has been prepared through extensive national consultations with various stakeholders. “In alignment with global action plan, India’s action plan has objectives of enhancing awareness, strengthening surveillance, improving rational use of antibiotics, reducing infections and promoting research. In addition, India aims to support neighbouring countries in collective fight against infectious diseases,” Shri Nadda elaborated. 

Acknowledging the progress made by the Government in combating AMR, Shri Nadda said that Health Ministry has taken a lead in this effort at international fora and has initiated series of actions including setting up a National Surveillance System for AMR, enacted regulations (Schedule-H-1) to regulate sale of antibiotics, brought out National Guidelines for use of antibiotics etc. He further said that more efforts are required considering the large size of our country, magnitude of the problem and the fact that AMR needs to be addressed comprehensively under “One Health Approach”. 

“This is a landmark occasion”, said the Union Minister for Health. “We are ready with a blueprint that meets global expectations. The challenge now is in its efficient implementation through a coordinated approach at all levels of use of antibiotics,” he added. Shri Nadda urged all State Governments to develop state-specific action plans and assured them of all possible assistance. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, stated that the Environment Ministry is conscious of the AMR threat and shall contribute in every possible way. Shri Ram Vila Paswan, Minister of Consumer Affairs, highlighted the ill effects of irresponsible use of antibiotics, food adulteration, excessive insecticides, and pesticides, fungicides on human and animal health. Shri Paswan stressed on the need for creating more awareness among masses and strict laws against adulteration. Smt. Anupriya Patel, MoS (Health & Family Welfare) stated that collective strike and collaborative effort is needed as singular effort shall have limited impact.

With a view to eliminating leprosy from the country, a three-pronged strategy has been adopted for early detection of leprosy cases in the community during 2016-17:

i. Leprosy Case Detection Campaign for high endemic districts.

ii. Focused Leprosy Campaign for hot spots.

iii. Specific plan for Case Detection in Hard to reach areas.

All detected cases of leprosy are provided standard treatment in accordance with programme guidelines. For National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), funds are provided to States/UTs under the National Health Mission. A budget provision of Rs. 46.00 crore has been made for NLEP for the Financial Year 2017-18.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas (2015), 69.2 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes representing 8.7% of adults aged 20- 79 years in India. As per Indian Council of Medical Research’s ICMR-INDAB Study on the prevalence of diabetes, the results available from 15 States/UTs indicate that overall prevalence of Diabetes varies from 4% to 13%. As per the National Family Health Survey-4 2015-16, in the age group of 15-49 years, 5.8% women and 8.0% men in India have blood sugar higher than 140 mg/dl.

Public Health being a State subject, the primary responsibility of supply of medicines free of cost or at subsidized rates to the patients lies with the State/UT Governments. Provisioning of drugs and diagnostics is supported under National Health Mission (NHM) and National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) based on the proposals submitted by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans.

The treatment of diabetic patients both in Central and State Government Hospitals is either free or subsidized.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

Under the RNTCP, Government is committed to end tuberculosis by 2025. The strategies adopted for this purpose include strengthening and improving quality of basic TB services, engaging with providers other than public, addressing TB HIV co-infection, other co-morbidities and programmatic management of drug resistant TB. Further, targeted interventions in the vulnerable population, integrating newer molecular diagnostics for TB in the health system for early diagnosis of TB, Information Communication Technology (ICT) for notification from private sector, programme monitoring and adherence have also been leveraged as part of the strategies under RNTCP.

The state level incidence for Tuberculosis has not been estimated, however the total case notified across the states in the last three years is at Annexure.

           

The total case notification for the last three years for the state of Rajasthan including that from the private sector has been 95199 in 2014, 102032 in 2015 and 106756 in 2016 respectively.

The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme is being implemented under the aegis of the National Health Mission with the following steps

·         strengthening and improving quality of basic TB services,

·         addressing TB HIV co-infection, other co-morbidities and MDR-TB

·         engaging with care providers both in the public and the private sector

·         targeted intervention in the vulnerable population and strengthening urban TB control along with active case finding activities

·         integrating newer molecular diagnostics for TB  in the health system (CBNAAT) for early diagnosis of MDR TB

·         leveraging of Information Communication Technology for enhancing TB notification and strengthening of monitoring.

According to the WHO Global TB Reports, the estimated proportion of Multi- Drug Resistant TB Cases in India is not increasing. The proportion of MDR cases is estimated to be in between 1.9 – 2.6 percent among new TB cases and between 11- 19 percent among retreatment cases.

However, the detection of MDR-TB/XDR-TB cases has been increasing due to availability of more diagnostic facilities for MDR TB/XDR-TB and coverage of the entire country through Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP).

           

Cases of Multi Drug Resistant TB detected for Rajasthan for the last three years are 2050 in 2014, 1930 in 2015 and 2118 for 2016 respectively.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the performance of Primary Health Centres (PHCs) is to be monitored by the State Governments. However, various public health facilities, including PHCs are regularly monitored and evaluated through Health Management Information System (HMIS). Further, Common Review Missions (CRMs) also undertake a review of National Health Mission (NHM) annually, that inter-alia includes review of functioning of PHCs. 

To encourage States to tone up the public health system, the Government is providing incentives to States based on functionality achieved by various public health facilities including District Hospitals, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres etc. and grading of the facilities based on indicators including availability of health Human Resource (HR), basic diagnostics, medicines for the patients etc. 

Public health and hospitals is a State subject. However, under NHM, technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their health facilities, including PHCs, as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). This includes support for engagement of health HR, drugs and equipment, infrastructure, diagnostics, MIS systems etc. This support is provided based on the requirement proposed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans. The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                As per National family Health Survey (NFHS-IV 2015-16), institutional delivery in rural areas is 75.1%. Data on Institutional delivery being conducted in rural areas is not being captured through survey data on a yearly basis. As per data available through National Family Health Survey (NFHS), Institutional delivery in rural areas has increased from 31.1% in 2005-06(NFHS-III) to 75.1% in 2015-16(NFHS-IV). 

The key strategies and interventions being implemented to universalize the facility of institutional delivery in the country is given below: 

Under National Health Mission, the key steps taken by Government of India to universalize the facility of institutional delivery in the country are: 

• Promotion of institutional deliveries through Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), a conditional cash transfer scheme. 

• Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) entitles all pregnant women delivering in public health institutions to absolutely free and no expense delivery, including caesarean section. Similar entitlements have been put in place for all sick infants accessing public health institutions for treatment. 

• Operationalization of Sub-Centers, Primary Health Centers, Community Health Centers and District Hospitals for providing 24x7 basic and comprehensive obstetric care. 

• Capacity building of health care providers in basic and comprehensive obstetric care with a strategic initiative “Dakshata” to enable service providers in providing high quality services during childbirth at the institutions

• Mother and Child Tracking System is being implemented to ensure antenatal, intranatal and postnatal care along-with immunization services. 

• Engagement of more than 9.90 lakh Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) to generate demand and facilitate accessing of health care services by the community. 

• Establishing Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Wings at high caseload facilities to improve the quality of care provided to mothers and children. 

• Newer interventions to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity- Diagnosis & management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism during pregnancy, Training of General Surgeons for performing Caesarean Section, Calcium supplementation during pregnancy and lactation, De-worming during pregnancy, Maternal Near Miss Review, Screening for Syphilis during pregnancy and Dakshata guidelines for strengthening intra-partum care. 

• The Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) has been introduced with the aim of conducting special ANC checkups for pregnant women (in their 2nd / 3rd Trimesters of pregnancy) in the country on 9th of every month by Medical Officer/OBGY specialist in the government health facilities and also through Private sector on voluntary basis for tracking of high risk pregnancy to ensure institutional deliveries. 

• Enhancing the availability of human resources particularly in high priority districts(HPDs) through a slew of measures like - improving retention of specialists, medical officers and nursing personnel particularly in difficult areas through special incentives; hiring of contractual personnel including MOs and Nurses particularly for operationalization of comprehensive RMNCH services at Delivery Points 

• To sharpen the focus on the low performing districts, 184 High Priority Districts (HPDs) have been prioritized for Reproductive Maternal New-born Child Health+ Adolescent (RMNCH+A) interventions for achieving improved maternal and child health outcomes. 

• The government has framed a set of Performance Based Incentives for the human resource working in these HPDs. 

• Referral transport for pregnant women, sick neonates and sick infants is being provided by the States as per their local needs, using different models i.e. 108/102 which include a network of emergency response vehicles using toll free number, government ambulances, available transport under public private partnership etc. 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                “A day of introspection, stock-taking, planning and strategizing for the future. It is day to think how we can move forward after the goalposts we have already achieved,” stated Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare. He was speaking on the occasion of ‘World Health Day’, here today. The Health Minister stated that the focus should be on pluralism, cross references and sharing of various practices covering geriatric, palliative and rehabilitative care,” added Shri Nadda. 

Shri Nadda stated that, as part of its renewed strategy for mental healthcare services, the Government is strengthening PHCs and CHCs. He said that extensive training is being provided to ASHAs and ANMs at PHCs and CHCs so that they can become the transformers, translators and change-makers within the community. Government is also aiding States in building their capacities. Shri Nadda pointed that the aim of the Ministry is to ensure implementation of the Mental Health Policy in letter and spirit, and to establish more institutions such as NIMHANS. Focus is also on working with civil society organizations engaged in mental healthcare. 

The Health Minister informed that the Ministry is undertaking universal health screening in 100 districts for hypertension, diabetes and breast, cervical and oral cancers. He further said that the Ministry has launched free drugs and diagnostics initiative that will benefit poor people in accessing healthcare. “We will strengthen Public Health Centers (PHCs) and around one lakh subcentres will be transformed into wellness centers, 2500 have already been selected for a pilot,” Shri Nadda said. 

Shri Nadda said that this is indeed a happy coincidence that the passing of the Mental Healthcare Bill by Lok Sabha is so closely followed by the celebration of the World Health Day with its theme on Depression. “We are witnessing a historic event in the healthcare sector of our country,” Shri Nadda said. Highlighting the most progressive features of the Bill, Shri Nadda informed that the provision of advance directive, nominated representative, special clause for women and children related to admission, treatment, sanitation and personal hygiene; restriction on use of Electro-Convulsive Therapy and Psychosurgery are steps in the direction. “Decriminalization of suicide is another significant facet of the Bill, which will ensure proper management of severe stress as a precursor for suicide attempts,” Shri Nadda added. 

At the function, Shri J P Nadda also launched the Report Book on the Centre for Well Being at NIMHANS, 2nd Edition of ECT administration manual, Psycho-social care kit for the disabled, Yoga and depression, Mental Health Resource Guide for ASHA, Training Manual for Psychologists and Life Skill Education, Stress Management and Suicide Prevention guide. He also launched the Dashboard for Drugs and Vaccines Distribution Management System (DVDMS). 

Speaking at the event, Shri Faggan Singh Kulaste, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, said that people with mental health issues need to be mainstreamed in society to help them deal with the issues in a more healthy way. 

Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, said that we have the potential within ourselves to fight depression but when it becomes unmanageable we must seek professional help. The Minister informed that according to the WHO estimate depression is the single largest contributor to global disability and it is one of the most common disorders globally. “Depression is multifactorial and every segment of society is affected by this disability, which is worrisome, Smt Anupriya Patel said. She stressed on the importance of connecting, conversing and expressing as integral to beat depression. 

Dr Saumya Swaminathan, Secretary (DHR) and DG (ICMR), said that this is an important time for India when Parliament has passed Mental Healthcare Bill, 2016 and the Cabinet has cleared the National Health Policy, 2017. She informed that suicide is a leading cause of death among young people (between 20-40 years of age) in India along with adolescents (15-19 years of age). She said that this needs introspection and added that we need more research and develop centres for mental and neuro disorders. 

Dr. Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India, said that over the last ten years, depression has increased by 20 percent and depression affects people’s social and professional lives and also affects their productivity. He said that although depression is prevalent, there is stigma attached to it and depression and suicide are closely linked. He stressed on the importance of physical activity for children as this helps to prevent depression.

According to  National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS -3) (2005-06), the  primary source  of health care for 69.5 percent households in urban areas and 62.5 percent households in rural areas was private  healthcare sector. However, recently completed NFHS-4 (2015-16) reveals that for around 52 percent households in urban areas and around 44 percent households in rural areas private sector is the main source of health care when they are sick. In case of Rajasthan, NFHS-4 data indicate that around 36 percent households in urban areas and around 33 percent households in rural areas generally seek healthcare from private sector when household members get sick. Public health being a State subject, the primary responsibility to improve the quality of healthcare services in public health facilities, lies with the State Governments. However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical assistance is provided to the States/UTs to strengthen the health services.  

 

Several steps taken by the Government to further improve healthcare facilities in the public sector include the following: 


	National Quality Assurance Programme has been rolled out to improve quality of care in government health facilities.


 


	‘Kayakalp’ award scheme for transforming public hospital by improving Sanitation, Hygiene, Upkeep, Infection Control Practices and waste management practices has been implemented. All facilities from Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), District Hospitals to central government hospitals are given annual award after assessment on defined criteria.


 


	NHM Free Drugs and Diagnosis Initiatives to reduce cost of care and improve quality in public facilities.


 


	Setting up of New AIIMS Institutions.


 


	Upgradation of district hospitals to medical college hospitals in districts without any medical colleges to improve access to tertiary care within districts.


 


	Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Services Programme to provide free dialysis services to poor in district hospitals.


 


	The Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) to provide quality antenatal care on 9th of every month in government hospitals, with voluntary private sector participation.  


 


	Biomedical Equipment Management & Maintenance Program (BMMP) to ensure uptime of bio-medical equipment in public health facilities.


 

 


	Health and wellness centres to provide comprehensive primary healthcare at Sub-Centre/PHC level.


 


	Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) Specialized machines which enable accurate diagnosis of drug resistant TB within a few hours facilitating diagnosis and treatment of Drug Resistant TB have been set up in 628 districts.


 


	Strengthening the healthcare facilities to Indian Public Health Standards norms with funding under NHM.


 


	Establishing public health facilities in underserved areas.


 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                As per the reports furnished by States/ UTs, less than 50 per cent donated eyes collected under the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are utilized for corneal transplantation.

This is mainly because, all the donated eyes are not found suitable for corneal transplantation due to various medical reasons, like poor quality of collected corneas due to reasons like, age of donor, pre-existing degeneration/diseases etc.   Prior to transplantation, the collected corneas are assessed by transplant surgeons for its suitability for optical keratoplasty by using Specular Microscope.   However, corneas not suitable or fit for optical keratoplasty are utilized either for therapeutic keratoplasty or for training and research purpose. No report about intentional non-use/wastage of donated eyes in Government eye banks/hospitals across the country has been received.

Information, Education and Communication (IEC) is an on-going activity under NPCB to create awareness about eye health including promotion of eye donation to restore vision of corneal blind in the country.  The major steps to promote eye donation are:
•    Educating people about early donation so that eye tissues can be harvested within 4-6 hours of  death of donor and also follow other general precautions like covering eyes of deceased person, switching off the fans etc.;
•    Nation-wide campaign during  annual event – Eye Donation Fortnight from 25th August to 8th September – to promote eye donation;
•    Honouring donor families in the annual functions organized by major eye banks during Eye Donation Fortnight;
•    Continuation of dedicated phone line 1919 (BSNL & MTNL users) automatically linked with the area eye banks in metro cities and new 24x7 toll free No. 1XXX-XX-4770 for organ donation including eye donation;
•    Promotion of eye donation through print and electronic media and a weekly radio programme - “Ankehn Hain Anmol” - aired on FM Gold.

Major Steps taken to strengthen eye banking at Government hospitals/Medical Colleges are as under:
•    Strengthening of Eye Banks located at Medical Colleges by providing essential ophthalmic equipments;
•    Collection of eyes by Eye Banks from willing donors after death and also from those patients who die in hospitals through “Hospital Corneal Retrieval Programme” for timely transplantation of corneas;
•    Appointment of Eye Donation Counsellors in the identified Eye Banks of Medical Colleges/Tertiary care Hospitals to promote eye donation and timely collection of donated eyes;
•    Free supply of preservation and storage medium for donated eyes to Government eye banks all over the country to improve utilization of donated eyes;
•    Provision for in-service training of eye surgeons in eye banking for skill development.

                The manufacturing, sale and distribution of drugs in the country is regulated under the provisions of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945 thereunder through a system of licensing and inspection. Licenses for manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs are granted by the State Licensing Authorities (SLAs) appointed by respective State Governments. SLAs are legally empowered to take action against violation of any provision of the Act and Rules. Further, the pharmaceuticals companies that manufacture drugs are required to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and Good Storage and Distribution Practices (GSP) as per the provision of the said Rules.

 

 

The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare had brought out a new National List of Essential Medicines in 2015 and based on the same, the Department of Pharmaceuticals has revised the Schedule to Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO). The National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals regulates the prices of medicines sold in the country under the DPCO.

 

In order to examine the quality of drugs, samples of drugs are picked up by both the officers of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and State Drugs Control Department regularly. Further, a nation-wide survey (2014-16) has also been conducted in which 47012 samples were tested and analysed from across the country. The percentage of drugs not conforming to the prescribed standards (Not of Standard Quality) has been found to be 3.16% and that of spurious drugs 0.0245%. The prevalence of such drugs, as such, is very low.

 

The Government is committed to ensuring that the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs are not compromised. With this in view, the Government has taken a series of measures including strengthening legal provisions, workshops and training programmes for manufacturers and regulatory officials and measures such as risk based inspections.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Every medicine whether synthetic or natural has a potential risk of causing health hazard, if it is not manufactured properly with assurance of quality, safety and efficacy and not consumed judiciously without adequate medical advice from a qualified medical practitioner. Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and rules thereunder have exclusive provisions for regulation and quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy medicines.  It is mandatory as per the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules 1945 to comply with the Goods Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and the quality standards of AYUSH medicines in terms of their identity, purity and strength as are laid down in the respective pharmacopoeia.

 

Government has accorded exclusive policy support for the growth and development of AYUSH systems.  In this direction, Government has implemented mainstreaming of AYUSH strategy under National Health Mission and National AYUSH Mission to support States for strengthening AYUSH infrastructure and services.

 

Apart from the allopathic and the AYUSH systems of medicine, no other alternative systems of medicine have so far been recognized by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Thus, no precise information with regard to the usage of such systems of medicine in the country is available. Government of India has put in place a mechanism to facilitate consideration of proposals with a view to identifying viable new systems of medicine, if any.

 

Government of India approved and notified Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) on 29.09.2014 which envisages better access to AYUSH services, strengthening of AYUSH educational institutions, facilitate the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU&H) drugs and sustainable availability of ASU&H raw-materials by promotion of medicinal plants in the States/UTs during 12th Plan.  Under NAM, Government of India provides financial assistance to the States/UTs to develop and promote AYUSH System of medicine in the country, State/UT wise through following activities:

          i.            Co-location of AYUSH facilities at Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs).

        ii.            Upgradation of exclusive State Government AYUSH Hospitals and Dispensaries.

      iii.            Setting up of up to 50 bedded integrated AYUSH Hospital.

      iv.            Upgradation of State Government Educational Institutions.

        v.            Setting up of new State Government AYUSH Educational Institutions in the States where it is not available.

      vi.            Strengthening of State Government/Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) Pharmacies and Drug Testing Laboratories (DTL).

 

    vii.            Cultivation and promotion of Medicinal plants.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

Cataract is mainly an age related diseases, which can be controlled by adopting appropriate measures and surgical procedures. Due to increase in population and life expectancy, the number of new cases of Cataract is likely to increase.   

 

However,  NPCB in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is committed to reduce the burden of avoidable blindness in the country including blindness due to cataract to 0.3% by the year 2020 by adopting the following strategies:. 

·         Decentralized implementation of NPCB through State/District Health Societies for close monitoring and supervision;

·         Reduction in the backlog of blind persons by active screening of population above 50 years, organizing eye screening  camps and transporting operable cases to fixed eye-care facilities for operation/treatment;

·         Involvement of private practitioners in eye care services;

·         In-service training to eye surgeons in various fields of ophthalmology to refresh and  develop clinical and surgical skills including Cataract;

·         Strengthening/developing of eye-care infrastructure at various levels to improve quantity and quality of eye-care services;

·         Provision for setting up Multipurpose District Mobile ophthalmic Units in District Hospitals to improve coverage area.

 

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), SmtAnupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the LokSabha here today.

                Since Industry is a State subject, no centralized data regarding setting up of heavy industries in any part of the country is maintained by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). The role of DHI is confined to the administration of a limited number of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. However, these CPSEs take decision to set their units in various parts of the country based on the commercial considerations. Further, Central Government, through M/o Finance, also provides incentives in the direct and indirect tax structure for the growth of industries across the country. However, many States have evolved incentives and schemes for the development and growth of industries and these States encourage setting up of industries as per their priorities and investment climate and details of such nature are only expected to be available with them. At present, DHI has no plan to set up any new industry.

                Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has no information on Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) which have been wound up since, 2014. As per the information available with DPE, 19 CPSEs have been approved for closure since, 2014. The details of these CPSEs, State-wise with location (Registered Office), are given in Annex.

 

CPSEs function under the administrative control of various Ministries/Departments and all matters relating to CPSEs including closure are dealt by the concerned administrative Ministries/Departments. The reasons for closure vary from CPSE to CPSE which may include persistent losses, resource crunch, low productivity, unsustainable business operations, old and obsolete plant & machinery, outdated technology, low capacity utilization, poor debt–equity structure, excess manpower, weak marketing strategies, stiff competition, lack of business plans, heavy interest burden, high input cost,  etc.

 

The interests of the employees are kept in view by the administrative Ministry/Department while formulating closure plans which include provision of VRS, settlement of employee related dues, statutory dues, etc. Further, the Counselling, Retraining & Redeployment (CRR) Scheme of the Government provides opportunities of self/wage employment to the employees or their dependents separated under Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)/ Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) or retrenched due to closure/restructuring of the CPSEs.  The Scheme aims at providing short duration skill development/ entrepreneurship development training programmes to equip the beneficiaries for self/ wage employment.

                Since Industry is a State subject, no centralized data regarding setting up of new heavy industry in any part of the country is maintained by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). The role of DHI is confined to the administration of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. However, these CPSEs take decision to set up their units in various parts of the country based on the commercial considerations. However, States encourage setting up of industries as per their priorities and investment climate and details of such nature are only expected to be available with them. At present, DHI has no plan to set up any new industry. 

 

This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                As per information received from Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT), the instructions regarding equal pay admissible to casual workers already exists in terms of DoPT O.M. No. 49014/2/86 Estt. (c) dated 07.06.1988. Further, Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are under the administrative control of their respective Ministries / Departments and CPSEs are required to follow the various statutory provisions / Court orders / Government instructions including instructions on wage related issues of various categories of employees, wherever applicable. However, as the responsibility to monitor the implementation of above said statutory provisions / court orders / Government instructions vests with the Board of CPSEs and the concerned administrative Ministry / Department, as such no centralized information in this regard is maintained by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) and accordingly complaints, if any, received against any CPSE on this issue are also forwarded to the concerned administrative Ministry / Department of CPSE for appropriate action.

                The role of DHI is confined to the administration of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. Any centralized data on investment made in industrial sector is not maintained in DHI. Further, Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) under the Ministry of Commerce & Industry has also not reported any such data.

DIPP has reported that Government of India has been working towards adopting international best practices and has made significant advancement over the years. Government has taken vigorous measures to make it easier to invest or to do business in India by undertaking various reforms. Major national initiatives have been designed to facilitate investment; foster innovation and enhance skill development. The goodwill generated by the Government’s hard work and efforts has yielded an unprecedented level of interest among investors, both foreign and domestic. 

 

A 98-Point Action Plan for improving the regulatory framework for business as part of easing the doing business in the country was shared in December 2014. Subsequently, a report titled “Assessment of State Implementation of Business Reforms” was released in September 2015 capturing the findings after taking the stock of reforms implemented by States. The assessment, first of its kind, promoted both competitive and cooperative federalism among the States and Union Territories (UTs). 

 

The first 98-point Action Plan created a wave of regulatory improvement measures and the need to sustain the momentum of the regulatory reform; a 340-Point Business Reform Action Plan for States and Union Territories (UTs) was circulated by Government to all States/UT Governments in the year 2015-16. 

 

In order to ensure that all information is readily available to an entrepreneur intending to set up a business, a comprehensive single window system is envisaged with an online common application form for various clearances to industry/businesses.

Various States have created a dedicated Single Window body as a one-stop online system for State level regulatory and fiscal incentive approvals. It has provisions for filing applications, payment, status tracking, online scrutiny and application approvals. 

 

As part of the 340-point Business Reform Action Plan 2016, all States/UTs were recommended to:  Design and implement an online single window system with functionality for online application, payment and approvals.

 

16 States/UTs implemented this reform in 2016:   Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. 

 

This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.

As per available information, there are 42 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) which presently do not have a regular Managing Director/Chairman & Managing Director (CMD)/Chairman. The list of these 42 CPSEs is annexed. 

 

The filling up of Board level posts in CPSEs is a continuous process and these 42 vacant posts would get filled in due course after completion of necessary formalities.

 

The Government has laid down guidelines for  upgradation of Board level posts of CPSEs on a personal basis which provides for grant of higher schedule of pay to the concerned Board level incumbent.

        

There are no cases which have been approved by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet where Chairman/CMD/Directors of Schedule ‘C’ CPSEs are getting pay scales of Schedule ‘B’ CPSEs.

At present, there is no recall policy in the country. However, the Industry has announced a voluntary code on vehicle recall in July 2012. Society of Indian Automobiles Manufacturers (SIAM) has shared the details of vehicles recalled voluntary by the Industry as per Annexure.

 

There is, at present, no such proposal under consideration in the Department of Heavy Industry to bring fine for faulty vehicles.

     SIAM has reported that the inflation rates have come down in the last two years and fuel prices have also not changed substantially in the recent past. Hence,  no major impact on sales is seen due to these factors.     

            This information was given by Minister of  State in the Ministry of  Heavy Industries  and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.

No such targets were fixed for Capital Goods Industry which includes its sub- sectors like Machine Tools, Earthmoving & Mining Machinery, Heavy Electrical Equipment. No such targets were fixed for Automobile Industries as well. However, the Government in consultation with Automobile Industry envisions a growth path  in the form of Automobile Mission Plan. First such plan was launched in 2006 for the period of 10 years. The performance of this Plan is given below:

        India has attracted significant quantum of local and global automobile manufacturers

(OEMs) as well as component manufacturers, exceeding the target of Rs.1,57,500 crores.

 

        While cumulative domestic sales volume of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles 

and tractors have been achieved, 2 and 3 Wheelers have fallen short of their targets. 

The Government has launched a Scheme in November, 2014 for enhancement of ecompetitiveness in the Indian Capital Goods Sector having infrastructural components like setting up of (1) Centre of Excellence for technology development, (2) Integrated Industrial Infrastructural facility i.e. industrial park (3) Common Engineering Facility Centre and (4) Test & Certification Centre. The Scheme also has provision for financial intervention by way of Technology Acquisition Fund Programme for acquisition/ transfer of technology. Details of the Scheme are available in the Department of Heavy Industry website. (dhi.nic.in). So far 14 proposals have been approved under different components of the Scheme. 

Further, the Government has recently launched a National Capital Goods Policy in 2016 under ‘Make in India’ initiative with a view to realize the potential of domestic capital goods industry. Details of the Policy may be seen at the Department of Heavy Industry website.(dhi.nic.in).

As far as Automobile Sector is concerned, Government has taken a series of steps for the promotion of the Industry, like launching of FAME India Scheme for promotions of Electric and Hyrid Vehicles and establishment of state of the art vehicle testing centres under NATRIP Project. 

         This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.

No revival package has been approved for Praga Tools Limited. So far as Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (IDPL) is concerned; it is a public sector undertaking under the D/o Pharmaceuticals. The department of Pharmaceuticals has informed that the company has been incurring heavy losses for a long time. Company was declared sick and referred to Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1992. The earlier revival /rehabilitation packages of IDPL have failed to achieve the desired results. In view of the same, the Government has decided to sell that much surplus land of IDPL, as would be required to clear the outstanding liabilities, implementing Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)/ Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) and to close the Company after meeting all the liabilities.

There is no revival package for Praga Tools Limited.

			*CPSE either not signed MoU in the year or MoU signed but not submitted its evaluation to DPE 
			
		
		
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
		
	


         This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today. 

Evaluation of Performance of CPSUs
 



Evaluation of the performance of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), against targets fixed in their respective Memorandum of Understanding for a financial year is done after the end of the financial year.

 

The details of the evaluation of the achievements of CPSEs for the last three years is enclosed at Annexure A.

 

Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) function under the administrative control of various Ministries/Departments and all matters relating to revival/ restructuring/closure of CPSEs are dealt by the concerned administrative Ministries/ Departments.  Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), as a nodal department, has issued guidelines on 29.10.2015 for “Streamlining the mechanism for revival and restructuring of sick/ incipient sick and weak Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)”. As per the guidelines, the responsibility for addressing the sickness of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) lies with the concerned administrative Ministries/Departments.  The administrative Ministries/ Departments monitor the sickness of CPSEs and identify the sick/incipient sick/weak CPSEs functioning under their control based on the performance and take timely redressal measures. The concerned administrative Ministries/ Departments formulate revival/ restructuring plans for such CPSEs on a case-to-case basis and after obtaining the approval of competent authority implement the plan.

                India is hosting FIFA Under – 19 World Cup in October this year. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has called for the support of not only children, but also parents to encourage boys and girls to play football and develop both skill and fitness. The tournament will be a milestone event in many ways, but perhaps most lasting aspect will be Mission XI Million, which is a grassroot programme designed to encourage children to play this popular game.

 

​Keeping in view of the appeal of the Prime Minister, the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have been tasked to conduct ‘Oorja’, - CAPFs Under-19 Football Talent Hunt Tournament – 2017. CAPFs will be jointly organizing the tournament under the aegis of All India Police Sports Control Board throughout the country from May 1-15, 2017. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is tasked to conduct the tournament for the States of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and the Union Territories of Dadr​a​ & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu.

 

In Goa, CISF is organizing the​ ​Oorja – 2017 for Boys and Girls under the age of 19 from May 1-10, 2017. O​pening Ceremony​ is ​ scheduled on May 1, 2017 at Bambolim Football stadium, Goa in which Governor of Goa, Smt. Mridula Sinha will be the Chief Guest. Chief Minister Shri Manohar Parrikar will grace the Closing Ceremony scheduled on May 10, 2017. Bruno Coutinho, Arjuna Awardee, will be the brand ambassador for Oorja -2017, in Goa.

 

Mission XI Million is a school contact programme that aims at improving the football ecosystem and ultimately widening the talent pool for the national team. Vying to reach out to over 37 cities and 12,000 schools across all 29 states of India, the initiative will focus on games that can be adapted to different field sizes and conditions, with special emphasis on small-sided games. It is divided into three phases: seminars for teacher and educators, in-school activities and football festivals, which will run up to September, 2017.

The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh reviewed the Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP) for the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) here today. The PMDP was announced by the Prime Minister during his visit to J&K on November 07, 2015. 

The Package consists of 63 projects concerning 15 Ministries of Government of India and has an outlay of Rs 80,068 crore. The review meeting was attended by the Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Mehrishi, Secretaries and senior officers from all the 15 Ministries, Chief Secretary of J&K along with Secretaries of various departments of the J&K Government. 

Out of Rs 80,068 crore outlay of PMDP, Rs 61,112 crore have already been sanctioned by the various Ministries of Government of India (more than 75 %). Rs 19,961 crore have already been released to the implementing agencies including the State Government (more than 25%).

The PMDP will provide a major development push for J&K with projects such as AIIMS for Jammu, AIIMS at Srinagar, Support for District as well as Sub-District Hospitals and Primary Health Centers, IIM at Jammu with an out campus at Srinagar, IIT, upgradation of NIT at Srinagar and additional Girls’ Hostels in Higher Educational Institutions. 

The Government of India has also approved to provide 1,00,000 jobs for undergraduates and school dropouts under HIMAYAT scheme, an elaborate layout for sports infrastructure in all the 22 Districts, Development of Pashmina wool, Cold Storage facilities for Agricultural produce and Development of Horticulture. The Package also includes a major support to Urban development under AMRUT scheme, Swachh Bharat Mission and Smart Cities. Major Water Resources projects include flood management of River Jhelum and its tributaries, conservation of major water bodies such as Dal, Nageen and Wular lakes. 

18 Major Road Transport and Tunnel projects under PMDP are expected to provide much better connectivity for the people of J&K and allow the farmers to transport their produce to the desired markets. 

Three (3) Himalayan Circuits have been sanctioned under Tourism that include extensive development in all the three regions ie Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, under the tourism front also. 

There are 5 major power projects which include Srinagar – Leh transmission line, Smart Grid and Smart Meters and augmentation of electricity distribution systems. 

In addition, approval has been given for Semi Ring roads for Jammu and Srinagar and hydro & solar power projects. 

These projects are in various stages of implementation. While work has started on many projects, in some cases DPRs are in final stages of preparation and in a few difficult cases, the DPRs are under preparation. Nearly 87 DPRs are being finalized for small hydro projects. 

Shri Rajnath Singh asked the team of Central and State Government officials to further accelerate the implementation of PMDP with definite timelines so that the people of the State of J&K are able to reap the benefits of these development initiatives of Government of India at the earliest.

There have been reports in a section of media on the recent Sukma incident which need clarification. The Ministry of Home Affairs has clarified these reports as below: 

It is factually not correct to observe that lack of financial resources are a reason for casualty of valuable lives of police and CRPF personnel which are being lost in the battle against Left Wing Extremism. The funds released for Security Related Expenditure Scheme have increased from Rs. 575 crores in 2011-12, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 to Rs. 675 crores in 2014-15, 2015-2016, 2016-2017. The above increase is in spite of the fact that States now get a greater share (42%) of the Centre’s tax resources. Earlier this used to be only 32%.

It is incorrect to say that Chhattisgarh Police is in shambles. In addition to 45,000 Central Forces, over 20,000 State Police personnel are posted in Bastar region. Recruitment is ongoing and continuous process. For a force of 70,000, about 3,000 policemen retire every year and there is always a pipeline of 6,000 people under recruitment. 

The Chhattisgarh police forces are well equipped and a Bastar package for police was introduced in end 2015. There is complete coordination between Centre and State forces. In fact 2016 has been the most successful year in anti-LWE operation. As compared to an average of 30 Naxals killed every year, 135 Naxals were neutralized in 2016 which is three times the number of police personnel killed. Even in 2017, 32 Naxals have been killed so far which is more than the average annual killings of Naxals before 2015. It is wrong to say that 72 CRPF personnel have sacrificed their lives in 2017. As a matter of fact 38 CRPF personnel have been martyred in Chhattisgarh in 2017. These figures clearly indicate that anti-Naxal operations are achieving success. 

The Government of India policy has been very helpful and has substantially brought down the violence figures in the State. There has been 7% decline in overall violence incidents since 2013. The LWE Cadres are infact in retreat and resorting to desperate attacks. 

A Bastaria Battalion has been sanctioned recently with a strength of around 750 to be recruited from the local tribals. Similarly 10 Special India Reserve Battalions (SIRB) and 56 India Reserve Battalions are being raised in the LWE areas. 58 Mine Protected Vehicles (MPVs) are available in Chhattisgarh to the CAPFs and 30 are under process for procurement through the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB). 42 Bullet Proof vehicles are also available and 210 Bullet Protected Vehicles (BPVs) are under process for procurement. 

On the development front various initiatives have been taken recently such as sanction of a 5,412 kms road project at a cost of Rs. 11,725 crores, inclusion of all 35 worst affected LWE districts in the skill development programme, providing Navodaya and Kendriya Vidyalayas, banks, ATMs and post offices in these districts. On the health front, the flagship NHRM programme is followed up by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on a constant basis and a super speciality hospital has been approved recently at Jagdalpur by way of upgradation of Jadgalpur Medical College. 

The next of kin of the martyred currently get around Rs. 84 lakhs as assistance. 

There were no directions by MHA regarding not showing grieving widows on TV channels. It was a suggestion verbally made keeping in mind the sensitivities of the bereaved families and the fundamental decency of not intruding to the privacy of the grieving families.

There is a report in a section of media that the Central Government is trying to impose Hindi. In this regard reference was given to the Resolution issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Official Language and it was alleged that it has been made mandatory for Members of Parliament and Ministers knowing Hindi to deliver their speeches/statements in Hindi. 

The Committee of Parliament on Official Language was constituted in 1976 and is working since then. This Committee has submitted 9 parts of its report. The 9th part of the Committee’s report was submitted to the President of India on 2nd June, 2011. The then Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Committee had given 117 recommendations. As views of all state governments and Ministries/Departments of the Central Government were to be invited on the Committee’s recommendations, it took time before the recommendations were considered and accepted by the President. 

Recommendation No. 105 is as follows “All dignitaries including Hon’ble President and all the Ministers especially who can read and speak Hindi may be requested to give their speech/statement in Hindi only.” 

The Central Government while accepting the above mentioned recommendation has issued a Resolution dated 31st March 2017. The Recommendation by the Committee is amply clear as it is in the form of a request and does not entail any form of Order/Instruction. The aforementioned recommendation is in pursuance with Constitutional and Statutory provisions regarding the progressive use of Official Language Hindi. Also, the recommendation is based on the policy of propagation; promotion of Official language through motivation & inspiration which is in line with the Government’s Policy.

It is clarified that such media reports are unfounded and devoid of facts.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) will conduct its first-ever mock exercises on forest fire tomorrow covering all districts of Uttarakhand. The exercise, to be conducted in collaboration with the State Government, is aimed at assessing the efficacy of integrating the response mechanisms of the forest department with those of the district administration. 

In the run-up to this mock exercise, a coordination conference and a table-top exercise have been held with all district magistrates and Divisional Forest Officers through video-conferencing from Dehradun. These meetings were held to ensure that necessary arrangements for conducting the mock exercise have been put in place. 

A detailed discussion was held on the different types of forest fires and how to best respond to them. Stakeholders were also briefed on the activation of Incident Response System (IRS) in the event of a forest fire. 

The forest department informed about the various channels being used to receive fire alerts such as the Forest Survey of India and Indian Space Research Organisation's Bhuvan portal. It also shared the mechanisms for its further dissemination up to the forest guard level for ensuring swift action during any forest fire incident. 

Senior officials from all stakeholder departments such as National and State Disaster Response Forces, health, police, forest, fire fighting, Civil Defense, Public Relations, etc. attended these preparatory meetings. 

NDMA regularly conducts such mock exercises across the country in its efforts to improve preparedness and response mechanisms for various disaster situations. The Authority has so far conducted more than 550 mock exercises in different States and Union Territories.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) will conduct its first-ever mock exercise on forest fire in Uttarakhand on Thursday (April 20, 2017) to help improve the preparedness and response mechanism in the event of a forest fire. 

The mock exercise will be conducted on the principle of Incident Response System (IRS), which identifies stakeholders and clearly attributes roles and responsibilities to each one of them. It will enhance preparedness and ensure a swift response by reducing confusion and chaos. 

It will help in filling gaps, ensuring better communication and improving coordination among various stakeholder agencies. It will also generate awareness among the local population about the Do's and Don'ts to be followed to prevent and respond to a forest fire. 

The mock exercise will be part of a three-day event which will begin with a Co-ordination Conference on Tuesday followed by a Table-top Exercise on Wednesday. Districts will attend these preparatory meetings through videoconferencing from Dehradun, the State Capital. 

An orientation conference was held earlier with concerned officials to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise. 

Senior officials from all the important departments such as the Army, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), forest, health, police, firefighting, Civil Defense, transport, electricity, public relations, etc. will participate in the exercise.

The workshop on the review of the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) concluded here today, on a high note with fruitful discussions and inputs from all stakeholders. The two-day workshop was organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

The NDMP, which was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in June last year, provides for periodic reviews. To make this review process participatory and inclusive, NDMA had sought suggestions from State Governments and Ministries of the Central Government. 

Various Ministries made presentations suggesting ways to improve the Plan and discussed how to integrate Prime Minister’s 10-point agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into the national plan. 

Earlier in the day, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, set the agenda by appraising the participants on the objectives of the workshop and summarising the discussions with State Government representatives. 

Discussions at this workshop will also form a part of the deliberations at the upcoming National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR), which will be held shortly.  

Senior officials of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), NDMA, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) participated in the workshop.

As on 01.01.2016, total authorised strength of IPS is 4802.

Calculation of authorised strength depends upon functional requirement of a particular cadre. As per rule 4 (2) of IPS Cadre Rules, 1954, the Central Government, ordinarily at the interval of every five years, reviews the strength and composition of each such cadre in consultation with the State Government(s) concerned and revises the authorised strength of the IPS for each Cadre. The authorised strength includes Senior Duty Post, Central Deputation Reserve, State Deputation Reserve, Leave Reserve & Junior Reserve, Training Reserve and Promotion quota.

As on 01.01.2016, 3894 IPS officers are in-position against authorised strength of 4802. As such, there are 908 vacancies in Indian Police Service as on 01.01.2016.

The authorised strength of IPS in Kerala is 163 as on 01.01.2016. There are 41 vacancies of IPS existing in Kerala as on 01.01.2016.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri K. Somaprasad in the Rajya Sabha today.

The Government under the Immigration, Visa and Foreigners Registration Tracking (IVFRT) project is maintaining database of arrival/departure and visa details of all foreigners visiting India. A Unique Case File (UCF) is created for each of the Indian Visa applicants and all the details are clubbed. So far about 2.70 crore UCF has been created. The UCF data is useful in getting details that may be needed in specific cases. It helps in better profiling of the foreigners at the Immigration Counters in less time.

The IVFRT project approved in 2010 and implemented in 2011 has so far covered 163 Indian Mission, 674 FROs/Districts, 87 Immigration Check Posts (ICPs) and 21 State Home Departments. For now, the project has been extended for six months beyond 31.03.2017.

On the basis of information provided by the Narcotics Control Bureau, more than 200 foreigners have been arrested and prosecuted under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 during 2016.

Central Security Agencies take cognizance of such incidences of international terror strikes and necessary security measures are taken to counter such terror attacks in India.

Security of sensitive buildings in the capital including Parliament House, Supreme Court, High Courts, Govt. Buildings, Vital Installations and important monuments etc. is reviewed periodically.

After the incident in London, the security agencies have been properly briefed to remain extra vigilant while performing duties and ensure proper security arrangements in the Parliament House Complex. Recently, instructions to strengthen the security of Government buildings under MHA security cover have also been issued on 31.03.2017.

As per available information, registration certificates of more than 10,000 NGOs have been cancelled during financial year 2014-15 to 2016-17 for violation of FCRA, 2010 and Rules made there under. A list of such cancelled organization is available on the Ministry’s website www.fcraonline.nic.in. 

 

            FCRA Registrations have mainly been cancelled on account of non-filing of the annual returns as mandated in the FCRA, 2010 and rules made there under. The FCRA, 2010, Rules, FAQs and notices/advisories for filing of the Annual Returns and renewal application etc. have been put on the MHA website for creating greater legal awareness amongst the Voluntary Sector.

                The Minister of State, Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, inaugurated a two-day workshop on the review of the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) here today. The workshop has been organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Kiren Rijiju said that it is imperative that we integrate Disaster Risk Reduction into our governance, adding that this review would majorly guide in managing future disasters.

The NDMP, India's first-ever national plan for Disaster Management, was launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in June last year. The Plan itself provides for periodic reviews to accommodate emerging global practices and national experiences. The Prime Minister’s 10-point agenda on DRR, outlined during the Asian Ministerial Conference on DRR in November last year, will serve as the guiding document in the revision of the Plan.

Calling the review of the Plan crucial for all stakeholders, Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, said that it was important to keep socio-economic realities and changes in mind while revisiting the Plan.

In its efforts to make the review process participatory and inclusive, NDMA had sought suggestions on the national plan from State Governments and Ministries of the Central Government.

Discussions at this workshop will form a part of the deliberations at the upcoming National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR), which will be held shortly.

Senior officials of NDMA and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), State Governments and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) attended the first day of the workshop.

MoS (Home) Shri Kiren Rijiju will inaugurate a two-day consultative workshop to review the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) here tomorrow.

The event, being organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), will bring together all stakeholders to deliberate upon the Plan and suggest ways to improve it.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the country's first-ever National Plan for Disaster Management in June last year. The Plan aimed to make India disaster resilient and significantly reduce the loss of lives and assets. With this, India became one of the first countries to align its national plan to the 'Sendai Framework' - adopted at the third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, in March, 2015.

While the Plan provides a framework for Disaster Management in the entire country, its execution involves all levels of Government right up to Panchayat and Urban Local Body level as well as Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO), civil society and vulnerable communities. It provides for periodic reviews of the Plan based on national experiences and emerging global practices. These reviews will help synchronise the Plan to the needs of the implementing agencies.

Discussions at this workshop will feed into the deliberations at the upcoming National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR), which will be held shortly.

NDMA Members and officials, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), State Governments, early warning agencies such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministries/Departments of the Central Government, concerned NGOs, ex-Members and Advisory Committee members of NDMA, and educational institutions will participate in the meeting.

Requests have been received in Ministry of Home Affairs from the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Uttarakhand and West Bengal for waiving off cost of deployment charges towards deployment of CAPFs in their States. As per the extant policy of Government of India, the States are required to bear the cost of deployment of Central Armed Police Forces in their states at the prescribed rates. The requests have been examined but not agreed to in view of the extant policy of the Government of India.

Two requests were received from the State Government of Andhra Pradesh vide letters dated 28.5.2014 and 24.6.2016 for waiving off of Rs.1003.61 crore and Rs. 50.76 crore respectively which have not been agreed to in view of the extant policy of the Government of India.

Two additional Reserve Battalions have been sanctioned to CISF in June, 2016. Further, Government has recently (December, 2016) increased the ceiling of strength of CISF from 1,45,000 to 1,80,000. The requirement of manpower for expansion/new induction is met from this enhanced strength on need basis.

CISF is deployed for security of Delhi Metro Rail only and not at any other Metro. At present there is no proposal for creation of a separate battalion of CISF for providing security at Metro rail stations.

             As per “Data on Police Organizations” published by Bureau of Police Research & Development, the police-public ratio (per lakh of population) in the country as on 01.01.2016 is 180.59. 

 

            Security is provided on the basis of threat assessment done by Central Security Agency. It is subject to periodic review. Based on such review, the security cover is continued, withdrawn or modified. Hence the number of protectees is not static and varies over time. As on date, the number of threat based protectees in the Central list in the various categories is as follows:

 


	
		
			
			Category
			
			
			Number
			
		
		
			
			Z+
			
			
			26
			
		
		
			
			Z
			
			
			58
			
		
		
			
			Y+
			
			
			144
			
		
		
			
			Y
			
			
			2
			
		
		
			
			X
			
			
			68
			
		
		
			
			Total
			
			
			298
			
		
	


 

 

Presently 14  ‘Z+’ category protectees have been provided with NSG mobile security cover.NSG has deployed 551 security personnel for the protection of these protectees. 

 

As regards expenditure on security, it is difficult to determine it precisely as it includes salary and allowances to security personnel, communication, transport vehicles, etc. which are accounted for under respective budget heads of different security agencies, including State Government agencies, providing security cover. Such details are not compiled centrally.

 

            There are special instructions for security of the President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister, which are contained in their respective Blue Books issued by M/o Home Affairs.

 

Security arrangements for other individuals are made as per the guidelines laid down in the ‘Yellow Book’ titled ‘Security arrangements for the protection of individuals’. The security arrangements for such individuals are made after careful assessment of their threat perception by the Central Security Agency. Depending on the level of threat, security is provided in Z+,Z,Y+,Y and X categories.

 

Certain categories of individuals, such as Union Ministers, State CMs and Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts, are provided positional/statutory security cover to facilitate bold and impartial decision making. Their security is withdrawn after they demit their office.

 

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Godse Hemant Tukaram and Shri Hariom Singh Rathore in the Lok Sabha today.

The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the web portal and mobile application named “Bharat ke Veer” on the occasion of Valour Day of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) here today. The portal is an IT based platform, with an objective to enable willing donors to contribute towards the family of a braveheart who sacrificed his/her life in line of duty. The amount so donated will be credited to the account of ‘Next of Kin’ of those Central Armed Police Force/Central Para Military Force soldiers. The actor Shri Akshay Kumar was the Guest of Honour during the function. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that he pays heartfelt tribute to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the safety of nation. He said that each moment of lives of CRPF and CAPF personnel is a test of their courage and bravery. He said that a bullet can hit a soldier physically, but no bullet can defeat the courage and motivation of a soldier. The bravery of CRPF commandant, Chetan Cheetah is an example of it who survived 9 bullets, Shri Rajanth Singh added. 

The Union Home Minister thanked the actor Shri Akshay Kumar for contributing his ideas to the launch of Web Portal “Bharat ke Veer”. He said that he is satisfied that this portal will be successful and will act as a motivation to the brave soldiers. He said that Shri Akshay Kumar is a hero for people, but Shri Akshay Kumar’s real heros are the soldiers of Paramilitary Forces. Shri Rajnath Singh appealed to the nation to visit the web portal and contribute maximum towards the corpus. The Union Home Minister said that CRPF has a multi-dimensional role to play and he is proud of their bravery and valour. He also said that the martyr’s family should get a support of minimum Rs one crore and the Government would meet the gaps, if any. He said that 45-50% decline in the LWE incidents, 75% decline in incidents in North-East and decline in terror-incidents in Jammu and Kashmir during the last three years is the contribution of the Forces. 

The Secretary (Home), Shri Rajiv Mehrishi also thanked actor Shri Akshay Kumar for conceptualizing the idea of this portal and making his contribution to the martyrs’ families. 

Speaking on the occasion, actor Shri Akshay Kumar said that this web portal has been designed in a record time of just two and a half months. He said that it will act as a support to the families of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the nation. He said that this will act as a platform for those who want to contribute to the families of the bravehearts, but are not aware of the channel. He thanked the Ministry of Home Affairs for working towards launching this portal 

The site “Bharat ke Veer” will be available on web portal as well as mobile application. This domain allows anyone to financially support the bravehearts of his choice or towards the “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus. This website is technically supported by National Informatics Centre (NIC) and powered by State Bank of India. To ensure maximum coverage, a cap of 15 lakh rupees is imposed and the donors would be alerted if the amount exceeds, so that they can choose to divert part of the donation to another braveheart account or to the “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus. “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus would be managed by a committee made up of eminent persons of repute and senior Government officials, who would decide to disburse the fund equitably to the braveheart’s family on need basis. 

On the occasion, the Home Minister awarded Police Medal for Gallantry to the CRPF personnel (including posthumously) on the occasion of Valour Day today. The Valour Day is celebrated in remembrance of an act of unparalleled bravery displayed by a small contingent of CRPF personnel, pitted against a full-fledged infantry brigade of Pakistani Army, trying to overrun their post, at Sardar Post, Rann of Kutch, Gujarat on April 09, 1965. They not only defeated the Pakistani brigade but also killed 34 Pakistani soldiers and captured 4 of them alive. The CRPF successfully defended the post till the arrival of reinforcements. The saga of valour of Sardar Post is a rich source of inspiration to the officers and men of CRPF and befittingly 9th April is observed as the “Valour Day”. 

Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Sudeep Lakhtakia, DG (Off.), CRPF, Shri Rajiv Jain, Director, IB, DGs of CAPFs and other senior officers were also present on the occasion.

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh concludes his three-day visit to Andaman and Nicobar Islands today. During his tour to Andaman & Nicobar Islands he visited four islands including South Andaman, Car Nicobar, Ross Island, Havelock Island and did aerial survey of volcanic eruptions at Barren Island. 

On the first day of his visit on April 06, 2017, Shri Rajnath Singh was accorded a warm welcome at Port Blair. On his arrival at the Veer Savarkar International Airport, the Home Minister was received by the Lt Governor A&N Islands Professor Jagdish Mukhi, Member of Parliament Shri Bishnu Pad Ray, Chief Secretary Shri Anindo Majumdar, Chairman Port Blair Municipal Council, senior officers of A&N Administration and general public. Soon after his arrival, the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh visited the National Memorial, Cellular Jail and paid tributes to the freedom fighters by placing a wreath at the Martyrs' Column. The Home Minister also visited the Veer Savarkar Cell in the Cellular Jail. 

Later on arrival at Raj Niwas, the Home Minister reviewed the progress of all important projects and schemes being implemented in these Islands. On account of very large distance from the mainland, he particularly held detailed discussion on the issues, which affect the life of people most, in these remotely located Islands, like transport including shipping and civil aviation, communication, power, tourism and fisheries . The review meeting was attended by Lt Governor Professor Jagdish Mukhi, Member of Parliament Shri Bishnupad Ray and the senior officers of the Union Territory and the Ministry of Home Affairs. 

Shri Rajnath Singh addressed 3 public meetings including the huge one that was held to accord him the civic reception by Port Blair Municipal Council at ITF ground. He reaffirmed the deep emotional connect of the Central government with the people of the islands and the strong commitment of the Government towards inclusive and all round development of the country with special focus on the outlying regions. 

While addressing the public meeting, the Home Minister described the Andaman & Nicobar Islands as “Mini India” a unique example of Unity in Diversity and national integration. He acknowledged the historical significance and distinguished contribution of the islands in the national freedom struggle. The Home Minister also recollected the contribution of freedom fighter, Veer Savarkar towards the country’s freedom struggle movement. He said that politics should be done with a motto of service to the humanity. “Politics should not be done merely for formation of Governments but it should be for creating a better society and development of a strong nation”, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh outlined that fight against corruption is key for achieving the mandate of development. He mentioned that the decision of demonetization for eliminating the parallel economy of black money and fake currency thus blocking illegal sources of fund flow for terrorists, Maoists and Naxalites, has been a path breaking step towards curbing corruption. He added that all measures towards promoting a cashless economy are aimed at reducing corruption. Opening zero balance accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana has successfully brought 99% of the population under the umbrella of banks. The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1st of July, 2017 will be a game changer as there will be a single tax for the entire country, he added. 

During his address, Shri Rajnath Singh made some important announcements like revolutionizing the telephone and internet connectivity by laying of submarine optical fibre cable between Chennai and Port Blair and other 5 islands (Havelock, Little Andaman, Car Nicobar, Kamorta and Campbell) by December, 2018 at an estimated cost of Rs 1102.38 Cr and adding 14 new ships to the fleet from May, 2017 and March, 2020 for the transport of passengers and Cargo from the mainland to islands and between different islands. A detailed plan for holistic development of 5 islands including Smith Island, Ross Island, Long Island, Avis Island and Little Andaman is being planned by NITI Aayog and that would be put into action for over all development of these islands, he added. 

While speaking about welfare measures and steps being taken to remove unemployment by the Central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Home Minister also underlined the resolve of the Government to attack and continue attacking corruption.. 

While laying the foundation stone of 25 MW Solar Power Plant integrated with battery energy storage at Guptapara Village in South Andaman, which is first of its kind in India, Shri Rajnath Singh said that the projects of solar energy parks of 100 MW have been sanctioned for the islands and all efforts would be made to commission all of them by 2018. As the total installed capacity of power generation in these islands is 109.45 MW of which 99.10 MW is from diesel, he announced that in order to save the beauty and pristine environment of these islands and to produce green and clean as well as comparatively cheaper energy highly polluting diesel generation would be replaced by solar, wind and sea-wave energy. 

In Car Nicobar Island, he visited areas affected by Tsunami of 2004, talked to tribal people of a number of villages and enquired about their well-being and progress of rehabilitation. In one of these villages namely, Malacca, he inaugurated a newly constructed and furnished building of senior secondary school, which was totally damaged by tsunami. He laid wreath at the tsunami memorial built in the memory of those who lost their lives in the devastating catastrophe, visited the picture gallery of the disaster and met the Tribal Council Captains and other Tribal leaders at Malacca. In Mus village he laid wreath at the Memorial of Padma Shree, Padma Bhushan and Ex-Member of Parliament, late Bishop Richardson, who is credited for integrating these islands. 

Today on the last day of his visit, the Home Minister visited the Barren Island. The island, located 137 km north east of Port Blair, is India’s only active volcano . It was recently in news when researchers from the Goa based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) reported the volcano to be active and spewing lava and smoke . The Union Home Minister also visited the famous Radha Nagar Beach at Havelock Islands. The beach has been rated as the best beach in Asia and seventh best in the world. On his return to Port Blair, Shri Rajnath Singh also met the representatives of the different sections of the civil society.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the web portal and mobile application named “Bharat ke Veer” here tomorrow. The portal is an IT based platform, with an objective to enable willing donors to contribute towards the family of a braveheart who sacrificed his/her life in line of duty. The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju and actor Akshay Kumar will also participate in the function.

 

The site “Bharat ke Veer” will be available on web portal as well as mobile application. The amount so donated will be credited to the account of ‘Next of Kin’ of those Central Armed Police Force/Central Para Military Force soldiers. This domain allows anyone to financially support the bravehearts of his/her choice or towards the “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus.   

 

This website is technically supported by National Informatics Centre (NIC) and powered by State Bank of India. To ensure maximum coverage, a cap of 15 lakh rupees is imposed and the donors would be alerted if the amount exceeds, so that they can choose to divert part of the donation to another braveheart account or to the “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus. “Bharat Ke Veer” corpus would be managed by a committee made up of eminent persons of repute and senior Government officials, who would decide to disburse the fund equitably to the braveheart’s family on need basis.

Police is a State subject, hence State Govt. concerned is mandated to take measures to ensure protection of their police personnel. However, Govt. of India provides central assistance for procurement of various safety instruments/equipments including Anti-Riot Equipment, Full Body Protector, Bullet Resistant (BR) Jackets, Bullet Resistant (BR) Helmets, MSL, Tear Gas, PAVA Shells, Chilli Water Cannon under the scheme of Modernization of Police Force (MPF) as per their operational requirement and strategic priorities to the State police. Similar assistance is separately provided to the CAPF for safety instruments/equipments for their personnel. These personnel are also imparted requisite training and regular mock drills to deal with such situations effectively.

Bureau of Police Research & Development, MHA, report “Précis on Crowd Control” exhaustively dealt with various problems and challenges that arise in controlling crowds and maintenance of law and order. As per the report, water cannons developed by the DRDO are commonly used in crowd and riot control for dispersal or to prevent movement on particular position and are considered most effective methods to disperse mobs.

As regards the use of “laughing gas” for controlling crowd, as less harmful detergent, BPR&D has not conducted any test/trial to asses its suitability for riot control.

The Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu inaugurated the 47th Foundation Day of Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd. (HUDCO) today and said that HUDCO is playing an important role in taking financial inclusion forward in the country, as it is taking care of the housing finance needs of the economically deprived sections.

Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that in the last 47 years, HUDCO had constructed 16 million residential units across the country and over 92 per cent of these dwelling units have benefited the economically weaker sections and low income groups. He further said that HUDCO has assisted in the construction of about 67 lakh, viable & low cost sanitation units.

Shri Naidu said that HUDCO executed 51 MoUs with various Primary Lending Institutions for Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme- Economically Weaker Section/ Low Income Group (CLSS-EWS/LIG) and 21 MoUs for Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for Middle Income Groups (CLSS-MIG). He highlighted that HUDCO has achieved the MoU targets in respect of overall sanctions and disbursements and from the past 5 years, HUDCO is continuously getting excellent rating, with Perfect 1 (One) ‘MoU Rating’ in 2015-16. 

The Minister pointed that, HUDCO has refinanced 759 beneficiaries under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme of PMAY(U) with a subsidy amount of Rs.11.66 Crore, as on March 31, 2017 and was hopeful that HUDCO will target atleast 50,000 beneficiaries under CLSS-EWS/LIG and an equal number of beneficiaries under CLSS-MIG scheme in the coming year. 

He said that HUDCO is going through a process of disinvestment of 10% of its equity share though an IPO process and expressed hopeful that the employees of HUDCO will be more responsible towards its growth and take HUDCO to the newer heights.

During the occasion, the Minister gave away awards and released publications namely, ‘Shelter’, ‘HUDCO Darpan’, ‘HUDCO Design Awards 2016’, ‘Sankalp’ and ‘Urban India’.

Chief Vigilance Commissioner Shri K.V. Chowdary, Secretary (HUPA) Dr. Nandita Chatterjee, Chairman & Managing Director, HUDCO Dr M. Ravi Kanth and other senior officers of HUPA were also present on the occasion.

                Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that the Government has done more for meeting the housing needs of urban poor during the last three years than what was done in the previous ten years proving that it is a ‘Government with a difference’ as desired by the people.

 

            Shri Naidu stated that to enable inclusive development benefitting the urban poor, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) ‘ to ensure Housing for All by 2022 and gave the following evidence in support of his assertion :

 

1.      Under PMAY(Urban), 17,73,533 affordable houses have been approved  for 2,008 cities and towns in the last less than two years as against 13,82,768 sanctioned for 1,061 cities in the earlier 10 years;

2.      An investment of Rs.96,266 cr has been approved so far for construction of houses for urban poor as against Rs.32,713 cr during 2004-14;

3.      Central assistance of Rs.27,883 cr has already been approved for release to States/UTs under PMAY(Urban) as against Rs.20,920 cr during the ten years of previous government;

4.      PMAY(Urbana) has been extended to Middle Income Groups there by benefitting people with annual incomes up to Rs.18 lakhs, covering large sections of the society;

5.      Specific time limit of 2022 has been fixed for achieving the Housing for All target as against the open ended approach of the previous government; and

6.      More importantly, an enabling eco-system has been created to promote affordable housing through various initiatives like granting Infrastructure Status for this segment, concessions like exemption of profits from affordable housing projects from Income Tax etc.

 

            Shri Naidu stated that to promote private investments in affordable housing on a large scale, his Ministry is considering to extend central assistance of Rs.1.50 lakh per each eligible beneficiary belonging to Economically Weaker Sections under projects taken up even on private lands. So far, the Ministry has approved construction of 5,83, 427 houses under Affordable Housing in Partnership component of PMAY(Urban) only with State Governments partnership.

 

            Elaborating on the strategy to meet the Housing for All target by 2022, Shri Naidu informed that 15 States/UTs are being targeted to meet the target by 2019. These are: Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Andaman & Nicobar Islands,Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu and Puducherry.

 

            Other large States have been asked to submit housing proposals by end 2018 so that construction of houses could be completed by the targeted 2022.

           

            The Minister further informed that within 22 months of launch of PMAY (Urban), 97,489 houses have been constructed for urban poor. Shri Naidu gave details of States leading in implementation of PMAY(Urban) as below:

            Stressing on the need for promoting rental housing stock to meet the housing needs in the context of urbanization being a continuous process and driven by migration, Shri Naidu informed that a National Urban Rental Housing Policy would be soon announced to meet the needs of migrant workers, students, single working women etc. The policy outlines measures to be taken to encourage investments in Social Rental Housing with government support and Market Driven Rental Housing without government support. The Minister said rental housing would be an effective complement to the Housing for All mission.

 

            Shri Venkaiah Naidu informed that the remaining 32 Sections of Real Estate Act, 2016 have been notified last night relating to registration of ongoing projects that have not received Completion Certificate, penalties for non-compliance etc which would be effective from first of next month. He said that under the Act, projects and Real Estate Agents have to be registered with Regulatory Authorities within three months thereafter.

 

            The Minister urged the States/UTs to ensure that Real Estate Rules and other institutional infrastructure were in place by the stipulated time failing which they would come under public pressure.

 

            Asserting that housing of urban poor has received unprecedented attention form the Government, Shri Naidu said “ The Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has done what was required and the ball is now in the courts of Chief Ministers’ courts to ensure Housing for All by 2022”.

                Minister for Information & Broadcasting Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has condoled the passing away of cinestar and Member of Parliament Shri Vinod Khanna. In a condolence message to the bereaved family, Shri Naidu said


“I am deeply saddened by the passing away of a great film personality and Member of Parliament (Gurdaspur) Shri Vinod Khanna. I am shocked at his untimely death. May his soul rest in peace.


His contributions to the Indian Cinema is tremendous and it will be very difficult to fill the voidcaused by his untimely death. His movies were widely acclaimed and accepted by a huge fan following. People will always remember hisperformances in movies such as Mere Apne, Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Jail Yatra,  Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Inkaar, Amar Akbar Anthony, Rajput, Qurbani, Kudrat and Dayavan.


Shri Vinod Khanna, had been associated with BJP for past twenty years. He was also Union Minister during Shri Vajpayee’s Government. A sitting MP from Gurdaspur, his death is a great loss to the party and to the people of Gurdaspur.

I pray to God to give strength to his family members to overcome this irreparable loss”.

The dastardly killing of a large number of CRPF Jawans on April 24, 2017 who were clearing roads for development works in Sukma district of Chattisgarh has shocked the nation. Several others were injured. This kind of cowardly acts of violence by the underground extremist elements is highly deplorable. 

CRPF Jawans killed and injured were serving the cause of the people of the country and they paid with their precious lives while doing so. This is the highest sacrifice for the country. The families of dedicated Jawans who were killed and injured while in uniform would get the highest consideration from Central and State Governments. Both the Governments would work with renewed commitment to bring such mindless acts of violence to an end. 

While the nation was shocked by this killing and violence, the so called sympathizers and proponents of Human Rights have maintained baffling silence since yesterday. These activists raise voice and react violently if an extremist or a terrorist is killed by the Police but take shelter in silence when large number of Jawans and innocent people get killed by those who operate underground, kill and run. 

Are Human Rights only meant for those who chose violence in furtherance of their outdated ideologies and not for security personnel and common people? 

Why are the Human Right activists silent when such inhuman acts are mindlessly committed by outlawed elements? 

I am constrained to infer that such motivated acts of violence are being resorted to with tacit support from the so called Human Rights advocates in desperation to derail the positive narrative emerging from the ongoing efforts by the Central and State Governments to ensure that fruits of development reach the last of the poor there by enabling rapid economic development. 

There is an urgent need to build strong public opinion against such violent acts by outlawed elements and the so called Human Rights activists who have double standards and don’t uphold similar rights of security personnel, their families and the innocent people who fall victim to such anti-national activities.

“I was pained to read in a section of the press today news reports wherein DMK leader Shri M.K. Stalin has been quoted alleging imposition of Hindi by the Central Government.

Shri Stalin was quoted as saying that the Parliamentary Committee (on Official Language) proposed to make it mandatory for Members of Parliament and Union Ministers who know Hindi to use it, both in speech and writing.  He further alleged that an Ordinance to this effect has been issued thereby suggesting that Government is imposing Hindi.

I would like to clarify that the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language headed by the then Home Minister, Shri P. Chidambaram made a recommendation as follows and the same was forwarded to Hon’ble President of India on 2nd June, 2011 :-

 

“This Committee suggests that all those occupying high political offices and who can speak and read Hindi language may be requested to give their speeches / statements in Hindi.  Hon’ble President and all Ministers come in this category”.

The present Government notified this recommendation on 31st March, 2017. 

This shows that the suggestion of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language was only recommendatory and not mandatory.  It is totally false and mischievous to allege that an Ordinance was passed in this regard.

It may be recalled that DMK was a member of the Government of India in 2011 when this recommendation was made and forwarded by the Parliamentary Committee to the Hon’ble President.

Government of India has no intention of imposing any language on anyone.”

                Renowned Film Director & Actor Shri KasinadhuniViswanath is to be conferred the 48thDadasahebPhalke Award for the year 2016. I&B Minister Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today approved the recommendation of the DadasahebPhalke Award committee.  The Award is conferred by the Government of India for outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian Cinema. The Award consists of a Swarn Kamal (Golden Lotus), a cash prize of Rs. 10 lakhs and a shawl. The Award shall be conferred by the President of Indiaat a function on May 3rd2017 at Vigyan Bhawan.

A presenter of classical and traditional art, music and dance, Shri K Viswanath has been a guiding force in the Indian film industry. As a director he has made fifty films since 1965 known for their strong content, endearing narrative, honest handling and cultural authenticity. His films on wide range of social & human issues had great appeal to the masses.

Shri K Viswanath was born in February 1930 at Gudivadain Andhra Pradesh. An ardent art lover, he made a series of films based on varied themes of art, music and dance. His films empathized with courage and frailty, aspirations and convictions, perseverance and distractions, social demands and individual struggle and at the core believed in the goodness of the human spirit.

His contributions have received recognition in the form of Padmashri Award in 1992 by the Government of India for his contribution to film making. He has also been awarded 5 National Awards, 20 Nandi Awards (awarded by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh), 10Filmfare Awards including Lifetime Achievement Award. His national award winning SwathiMuthyam was the India’s official entry to the 59th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Film category.

The stories that Shri K Viswanath told through his films were seemingly simple. They provide an uncomplicated, direct and pleasant cinematic enjoyment to the audience. At the same time they lend themselves to a nuanced and layered interpretation leading many to watch them again and again and come back with a new hitherto unseen aspect or a deeper understanding and realization.

One of his most memorable films, Sirivennelawas a sensitive story of a blind flutist and a mute painter who fall in love with each other, over the love of music and their individual setbacks. It helped in changing the viewers’ perception of disability, to a large extent.  The musical compositions of this film are still fresh and soothing to the ears.

His film, Sankarabharanam, is one of India’s most memorable classics, which was appreciated across the world. A remarkable feature of his films is that all of them remain wholesome family entertainers. They have a fair share of humor, sentiments and contain scenic beauty, good music, powerful and realistic characters and most importantly concrete storylines.

                Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said Social Media is a powerful tool to fulfil the communication needs of the Government and implement the vision of the Prime Minister “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”. It is also an important medium to bring about transformational change and act as a catalyst for the emerging “New India”. Instagram as a communication platform for Government would be like a Rainbow to visualise the Story of Emerging New India. The Minister mentioned this at the inauguration of the “Workshop on Instagram for better Government Communication” here today. Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore, Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting, Shri Frank Noronha, PDG-PIB and senior Officials from Ministry and PIB were also present on the occasion.



 

Emphasizing on the role of Instagram, Shri Naidu said that the medium has become an appropriate place for the Government to visually engage with citizens and other stakeholders and communicate with a new generation of digital users. Quoting the old maxim “A picture is worth a thousand words”, he added that the colours of India, through its diversity celebrated through festivals, cultural practices, region specific dresses could best be experienced through visual images. He emphasized that Prime Minister himself was very active on social media and is the most followed World Leader on Social Media such as Facebook, Twitter & Instagram.



            Elaborating on the opportunities and challenges of social media in Governance, Shri Naidu said that social media provided actionable intelligence and inputs to policy makers, in order to aid them in making better decisions. On the other hand, it has also raised the expectations of citizens from the Government’s across the globe. In the new digital age, citizens would not be content with just information but also its promptness and the manner in which the information has been communicated. Social Media today shape actions and has become agenda setter for debates on News channels and Papers. He added that in the new world, the way people are communicating with each other is changing, and for governments to be successful, they should seek to match that evolution with their own efforts to communicate in new ways. 

             The Minister mentioned that that Government of India was working hard to institutionalize the creative and systematic use of social media within Government, in order to better tap into the promise of this tool in advancing the cause of good governance.

                        The workshop organized jointly by Press Information Bureau & Instagram was the first such workshop organized by Instagram in Asia. The workshop aimed at exposing the Government Officials to various features and applications of Instagram Platform for better Government communication and outreach on social media.

                I&B Minister addresses MindMine Summit 
 



Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that scripting of New India by bringing disruptive changes in governance had resulted in removing deficiencies, catalysing proficiencies and reaping efficiencies. The transformational initiatives brought out by the Government aimed at initiating change and altering the status quo thus positioning India as a Global Leader. The Demonetisation initiative was one of the most disruptive changes that targeted black money, counterfeit currency and corruption, which overhauled India’s economic system removing tainted currency from circulation. The Minister stated this while addressing the Mind Mine Summit here today. Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Railways was also present on the occasion.



Elaborating further, Shri Naidu said that, it has become a New Normal for the Government to bring path breaking changes to transform the country, latest being the ban on the usage of Red Beacons. The process of reform in every sector was evident in the current approach to Governance.



 

Listing out the various initiatives taken by the Government that impacted people’s life, Shri Naidu said that change was inevitable and any change that brought incremental benefits to people would fail in transforming people’s life. Behavioural change to encourage people use less cash and turn towards digital payments would not only require change in mind set but also require the institutional mechanism that will support this change. The BHIM app launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi provided latest features that is helping people shift from using less cash towards digital payments.  The use of technology has enabled providing better governance to people. The JAM trinity which uses the Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile connection has revolutionised the transfer of subsidies to the people by removing the middle men from the link.

            Shri Naidu mentioned the historic passage of GST bill in parliament which would transform the Indirect Tax structure in the country by unifying the country into a single market and thus simplifying the current complex and opaque tax administration. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan has been hailed as the biggest Behavioural Change program launched by the Government that aims to build a Clean India, dismantling age old behaviours and social practices of the people.

Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Skill development would be a priority area for the Ministry of I&B in the overall communication approach for the North Eastern Region. This would complement the Government’s Act East Policy launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi last year as it would facilitate the nurturing of talent in the field of Media & Entertainment. The proposed Film & Television Institute of India in Arunachal Pradesh and the setting up of permanent campus of Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) at Aizawal would provide quality training to the young population catering to their needs and aspirations thereby acting as Talent Creators and Talent Hubs in the region. The Minister stated this while conducting Review Meeting of Programmes & Policies in North East with the officers of the Ministry in Guwahati today. Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam, senior officials of the Ministry along with officers of the North Eastern Region were present on the occasion.



Shri Naidu further mentioned that, the Film & Television Institute of India in Arunachal Pradesh would be setup on a campus of more than 50 acres and at a cost of Rs 200 Crores, as an extended campus of Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute, Kolkata. This would act as a catalyst to promote talent in different aspects of film making in the region. The Minister also mentioned the setting up of permanent campus of Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) at Aizawal which would be developed as media training hub for North East Region & South East Asian countries. The institute would be developed at an estimated cost of Rs. 25 Crores.

Regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Public Broadcaster, Shri Naidu mentioned that it was critical in spreading the Development story of the Government especially the programmes and policies specific to the North Eastern Region. The Minister mentioned that only way for development in the region was peace and that Terrorism and Insurgency was anti-development.  He mentioned that it was essential to develop programmes in local dialects and languages in order to reach out to diverse sections of the society.  He mentioned that currently AIR broadcasts in 28 dialects belonging to the North Eastern Region in order to bring a better connect with the people.

The Minister while talking about Community Radio said that recently the Ministry increased the subsidy level to 90% for setting up Community Radio stations in the North East Region. Community Radio Stations broadcasted programmes on issues which are of immediate relevance to the community and there by facilitated development by disseminating information regarding education, rural development, agriculture, health, nutrition environmental, social welfare, Panchayati Raj issues and cultural needs.



Highlighting the various Film Festivals that the Ministry has conducted in the North Eastern Region, Shri Naidu mentioned that the medium of Cinema was powerful to send across the message of peace and development in the region. The National Children’s Film Festival (NCFF), which recently concluded in Guwahati showcased value based award winning movies from the Children’s Film Society of India’s catalogue.  The special edition of Fragrances from North East also showcased movies from the North Eastern Region throughout the country in order to raise awareness and thereby enhance people to people contact.

                Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu, has said that Mahatma Gandhiprovided valuable lessons of Humanity, Compassion and Determination to the “Young Minds”. It gave the Generation Next an opportunity to understand the essence of his philosophy “My Life is My Message”. The young generation ought to understand the spirit and intent of the supreme sacrifices made by our freedom fighters from across the different regions in the country. To carry the message of Gandhiji forward, bookson his Ideas and Teachings must be made available to readers for inspiration. The Minister stated this while releasing the Heritage book Gandhi in Champaran Published by Publications Division in collaboration with National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi. Ms AparnaBasu, Chairperson National Gandhi Museum and senior officials from the Ministry were also present on the occasion.

 Referring to recent Mann Ki Baat address where the Prime Minister himself spoke on the importance of Champaran movement and Gandhiji’s struggle, Shri Naidu mentioned that Champaran Satyagraha was first Non Violent Jan Andolan that Mahatma Gandhi spearheaded in India. The struggle at Champaran became the inspiration for future struggle for India’s Independence. 

Complimenting the efforts of Publications Division in restoring and re-publishing Heritage archival literature, Shri Naidu said that the Government had always aimed to mainstream the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi by working towards the welfare of the poorest of the poor. He also mentioned that Publications Division should strive to restore and publish other relevant literature& publications related to GandhijiandRegional Freedom Fighters. The books onGandhiji would provide a further fillip to the Flagship Schemes of the Government such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan DhanYojana and Skill India which have been aimed at bringing about equality and empowerment. 



 

Regarding the books released, the publication “Gandhi in Champaran” would bring to the contemporary reader an account of that important phase of Indian struggle for independence. The book aims at reliving, recounting & retelling the experiences that have had a deep impact on Gandhi and how it had shaped the course of our nation’s history.

The Minister also released two other titles namely, Romain Rolland and Gandhi Correspondence and Mahatma Series (8 volumes) by DG Tendulkar, published by Publications Division. The book “Romain Rolland and Gandhi Correspondence” is a collection of letters, diary extracts and articles of Romain Rolland’s correspondence with and about Mahatma Gandhi and other writings, including extracts from his diary. The book “Mahatma Series ( 8 volumes)” is a  biography of Mahatma Gandhi, conceived and written by DG Tendulkar during the lifetime of Bapu which has been restored from the edition revised by the author himself and published by Publications Division in the early sixties.

All these restored titles were published in the 1950s and 60s and gave the most authentic account and description of that iconic Freedom Struggle which has shaped the destiny of our nation.

                Shri M Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information & Broadcasting has said that the Development and Growth story of India was unparalleled in the World today. The dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has transformed the nation and put it on the fast road to development with the mantra Reform, Perform and Transform. MODI (Making of Developed India) movement was the story that is spreading all across the country. The story of India should focus on India as an Emerging Economy, Growing Superpower, Vibrant Democracy, Responsible Power and Largest & Youngest workforce in the World.  The Minister stated this at the valedictory session of the Conference on Communicating India organised by Vivekananda International Foundation in association with University of Westminster, IIMC, Prasar Bharati and Nehru Memorial Museum  here today.



Highlighting the importance of traditional media and new forms of media like social media, Shri Naidu said that both forms of communication were necessary to ensure integrated and seamless connection with different sections of the society and varied target audiences. Citing the example of Prime Minister Shri Naidu said, the Prime Minister extensively used Twitter platform to communicate his thoughts and ideas and also innovatively used Radio for the Mann ki Baat program to reach out to the people.

Emphasizing on the rising aspirations of youth in the country, Shri Naidu said that the current generation priorities were focussed on Growth and Development of the country and participated in the development processes through communicating their ideas and thoughts. With the changing technology paradigm, a new trend of citizen journalism has emerged in the communication domain where citizens themselves have become the writers, editors and publishers.



Elaborating further, the Minister said that Communication was very critical in the governance agenda. He mentioned that communication had become the most important cog in the wheel of National Development which supported government’s priorities and helped deliver programmes and benefits thereon to the people. The Minister emphasized on the focused communication strategy for some of its major flagship schemes like Swachh Bharat, Skill India, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Make in India in the past three years.

Citing the examples of path breaking flagship schemes of the Government such as Jan Dhan Yojana and Pahal (Give it Up), Shri Naidu said that western media should acknowledge the various developmental and path breaking initiatives taking place in the country that has transformed the lives of people.

Commenting on the role of media, Shri Naidu said that there has to be a clear difference between News and Views else the narrative gets a biased push, thereby rendering the entire communication ecosystem worthy less. 

The Minister while speaking on the Media & Entertainment sector in India, said it is having tremendous potential to break all previous records. Elaborating further he said, India was the biggest producer of general entertainment combined with the advantage of the IT Sector and young workforce, was the right moment to give India’s soft power a big push. India was in the midst of an unprecedented revolution in regards to production, distribution and consumption of general entertainment, music, cinema, television programmes etc. The Government for one had taken many initiatives to transform the entire Government Machinery, converting Red Tapism to Red Carpet by providing opportunities and facilitating their participation.

According to it, a member would only be required to submit a self-declaration, which has already been included in the composite claim form, to avail advance under the EPF Scheme in case of illness of members/ dependent and also in case of differently abled members. 

This is in continuation of initiatives taken by EPFO as part of next phase of its e-governance reforms with a view to make the services of EPFO available to its stakeholder in an efficient and transparent manner. An administrative order was issued on 20.02.2017 in the matter of Introduction of Composite Claim Forms (Aadhar and Non-Aadhar ) to replace existing Claim Forms No. 19, 10C & 31 and Forms No. 19 (UAN), 10C(UAN) & 31 (UAN). EPFO has since implemented Universal Account Number (UAN) for its subscribers. It is now possible for subscribers, who have seeded their UAN with Aadhar Number and Bank account details, to submit claim forms directly to EPFO without the attestation of employers.

                The Government has undertaken an exercise to promote ease of compliance of LabourLaws and Rules byvarious establishments. The “Rationalisation of Forms and Reports under Certain Labour Laws Rules, 2017” has reduced the number of forms and reportsprescribed under 3 Acts and the Rules made thereunder from 36 to 12. The overall aim of the exercise is to make the forms and reports easy to understand for the users. This will save efforts, costs and lessen the compliance burden of various establishments.As per the sixth Economic Census of Central Statistical Office, conducted during 2013-2014,there are about 5.85 crore establishments in agriculture and non- agriculture sectors of the country.


While reviewing the requirement of filing forms under various Labour Lawsit was observed that 36 forms prescribed under 3 Acts and the Rules made thereunder had several overlapping/redundant fields. Therefore, an exercise was undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and Employment to do away with overlapping fields and reduce the number of forms. An intention notification for reducing the number of forms and reports was placed in the public domain on 9th February, 2017 and objections and suggestions thereon were sought from all stake-holders.

The Labour Laws under which these forms are filed include:


(I)    The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970
(II)    The Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979
(III)    The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996.

The Ministry of Labour & Employment has notified “Ease of Compliance to maintain Registers under various Labour Laws Rules, 2017” on 21st February 2017 which has in effect replaced the 56 Registers/Forms prescribed under 9 Central Laws and Rules made there under into 5 common Registers/Forms. Such exercise has reduced the number of data fields from about 933 to about 144. This will save efforts, costs and lessen the compliance burden by various establishments. 

Reforms in labour laws are an ongoing process to update legislative system to address the need of the hour and to make them more effective and contemporary to the emerging economic and industrial scenario. The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare; and Safety and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. Further, amendments in individual Labour Act viz. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986, Payment of Wages Act 1936, Payment of Bonus Act 1965, Maternity Benefit Act 1961 have also been carried out. These legislative initiatives will improve the wage security, job security and social security of the workers.

                Minister of Law & Justice and Electronics & IT, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad today appealed to all those involved in the delivery of justice to join hands in improving the system to ensure that assistance is available to every citizen irrespective of his socio-economic position. He said this after the launch of three key legal aid and empowerment initiatives of the Department of Justice – including ‘Pro bono legal services’, ‘Tele law service’ and ‘Nyaya Mitra scheme’. The Minister also mentioned that the country’s legal system would be digitally transformed, as digital inclusion holds the key to the country’s march towards Digital India.

 

The Minister emphasized the need for increased opportunities of legal aid and awareness for people, especially the marginalised sections of the society. He said that the three initiatives launched today were aimed at fulfilling the department’s core mandate of enhancing ‘access to justice’ for the poor and vulnerable communities, including making accessible quality and effective legal aid for them. He acknowledged and appreciated the initiatives undertaken, over the last two decades, to safeguard and deliver this right to citizens, first, by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and subsequently by the Department of Justice – both of whom have the shared mandate of delivering adequate and efficient legal aid to the marginalised and vulnerable sections. The Minister also underscored that the initiatives launched by the department here are to supplement the efforts of NALSA and not to overlap the activities undertaken by the legal services authorities.

 

Pro bono legal Services

The ‘Pro bono legal services’ initiative is a web based platform, through which interested lawyers can register themselves to volunteer pro bono services for the underprivileged litigants, who are unable to afford it. The Department of Justice has launched the online application for this initiative on its website doj.gov.in. Through this online portal, litigants from marginalised communities (including members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women, children, senior citizens, persons with low income and persons with disabilities) can also apply for legal aid and advice from the pro bono lawyers.

 

The Minister described this effort as an ‘earnest step’ towards fulfilling the mandate of quality legal aid for all. He noted that many from the legal fraternity were already volunteering legal support for the underprivileged clients, in an individual capacity. However, he stressed that the time has come to promote the concept of pro bono legal aid in an institutionalized manner and ensure that those who volunteer their valuable time and service towards this public service are duly recognized.

 

The Minister called upon all lawyers from across the country to wholeheartedly support this initiative and help in fulfilling the constitutional mandate of legal aid for all.

 

Tele Law: Mainstreaming Legal Aid through Common Service Centre

Through the second initiative, launched by the Minister, the Department of Justice and NALSA are partnering with CSC- E- Governance Service Limited for mainstreaming legal aid to the marginalized communities through the Common Service Centers (CSCs). This initiative, called ‘Tele Law’, is aimed at facilitating delivery of legal advice through an expert panel of lawyers – stationed at the State Legal Services Authorities (SLSA). The project would connect lawyers with clients through video conferencing facilities at CSCs, operated by para legal volunteers. For this purpose, this initiative would also play a pivotal role in empowering 1000 women para legal volunteers.

 

The Minister said that using CSCs for mainstreaming legal aid services for the marginalized at the panchayat levels would ensure that legal aid reaches populations which remained untouched due to geographical challenges and/or lack of infrastructure. He also described the use of CSCs as change agents, enablers of community participation and capacity building in rural settings as commendable.

 

The project would be launched across 1800 panchayats in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, North Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir.

 

District Facilitation Centre to reduce pendency: Engagement of Nyaya Mitra

The Minister also discussed the issue of heavy pendency of cases in courts across the country. He noted that at present, more than 2.4 crore cases are pending in the district and lower judiciary, of which nearly 10% are more than 10 years old. He called for collective action and efforts in remedying this situation. In this context, the Minister also inaugurated the Nyaya Mitra scheme, which is aimed at reducing pendency of cases across selected districts, with special focus on those pending for more than 10 years.

 

Functionalized through a retired judicial or executive officer (with legal experience) designated as the ‘Nyaya Mitra’, the project would be operated out of District Facilitation Centres, housed in CSCs. Nyaya Mitra’s responsibilities would include among others assistance to litigants who are suffering due to delay in investigations or trial, by actively identifying such cases through the National Judicial Data Grid, providing legal advice and connecting litigants to DLSA, CSC Tele Law, other government agencies and civil society organisations. He/she shall also refer the marginalized applicants to Lok Adalats for dispute resolution and render assistance towards prison reforms within the district, in coordination with the district judiciary and other stakeholders.

 

This initiative would be launched in 227 districts including 27 districts from North East and Jammu & Kashmir and 200 districts from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, West Bengal etc. and would be operated out of CSCs.

 

The Minister stated that the department was committed to fulfilling its mandate of securing access to justice through these initiatives and called for support and action for all stakeholders in making them a success.

                Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Union Minister for Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation and Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting launched two important initiatives of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (Ministry of MSME), viz. Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC) portal and MyMSME Mobile App on the occasion of the 15th Meeting of the National Board for MSME here today. Union Minsiter for MSME Shri Kalraj Mishra, Minister of State for MSME Shri Giriraj Singh and Minister of State for MSME Shri Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary were present on this august occasion

The Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Shri Kalraj Mishra and the Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Shri Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary are also seen.
			
		
	


 

 

 

 

 

 

Shri Kalraj Mishra, speaking on the occasion, said that Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC) portal on http://msefc.msme.gov.in, would facilitate implementation of the delayed payment provisions of the MSMED Act 2006 and also assist in monitoring of delayed payment cases. This online platform is expected to be a significant step in the direction of Digital India from the perspective of the MSME Sector in the country. With the access to this platform, micro and small enterprises would be able to file their delayed payment related grievances online. The grievance filed would be communicated through email and SMS to the parties involved. It would also help officers of the Ministry of MSME as well as the State Government concerned in monitoring the progress of cases both at the State and National levels. He also informed that most of the States have already uploaded the information regarding delayed payment cases on MSEFC portal. As on 31.03.2017, 3690 cases involving an amount of Rs.1660 crore are being considered by various MSEFCs. In fact, the online portal would be of great help to start-ups since delayed payment is probably the single biggest problem for start-ups.

 

In addition, the MyMSME mobile app on http://my.msme.gov.in, also launched by Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, provides information on all schemes implemented by the Ministry of MSME at one place. The MSME units have had always been complaining that information on all schemes were not available at a single place. Such a compilation is certainly the need of the hour so as to ensure that entrepreneurs need not be searching multiple windows for help or information. With the help of MyMSME mobile app Ministry of MSME would be providing one single window to MSMEs to access information on all schemes implemented by the Ministry and as well as apply for any of them. And MSMEs can also lodge grievances pertaining to Ministry of MSME through this app. 

 

Prime Minister has recently spoken about the need for moving forward to M-Governance (Mobile Governance) from e-Governance, on the occasion of the Civil Services Day celebrations. This mobile app has enabled the MSME Sector to usher in the era of M-Governance.

 

Union Minister of State for MSME Shri Haribhai Choudhary stated that the Ministry has embarked on the journey to make every scheme online.  He stated that MSME Internet grievance monitoring system has already resolved the grievances of more than 3000 persons.

 

Shri Venkaiah Naidu, Hon’ble Union Minister for Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation and Information & Broadcasting appreciated the efforts of the Minister in taking various initiatives towards ease of doing business in the MSME Sector in the country. He also congratulated Shri Kalraj Mishraji for taking steps in line with Prime Minister’s Digital India mission.

                Shri Piyush Goyal @PiyushGoyal, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power @MinOfPower, Coal @CoalMinistry, New and Renewable Energy @mnreindia and Mines @MinesMinIndia, will inaugurate the multisensory aero-geophysical survey of the Obvious Geological Potential (OGP) and adjoining areas of the country through video conferencing in the Constitution Club New Delhi tomorrow i.e. 7 April 2017. Two aircrafts equipped with geophysical sensors belonging to a consortium of service providers led by M/s McPhar International (India) with partners EON Geosciences Inc. (Canada) and Kiwi Air Ltd. (New Zealand) and brought from New-Zealand will be launched from Dr. Babsaheb Ambedkar International Airport, Nagpur for the aero-geophysical data acquisition.

 

The other two selected agencies i.e. M/s Scientific Production Centre GEOKEN Ltd Liability Partnership (Kazakhstan) with Helica s.r.l (Italy) and Secon Pvt. Ltd. (India) and M/s IIC Technologies Ltd (India) along with Geophysique GPR International Inc. (Canada) and Goldak Airborne Surveys (Canada) will start their operations in the third week of April 2017. The Mines Minister will also release a brochure of GSI on the Multi-sensor Aero-Geophysical Surveys over Obvious Geological Potential and adjoining areas.

 

With the exhaustion of conventional geological methods for mineral exploration based on surface manifestations in hard rock areas, necessity has arisen for search of concealed mineral deposits based on multi-thematic earth science (geological, geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing) data. The regional multi-sensor aero-geophysical surveys are considered worldwide as an important tool to scan large areas to demarcate favourable geological environments for hidden mineral resources in a short span of time. High quality aero-geophysical data are available over most of the already explored areas of many parts of the world such as Australia, Canada etc. and has resulted in locating many new concealed mineral deposits.

Geological Survey of India @GeologyIndia [#GSI] has been carrying out multi-sensor aero-geophysical surveys in different geological terrains of India since 1965. About 24 lakh square kilometres area with about 15 lakh line km has been covered with various survey specifications under different projects until date. The study of aero-geophysical surveys has led to the discovery of number of mineral deposits like Kayar (Zn-Pb, 9.2 million tonnes), Aladahalli (massive sulphides, 4.5 million tonnes) in Karnataka and Golapalle (Pb-Zn, 14 million tonnes) in Andhra Pradesh. In addition to this, survey has also delineated significant Uranium anomaly in Nalgonda, Andhra Pradesh.

The National Mineral Exploration Policy NMEP unveiled in July 2016 has provisioned the implementation of a national geophysical mapping programme for acquiring baseline geoscience data in order to target concealed and deep-seated mineral deposits.

GSI has planned for multi-sensor Aero-geophysical Surveys over OGP and its adjoining areas by engaging international agencies through global tender process. Under this project, around 8.13 lakh sq. km. area divided into 12 blocks is planned to be covered with line spacing of 300 m and at an altitude of 80 m above ground level. Initially four blocks have been taken up for the multisensory survey as a pilot project. In the first phase, GSI has taken up Magnetic-Gradiometric and Radiometric surveys by engaging Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) for data acquisition, processing, integration and interpretation. The promising areas of mineral potential once identified by this project,  further high resolution Electromagnetic, Gravity, Gravity-Gradiometric and Magnetic surveys will be done in selected smaller blocks. GSI has selected a consultant for the Technical Supervision and Quality Control (TS-QC) by global tender process for the completion of the pilot project to cover four identified blocks during 2017. The National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) is wholly funding the project and these surveys will be completed by December 2017.

Three PIAs are selected to carry out the multisensory survey. A consortium led by M/s McPhar International (India) with partners EON Geosciences Inc. (Canada) and Kiwi Air Ltd. (New Zealand) will cover two blocks, 59,111 sq. km. area ( Block-1) falling in  Barmer, Jodhpur, Pali,  Jalore and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan and Palanpur district, Gujarat and 48,052 sq. km. area (Block-4)  in Bhandara distict,  Maharashtra and Balaghat, Rajnandgaon, Durg & Raipur districts, Chhattisgarh. The consortium led by M/s Scientific Production Centre GEOKEN Ltd Liability Partnership (Kazakhstan) with Helica s.r.l (Italy) and Secon Pvt. Ltd. (India) will cover 59,409 sq. km. area (Block-2) falling in Gwalior, Morena, Datia, Shivpuri, Tikamgarh, Chhatrapur & Panna districts of Madhya Pradesh and Hamirpur, Fatehpur , Banda, Orai, Lalitpur & Jhansi districts of  Uttar Pradesh. M/s IIC Technologies Ltd (India) along with Geophysique GPR International Inc. (Canada) and Goldak Airborne Surveys (Canada) will cover 39,452 sq. km. area (Block-3) falling in Mirzapur district, U.P.,  Satna, Rewa districts, M.P. and Aurangabad, Sasaram & Daltungunj districts, Bihar.

 M/s IDP Geosciences Services Pvt. Ltd. UK, a consortium of M/s Paterson, Grant & Watson Ltd. (Canada), International Geoscience Services Ltd (UK) and Datacode (India) has been appointed as TS-QC consultant.  The geoscientists of the GSI will also be imparted hands on training by these international experts during each phase of the project implementation. The total cost of the project including the TS-QC consultancy is estimated as Rs 111.34 Crore.

The Government believes that this will not only help in identifying mineral potential areas of the country but with the release of the acquired geophysical data private investment will be attracted in the mineral exploration sector.

·         Preponing of the Union Budget and completion of all financial business of Government before the start of next financial year by 31stMarch;

·         Passing of all the enabling acts of the Goods & Services Tax (GST);

·         Presenting and passing of an Integrated Budget.

 

This has been possible due to the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Shri ArunJaitley along with the participation of all members of both Houses of Parliament in constructive debates held on various issues of public importance, the Minister added.

 

Shri Ananth kumar informed that this is for the first time in Indian legislative history that all financial business of Government has been completed before the start of next financial year by 31stMarch and that too without any short cuts by following due process of general discussion, scrutiny by Standing Committees, discussions on some individual Ministries etc.    Whenever in the past financial business was completed before 31stMarch, those were either election years having interim budgets or in other cases scrutiny by Parliamentary Committees was dispensed with. This is a big financial reform so as to make full funds available to line Ministries for execution of their developmental projects. This is the first time when Vote on Account was dispensed with during the Budget session.

 

Speaking on the occasion Shri S.S. Ahluwalia, Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and Parliamentary Affairs, explained in detail about the advantages of preponing the Budget, merger of General and Railway Budgets, and how it will facilitate the efficient deployment of financial resources for carrying social development works. 

 

Minister of State for Minority Affairs (IC) and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi informed the media that the Government followed the policy of ‘Sampark, Samvaad, Samanvaya’ and ensuredthat all issues of wide public importance debated upon in depth by giving all members of both Houses a chance to present their views and derive a constructive consensus to move forward. He noted that 3 important bills namely,Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2017 for giving Constitutional status to the backward classes commission, Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017 and Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2016, could not be passed by both Houses. Shri Naqvi said that the opposition to these bills was not on merit but still the Government respected the consensus in Rajya Sabha to refer them to the Select Committee. The Minister noted that the delay in passage of these socially important bills will prevent the common people to derive benefits for some more time.

 

Regarding the Legislative Business carried out during the Budget Session 2017, it was informed that the first part of the Budget Session yielded a total of 7 sittings of Lok Sabha and 8 sittings of the Rajya Sabha.  In the second part of the Session there were 22 sittings of Lok Sabha and 21 sittings of Rajya Sabha.  During the entire Budget Session, 2017 there were in total 29 sittings each of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.The productivity of Lok Sabha was 113.27% and that of Rajya Sabha was 92.43%.

                Before the commencement of business in the Lok Sabha today Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, Speaker, Lok Sabha, congratulated the members of the House for completion of entire budgetary process before beginning of new financial year and said that it is the beginning of a very important tradition in the Indian Parliamentary system. This has been achieved by active participation of all parliamentarians and support of all political parties, she added. 

Smt. Mahajan said, “On this historic achievement I would like to thank the Prime Minister and Finance Minister who visualized this change. I complement the Council of Ministers who worked very hard to achieve it. I would especially like to thank Shri Ananthkumar, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, who coordinated with everybody and implemented it meticulously.” 

She thanked all the MPs who played the role of vigilant and responsible peoples’ representatives by participating in late sittings of the house. Smt Mahajan also thanked all officials of Lok Sabha secretariat, Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Affairs for their dedication and support. 

The Speaker observed that earlier the Union Budget used to get passed in April and a delay in budgetary allocations of four to five months had become the norm. The completion of the whole Budgetary process before 31st march means that the government departments will have budgetary allocations from the first day of the new financial year and they would have full year to spend on new programmes. Further, this will help all the State governments in their budgetary preparations.

Smt. Anita Kapur, Member, Competition Appellate Tribunal delivered CVC lecture on the topic “Tax Regime for countering Corruption” here today. This was the 18th lecture of the “Lecture Series” organised by the Central Vigilance Commission.

In her address, Smt. Kapur drew attention to the relationship between transparency, development and corruption in various countries. The provisions of various international tax agreements as well as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) were explained and implications for tax enforcement as well as the concerns of investigative agencies other than tax authorities were explained. The broader shift from request based sharing of information between countries to automatic exchange of information in respect of financial transactions was highlighted in the lecture. The address was followed by a question and answer session with the audience.

Speaking on the occasion, the Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri KV Chowdary said that corruption and black money are affecting a large number of people in the country. Shri Chowdary said with an amendment to the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, the CVC has been empowered, since 2015, as a Notified Authority to receive information relating to suspicious transactions.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, presented awards for Excellence in Implementation of Priority Programmes and addressed Civil Servants on the occasion of the eleventh Civil Services Day here today.

These awards were given in three Groups, the first group consisting of eight North-Eastern States and the three Hill States of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, second group comprising of the seven Union Territories and the remaining 18 States constituting the third group.

For Start-Up India, the award was given to Gujarat state under other states category and for Stand-Up India, the award was given to North and Middle Andaman of Andaman & Nicobar islands under Union Territories category.

 

The Prime Minister also released two books “New Beginning” on Innovations for the Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence and “Fostering Excellence” for initiatives under identified Priority Programmes.

 

During the function, “Making New India-2017”, a film by DARPG was also screened.

 

Addressing the Civil Servants on the occasion, the Prime Minister described this day as one of “rededication,” and said that civil servants are well aware of their strengths and capabilities, challenges and responsibilities. 


He said conditions prevailing today are quite different from about two decades ago, and would evolve much further over the next few years. Elaborating on this, the Prime Minister said that earlier, Government was almost the sole provider of goods and services, which left a lot of scope for ignoring one’s shortcomings. However, now, very often, people perceive that the private sector offers better services than Government. The Prime Minister said that with alternatives now being available in several areas, the responsibilities of Government officers have increased. He added that this increase is not in terms of scope of work, but in terms of the challenge. 


The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of competition, which brings qualitative change. He said that the sooner the attitude of Government can change from regulator to enabler, the faster this challenge of competition will become an opportunity. 

The Prime Minister said that while the absence of Government in a sphere of activity should be perceptible, its presence in a sphere of activity should not become a burden. He asked civil servants to strive towards such arrangements. 


Noting the quantum jump in the applications for Civil Service Day awards, from less than 100 last year to over 500 this year, the Prime Minister said that the focus should now be on improving quality, and making excellence a habit. 


The Prime Minister urged senior officers to ensure that experience does not become a burden that stifles innovation of younger officers. 


Shri Narendra Modi said that anonymity is one of the greatest strengths of the civil services. He cautioned officers that the use of social media should not lead to a decline in this strength, even as social media and mobile governance are leveraged for connecting people to benefits and government schemes. 


Speaking in the context of “reform, perform and transform”, the Prime Minister said that political will is needed for reform, but the “perform” part of this formulation must come from civil servants, while transformation is enabled by people’s participation.


The Prime Minister said that civil servants must ensure that every decision is taken keeping national interest in mind, and this should be their touchstone for taking a decision. 

Recalling that the year 2022 would mark 75 years of independence, he urged civil servants to play the role of catalytic agents in fulfilling the dreams of freedom fighters. 

 

The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the celebration of Civil Services Day has undergone a considerable change during the last three years and has now emerged as an effective platform for mutual exchange of best practices. He said that this year, 599 districts participated in the PM Awards competition, as compared to 74 districts last year. He said that this shows the trend towards competitive federalism and now more and more districts are competing for these awards by improving their performance in various Priority Programmes. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances made an elaborate exercise through a platform for young officers and 615 IAS officers of four batches (2013-2016) spent about 2000 hours and provided their inputs on this platform, he added. The Minister said that this year’s theme of CSD is ‘Making New India’, which is on the lines of the Prime Minister’s vision of New India. Without good Civil Servants, we can never achieve good governance, he added. He also emphasised on the Maximum Governance and Minimum Government.

 

Earlier, the Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K. Sinha in his welcome address highlighted the entire process involved in the selection of awardees through different committees for initiatives under the various Priority Programmes. The Department organised workshops at different places for replication of identified good governance initiatives of the Government, he added.

 

Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Shri Nripendra Misra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Dr P. K.  Mishra, Secretary, DARPG Shri C. Viswanath, former Cabinet Secretaries were also present on the occasion, in addition to senior officers from the Central and State Governments.

 

The two-day Civil Services Day programme was inaugurated by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh here yesterday. The inaugural session was followed by a Plenary Session on the topic ‘Creating value through Human Capital Management in Government’ and three Breakaway Sessions on subjects related to Agriculture, Energy and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship were also held.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has called for focus on control of Diabetes in young and said that this is not only a health priority but also a national priority considering the invaluable potential of the youth energy in the making of “New India”. 

Addressing the inaugural session of conference on Non-Communicable Diseases as chief guest here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the disease spectrum in India, over the last few decades, has shifted from Communicable to Non-Communicable Diseases as a result of which, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Disease and Cancer have occupied the centre stage. This has, at the same time, also resulted in huge social and economic burden on society which has more than 65% of population below the age of 45 and, therefore, cannot afford any drainage or wastage of valuable youth potential. 

Dr Jitendra Singh cautioned that more than the rapidly spreading epidemic of Diabetes, the more serious concern is upsurge of Diabetes in younger age groups and among hitherto lesser affected sections of the society and lesser affected parts of the country including rural areas and village folk. This, he said, is also, to a great extent, because of the breakdown of the rural-urban divide resulting in unhealthy lifestyle changes across all sections of society. 

Making a strong plea for engaging in public-private partnership (PPP) modules, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Government agencies, social scientists and health professionals will have to work in tandem to devise strategies for control and prevention of Diabetes before it appears. 

Underlining the Central Government concern and priority for health issues, Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the recent decision of the Government to streamline and control the prices of cardiac stents used for heart patients. He also referred to the Government’s move for use of generic medicines and to introduce a comprehensive health policy under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

Considering the topography of some of the far-flung and inaccessible areas of the country, Dr Jitendra Singh said, he had also proposed the idea of having “Air-Clinic” set up inside a helicopter with a specialist and requisite equipment as well as paramedics which could be used as an OPD at more than one places on a single day.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, during the meeting held on March 10, 2017, directed that a paper may be sought from the District Collectors/Magistrates of all States/ UTs on the optimum utilization of human resources and building a competent and well-functioning administrative structure which is geared to adapt to the changing needs and aspirations of the citizens of the country. The papers need to focus on meeting human capital related challenges and suggest workable solutions. In pursuance to the directions of the Prime Minister, DCs/DMs of all States/ UTs were requested to submit their views and suggestion on the topic on PM Awards portal, developed by DAR&PG. DCs/DMs from across the country were reached out and sensitized by sharing a background note on 'Creating value through Human Capital Management in Government' and through letters, call center, social media, video-conferences etc. Inputs have been received from 533 DCs/DMs. Some of the key issues and the solutions have been suggested by the DMs and DCs along the lines of resource optimization, process simplification, technology enablement, and fostering innovation.

Pursuant to the directions of the Prime Minister, the shortlisted initiatives were shared with IAS batches of 2013-16 through the DARPG web-portal (link: http://darpg.gov.in and http://darpg.wooaer.com/).They were requested to go through all the case studies, discuss with District Collectors/Magistrates or field officers and submit their suggestions on implementation of programmes through an online questionnaire. DAR&PG reached out to all the officers, through multiple calls, social media and video-conferences, to sensitize and provide handholding support for undertaking the exercise. A total of 615 officers undertook this exercise and submitted their suggestions online. A total of 2,150 hours were spent by the young IAS officers in reviewing the case studies and submitting their responses. From the responses, it came out that agriculture-related priority programmes are better understood by the officers, e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) being the best understood programme. The overwhelming response reflects the enthusiasm and motivation amongst the young officers. These would also be discussed in the three breakaway sessions to be held on 20th April 2017.

                The attention is drawn to the media news about extension of working hours of Central Government employees by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India. It has been stated in the news item that Central Government employees’ working hours will be changed from 09.00 AM to 07.00 PM. It was also stated that the holiday of Saturday will also be done away with for the Central Government employees.

In this regard, the DoPT clarifies that there is no such proposal under consideration of the Central Government. The media news regarding the extension of working hours and abolition of holiday on Saturday for Central Government employees is false and baseless. There is no oral or unwritten order issued in this regard.

With effect from 7th March 2017, Government has simplified and liberalised the conditions for taking advance from the fund by the subscribers for education, illness, purchase of consumer durables. Conditions and procedures for withdrawal from the fund for the purpose of education, illness, housing, purchase of motor vehicles etc. have also been liberalised. No documentary proof is required to be submitted now for advance and withdrawal applications. A simple declaration by the subscriber is sufficient. A time limit for sanction and payment of advance/withdrawal has also been fixed.

There is no proposal under consideration of Government to increase/link the rate of interest on GPF at parity with that of EPF. The interest rates on EPF are decided on the recommendations of the Central Board of Trustee (EPF) taking into account the yearly income from the investment made by EPFO. The GPF interest rate is presently fixed at par with that of PPF interest rate.

""Making New India” will be the theme for Civil Services Day, 2017 scheduled to be held on 20th and 21st of this month in New Delhi. This was disclosed here today by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh after the conclusion of a high level meeting to review the preparations for the two-day event which is expected to have the largest ever participation to compete for Prime Minister's Awards for Excellence. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will give away the awards for excellence in implementation of priority programmes on the occasion of Civil Services Day. On the occasion, three films will be shown respectively on, award winning initiatives, citations of the award winning achievements and the entire process of initiating, selecting and finalizing the awards as well as conceptualizing and holding of the event. 

A unique feature of this year’s event, Dr Jitendra Singh said, that on the advice of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, young IAS Collectors and probationers of the last four years from 2013 to 2016, were engaged to send their responses as feedback. Out of a total of 691 IAS officers across the country from these four batches, he said, as many as 615 put in their responses. This year’s awards, Dr Jitendra Singh said, will be based primarily on excellence in implementation of five priority programmes of Government of India, which include (i) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), (ii) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), (iii) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), (iv) e-National Agriculture Market (eNAM) and (v) “Start Up India, Stand Up India”. In addition, he said, awards shall also be presented for innovation work done in areas of environment, conservation, disaster management, education, health, women and child initiatives, etc. 

Of the 2,345 entries received for the awards, Dr Jitendra Singh informed, 1515 have been received from 599 districts under the priority programmes category and 830 from various organizations and Government agencies under innovation category. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that under the inspiration of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the entire concept and format of Civil Services Day has evolved in the last two years and transformed from being a mere ritual to an elaborate stimulating academic event inspiring a sense of healthy competition among the different districts and States of the country to excel each other in implementing the various public welfare schemes and programmes of Government of India. In addition, he said, it has also inculcated a spirit of healthy competition among young Collectors and Deputy Commissioners across the country to showcase their work and to share it with the rest of the fraternity across the country. 

While the event will be spread over two days and into different sessions touching upon different areas, Dr Jitendra Singh said, an effort is also being made to have some of the most distinguished resource-persons to deliver keynote addresses during different sessions. 

The Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) Shri C. Viswanath and senior officers of the Ministry of Personnel were present at the meeting.

The Government has issued instructions to all the Ministries/Departments of Govt. of India from time to time impressing upon the Public Authorities to disclose maximum information proactively under Section 4 of RTI Act, so as to reduce the need for filing RTI applications by the citizens.

For speedy disposal of pending cases the Government has taken several steps like capacity building through training of Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs) / Public Information Officers (PIOs) and issue of guidelines for PIOs and First Appellate Authorities (FAAs), so as to enable them to supply information / dispose of first appeal effectively, resulting into less number of ‘First Appeals’ and ‘Appeals’ to the Information Commission.

 

This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Prof. M.V. Rajeev Gowda in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that intellectual honesty is as important as intellectual thought and that most of the conflicts in intellectual arena arise when the thought is devoid of honesty and instead influenced by extraneous considerations. 

In his inaugural address as Chief Guest at the one day conference on the theme “Communicating India”, organized by Vivekananda International Foundation in collaboration with Prasar Bharati, here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said a constant introspection coupled with critical appraisal of one’s inner self is what finally churns out an unbiased belief or conviction. Describing youth aspiration as the predominant factor determining contemporary India’s thought process, Dr Jitendra Singh appealed the youth to seek one’s own original belief from the core of one’s conviction. 

Dr Jitendra Singh’s lecture was followed by a lucid interaction in which youth from different streams of academics participated with great enthusiasm and involvement.

Section 33 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 mandates every appropriate Government to appoint in every establishment such percentage of vacancies not less than three per cent for persons or class of persons with disability of which one per cent each shall be reserved for persons suffering from (i) blindness or low vision, (ii) hearing impairment and (iii) locomotor disability or cerebral palsy, in the posts identified for each disability

Promotions to the higher grades are made as per provisions of the relevant Recruitment Rules. In some of the Recruitment Rules, provisions exist for promotion either on the basis of seniority in service or through Limited Departmental Competitive Examinations. The candidates, who do not qualify the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination are promoted on the basis of their inter-se-seniority in the feeder grade.

However, in cases where the departmental promotion test is the only mode of promotion, proposal to give promotion on the basis of the seniority or merit in service alone is not under consideration.

This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Shri Chandu Lal Sahu, Shri Om Birla and Shri Chandra Prakash Joshi in the Lok Sabha today.

Government committed to full and easy implementation of RTI 
 

A factually incorrect and misleading news report appeared in a section of the media that a new set of RTI Rules have been formulated which creates difficulties and hurdles in the right of the citizens to get information from the Government. It has been alleged that the size of the RTI has been restricted to 500 words and a provision of fees has been unfairly introduced in the Rules. 

The facts are totally to the contrary. On 31st July, 2012, the Central Government notified the RTI Rules under Section 27 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. A copy of existing rules is available on the official website of DOPT. The Rules provided that an RTI application will ordinarily be not more than 500 words (subject to exception) with a nominal fee being charged from each applicant. These Rules were framed and notified in 2012. 

However, legality of the CIC (Management) regulations of 2007 was challenged before the Delhi High Court and these were quashed. The matter has been pending before the Supreme Court. The Government therefore decided, in consultation with the CIC, that a comprehensive set of rules be notified by consolidating the key provisions of CIC (Management) Regulations and also the Rules of 2012. Same has been put up in public domain for comments. 

The key provisions of the RTI Rules, 2012 have been identically incorporated verbatim. No change has been made in the RTI fee structure. The Government is committed to ensuring a full and easy implementation of the Right to Information. 

The factual position on the proposed Rules is as follows: 

1. The existing RTI Rules 2012 notified on 31st July, 2012 specifically provide in section 3 that an application shall ordinarily not contain more than 500 words excluding annexure. It further provides that no application shall be rejected only on the grounds that it contains more than 500 words. There is no change proposed in these provisions in the new rules. 

2. The provision with respect to charging rates is identical to that contained in existing RTI Rules 2012 which provides for charging rates as per price fixed for a publication or Rs.2 per page of photocopy for extracts from the publication. There is a further provision in rule 5 that no fee under rule 3 and rule 4 shall be charged from any person who is below poverty line. This provision has been retained as such in the new proposed rules. Therefore, there is no change in fee and the existing rules have been proposed to be continued. 

3. There is no change in the postal charges for sending the information. 

4. The proposed rules do not limit the filing of either complaint or appeal “online” only. Both rule 8 and rule 13 dealing with filing of appeals and complaints especially provide for filing offline as well as online. 

5. The provision for withdrawal of appeal, which was earlier included in the Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations 2007 has been included in the new rules. Similarly, the provision for abatement of appeals/complaints on the death of the applicant/ complainant, which was earlier included in the Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations 2007, has also been included. 

6. With regards to the provision of officials being allowed to file documents to counter claims of false information, it is clarified that at present, as per the procedure of CIC, once appeal is taken cognizance of, the CPIOs are given a notice to furnish their submission before the appeal is decided. This was also part of the Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations 2007 which are now being incorporated in the rules. Therefore, the existing standard operating procedure has been proposed to be incorporated in the rules. 

As can be seen from above, the allegation that there is a move to dilute the provisions of RTI is unfounded. The proposed amendments to the rules are in public domain for comments by April 15, 2017 and will be finalised keeping in view the public feedback received in the matter. The comments can be sent both online and in hard copy to the Department.

Addressing the media during a press conference, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan emphasized on Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision for fast paced development of Eastern India which is a prerequisite for the overall development of India. He said that for fast pace development in Eastern India, massive infrastructure investment in an agri focused Eastern India will give a fillip to the Second Green Revolution in the region. Shri Pradhan said that massive investment to the tune of Rs 50,000 Crore is being undertaken for revival of closed fertilizer plants and setting up of gas pipeline network to connect Eastern India to the National Gas Grid.

 

Petroleum Minister informed that the key components of this infrastructure investment will be revival of Fertilizer Plants at Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Barauni (Bihar) and Sindri (Jharkhand), and Talcher (Odisha); Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga pipeline of 2650 Km and setting up of LNG terminal at Dhamra (Odisha).

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production

 

3.1    PSU Refineries’ production during March, 2017 was 12139.82 TMT which is 2.70% higher than the target for the month and 1.57% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 137394.61 TMT which is 1.34% higher than the target for the period and 8.11% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:

v  IOCL, Paradip:  Throughput is lower due to coke containment. 

v  IOCL, Haldia:  Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up due to problems in OHCU. 

v  IOCL, Digboi / Guwahati: Lower availability of Assam crude. 

v  BPCL, Mumbai:  Throughput is lower due to shifting of CDU3 shutdown and BS4 implementation.

v  CPCL, Manali: Lower due OHCU shutdown.

 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during March, 2017 was 1347.74 TMT which is 42.08% higher than the target for the month and 14.42% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved signing of Framework of Understanding (FoU) on Cooperation in the Hydrocarbon Sector with Bangladesh, setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh as ""an Institute of National Importance"" through an Act of Parliament and also approved the Policy to provide Purchase Preference (linked with Local Content PP-LC) in all Public Sector Undertakings under Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas on 12th April, 2017.

The Secretary for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri K D Tripathi held a press conference and briefed the media on the various cabinet decisions taken for the Ministry.

The Secretary said that the ‘Make in India’ initiative was launched by Prime Minister in September, 2014 as part of a wider set of nation-building initiatives devised to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub. In tune with the campaign, the Government has decided to incentivize the growth in local content in goods and services while implementing oil and gas projects in India through a policy for providing Purchase Preference to the manufactures/services providers who meet the local targets in oil and gas business activities.

Under the policy, progressively increasing targets of Local Content are being stipulated for procurement of goods, services and EPC contracts for oil and gas business activities. The manufacturers/service provider who meet the local content targets and whose quoted price is within 10% of lowest valid price bid, would be eligible for 10% purchase preference for a stipulated portion of the purchase order, on matching such price. For example, Drilling/Workover Rigs/WSS units construction in the onshore sector the local content would be pegged at 50% in the first year and progressively increased to 60% in the next two years and they to 70% in last two years. Similarly, for premium bids as wells as specialized drilling and completion services the local content stipulated is 10% in the first year and progressively increased to 15% in the next two years and then to 20% in the last 2 years.

He added that the policy is expected to encourage suppliers and service providers to progressively adopt ‘Make in India’ practices and add value to their goods and services within the country. It will facilitate growth of activities related to manufacturing, services and EPC in the Indian economy. This will boost productivity and help in growth of employment at all levels in the oil and gas sector.

Shri Tripathi said that this policy is applicable to all the Public Sector Enterprises and their wholly owned subsidiaries under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; Joint Venture that have 51% or more equity by one or more Public Sector Enterprises under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; attached and subordinate offices of MoPNG.

The Cabinet had approved a Framework of Understanding on Cooperation in the Field of Hydrocarbons. This was first discussed during the visit of Petroleum Minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan to Dhaka in April 2016 with the objective to work as an umbrella framework to initiate, monitor and pursue activities of mutual interest in the oil and gas sector. It will give an institutional mechanism for our engagement with Bangladesh in the Hydrocarbon sector.

Salient Features of the proposed Framework document include -

·         Promotes the energy trade and integration of oil and gas grids of the two countries

·         Promotes investments in each other’s countries as well as in third countries, technology transfer, R&D, conducting joint studies and capacity building of human resources.

·         Provides increased trans-border economic cooperation and connectivity.

·         Promotes bilateral cooperation at the sub-regional and regional levels

·         Exchange of information to energy policy formulation in the region.

·         This Framework of Understanding shall remain in force for a period of five years, and shall be automatically renewed thereafter for a period of every five year.

The visit of PM Sheikh Hasina which took place on April 8-10 has given a further impetus to the Indo Bangladesh relations, as 22 documents were signed, including many in the field of oil and gas. Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan had visited Bangladesh during 18-19 April, 2016 and in the last two years there have been at least 7 meetings between him and his counterpart in Bangladesh. There is an institutionalised Energy Dialogue at the level of Secretary which met last month in Dhaka.

The comprehensiveness of the relationship between India and Bangladesh comes from the fact that we are already engaged in Supply of HSD from Siliguri to Parbatipur, Setting up LNG Terminal at Kutubdi island, Setting up LPG Terminal in Chittagong / Kutubdi island, Providing gas for the Khulna Power plant in Bangladesh, Working of gas grid connectivity, Refurbishment of refineries, Building of pipelines and Upstream activity in Bangladesh by Indian companies etc.

India and Bangladesh have signed three Documents: Sale Purchase Agreement between Numaligarh Refineries Ltd (NRL) and Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation for supply of High Speed Diesel to Bangladesh; Setting up of an LNG terminal in Kutubdia Island by Petronet LNG Ltd and Setting up of an LPG Terminal by IOCL in partnership with Petrobangla. In addition to these Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi along with Prime Minister of Bangladesh flagged off the Rail Rake carrying 2200 MT of HSD from Radhikapur in India to Parbatipur in Bangladesh. The rail rake travelled on the newly constructed rail route. The length of the new route is around 260 kms, almost half of the old route.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh as ""an Institute of National Importance"" through an Act of Parliament. The Institute will have the governance structure as well as legal mandate to grant degrees in a manner similar to that enjoyed by IITs. A separate Act will also impart the required status to the Institute to become a ""Centre of Excellence"" in petroleum and energy studies.

The Cabinet has also approved Rs 655.46 crore as capital expenditure to set up IIPE and contribution of Rs 200 crore towards its Endowment Fund (in addition to a contribution of Rs 200 crore from Oil Companies towards the Endowment Fund).

As committed under the 13 Schedule of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, it has been decided to set up this Institute. The objective is to meet the quantitative and qualitative gap in the supply of skilled manpower for the petroleum sector and to promote research activities needed for the growth of the sector. The academic and research activities of IIPE will derive strength from the Institute's proximity to sector-related activities such as KG-Basin, Visakhapatnam refinery and the planned Petrochemical complex at Kakinada.

Background:

Andhra Pradesh Government has allocated 200 acres of land, free of cost, for setting up of IIPE at Sabbavaram Mandal in Visakhapatnam district. IIPE has been registered as a Society under the AP Society Registration Act, 2001 on 18/04/2016. A temporary campus of IIPE has been set up from academic session 2016-17 from the Andhra University Campus with two undergraduate programmes namely, Petroleum Engineering and Chemical Engineering (with capacity of 50 students each). IIT, Kharagpur has taken up the responsibility of mentoring the Institute.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for Policy to provide Purchase Preference (linked with Local Content (PP-LC) in all Public Sector Undertakings under Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.

The Policy will be applicable for five years. A steering committee will be constituted to oversee implementation of the Policy and carry out annual review and recommend continuation of the policy from year to year basis.

Under the Policy, the targets of Local Content (LC) will be stipulated for certain oil and gas business activities. The manufacturers/ service providers who meet the local content targets and whose quoted price is within 10% of the lowest valid price bid would be eligible for purchase preference for a stipulated portion of the purchase order on matching such price.

The Policy is expected to encourage suppliers and service providers to progressively adopt 'Make in India' practices and add value to their goods and services within the country.

The Policy will apply to all the Public Sector Enterprises and their wholly owned subsidiaries, Joint Ventures that have 51% or more equity by one or more Public Sector Enterprises, attached and subordinate offices of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Background:

The ‘Make in India’ initiative was launched by Prime Minister in September, 2014 as part of a wider set of nation-building initiatives devised to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub. In tune with this campaign, the Government has decided to incentivize the growth in local content in goods and services while implementing oil and gas projects in India through a policy for providing Purchase Preference to the manufacturers/ service providers who meet the local content targets in oil and gas business activities.

The connections released includes 2 crore connections released under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which was launched on 1st May 2016 by Hon’ble Prime Minister and 1.25 crore connections to new consumers other than PMUY beneficiaries. Under PMUY, women of BPL families especially residing in rural areas have been given LPG connections. 

This increase in connections has resulted in a jump in the LPG coverage and as on 01.04.2017, the national LPG coverage is estimated to be 72.8% with 19.88 crore active consumers.

Petroleum Minister releases LPG connection to mark completion of 2 Cr connections under PMUY 
 



Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan formally launched BS-IV grade transportation fuels across the country from Bhubaneswar today. The event coincided with Utkal Divas (formation day of the State) being celebrated in Odisha.

 

To mark the historic occasion of the launch of BS-IV fuels across the country, the Hon’ble Minister symbolically commenced sale of the eco-friendly and low-emission fuels from 12 different locations across the country through live video links - Varanasi, Vijayawada, Durgapur, Gorakhpur, Imphal, Bhopal, Ranchi, Madurai, Nagpur, Patna, Guwahati and Shillong.

 

At the event, the Petroleum Minister also handed over a deposit-free domestic LPG connection under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana(PMUY) scheme to Swalia Bibi of Shikharchan Basti in Bhubaneswar to mark the completion of release of 2 crore LPG connections to women beneficiaries from below poverty line (BPL) households across the country under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana(PMUY).

 

The Minister reiterated the Ministry’s commitment to holistic vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He said that with the launch of the BS IV Fuel , a new era of clean transportation fuels has begun. This era will benefit all citizens of our country by substantially reducing pollution levels everywhere.

 

Shri Pradhan said that from today India will have “Only BS-IV” fuels. He complimented the OMCs for working in unison to set up refining infrastructure and logistics in record time for the launch of BS-IV grade fuels across the country as per schedule. The OMCs are incurring an expenditure of Rs. 90,000 crore on phase-wise upgradation of fuel quality in the country.

 

Shri Pradhan said that even though India is not a major polluting country, we shall stand by Hon’ble Prime Minister’s commitment at COP-21 in Paris that India will substantially reduce carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. Migration to BS-IV fuels shows India’s resolve to cut down emissions. The next step is to usher in BS-VI fuels by 1st April, 2020, to be at par with global standards, he said.

 

Speaking about the new milestone crossed by the PMUY scheme, Shri Pradhan said that the Government is fully committed to providing sustainable, clean and affordable energy as an essential input for economic development of India, which has emerged as the fastest going economy in the world. He said that the resounding success of initiatives like PaHaL, GiveItUp and the ongoing PMUY scheme are ample proof of the effectiveness of these socio-economic welfare schemes, which go a long way in ensuring energy inclusion of the poor.

 

Shri Pradhan expressed his happiness that the journey of PMUY started by the Hon’ble Prime Minister to transform the lives of BPL women across the country has crossed the 2 crore mark at Bhubaneswar today. He said in Odisha alone, PMUY has benefited 10 lakh BPL households and freed them from smoke-related hazards.

 

The Petroleum Ministry is vigorously pursuing various other forms of energy such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) for industries and transport sector, compressed natural gas (CNG) and AutoLPG for automobiles, and piped natural gas (PNG) for households, besides ethanol and bio-mass to expand the existing energy basket, he added.

India’s Path to Green Fuels

 

The increasing consumption of oil is directly linked to atmospheric pollution, and the health impact of the deteriorating ambient air quality linked to combustion of fuels is of serious concern in urban areas worldwide.

 

The Government of India has taken several policy measures and significant interventions to reduce vehicular emissions and improve fuel efficiency.  India has followed the regulatory pathway for fuel quality and vehicle emissions standards termed as Bharat Stage (BS). The transition has been in phases, considering the time and money that is required at the refinery end and in terms of vehicle production.

 

·      India’s fuel quality standards have been gradually tightened since the mid-1990s. The fuel upgradation programme took off with notification of vehicular emission norms for new vehicles in 1991.

·      The emission norms were revised in 1996. Low-lead gasoline was introduced in 1994 in the four metros, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.

·      On Feb 1, 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide.

·      BS 2000 (Euro I equivalent, Bharat Stage I) vehicle emission norms were introduced for new vehicles from April 2000.

·      Bharat Stage II (Euro II equivalent) emission norms for new cars were introduced in Delhi from the year 2000 and extended to the other three metro cities in the year 2001.

·      The emission norms for CNG and LPG vehicles were notified in the year 2000 and 2001, respectively. BS-III was implemented in phases during 2005-2010.

·      The current BS-IV fuel with 50 ppm (parts per million) sulphur was introduced in the year 2010 and it was to cover the entire country by 1-4-2017.

·      In 2016, the Govt. of India decided to meet international best practices by leapfrogging directly from BS-IV to BS-VI norms by skipping BS-V altogether by 1st April, 2020.

·      As the technology for BS V is not very different, it was rightly decided to go straight to BS VI grade fuels from BS IV.

·      As part of its focus on clean energy, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas is actively promoting city gas distribution networks and connecting major cities with “green highways,” which will have vehicles running on CNG and LNG with adequate re-fuelling stations.

·      Lakhs of households are getting the benefits of piped natural gas (PNG) supplies.

·      27.5 lakh vehicles in the country are benefiting from availability of CNG.

·      So far, 80 cities / districts of 19 States/UTs have been covered for development of PNG/CNG network.

                ·         Scheme is being implemented in 23 States and Union Territories

·         Annual energy savings of 295 million units

 

 Under the Government of India’s Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) over 21 lakh conventional street lights have been replaced with LED street lights across the country. The newly installed lights have led to brighter streets, feeling of enhanced safety and security among the residents and motorists. Energy Efficiency Services Limited, a Public Energy Services Company under the administration of Ministry of Power, Government of India (GoI) is the implementing agency for SLNP.

 

The installation of LED street lights has resulted in 295 million unit kWh, avoided capacity of over 73 MW and reduction of 2.3 lakh tonnes of CO2 annually. The project has been implemented across 23 states and union territories. The lighting level on roads have increased significantly after the replacement. The highest replacement of LED lights has happened in the following states:

 


	
		
			
			State
			
			
			Number of Street Lights
			
			
			Energy Saved per year (kWh)
			
		
		
			
			Rajasthan
			
			
			7,04,891
			
			
			99,054,808
			
		
		
			
			Andhra Pradesh
			
			
			5,86,037
			
			
			82,352,849

			28,180,321
			
		
		
			
			Goa
			
			
			94,856
			
			
			13,329,639
			
		
	


 

EESL is also implementing a special heritage lighting project, wherein 1000 LED street lights have been installed in Kashi region of Uttar Pradesh, and another 4000 lights are being installed.

 

The procurement price of the LED Street Lights has been reduced from Rs. 135/watt to Rs. 80/watt due to mass procurement of the lights. EESL makes the entire upfront investment in installation of the Street Lights and no additional budget allocation from the Municipalities is required. Municipalities pay EESL from the savings in energy and maintenance cost over a 7 year period, making the LED lights affordable and accessible. EESL also undertakes social audits in all states post the completion of the project.

 

EESL procurements conform to BIS specification & carry a 7 year warranty against technical defects. EESL conducts appropriate quality checks right from the bidding stage to the field level. This has resulted in the LEDs’ overall technical fault being less than 1% in the 21 lakh lights installed by EESL in the country. EESL has maintained an uptime of 95% for all street lights across the country.

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, presided over the signing of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between Delhi Metro Railways Corporation (DMRC) & Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company (MPPMC) with Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited, the implementing agency for the ‘world’s largest single­site solar power project’, the Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Power Project (UMSPP, 750MW) in Bhopal today. Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Union Minister for Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation and Information & Broadcasting, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Naidu said that Madhya Pradesh is a special state having huge resource base that is being harnessed under Shri Chouhan’s leadership. Taking a huge step towards realizing Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of 24x7 Affordable, Quality Power for All, Madhya Pradesh has successfully brought down the rate of solar power to Rs. 3.30/ unit, which is a huge revolution in its own right, Shri Naidu noted. The Minister said that seven cities in the State qualified as smart cities in the first round comprising a total of 20 cities. This has been made possible only through people's active participation and the dynamic leadership in the State, Shri Naidu said.

In his address, Shri Chouhan said that the Madhya Pradesh government has set 3 guiding principles of its performance - equitable growth, social empowerment and sustainable development. The Chief Minister noted that a decade ago even water, electricity and roads used to be challenges in the State but now due to the dynamic development model being implemented, the year on year agricultural growth will touch 25% this year and milestones like the cheapest solar power in the country are being achieved in Rewa. Madhya Pradesh has become the leading state in renewable energy sector in India, the Chief Minister said.

Congratulating Shri Chouhan on his unrelenting efforts in the direction of achieving the unprecedented scaling up of the renewable energy sector in the State, Shri Piyush Goyal informed that the Rewa UMSPP had achieved historic results with a record low first year tariff of Rs 2.97 per unit of electricity and a levelised tariff of Rs 3.30 over the term of 25 years, in the marathon online auction, which lasted 33 hours between biggest of the Global solar companies. The Rewa UMSPP becomes the first power project to conduct interstate sale of solar power to Delhi Metro. There would be huge savings to the Delhi Metro because of per unit cost of power reducing from over Rs. 4.50 to Rs. 3.30, Shri Goyal informed.

Shri Goyal also mentioned that with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and cooperation of all Chief Ministers of various States, in the last 3 years, renewable energy has seen a growth of over 370 %. As compared to 2,600 MW of installed solar power capacity in 2014, today in India there is a total of 12,200 MW of installed solar power capacity and the country would achieve the 20,000MW solar power capacity target 5 years ahead of schedule by the end of 2017, the Minister noted.

Shri Goyal appreciated the proactive way in which the Madhya Pradesh Government provided financial guarantees to make the Rewa PPAs viable. The Minister further informed that the Rewa PPA has been accepted by the central government as a standard model for all other state governments to emulate and achieve lowest electricity tariff rates through competitive bidding.

Listing out the factors responsible for the success of the Rewa UMSPP, Shri Goyal included partnership of all stakeholders; outcome-oriented decisive leadership; root cause analysis of causes of failure on previous bids; time-bound execution; innovative financial model like partnering with International Finance Corporation (IFC); focus on transparency and technology including green energy corridor for evacuation of solar power; assigning responsibility and fixing accountability of implementation at each step.

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Ministers in Madhya Pradesh Government, Shri Paras Chandra Jain, Minister for Energy, New & Renewable Energy and Shri Rajendra Shukla, Minister for Mineral Resources, Commerce, Industry and Employment, Overseas Indian Affairs, along with other senior officials of the Union Ministry of Power, State Government, DMRC and IFC.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy, and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, while presiding over the launch of ‘URJA MITRA App’ and inauguration of the ‘Rural Feeder Monitoring Scheme’ here today, said that the Government is engaged in preparing the Nation to truly get 24x7 affordable, quality and uninterrupted adequate power. 

Shri Goyal noted that “Power today, comes from information sharing and not by withholding it. URJA MITRA empowers citizens by real time information sharing on power supply.” He further added that the app is a first of its kind application which provides a central platform, Web-Portal (www.urjamitra.com) as well as Mobile App (iOS version and android version), for State Power Distribution utilities to disseminate power outage information to urban/rural power consumers across India through SMS/email/push notifications. Nevertheless, Shri Goyal directed the Ministry officials to strive harder and ensure that progressively the need to send messages for power outages should decline to zero, thereby ensuring uninterrupted 24x7 power for all. 

The Minister also informed that power consumers across the nation would have prior intimation of expected duration and cause of scheduled power outages and post fault intimation of unscheduled power outages duration. Consumer can also view real time power outages in any part of the country, lodge a complaint on power outages in its area. Complaints can also be lodged on helpline number 1912. Empowerment of all section of society has been ensured by providing vernacular mobile apps. Field staff can trigger power outage and take corrective action on outage complaints etc, he added. 

Commenting on the utility of Urja Mitra App, Shri Goyal said that this will be the life changing for millions of people in this country. “I would like to urge all the states to join in this excellent initiative to be a part of this effort so that anywhere in the country, if there is a problem of power outage, the people know about it in advance and present scenario. It will help save many lives in hospitals, help people better plan their lives like study schedules, daily household chores etc.”, the minister added. 

Speaking on the Rural Feeder Monitoring Scheme, Shri Goyal informed that the Government has launched ‘Rural Feeder Monitoring Scheme’ to monitor the quantity and quality parameters of power supply in rural areas of the country. The entire data shall also be hosted on National Power Portal (NPP) on real time basis and may be accessed by various stake holders through web services. The Minister informed that the Government has set December 2017 as the deadline to achieve 100% rural feeder monitoring by installing additional meters and modems on all feeders across the country, in order to facilitate real time communication of faults appearing in the power supply. Further, these meters would be geo-tagged to pin point the cause and location of the fault and address it at the earliest, he added. 

Shri Goyal also announced that on 14th April 2017, birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Uttar Pradesh will be executing ‘Power for All’ document with the Government of India. Uttar Pradesh will become the last state to join ‘Power for All’ initiative, he added. 

Interacting with the audience, Shri P.K. Pujari, Secretary, Ministry of Power, said that the app is a milestone and it will bring pressure on the system to improve itself. It is a proactive Citizen-Government Connect that will bring in transparency, accountability in the power supply system in the country. Shri Pujari said that already 8 crore consumers have joined on the Urja Mitra app which have resulted in their empowerment. It is expected that all power consumers in the country to make use of the app and get empowered, he added. 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Arun Kumar Verma, Joint Secretary, Power, said that approximately seventy percent of the population resides in rural India. In order to ensure quality of life in rural India, it is of paramount importance to improve the quality and availability of power supply as it has direct relation with quality of life and socio economic upliftment of all sections of society. In order to get a complete picture of the entire power distribution network in rural part of the country, it is essential to capture real time power supply parameters of rural India. 

Also present on the occasion were Smt. Shalini Prasad, Additional Secretary, Power, Shri Ajay Jain, Principal Secretary (Energy), Government of Andhra Pradesh, Shri R.K. Verma, Chairperson, CEA and other senior officials of the Ministry and State Power Departments of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, and UK’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Mr. Greg Clark, chaired the inaugural India-UK ‘Energy for Growth’ Dialogue here today. The dialogue takes forward the commitment of Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of UK, Ms. Theresa May for an enhanced ‘Energy for Growth’ Partnership between the two countries. 

Both Shri Goyal and Mr. Clark welcomed UK’s ongoing commitment to India’s energy sector. On 4th April 2017 the two countries had reaffirmed their commitment to anchor investment up to £120 million each in the joint fund which aims to raise around £500 million, and has the potential to unlock much more in the future. It was announced that the fund will focus its initial investments on India’s rapidly growing energy and renewables market. 

India and UK also recognised the importance of combating climate change and mobilising finance from a variety of sources, instruments and channels to mitigate its effects alongside generating economic opportunities. They welcomed the work of the G20 Green Finance Study Group promoting green finance encouraged the issuance of green bonds, among other forms of green finance. 

Both Ministers appreciated the strides taken by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), which has established operations in UK by investing around £7 million in seven energy saving projects after intense technical and financial due diligence. The projects are in operation for more than two years and have been yielding dividends. The Ministers also noted the interest expressed by UK for replicating successful LED business model (UJALA-Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LED’s for All) of India in the UK. 

India and UK share a strong investment and financial partnership, wherein UK is the third largest FDI investor in India and India is the third largest source of FDI projects in the UK. The India-UK Partnership Fund set up under National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) has made substantial progress. The successful issuance of Rupee-denominated bonds in London by Indian entities is encouraging and is reflective of the potential of our financial partnership. 

The two Ministers agreed on priority areas for further collaboration in the power and renewable energy areas under the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Energy Sector, which was signed during the visit of Prime Minister Modi to the UK in November 2015. The agreed areas include innovation in smart technology to improve performance and reduce losses in India’s power sector; support for increased energy efficiency; enhanced energy access; work to accelerate deployment of renewable energy and its integration with the grid; financing for clean energy; decentralized energy scale up and sustainability; and support to states in renewable energy planning and deployment.

                A delegation of senior editors and journalists from Bangladesh called on Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal here today. The members of delegation were apprised about the series of reform measures that have been taken by the government to bring about transparency and accountability in the power sector and to achieve the mission of Affordable, Quality, 24x7 Power for All.

The interaction was organised by the Ministry of External Affairs as a familiarisation initiative for the delegation learning about the turnaround that has been achieved in India’s Power sector. A presentation was given to the delegation informing them about the transparency initiatives taken by the government like various mobile apps and web portals in the power sector and the change that the transparency and accountability has brought about in the governance in the sector.

Addressing the delegation, Shri Goyal said that India and Bangladesh have expanded the scope of engagement to an unprecedented scale, which has built a great level of mutual trust between the two Nations. The Minister noted that both countries have a lot to learn from each other and cooperate on a number of issues of regional and global importance. Shri Goyal commended the neighbouring Nation on its achievements like the Grameen Bank, revolution in the textile sector, on which India looks up to Bangladesh. India and Bangladesh are neighbours, more than just neighbours, he added.

Shri Goyal also expressed confidence of receiving greater cooperation from Bangladesh in areas like developing intra-regional power and transport corridors, maintaining peace and security in the South Asian region by putting up a consolidated front against regional and global terrorism, among others. This would enrich and strengthen the engagement between the two countries in the areas of mutual and shared interests, he added.

Talking about the future prospects of engagements between the Nations, Shri Goyal expressed willingness in supporting Bangladesh in the Renewable Energy sector and Energy Efficiency initiatives, in which India has achieved huge success. The scale at which the RE sector has expanded, would surely help Bangladesh learn from India’s experiences and help the Nation in transition towards Clean Energy in the future, the Minister added.

                The Government has taken several steps to modernize and improve the efficiency of coal based thermal power plants and to reduce the pollution level of coal based thermal power plants in the vicinity of these plants. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today. These are as follows:- 

(i) Supercritical technology has already been adopted for thermal power generation. The design efficiency of Supercritical units is about 5% higher than that of typical 500 MW subcritical units and these (supercritical) units are likely to have correspondingly lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in ambient air. A capacity addition of 39,710 MW power based on supercritical technology has already been achieved and 48,060 MW of supercritical technology is in the pipeline. 

(ii) All Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) are required to use supercritical technology. 

(iii) Coal based capacity addition during the 13th Plan period shall be through super-critical units. 

(iv) Indigenous research is being pursued for development of an Advanced Ultra Supercritical Technology (A-USC) with targeted efficiency improvement of about 10% over supercritical unit. Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), NTPC Ltd. and BHEL signed an MoU, in August 2010, for development of 800 MW A-USC indigenous demonstration plant with main steam pressure of 310 kg/cm2 and temperature of 710/ 720 deg C. 

(v) A capacity of about 7751.94 MW of old and inefficient unit has already been retired till date. 

(vi) To facilitate State Utilities/IPPs to replace old inefficient coal based thermal units with supercritical units, Ministry of Coal, Government of India has formulated a policy of automatic transfer of Letter of Assurance (LOA)/Coal linkage (granted to old plants) to new (proposed) super-critical units.

> (vii) Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme under National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency is under implementation by BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency). In PAT cycle–II, individual target for improving efficiency has been assigned to 154 thermal power stations. 

(viii) High efficiency Electrostatics Preceptor (ESP) are installed to capture Particulate Matters from Flue gases. 

(ix) Low NOX burners are installed for reducing NOx emission from flue gases. 

(x) SO2 emission control is achieved through dispersion of flue gases through tall stacks (275 metres) to reduce the concentration of polluting gases at ground level.

The Government of India and the State of Mizoram signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under the scheme Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) today for operational improvement of the State’s Power Distribution Department. With the signing of MoU by Mizoram, the total States/ Union territories covered under UDAY will be 27. Mizoram would derive an overall net benefit of approximately Rs.198 crores by opting to participate in UDAY, by way of cheaper funds, reduction in AT&C and transmission losses, interventions in energy efficiency, etc. during the period of turnaround.

The MoU paves way for improving operational efficiency of the Power Distribution department of the State. Through compulsory Distribution Transformer metering, consumer indexing & GIS mapping of losses, upgrade/change transformers, meters etc., smart metering of high-end consumers, feeder audit etc. AT&C losses and transmission losses would be brought down, besides eliminating the gap between cost of supply of power and realisation. The reduction in AT&C losses and transmission losses to 15% and 2.50% respectively is likely to bring additional revenue of around Rs.166 crores during the period of turnaround.

Demand Side interventions in UDAY such as usage of energy-efficient LED bulbs, agricultural pumps, fans & air-conditioners and efficient industrial equipment through PAT (Perform, Achieve, Trade) would help in reducing peak load, flatten load curve and thus help in reducing energy consumption in the State of Mizoram. The gain is expected to be around Rs.30 crores.

While efforts will be made by the Power Distribution Department of the State to improve their operational efficiency, and thereby reduce the cost of supply of power, the Central government would also provide incentives to the State Government for improving Power infrastructure in the State and for further lowering the cost of power. The Central schemes such as DDUGJY, IPDS, Power Sector Development Fund or such other schemes of MOP and MNRE are already providing funds for improving Power Infrastructure in the State and additional/priority funding would be considered under these schemes, if the State/DISCOMs meet the operational milestones outlined in the scheme. Further, with improved efficiency, the State Power department would be in a better position to borrow funds at cheaper rates for Power infrastructure development/improvement in the State.

The ultimate benefit of signing the MOU would go to the people of Mizoram. Reduced levels of transmission and AT&C losses would mean lesser cost per unit of electricity to consumers. Further, financially and operationally healthy State Power Distribution department would be in a position to supply more power. Higher demand for power would mean higher PLF of Generating units and therefore, lesser cost per unit of electricity which would again mean lesser cost per unit of electricity to the consumers. The scheme would also allow speedy availability of cheaper power to 22,007 households in the State that are still without electricity. Availability of 24*7 power to hitherto unconnected villages/households etc. would boost the economy, provide more employment opportunities for the people of the State and thereby, improve the standard of living of the people of the State.

                Minister of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu dedicated/flagged off the following through Video Conferencing from Rail Bhavan today i.e. 19 April 2017.

1.      Dedicated New Freight Terminals under Mission Hundred & flagged off Freight Trains from following Freight Terminals:

a.       Adani, Kila Raipur,

b.      Penna Cement, Tandur,

c.       CONCOR, ICD, Khemli

2.      Flagged off 1st High Axle Load Steel Carrier rake under Special Freight Train Operator (SFTO) policy from Jamshedpur and

3.      Flagged off Train No 16791/16792 from Punalur to Palakkad.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu said that “Kerala is a state with high population density with not much urban rural divide, so demand for public transport is high. Providing intercity transport for Kerala is important. This new train would cater to the needs of people of Kerala. Stoppages and timings of this train has been taken care of based on the suggestions from the representations from the state.”

 

Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu added that for Railway, Freight is important segment. Change in freight policies are always required.These new 45 Freight terminals inaugurated today are a next step of changes in freight policy. The High Axle Load train is a customised rolling stock based on need of customers. Challenge for Railways is to run passenger and cargo train on same track & maintain the punctuality. Our traffic has grown 65 times and handling capacity has just grown to 4 times. To maintain punctuality is a challenge, we are working for it.

 

Background:

New Freight Terminals under Mission Hundred

●       While presenting Rail Budget for the year 2016-17, it was announced by the Hon’ble Minister of Railways that Indian Railways would develop/ commission at least hundred freight terminals on private investment in the next 2 years.

●       The siding policy enables to provide rail-connectivity and construction of private sidings at the door-step of party’s factory/premises.  Private siding is only for end-users who owns a plant/ manufacturing unit or production units/ mines for his exclusive use. However, one co-user is permitted with permission of Chief Operations Manager of the concerned zonal railway.  To enable the terminal management to handle third party cargo, a scheme namely ‘Private Freight Terminal (PFT)’ is also in existence. 

●       The capital cost for construction of private siding is borne by the siding owner from the take-off point to the serving station. For providing rail-connectivity, railway land is provided by Railway on prescribed lease rent.

●       The siding owner can opt for bearing the cost of traffic facilities (common-user facilities) that are to be normally borne by the Railways.  In such cases, a fixed freight discount of 10% on outward traffic only is granted for a maximum period of 10 years or till recovery of investment made by the Party, whichever is earlier.  

●       The  main advantages of party’s own terminal are -  

○       Door to door transport service.

○       Better control over transport need of the business.

○       Reduction in multi handling of cargo and thereby reduction in production cost and also damage free transportation of cargo.

○       The PFTs are managed by logistic provider and gives unique opportunity to them for expansion of business through rail connectivity to their terminal.

●       Development of private freight terminal is in win-win situation for both Railways and the investor industries.

●       During the year 2016-17, 45 freight terminals (i.e. 30 Private Sidings & 15 PFTs) have been commissioned.  These freight terminals will be dedicated to the nation and freight trains from three terminals i.e. Kila Raipur in the state of Punjab (Northern Railway), Tandur in the state of Telangana (South Central Railway) and  Khemli in the state of Rajasthan (North Western Railway) will be flagged off on 19.04.2017.


 

High Axle Load Steel Coil Carrying Rake

●       Special Freight Train Operator (SFTO) scheme introduced to increase rail share of the non-traditional commodities like CR Coils, molasses, fly ash, edible oil, caustic soda, chemical, petrochemicals, alumina & bulk cement,

●       Approval granted to M/s TM International Logistics Ltd to procure 3 rakes of BFNS wagons with 22.9t axle load.

●       Specially designed 22.9t axle load wagons with V-Groove and rubber liners for movement of Cold Rolled Steel coils which are susceptible to damage in ordinary wagons and require special design.

●       These wagons will have approximately 19% higher payload of 64.89t.

●       The BFNS rakes would move between TWS siding of Tata Steel on Chakradharpur Division of South Eastern Railway and TISR siding of Tata Steel on Chennai Division of Southern Railway.    

●       For each loading a freight rebate of 12% will be granted for 20 years on the prevailing freight rate at the time of booking.

●       This rake shall be a winning proposition for Indian Railways and Tata Steel in terms of assured and dedicated traffic and incremental business.

On April 13th of 2017, , Minister for Railways Mr Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, held meeting with , Minister of State for Transport, Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of France, Mr Alain Vidalies . They were accompanied by their respective delegation. 

 

On the occasion of this bilateral meeting, both sides  exchanged views,  recalled the long standing technical cooperation between French National Railways and the Indian Railways (IR) and   reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening their cooperation in the field of Railways. 

 

India and France are committed to develop this cooperation under the aegis of the Memorandum of understanding signed in 2013 between the Ministry of Railways of the Republic of India and the French National Railways (SNCF). This   Bilateral Meeting is intended to build upon and deepen the mutual cooperation already existing between the  two countries. 

 

India has over  66600 km of railways and over  7000 stations. It focuses its action in particular on  priorities :  safety  speed upgradation, renovation and improvement of stations,  passenger amenities,  freight transport and network decongestion.

 

France has 30 000 km of railways, more than 2000 km of High Speed tracks and about 3000 stations. The High Speed network is still expanding. A global reflection on the place and purpose of stations in the city has been carried out recently and led to major renovation works in France. The security and improvement of the facilities is of course a constant concern in France.

 

In this context, both leaders desired for regular sharing of  experience  in order to address the common challenges.  Both sides agreed that  mutual collaboration and exchange of expertise will benefit the stakeholders in the two countries.

 

This collaboration between the two countries will in particular focus on the following:  

High speed and semi-high speed rail ; 

Modernisation of current operations and infrastructure ;

Station renovation and operations ;

Suburban trains ;

Safety systems, operations and Security.

 

On Semi High Speed, the  two sides have decided in 2015 to carry out a technical and execution study for upgrading the speed of passengers trains on the current rail corridor between Delhi and Chandigarh (244 km) up to 200 kmph. The study is likely to be completed by Sep’2017.

 

The relevant partners, including government entities, agencies and companies, scientific and technical research bodies and private companies, will be invited to join the cooperation, when appropriate, and under the umbrella Cooperation program of two sides.

At present, Rail Neer is mandatorily supplied to passengers of all Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto/Suvidha trains. There is also mandatory supply of Rail Neer in 139 pairs of trains and 200 stations as identified by the Ministry of Railways. For remaining trains/stations, other brands of Packaged Drinking Water (PDW) bottles are being supplied to the passengers, as approved by the Zonal Railways. Presently, approximately 6 lakh litres of packaged drinking water is being supplied to passengers all over the Indian Railways, through production in seven Rail Neer plants located at Nangloi, Delhi (2003), Danapur, Bihar (2004), Palur, Tamil Nadu (2011), Ambernath, Maharashtra (2014), Amethi, Uttar Pradesh (2015), Parassala, Kerala (2016) and Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh (2017). However, since the estimated demand for PDW is approximately 25 lakh litres per day, six more Rail Neer plants are planned to become operational in the next two years which will augment the total capacity to approximately ten lakh litres per day. In addition, 1106 Water Vending Machines set up by Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) have been installed at 345 stations for dispensing drinking water to passengers at prescribed rates in refills and with containers as under:-

Another 1100 Water Vending Machines are planned to be installed on other railway stations shortly. Further, all railway stations already have provision of potable drinking water on all platforms to satisfy the needs of rail passengers, free of cost. On most of the important stations, water coolers and chiller plants are also in operation for providing cold drinking water to passengers during the summer season.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has been mandated to carry out the unbundling by creating a distinction primarily between food preparation and food distribution. In order to upgrade quality of catering services, IRCTC will engage service providers from hospitality industry for service of food in trains. In the case of tourist trains, products, executive lounges etc. service providers are engaged. Further, in order to provide better and improved services to passengers, Indian Railways has decided to hand over the Retiring Rooms/dormitories and their management to IRCTC. Expression of Interest (EOI) has been called for for Empanelment of Reputed Organizations by IRCTC to undertake the work of Renovate, Operate and Transfer of retiring room in a phased manner.

Railways also propose to outsource the housekeeping of major stations and trains by engaging professional agencies so that integrated cleaning can be taken up as a specialised activity.

   Policy guidelines have been issued from time to time regarding Waste Management on Indian Railways including the following aspects: 

(i) Handling and disposal of Municipal Solid Waste arising in the railway station area. 

(ii) Handling and disposal of garbage arising from catering services. 

(iii) Segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes. 

(iv) Disposal of hazardous waste such as batteries and e-waste. 

(v) Prohibition of open burning of waste. 

 

Garbage collected from different points is disposed off to the places nominated by local bodies like Municipal Corporation / Nagarpalika. Final disposal of garbage is done by these local bodies. 

 

Railways have also proposed a pilot project for disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) being generated at major railway terminals in an environment friendly manner including segregation of waste and conversion of bio-degradable waste to energy. 

 

Detailed instructions have been issued for provision of separate dustbins for biodegradable (wet) and non-biodegradable (dry) at major railway stations. Apart from vending stalls, separate dustbins for collection of biodegradable (wet) waste and non-biodegradable (dry) waste are to be provided on the platforms and all passenger interface areas. Railways have to provide different coloured dustbins and polythene liner bags for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. 

 

As informed by the zonal railways, segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste is being done at some major stations of railways such as ER, NCR, SR, SCR, SECR and WCR. However, segregation is generally not done at collection and final disposal stage by the local Municipal bodies. 

 

The effluent treatment plant at stations data is maintained by the concerned Zonal Railways. As informed by the zonal railways, effluent treatment plants are installed at 06 stations in CR, 02 stations in ER, 04 stations in SCR, 03 stations in WCR and 01 station each in NFR and SR. In addition, effluent treatment plants are also installed in other railway establishments such as Production Units, Workshops and Diesel Locomotive Sheds.

                52 pairs of trains have been speeded up and converted into Superfast category. However, speeding up of trains is a continuous exercise over Indian Railways and is done keeping in view the operational feasibility, availability of sectional speed on line, high speed compatible coaches, high power locos etc.


      ‘Mission Raftaar’ has been announced in the Railway Budget 2016-17. The mission envisages, inter alia, increasing the average speed of all non-suburban passenger trains by 25 kmph  in next 5 years.  A cross functional Mobility Directorate has been created in Railway Board for this purpose.


The fare of Superfast trains has not been increased. However, there is a levy of Supplementary charge for Superfast trains.

                Indian Railways wishes to install Railway vehicle mounted sensor based “On Board Condition Monitoring System” (OBCMS) that will monitor the health and safety of key components of the coaches, freight cars, locomotives that would finally result in improved safety, improved reliability, higher utilization, increased up‐time and reduced operation cost of the railway assets by enabling Predictive Maintenance and reduction in sudden catastrophic failures of these assets.


OBCMS project of Indian Railways presently is at a very nascent stage. An Expression of Interest (EOI) for development of “OBCMS” has been called for. Since such a system shall be tried out on Indian Railways, the specifications of the same are being firmed up.

                Under Swachh Bharat Campaign, regular intensive campaigns / drives have been organised over the Indian Railways with the sole objective of significant and sustainable improvements in cleanliness standards of Trains and Railway premises, including Railway stations. Some of the major initiatives taken by Indian Railways towards improvement of sanitation/cleanliness are as follows:

(i) Pace of fitment of bio-toilets in coaches has been increased. More than 25000 bio-toilets were fitted in the last two years and target for this year is 30,000. Fitment of Bio-toilets in coaches will prevent discharge of human waste during train journeys directly onto the track.

(ii) The facility of On-Board Cleaning has been extended to more than 800 trains which is being monitored through a closed loop ‘APP’ based passenger feedback system.

(iii) Railways is resorting to SMS-based, web-based and APP-based complaint redressal system. Daily IVRS-based passenger feedback is randomly being taken from about 1 lakh passengers.

(iv) To assess the impact of cleanliness efforts at major stations, a third party survey on cleanliness indicators has been done at 407 stations in 2016 involving feedback from 1.3 lac passengers.

(v) Instructions exist for provision of suitable mobile toilets/eco-friendly toilets for use of encroachers in the Railway land, by local Government.

(vi) Additional toilets at Railway Stations, including Pay & Use toilets, have been provided.

(vii) Enforcement of Indian Railways (Penalties for activities affecting cleanliness at railway premises) Rules, 2012 has been intensified.

(viii) Use of CCTVs extended for monitoring of cleanliness activities at major stations.

(ix) Weekly intensive cleanliness drives have been undertaken at various Railway stations, by Zonal Railways.

(x) Various theme-based drives have been undertaken from time to time with focus on cleanliness in different areas of Railways.

                Railways need increased revenue in 2017-18 not only to meet higher revenue expenditure assessed in Budget Estimates 2017-18 but also to have surplus so as to supplement Railways’ capital expenditure from internal resources.

 Accordingly, a 9.8% increase in Gross Traffic Receipts of Railways has been targeted in Budget Estimates 2017-18.

 In order to increase the revenue earnings in freight transportation and to improve the efficiency of freight traffic specially for non-conventional traffic in high capacity and special purpose wagons, following schemes have been introduced for procurement of rakes for freight transportation by inviting private investment through partnerships:

          ·         Liberalized Wagon Investment Scheme: So far, out of 68 rakes for which approval for procurement has been accorded to various customers, 32 rakes have been procured/inducted and are running in the system.

·         Wagon Leasing Scheme: Two Companies have been registered under the scheme as Wagon Leasing Companies who have procured 12 rakes of BLC wagons and 1 BTAP rake. Approval for 4 new BLC, 1 BTAP and 6 BFNS (22.9t axle load) rakes have been accorded.

·         Special Freight Train Operators Scheme: So far, 3 rakes of BRNA wagons have been inducted and approval for procurement of 3 rakes of BFNS (22.9t axle load) has been given.

·         Automobile Freight Train Operators (AFTO) Scheme: License has been given to two companies to work as AFTO and they have procured 9 rakes till date.

 Further, to facilitate rapid development of a network of freight terminals with private investment, to provide efficient and cost effective logistic services with warehousing solution to end users, a scheme namely Private Freight Terminal (PFT) has been introduced. So far, 94 proposals have been received under the scheme out of which 47 terminals have been notified and are functional.

 Regular interactions are held with stakeholders of the main bulk commodities carried by the Railways so as to meet the requirement of the industry.

 The Government has initiated various freight rationalization measures to increase freight revenue. Some of these steps are as under:-

 (i) Withdrawal of Port Congestion Charge from 13.04.2016.

(ii) Extension of Automatic Freight Rebate scheme for traffic loaded in empty flow direction upto 31.03.2018.

(iii) Withdrawal of dual freight policy for iron ore w.e.f. 10.05.2016.

 BACKGROUNDER:

 

 

Investiture Ceremony is an occasion to recognise and honour the meritorious, distinguished and gallant members of the Force for their deeds in the service of the Nation and in enhancing the image of the Force. The giving away of these honours on behalf of the President of India by Minister of Railways evokes a sense of pride and dignitary to the recipients and the Force personnel.

 

            The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has come a long way from the Watch & Ward era of 1882 to the present day wherein it is now entrusted with not only protection of Railway Property but also providing security to railway passengers, passenger area of the Indian Railways. The 76,563 strong Force working under the Ministry of Railways works tirelessly to serve 23 million passengers travelling daily apart from guarding huge Railway assets spread across the country. The award of the President’s Colour to the RPF in 2006 is an indication of the gowing stature of the Railway Protection Force.

 

Having been vested with powers of investigation under the RP(UP) Act & Railways Act, the Railway Protection Force arrests & prosecutes offenders committing crime over the Railways. The Force faces diverse security challenges such as crime against railway property and passengers, extremist violence against railways, obstruction to train movement/ Rail Rokos due to political agitations, flash protests by daily commuters, rescue of runaway, lost and trafficked children, ticketless drives, drugging, narcotics, smuggling of contraband material and FICN, etc.  A good number of unauthorized vendors, touts, males in ladies compartment, offenders at level crossing, offenders indulging in unauthorized chain pulling, carriers of dangerous goods, etc. are prosecuted in the best interest of the travelling passengers ensuring better security atmosphere in Indian Railways.

 

CCTV surveillance cameras have been installed at major stations under Integrated Security System (ISS).  Besides, Baggage Scanners, Door Frame Metal Detectors, Hand Held Metal Detectors & Bomb Detection equipment items have also been installed/ procured under ISS. The RPF Security Management System (RSMS) (developed by CRIS) has started functioning in 2013 for communication with Zonal Railways through ‘Railnet’ for taking prompt action on real time basis and to reduce the paper work. The increasing use of technology by RPF to ensure safety and security of rail passengers is evident in the launching of Security Apps on mobile phones of rail passengers, especially women, for alerting RPF has been initiated in Central Railway (M-Indicator), South Central Railway (RISSTA) and Eastern Railway (R-Mitra). Efforts are being made to standardize an App on an All India basis.

 

An “All India Security Helpline” has been set up in Feb. 2015 over Zonal Railways by providing a common Helpline No. 182 for round the clock security related assistance to passengers. Calls related to offences under the Railways Act, theft of passenger belongings, for medical assistance, luggage left behind, nuisance mongers in trains / railway premises, etc. are received and suitable action initiated. A good number of passenger appreciation have been received in this front.   

 

 

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was issued in collaboration with Ministry of Women & Child Welfare for the care & protection of children on Railways. The work of RPF in rescue of children from traffickers was recognized by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The National Conference of Anti Human Trafficking held at New Delhi - 2015, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh presented Certificate of Excellence to RPF for commendable contribution of RPF during “Operation Smile” in the field of Anti Human Trafficking. RPF rescued more than 12,000 juveniles from trains and Railway stations during the last two years (2015 & 2016).

                Shri Nitin Gadkari does an aerial survey and addresses the press at the construction site

 

Outlines the Government’s plans for bringing a transport revolution in the country

 

 

The Minister of Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari did an aerial survey of the ongoing construction work of the 135 km long  Eastern Peripheral Expressway that runs from Kondli – Ghaziabad- Palwal. The Minister was accompanied by media persons on this aerial visit.

 

 Addressing the press near Palwal Shri Gadkari said that the construction of the Expressway was nearly 60 percent done, and he was hopeful that it would be over by August this year.

 

The Peripheral Expressway Project comprises two expressways  - Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) and Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi.The EPE and WPE constitute one combined project forming a Ring Road around Delhi with a total length of 270 km. About 183 km length passes through the State of Haryana whereas the remaining about 87 km length passes through the State of Uttar Pradesh.

 

Shri Gadkari said that once complete, the two expressways together will allow a by pass for traffic not meant for Delhi and headed towards the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. This will not only decongest Delhi but also cut down pollution by almost 50 percent.

 

The Expressway is planned to be equipped with the latest, world class smart technology and road safety features like intelligent highway traffic management system, video incident detection system and a closed tolling system where the toll will be charged on the distance travelled, said Shri Gadkari.

 

The Minister also informed that the EPE will be the country’s first Green Highway, with landscaping, plantation with nearly 2.5 lakh trees and fully lit by solar energy. There will also be facilities for rainwater harvesting at short distances. The Highway will also have roadside amenities like petrol pumps, motels, restaurants etc.

 

The Expressway will greatly benefit farmers, traders and the people of the NCR region and neighbouring states of UP, Uttarakhand, as a whole by providing  better road connectivity in the region. The projects will give a major boost to the transport infrastructure of the region, making it speedier, more efficient and less polluting, which in turn, will give a boost to the economy as a whole.

 

The projects will create both direct and indirect jobs. The construction work of EPE has generated 40 lakh mandays of employment. 2100 engineers and 5200 workers are employed daily. Besides this, the local population would be involved in creating and  maintaining the green belt. The roadside amenities will provide markets for local produce.

 

Shri Gadkari informed that the total compensation given to farmers for land acquisition for Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways was Rs 7700 crores,

 

The Minister further said that an efficient and integrated transport system is necessary to bring down logistics cost and give a boost to the economy. He informed that twelve expressways are also being constructed in other parts of the country, including Delhi- Meerut ,Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi–Ludhiana-Amritsar-Katra, Mumbai - Vadodara, Bangaluru-Chennai, Hyderabad-Vijaywada-Amravati, Hyderabad-Bangaluru, Nagpur – Hyderabad and Amravati Ring Road Expressway.

 

Shri Gadkari further informed that the Government is fast moving towards meeting its target of building 2 lakh km of National Highways. Starting from around 57000 km of NH we have reached a figure of 103933 km . He said that the pace of construction of National Highways across the country has risen very fast. A record 16000 km of NH construction work was awarded this year. He said the award  target for the coming year is 25000 km. He also said that the daily rate of construction has gone up from about 2 km per day three years back to about 22 km per day at present.

 

The Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar and NHAI Chairman Shri Yudhvir Singh Malik were also present during the press conference.

                With a view to strengthening healthy democratic values in the country, the Central Government took another historic step today. The Union Cabinet, in its meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today decided to do away with beacons of all kinds atop all categories of vehicles in the country. The government is of the considered opinion that beacons on vehicles are perceived symbols of VIP Culture, and have no place in a democratic country. They have no relevance whatsoever. Beacons, however, will be allowed on vehicles concerned with emergency and relief services, ambulance, fire service etc. In the light of this decision the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways will make necessary provisions in the law.

Mahatma Gandhi NREGS has reached a new milestone today by geotagging one Crore assets and putting them in public domain. 

The scale of rural assets created under MGNREGA is very large. Since the inception of the programme in financial year 2006-07, about 2.82 Crore assets have been created under the programme. On an average, about 30 Lakh Assets are created annually which includes a variety of works such as water harvesting structures, plantations, rural infrastructure, flood control measures, individual assets for sustainable livelihood, community infrastructure and so on. The process of geotagging is going on and all assets under MGNREGS will be geotagged. Special focus is being given to geotag Natural Resource Management works especially the water related works. 

GeoMGNREGA is a unique endeavor of the Ministry of Rural Development in association with National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO and National Informatics Centre. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by Ministry of Rural Development with NRSC on 24th June 2016 for geo-tagging the assets created under MGNREGS in each gram panchayat. Strength of Space technology has been leveraged. 

Pursuant to the signing of MoU, training manuals were developed in consultation with NRSC. Training was imparted to around 2.76 Lakh personnel across the country with the help of National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR). The training programme was conducted in the last week of August, 2016. The geotagging exercise started from 1st September, 2016. One Crore assets have been geotagged and put in public domain in the last seven months. It is expected that the exercise will lead to greater transparency and ensure accountability at field level.

The Ministry of Rural Development has released Rs. 23,443.09 crore to the States today as first tranche for Financial Year 2017-18 under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The amount released includes all pending liabilities as on 31st March, 2017. It is also to ensure priority work on water conservation measures. 

The Government is laying considerable emphasis on Water Conservation and Water Management works under MGNREGS. All States have been advised to ensure that such works are taken up wherever required with appropriate technical and scientific scrutiny. In collaboration with the Ministry of Water Resources, Mission Water Conservation Guidelines have been developed and shared with the States. A list of 2264 water-stressed Blocks, as ascertained from the Ministry of Water Resources, has been prepared. These Blocks are located in 324 districts of 21 States. In a recent communication to the States, the Ministry has advised the States to ensure not less than 65% expenditure on Natural Resource Management (NRM) Activities. There are 155 kind of works permissible under MGNREGS. Of these, 100 works are NRM related. 

In a communication to the Chief Secretaries, Secretary, Rural Development has requested them to accord top most priority to Water Conservation works under MGNREGS. Special thrust has to be ensured in drought prone regions and in districts/Blocks receiving inadequate rainfall. 

Apart from focusing on execution of works related to Water Conservation and Water Management, States have been requested to ensure work availability to poor households in poor regions on priority. A campaign to ensure a Job Card for every household that reported deprivation in SECC has been going on. No poor household will be denied work in MGNREGS.

Homes will have cooking area, toilet, LPG connection, electricity connection and water supply through convergence, and beneficiaries can plan their homes as per their need.  Training programme for Rural Masons has been launched to meet a critical skill requirement for quality construction.  The selection of beneficiaries has been through a rigorous process using Socio Economic Census (SECC) Data for those who are homeless or in 0, 1, 2 kutcha rooms with kutcha roof.  The SECC Data has been validated by Gram Sabha and also subjected to space technology validation to ensure that there is no inclusion of errors.  CAG’s Performance Audit Report, 2014 highlighted problem of ineligible beneficiaries covered under Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY).  It has been completely taken care of through the 3 filter selection process under PMAY-G.  A total of 44 lakh houses were approved for 2016-17 and the Ministry of Rural Development is working hard to complete all of them by December 2017.  A completion period of 6 to 12 months is being followed in PMAY-G.

 

The thrust in 2016-17 was to launch PMAY-G with all the tasks completed regarding selection of beneficiaries, IT/DBT platform, space technology use, training programme for Rural Masons, finalisation of housing design typologies etc.  The other major thrust was to complete most of the 36 lakh incomplete Indira Awaas Yojana houses which had been pending from anywhere between 1 to 4 years.  As per the reports received from the States, a total of 32.14 lakh houses have been completed in 2016-17.  On account of network and IT related issues on the AwaasSoft MIS, only 24.81 lakh completed houses have been uploaded on the AwaasSoft so far.  The rest are in the process of being uploaded. The completion in 2016-17 is almost 2 to 3 times higher than those were getting completed in earlier years.  100% use of AwaasSoft MIS and IT/DBT system is being ensured.

 

As part of the Governance Reform, from anywhere between 2 to 20 Bank accounts in every District for the Rural Housing programme earlier, there is now a Single Nodal Account at the State level from where funds are directly transferred electronically on the AwaasSoft-PFMS platform to the beneficiary’s account.

 

 The beneficiaries under PMAY Gramin have been selected up to 2022 based on the prioritisation and in a transparent manner. The three filters have ensured that the genuinely poor homeless and those living in dilapidated houses, have been selected. Large number of households from vulnerable groups and large number of women have been selected as beneficiaries. House design typologies incorporating disaster resilient features have been finalised and are being used by the State Governments under the programme.  The workmanship and employability of trained Rural Masons is being improved by ensuring their assessment and certification as per the Qualification Pack endorsed by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).

 

States like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Assam have taken the lead in the implementation of the PMAY-G.  States like Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have done well in completing a very large number of incomplete Indira Awaas Yojana houses.

 

The Department of Rural Development plans to complete 51 lakh houses in 2017-18. An additional 33 lakh houses will be sanctioned for 2017-18 shortly.  A similar number is proposed to be completed in 2018-19 making the completion during 2016-19 period of 1.35 crore houses.  This will pave the way for Housing for All by 2022.

The Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) is making a difference to the lives and livelihoods of over 3.6 crore households from where women have joined Self Help Groups (SHGs). The collectives of women under SHGs, Village Organisations (VOs) and Cluster Level Federations (CLFs) has evolved transformational social capital that is changing gender relations, access to services and participation in Gram Sabhas and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). The programme has given confidence to women to seek Bank loans for economic activity after developing skills and competencies through a sustained Community Resource Person (CRP) led handholding for livelihood diversification. 1.50 lakh women Community Resource Persons (CRPs) who have themselves come out of poverty, are today the greatest agents of change in promoting sustainable agriculture, providing Banking services, developing a cadre of Para Vets for animal care, Book keepers and Accountants to women’s collectives, and most importantly an agent for social transformation of villages. 

Since the inception of the programme in 2011, women members of SHGs have accessed Rs. 1.06 lakh crore as Bank credit. From Rs. 20,000 crore Bank linkage in 2014-15, SHGs got more than Rs. 30,000 crore as credit in 2015-16. Till February 2017 over Rs. 29,000 crore had already been disbursed and it is expected that about Rs. 35,000 crore to Rs. 38,000 crore will be mobilised as credit in the Financial Year 2016-17. Analysis of Bank linkage in 2016-17 shows the remarkable increase in credit linkage in States like Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan and West Bengal. There is a clear National spread in Bank linkage as SHGs become vibrant and stronger institutions of the poor in many Northern Indian States as well. They are already strong and vibrant in the Southern Indian States. 

Under the DAY-NRLM, over 30 lakh women farmers have been supported under Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) to promote sustainable agricultural practices. Women SHG led Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) for agricultural implements, power tillers etc have come up in some States. Vermi Compost/NADEP pits have also come up through the efforts of these women SHG farmers besides the promotion of pesticide free agriculture and multi-tier cropping in rain-fed regions for fodder, food, forest, fruits and fibre. 

The DAY-NRLM programme has reached nearly 1/3rd of the Gram Panchayats of the country and efforts for its consolidation and expansion are being continuously made. During 2017-18, 52 lakh households through 4.5 lakh new SHGs were added to DAY-NRLM. Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) to develop 84,000 micro enterprises was started in 17 States covering 47 Blocks. Solid Waste Management initiative through convergence was done in 11,000 (nearly 90%) villages of Tamil Nadu through their women SHGs. The successful initiative has been initiated by DAY-NRLM in 6 other States. DAY-NRLM published a Compendium of successful Business Models for Livelihood Diversification and also developed a Best Practice Volume based on National awards and recognition to the best SHGs during the year. 

To facilitate diversification of livelihoods, skill development for Placement Based Wage Employment and self-employment was promoted on a large scale through the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) and Rural Self Employment & Training Institutes (RSETIs) respectively under DAY-NRLM. 1.60 lakh youth were trained and 79,400 placed under DDUGKY besides 4 lakh youth being trained in 585 RSETIs for self-employment in 2016-17. 12 new Champion Employers were selected under DDUGKY for high quality training and committed placements. Some of the Champion Employers are Cafe Coffee Day, Apollo Mediskills, Team lease, etc. Training of drivers was also started at a large number of RSETIs during the year. 

The first National evaluation of DAY-NRLM has been completed recently by the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA). The draft report recognises the social capital developed through women’s collectives at village level. The evaluation finds that the NRLM strategy has led to greater demand expression of rural poor not just through their weekly meetings but also through collective action in production as well as on social issues. Transforming lives through an even larger scale diversification and development of livelihoods is clearly the way forward to reach the Mission Antyodaya objective of Poverty free Gram Panchayats.

                A new web portal “nakshe” was launched by the Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan in New Delhi today, on the occasion of 250th anniversary of Survey of India(SoI).

Topographic maps or Open Series Maps (OSM) containing natural and man-made geographical features including terrain or topography are prepared by the SoI since its inception in 1767 and is in conformity with the National Map Policy-2005. These OSM maps have been made available for free download from “nakshe” web portal in pdf format on 1:50,000 scale through Aaadhar enabled user authentication process, in line with Digital India programme of the Government of India.

The Survey of India, the principal mapping agency of the country is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year. Origin of the Survey of India is traced back to Year 1767. It is the oldest scientific department in India and one of the oldest survey establishments in the world. Foundation for the scientific survey and mapping of the country was laid with The Great Trignometric Survey (GTS) in 19th century on this day i.e. 10th April, 1802, by noted surveyors Col. Lambton and Sir George Everest. SoI has surveyed and mapped each and every part of the country and these maps have played an invaluable role in the saga of India’s nation building and were pivotal in the foundation of almost all major developmental activities of modern India.

Survey of India completes 250 years of its service to the nation and is celebrating its achievements this year. A National Conference on, “Users’ Perspective on Geospatial Policy Framework in India” was organized by Survey of India (SoI) and FICCI, in New Delhi today. The 10th of April is also celeberated as National Survey Day.

As a part of its 250 years completion celebrations, Survey of India has proposed to re-measure the height of Mount Everest during the year 2017. India was the first country under Sir George Everest’s leadership as ‘Surveyor General of India’ to have declared the height of Mount Everest and establish it as the highest peak in the world in the year 1855. Subsequently, India once again carried out the exercise and declared the height of Mount Everest in the year 1956. After the Gorkha Earth Quake in the year 2015,various doubts were raised by the scientific community. In response to this, the Survey of India proposed re-measuring the height of Mount Everest as an ‘Indo-Nepal Joint Scientific Exercise’ along with Survey department of Nepal. The proposal has been forwarded to Nepal through diplomatic channels and the expedition will start after the formal concurrence of Government of Nepal is received.

Discussions and deliberations of all stakeholders of Survey of India products and services focussed on users’ perspective on Geospatial Policy Framework in India during the panel discussions.

The Secretary, Department of Science & Technology, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, said that the panel discussions and the opinion and suggestions from all the stakeholders assembled in the forum would facilitate the inclusion of wider spectrum considering present day technology scenario and developmental needs and challenges in the country, and will prove to be very useful inputs for shaping the geospatial policy paradigm in the country.

                In a major boost towards realising country’s ambitious inland waterways project, the World Bank has approved a $375 million loan for capacity augmentation of National Waterway-1(River Ganga) under Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP). 

The government is developing NW-1 (River Ganga) under JMVP from Haldia to Varanasi (1390 Km) with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs 5369 crore. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT. 

Under the project, there are going to be three multi-modal terminals--one each at Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), Sahibganj (Jharkhand), and Haldia (West Bengal), two inter-modal terminals- at Kalughat and Ghazipur, a new Navigation Lock at Farakka, five Roll on-Roll off (Ro-Ro) terminals, development of Ferry services at Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Munger, Kolkata and Haldia and Vessel repair and maintenance facilities. 

While the contracts for construction of multi-modal terminals at Varanasi, Sahibganj, and a new Navigation Lock at Farakka have been awarded, and the work at respective sites has commenced, the construction of multi-modal terminal at Haldia will begin soon. The foundation stone for the multi-modal terminal at Sahibganj was laid by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 6th April, 2017. In August 2016, the Minister for Road Transport, Highways & Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for multi-modal terminal at Varanasi. 

Jal Marg Vikas Project also includes proposal for Performance Based Maintenance Dredging Contract for Provision of Least Assured Depth (LAD) of 3 metres between Farakka to Kahalgaon, and Sultanganj to Barh; LAD of 2.5 metres between Barh to Doriganj, and Doriganj to Ghazipur; and LAD of 2.2 metres between Ghazipur to Varanasi. 

In addition, the project will enable IWAI setting up of River Information Service System on NW -1 for the first time in India. River Information System (RIS) are equipment, hardware and software information technology (IT) related services designed to optimize traffic and transport processes in inland navigation. 

JMVP will also support the design and development of low draft vessels capable of carrying up to 2000 tonnes of cargo in shallower depths. 

NW-1 is a waterway of national significance passing through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, serving the major cities of Allahabad, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Bhagalpur, Patna, Howrah, Haldia and Kolkata, and their industrial hinterland including several industries located in the Ganga basin. The Rail and Road corridors in this region are heavily saturated. Hence, the development of NW-1 would provide an alternative, viable, economical, efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport. The waterway will act as a catalyst in the socio-economic development of the regions by creating new business and employment opportunities.

The top position in cargo handling was retained by Kandla Port that handled 105.44 Million Tonnes of cargo, registering a growth of 5.39% over last year.  This was followed by Paradip Port with 88.95 Million Tonnes of cargo handled, and an impressive growth rate of 16.45%.  Mumbai Port holds the third position with 63.05 Million Tonnes of cargo handled and growth rate of 3.17%.JNPT recorded highest ever handling of 4.50 million TEUs during 2016-17. The port owned terminal, JNPCT, achieved highest ever handling of 1.53 million TEUs during the year, registering a growth rate of 7.33%.

Iron-ore traffic attained the highest growth rate of 163.67%. Other miscellaneous and general cargo grew by 18.53% and POL products by 8.16%. 

In terms of Operating Surplus too, the Major Ports have shown highest ever achievement in 2016-17. JNPT net surplus has crossed Rs. 1300 crores as against Rs. 1091 crores of 2015-16. Kandla Port posted its highest ever net surplus of Rs. 651 crores during   2016-17, an increase of 54.4% over last year’s  profit of Rs 422 crores.

For the first time ever, JNPT raised Foreign Denominated Loan of US $400 million .  It became the first  major port to raise foreign currency loans. Kamarajar Port Limited (Ennore) is also in the process of raising USD $100 million foreign currency loan. This mode of financing at low interest rates and natural hedging has been followed in the Major ports for their infrastructure development for the first time. 

The major ports have also recorded the highest ever capacity addition of 100.37 Million Tonnes (MT during 2016-17.  The capacity of  major ports during 2015-16 was 965.36 MTPA. This crossed 1065 MTPA during 2016-17.

In respect of development of port infrastructure, 56 projects have been awarded with a capacity of 103.52 MTPA against a target of 102 MTPA with an investment of Rs. 9490.51 crores during 2016-17. 

The efficiency indicators in major ports are also improving steadily.  During 2016-17, total turn-around time came down to 3.44 days as against 3.64 days during last year.  Likewise, Average Output Per Ship Berthday has gone up to 14583 tonnes as against 13748 tonnes during last year. 

Major Ports have been benchmarked to international standards. 116 initiatives were identified. Out of these, 70 initiatives have been implemented and remaining will be implemented by 2019. This has resulted in unlocking 80 MTPA capacity. Implementation of these initiatives would further improve the efficiency & productivity of the Major Ports.

Mumbai Port has become Home Port for cruise tourism.  Asia’s largest passenger ship ‘Genting Dream’ with a capacity of 3,400 guests anchored at Mumbai Port on 29th October, 2016.  The ship also ferried 1,900 passengers from Mumbai to Singapore via Colombo. 51 cruise vessels have called at Mumbai Port during 2016-17. A total number of 158 Cruise vessels anchored at 5 Major Ports during 2016-17, registering an increase of 23% over 2015-16.

In addition to the outstanding performance of the ports, the Ministry has taken several initiatives. The dredging of Mumbai Channel and JNPT Channel phase – II has been awarded to increase draft upto 15 meters at an estimated cost of Rs.  1963.17 crore. Smart Port Industrial Cities are being developed at Paradip and Kandla,  Master Plans for which have been finalised. Multi Modal Logistic Park is being set up in Paradip. 

The Ministry of Shipping has initiated several Policy during the year . The  New Captive Policy guidelines were issued in July, 2016 to ensure uniformity and transparency in the procedure for awarding captive facilities in the ports. This will allow concessionaire to handle non captive cargo upto 30% of the designed capacity of the berth.  

The New Berthing Policy came into effect from August, 2016.  This policy provides standardized framework for calculation of norms, specific to the commodity handled and infrastructure available on the berth. This will improve the efficiency at ports and productivity norms across ports.

 

The New Stevedoring Policy has been implemented since July, 2016. This will improve productivity, efficiency and safety in the ports.  

 

The existing Model Concession Agreement of 2008 is under process of revision which will address the concerns of PPP projects and prevent them from getting stressed.  

 

The Major Port Authorities Bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha in December, 2016 to modernize the institutional structure of the ports to usher in professional governance in the ports.

For the first time ever, the twelve major ports under the Ministry of Shipping have been ranked on sanitation parameters, based on the efforts undertaken by them to counter waste generating sources with respect to port operation, office area, township area and the response to incoming ships.  The assessment methodology included official interview, direct observation by the designated team from Quality Council of India and stakeholder’s interaction. The exercise was undertaken during the ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’ observed from the 16th to 31st of March 2017. Quality Council of India (QCI) was tasked to assess the Swachhata activities undertaken by all the Ports.  While Haldia and Vizag  ports bagged the first and second ranks respectively, almost all ports have achieved the benchmark for cleanliness or are well above it.

The ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’ was a major sanitation and cleanliness campaign launched by the Hon’ble Minister of Shipping, Sh. Nitin Gadakari on the 16th of March 2017 at the Shipping House in Mumbai, and observed by  all the twelve major ports, five PSEs and seven attached offices/organizations of the Ministry of Shipping.  This was a culmination of one year of activities undertaken to promote the vision ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi on 2nd October 2014.

The ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’ not only emphasized cleanliness and sanitation but brought the focus on the setting up of ‘Green Ports’ for sustainable, environment friendly,  long term development of ports. The emphasis is on state-of-the art planning and implementation of an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan or the ‘Green Plan’ in all Ports. This will be benchmarked to international standards, conventions and parameters. A consultant of repute has been appointed for this on 30th March 2017.

            Approximately 42,000 employees of all organizations under the  ministry participated in this cleanliness drive to make this a success. Better organizational and employee discipline to promote a drive against spitting and spilling of plastics & wastes was observed during the campaign.

 All 193 lighthouses across India have been solarized and this mega drive culminated during the ‘Swachhata Pakhwada’. Clean and green energy is now used by the lighthouses, which generate 1.4 MW/hr of clean energy. Besides this an ambitious target of generating 100 MW of solar energy has been set up for the twelve major ports against which 23 MW was achieved by March 31, 2017.

 

Special awareness campaigns for cleaning of work place, tidying up of the office and port premises, tree plantation and beautification drives were undertaken at all Ports  and other Organizations.

 

A common agenda was planned and implemented by all organizations to provide impetus to the program. This included renovations of rooms and toilets, cleaning of wharfs and sheds, repair of sheds,  auction and disposal of all  unserviceable items and unclaimed goods, painting with uniform colour code (unique to a Port) of all signages and boards,  beautification and cleaning of parks,  covering tiles, modernizing all toilet complexes , placing dust bins at regular intervals, boards – indicating cleanliness messages – dos & don’ts, painting, whitewashing all office buildings and residences with proper colour,  proper keeping of files, records, dak pads and other important papers in the office/work places, cleaning and painting of statues, cleaning & repairing of all drainages and storm water system, plantation in open area, avenues and corners. Awards were given to departments or officers whose area/jurisdiction was found to be the most neat & clean.

 

 Regular training was also imparted to staff to generate awareness and inculcate the importance of a clean environment.

 

Special emphasis was laid on use of technology to maintain cleanliness and hygiene at ports and the organisations under the Ministry of Shipping. Use of solid and liquid waste management, modernisation of toilets in all complexes under the Ministry, acquisition of Dust Suppression System, equipments for monitoring environmental pollution at ports , usage of bio-diesel are some of the highlights.

 

The campaign gave very encouraging results wherein 538 toilets and 265 office rooms were renovated; a total of 195.8 KM roads were repaired across Major Ports and others Organisations. 63696.32 tonnes of trash was disposed. Under the program of greening of Ports and office spaces, 65,498 new trees were planted.

The Swachhata drive was taken up in the main Secretariat of the Ministry of Shipping to renovate office rooms and toilet blocks. Renovation of 4 sections has been completed and orders have been issued for all others.  Provision of pure and clean drinking water to all has been ensured. About 10,000 files have been scanned/weeded out and more than 300 old pieces of furniture and equipment have been listed for disposal.

 

The Ports and the attached offices/organizations under the Ministry responded extremely well to this mega cleanliness drive and all have met acceptable level of sanitation requirement.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today laid the foundation stone of the multi-modal terminal at Sahibganj, Jharkhand. The terminal at Sahibganj is an important component of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) for the augmentation of the navigation capacity of National Waterway-1 (Ganga) from Varanasi to Haldia (1390 km). Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari was also present on this occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister said that the Sahibganj Multi Modal Terminal will link the city and the landlocked state of Jharkhand to foreign shores through the Bay of Bengal. Speaking on this occasion Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari said that Sahibganj multi-modal terminal will prove growth engine for Jharkhand. He said that for the first phase of the project, work of Rs 280 cr has already been awarded. . He added that the terminal will generate considerable direct and indirect employment for local people also.

A Roll-on Roll-off (Ro-Ro) terminal at Sahibganj will provide critical connectivity to Bihar at Manihari for the cross –river movement of loaded and empty trucks. This will considerably reduce the cost and time of cargo movement between Sahibganj and Manihari. The state of the art terminal at Sahibganj will have cargo handling capacity of 2.24 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA) on completion in 2019. The overall cost of the Sahibgang terminal is estimated to be Rs 467 Crore. Jharkhand is richly endowed with mineral resources. The multi-modal terminal at Sahibganj will play an important role in transportation of domestic coal from the local mines (in Rajmahal area) to various thermal power plants located along NW-1.

The terminal facilities will include berthing space for two vessels, stockyard, conveyor belt system with hoppers, barge loaders, shore protection works, roads, ramps, parking area, and terminal buildings. The construction of multi-modal terminal and Ro-Ro terminal will help create substantial direct and indirect employment in Sahibganj and Jharkhand. Overall additional employment opportunities for 1.5 lakh persons are expected to be generated under the Jal Marg Vikas Project on Ganga river.

Sahibganj terminal is the second multi-modal terminal (out of the three) to be constructed on NW-1. In May 2016, IWAI had awarded the contract for the construction of a multi-modal terminal at Varanasi. The third terminal will be constructed at Haldia in West Bengal where the work is expected to commence soon. River Ganga is being developed under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) with the technical and financial assistance of World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369 crore. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of a multi-modal terminal on River Ganga at Sahibganj in Jharkhand tomorrow. 

The multi-modal terminal is an important component of the development of the National Waterway-1 from Varanasi to Haldia, a distance of 1390 km. NW-1 is being developed under the Jal Marg Vikas Project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India, with the technical and financial assistance of World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369 crore. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT. 

The Sahibganj terminal is the second out of three multi-modal terminals to be constructed on NW-1. Earlier in May 2016, IWAI had awarded the contract for the construction of a multi-modal terminal at Varanasi. The third terminal will be constructed at Haldia in West Bengal. The work is expected to commence soon at Haldia. Construction of terminals is essential to facilitate transhipment and movement of bulk cargo on NW-1. 

The state of the art terminal at Sahibganj will have a cargo handling capacity of 2.24 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA) on completion in 2019. The contract for the construction of the terminal has been awarded to M/s L&T Infrastructure Ltd at an estimated cost of Rs 280 crore. The terminal facilities will include berthing space for two vessels, stockyard, conveyor belt system with hoppers, barge loaders, shore protection works, roads, ramps, parking area, and terminal buildings. 

A Roll-on Roll-off (Ro-Ro) terminal at Sahibganj will provide critical connectivity with Bihar at Manihari. About 100 trucks have already started using the facility at Sahibganj. The crossing of trucks through Ro-Ro facility would save a lot of time, cost and fuel in road transport. 

The construction of the multi-modal terminal at Sahibganj and the overall development of NW-1 will contribute significantly to the creation of business and employment opportunities in Jharkhand, particularly in the rural areas. It will also provide critical last mile connectivity to the hinterland of Jharkhand. The state is richly endowed with mineral resources. The multi-modal terminal at Sahibganj will play an important role in transportation of domestic coal from the local mines in Rajmahal area to various thermal power plants located along NW-1. Other than coal, stone chips, fertilisers, cement and sugar are other commodities expected to be transported through the terminal. 

The construction of the multi-modal terminal and Ro-Ro terminal will also help to create direct employment of about 600 people and indirect employment of about 3000 people. 

National Waterway-1 (NW-1) is a waterway of national significance passing through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, serving the major cities of Haldia, Howrah, Kolkata, Bhagalpur, Patna, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Allahabad and their industrial hinterland including several industries located in the Ganga basin. The rail and road corridors in this region are heavily saturated. Hence, the development of NW-1 would provide an alternative, viable, economical, efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport. The waterway will act as a catalyst in the socio-economic development of the regions by creating new business and employment opportunities.

Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment regularly organizes Camps for distribution of all types of assistive devices to Divyangjans nationwide. He said that the National Trust has launched 10 schemes in November, 2015 for the empowerment and welfare of the Divyangjans. He hoped that the Conference will provide an excellent opportunity to obtain information about latest developments in education / skilling and inclusive living of persons with autism, apart from deliberations on latest research on medical aspects.

RINL, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) @RINL_VSP has recorded an impressive performance in all fronts of its operations and sales in the concluded financial year 2016-17. #Steel demand would grow in the coming year, said the CMD, RINL Shri Madhusudan releasing the report in #Visakhapatnam. Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh @ChBirenderSingh also lauded the performance shown by the RINL a PSU of the Steel Ministry @SteelMinIndia.

 

In Production, VSP achieved a growth of 11% in Hot Metal production, 10% in liquid Steel, 16% in Finished Steel and 10% in Saleable Steel production during 2016-17. Another notable achievement is production from Wire Rod Mill-2 recorded a growth of 43%. Gross Sinter production touched 6 million ton mark, representing a growth of 5%.

 

As far as Techno-economic parameters are concerned, VSP registered a growth of 28% in Blast Furnace productivity, 9% in Labour Productivity, 5% reduction in Specific Water Consumption when compared to the CPLY.

 

Shri P. Madhusudan, CMD RINL commended the VSP collective for the achievements and expressed confidence that in the current financial year there will be substantial growth in production including from expansion units.

 

Shri Madhusudan said that the #UnionBudget 2017-18 points to a favourable demand outlook for the Steel Sector and the government’s thrust on infrastructure and affordable housing would spur the demand for steel consumption in the country.

 

In Marketing Highlights, Despite sluggishness in infrastructure and construction sectors, RINL turnover grew by 4% at Rs.12,781 crores against CPLY of Rs 12,281 crores. This includes exports of Rs.1048 crores during the 2016-17. All the marketing regions registered growth during the year.

 

RINL achieved a sales volume of 5.77 lakh tons during March’17, representing a growth of 27% and a turnover of Rs. 2205 crores, up by 44% when compared to March’16.

 

In tune with the government’s policy to increase the consumption of steel in rural areas, RINL increased its rural dealership from 235 to 417, representing a growth of 77%. RINL has given an impetus to Value Added steel production to cater to the growing demand of domestic steel with a view towards customized products. Another notable initiative of RINL is successful implementation of e-tender in both Ocean and Nepal exports in place of mutual bidding by the bidders that increased the customer base.

 

A Brand promotion campaign has already been launched in the country with Padma Shri Awardee Badminton Champion P.V. Sindhu @Pvsindhu1 as its Brand Ambassador as well as Train branding on New Delhi bound Vizag Steel Samta/Swarna Jayanthi Express.

                The Minister of Steel Chaudhary Birender Singh @ChBirenderSingh speaking at the National Conference on Secondary Steel Producers said, “We intend to adopt the ‘Melt & Manufacture’ Model of USA for increasing steel production capacity. Worldwide, mini-mills are becoming popular and we want to establish such plants and mills in India. This is cost-effective, environment-friendly and energy efficient.”  Outlining the strategic roadmap for steel industry, Shri Birender Singh said acronym PRIDE is our guiding motto, where

•           P is for production and productivity,

•           R is for Research & Development,

•           I is for Indian-made Steel,

•           D is for demand increase and

•           E is for Excellence in Quality of steel.

These thrust areas are as important for secondary steel producers, as these are for integrated steel producers. Steel plants in secondary sector have many advantages like less land requirement, lower capital investment, better energy efficiency, proximity to users and less dependence on logistics. The Minster said that his ministry want to promote and encourage growth of domestic steel industry and want that Indian-made steel should be given preference in government-funded projects. The Government have decided to institute an award scheme for the Secondary Steel Sector units under various categories to recognise their contribution in nation building and award the best performers in these areas so that they can be source of inspiration for other producers. An Inter-Ministerial Task Force has been formed to explore ways of increasing steel consumption. Whether it be Housing, Urban Development or Swachh Bharat Mission, steel is integral to the sectors. Steel-intensive houses, pre-fabricated steel toilets and other units, bridges, community centres, malls, smart city infrastructure are few of the examples where steel use is being promoted, Shri Singh said. Secondary steel sector has played a critical role in growth of Indian steel industry and would continue to do so.  Secondary Sector produces 58% of steel produced in India. Around 65% of steel long products come from the secondary sector, which is quite significant. There are a large number of Re-Rolling Mills, Cold Rolling Mills, Galvanising & Colour Coating units, which produce value added steel products. We are moving towards 100 % Quality Regime in Indian Steel Sector to make it internationally competitive and for safeguarding the health and safety of end-users, the minister added.

“Secondary steel players do play a key role in increasing production and enhancing consumption and your contribution is as important as integrated steel producers. That is why we have organised this National level conference to understand your issues and concerns and seek your inputs on policy-making”, the Steel Minister emphasised.

The Ministry of Steel @SteelMinIndia in association with National Institute of Secondary Technology (NISST) and Joint Plant committee organized one day National Conference on Secondary Steel Producers on the theme “Make in Steel for Make in India” in New Delhi today. The Minister of Urban Development, Urban Housing and Poverty Alleviation and Information & Broadcasting Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu @ MVenkaiahNaidu inaugurated the conference.

Inaugurating the national conference, the Minister of Urban Development @Moud_India, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation @MoHUPA and Information & Broadcasting @MIB_India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that @Moud_India and @MoHUPA welcome ideas for innovative usage of steel that will help bring down the overall costs in housing.

Speaking at the valedictory session, the Union Minister of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping @MORTHIndia, Shri Nitin Gadkari @nitin_gadkari said that crash barriers have been made mandatory for all highways. Steel consumption will definitely increase with substantial increase in length of highways and more bridges. He asked Steel Industry that they must carry out research and explore internationally for cost effective steel structures like bridges and ports. Shri Nitin Gadkari said, Steel companies can think of having JVs for making steel bridges and structures on turnkey basis with innovative designs.

The Comprehensive Sustainable Tourism Criteria for India (STCI) for Accommodation, Tour Operators and Beaches, Backwaters, Lakes & Rivers sectors were launched in August 2014 and has been accepted by the stakeholders. No issues/problem in this regard have surfaced. 

Further, the Ministry has guidelines for approval of Hotel Projects at the implementation stage and also guidelines for classification/re-classification of operational hotels under various categories. As per these guidelines, hotels at the project stage itself are required to incorporate various eco-friendly measures like Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), Rain Water Harvesting System, waste management system, pollution control, introduction of non-Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) equipment for refrigeration and air conditioning, measures for energy and water conservation etc. Under the guidelines for project level & classification/re-classification of operational hotels, it has been prescribed that the architecture of the hotel buildings in hilly and ecologically fragile areas should be sustainable and energy efficient and as far as possible be in conformity with the local ethos and make use of local designs and material. 

The tour operators approved by Ministry of Tourism have to sign a pledge for commitment towards Safe & Honourable Tourism and Sustainable Tourism to fully implement Sustainable Tourism practices, consistent with the best environment and heritage protection standards, such that the present tourism resource requirements optimize both local community benefit and future sustainable uses.

Now India has moved up by another 12 positions and ranked at 40th position.  In all, in last three years India has cumulatively improved its ranking by 25 places which is a significant achievement.

 

India continues to charm international tourists with its vast cultural and natural resources with a ranking of 9th and 24th respectively which are the USP’s of Indian Tourism product. In terms of price competitiveness advantage, we are ranked 10th. 

 

India continues to enrich its cultural resources, protecting more cultural sites and intangible expressions through UNESCO World Heritage lists, and via a greater digital presence.

 

In terms of International openness,  India is ranked 55th, up by 14 places. This has been possible through stronger visa policies. Implementing both visas on arrival and e-visas, has enabled India to rise through the ranks. 

 

The T&T sector benefited from improvements in the country's ground transport infrastructure, which has traditionally been a challenge (29th). India is taking small but important steps in the right direction. The Indian T&T sector presents significant opportunities that are yet to be reaped.

           

The World Economic Forum has, for the past 11 years, engaged leaders in travel and tourism to carry out an in-depth analysis of the Travel and Tourism competitiveness of 136 economies across the world.  The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the travel and tourism sector, which in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country”.  The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index enables all stakeholders to work together to improve the industry’s competitiveness in their national economies.  

 

At a macro level, the primary reasons for India’s jump in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index 2017 should be attributed to the pro-active steps taken by our Government in terms of development of tourism infrastructure, easing of entry formalities for tourists by introducing the e-visa facilities in November 2014.  

 

Some of the key achievements of the Ministry of Tourism in the last 3 years are as follows:-

FEE has grown with a CAGR of 7.86% against a      contraction of 5% in international tourism receipts. FTA has registered a     growth of 16.3% in January 2017 when compared to January 2016.

Model Regulations issued by the Government 

Regulation of real estate sector becomes a reality ending nine year wait 
 

Ending the nine year long wait, regulation of real estate sector involving over 76,000 companies across the county becomes a reality from tomorrow i.e May 1, 2017 with the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act,2016 coming into force. 

With all the 92 Sections of the Act coming into effect from tomorrow, developers shall get all the ongoing projects that have not received Completion Certificate and the new projects registered with Regulatory Authorities within three months i.e by July end. This enables the buyers to enforce their rights and seek redressal of grievances after such registration. 

Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu in his tweets on the occasion said today; “Real Estate Act coming into force after a nine year wait marks the beginning of a new era making buyer the King while developers benefit from the confidence of the King in the regulated environment. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s personal interest in the matter made the Act a reality now. The Act ushers in the much desired accountability, transparency and efficiency in the sector with the Act defining the rights and obligations of both the buyers and developers. This important legislation gained momentum under this Government and could see the light finally”. 

Ahead of the Act coming into force, Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation has formulated and circulated Model Real Estate Regulations for adoption by the Regulatory Authorities in the States/UTs. Under these Regulations, developers are required to display sanctioned plans and layout plans of at least 3 feet X 2 feet size at all marketing offices, other offices where properties are sold, all branch offices and head office of the promoters in addition to the site of project. Real Estate Regulatory Authorities may take decisions on all issues preferably through consensus failing which through voting with Chairman using Casting Vote in case of a tie. There shall be quorum for the meetings of the Regulatory Authorities and if a meeting is adjourned due to lack of such quorum, such meeting can take place without quorum. Members of Regulatory Authorities shall declare interest if any in the matters coming up for discussion and shall not participate there in. 

Some of the major provisions of the Act, besides mandatory registration of projects and Real Estate Agents include: 

1.Depositing 70% of the funds collected from buyers in a separate bank account in case of new projects and 70% of unused funds in case of ongoing projects; 

2. Projects with plot size of minimum 500 sq.mt or 8 apartments shall be registered with Regulatory Authorities; 

3.Both developers and buyers to pay the same penal interest of SBI’s Marginal Cost of Lending Rate plus 2% in case of delays; 

4.Liability of developers for structural defects for five years; and 

5. Imprisonment of up to three years for developers and up to one year in case of agents and buyers for violation of orders of Appellate Tribunals and Regulatory Authorities. 

Further to several rounds of consultations, the Ministry of HUPA has made several and substantial changes in the Real Estate Bill that was first introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2013 to make the final Act more effective towards promotion of the sector. 

At the time of passing of the Bill in Rajya Sabha in March last year, there were 76,044 companies were operating in the real estate sector including 17,431 in Delhi, 17,010 in West Bengal, 11,160 in Maharashtra, 7,136 in Uttar Pradesh, 3,054 in Rajasthan, 3,004 in Tamil Nadu, 2,261 in Karnataka, 2,211 in Telangana, 2,121 in Haryana, 1,956 in Madhya Pradesh, 1,270 in Kerala, 1,202 in Punjab and I,006 in Odisha.

DDA and DUSIB to sign MoA with Ministry of HUPA for implementation of PMAY(Urban) in Delhi

 

            Issues that held back implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban)-Housing for All Mission in the  National Capital Territory of Delhi for 22 months have now been resolved.

 

            Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu approved signing of Memorandum of Agreement between the Ministry of HUPA, Delhi Development Authority (DDA)  and Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) enabling implementation of the Urban Housing Mission in NCT of Delhi.

 

            The issues were resolved at a meeting taken by the Lt.Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal last month.

 

            Keeping in view the uniqueness of jurisdiction of land ownership in NCT of Delhi, it was decided in the meeting taken by LG of Delhi that DDA and DUSIB will sign the Memorandum of Agreement as required under the PMAY(Urban) Mission Guidelines. As per the Guidelines, Government of NCT of Delhi was to sign the MoA. However, Minister of HUPA Shri Venkaiah Naidu now granted exemption in this regard.

 

            The MoA requires the State Governments to commit to comply with six mandatory conditions including amending the Master Plan earmarking land for affordable housing, removing requirement of separate Non-Agricultural Permission if the land falls in the residential zone, putting in place a single window time bound clearance system for layout approvals and building permissions, providing additional FAR/FSI/ Transferable Development Rights and relaxing density norms for slum redevelopment and low cost housing etc.

 

            DDA and DUSIB will be the State Level Nodal Agencies as required under the Guidelines for implementing the In-Situ Slum Redevelopment component of PMAY (Urban) while DDA will be the agency for other components viz., Credit Linked Subsidy component, Affordable Housing in Partnership with Public and Private sectors and Beneficiary Led Construction.

 

            Under PMAY(Urban), central assistance of up to Rs.1.00 lakh per beneficiary under ISSR, Rs.1.50 lakh under AHP and BLC, interest subsidy of 3% to 6.50% on housing loans of Rs.6.00 lakhs to Rs.12.00 lakhs  under Credit Linked Subsidy component is provided.

 

            Ministry of HUPA has so far approved construction of 18,75,389 affordable houses for urban poor in the country with an investment of Rs.1,00,466 cr and central assistance of Rs.29,409 cr.

Implementation and progress of various new urban development and housing missions launched by the central government in Haryana will be reviewed tomorrow i.e April 28, 2017 at a high level meeting. 

Union Minister of Urban Development and Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu will chair the review meeting in Chandigarh. Chief Minister of Haryana Shri Manoharlal Khattar, concerned Ministers of the State Government, Secretaries of the two urban ministries, Chief Secretary of Haryana and National and state Level Mission Directors of new urban missions and other senior officials will be attending the review meeting. 

The central government launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart City Mission and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) to enable inclusive and sustainable urban development and to address infrastructure deficit in urban areas of the country. Progress under these schemes and implementation issues will be reviewed tomorrow. 

Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) is being implemented in all the 80 statutory cities and towns of Haryana. So far, 24,986 Individual Household Toilets have built in Haryana out of the target of 1,06,373 besides 1,679 Community and Public Toilets out of the target of 10,394. Out of the total 1,449 urban wards in the State, 412 wards have reported 100% door to door collection of Municipal Solid Waste. While 3,490 tonnes of solid waste is being generated every day in Haryana, 25% of this is being currently processed against the mission target of 100% by October, 2019. 

In Haryana, 10 of the 80 mission towns have so far been declared and certified as Open Defecation Free. These are: Panipat, Sirsa, Mandi Dabwali, Thanesar, Pehowa, Ladwa, Shahbad, Kalanwali, Ellenabad and Rania. 

Ministry of Urban Development has so far released Rs.75 cr to Haryana under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). 

Under AMRUT, 20 cities and towns are included in the Mission. A total investment of Rs.2,544 cr has been approved under this mission for providing water taps to all urban households in mission cities as first priority besides improving sewerage and drainage networks, non-motorised urban transport and providing open spaces. Total central assistance of Rs.764 cr has been approved for Haryana under Atal Mission. 

AMRUT cities in Haryana are: Panipat, Sonipat, Ambala, Ambala Sadar, Bahadurgarh, Hissar, Karnal, Rohtak, Bhiwani, Jagadhari, Palwal, Sirsa, Faridabad, Jind, Panchkukla, Thanesar, Gurgaon, Kaithal, Rewari and Yamuna Nagar. 

Faridabd and Karnal have been included in Smart City Mission.

                Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that implementation of Smart City Mission is certainly changing the way the city governments are addressing issues of urban planning and execution. He spoke on various aspects of development of smart cities in the country at the Knowledge sharing workshop on ‘Smart Cities and Informed Urbanisation’ here today, organized by NITI Ayog and University of New South Wales, Australia.

Stating that Smart City Mission aims at improving livability in cities, Shri Naidu said the broad objectives of the Mission are: Sustainable urban planning and development, Management of urban affairs with citizens’ participation, Area based development, Resilience to climate change, natural disasters etc and Technology based solutions for better governance and infrastructure management.

The Minister further said that all new urban sector missions launched over the last two years aim at inclusive urban development benefitting all sections.

Vice-Chairman of NITI Ayog Dr.Arvind Panagariya said the Government has selected 100 cities for smart city development based on competition without any iota of controversy and was highly laudable. Basic features of a smart city include slum free city environment, proper delivery of city services including clean water and quality and assured power, affordable housing and meeting the needs of children, women and the aged. He stressed on the need for optimal use of scarce urban land through vertical development.

NITI Ayog Member Dr.Vivek Debroy stated that Smart City Mission is not aimed at disbursing public money but to recast urban landscape through other means of resource mobilization and promoting best urban practices.

Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary (Urban Development) said “Smart City Mission is not a typical project oriented programme but a process driven by the ambition of the citizens for better living and is not limited by time”. He said the first batch of 20 smart cities have come out with projects with potential for visible impact on ground. He clarified that Special Purpose Vehicle being constituted for implementation of smart city plans are not parallel power structures but are accountable execution tools with the involvement of Mayors and elected Representatives of People in advisory bodies. Smart city mission implementation seeks to ensure core services of high quality, transformation of old and neglected neighbourhoods and adoption of technology based solutions.

                Modernisation and redevelopment of Government of India Printing Press at Minto Road in New Delhi will be taken up at a cost of Rs.338.56 cr.

Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has accepted the recommendation of the Standing Finance Committee in this regard.

The present building of the Press will be redeveloped at a cost of Rs.238.56 cr into three blocks of Ground plus six floors suitable to locate the modern technology and equipment to be installed at a cost of Rs.100 cr.

At present, the machines and equipment being used are of 1980-2005 vintage and some of them installed as early as in 1968, resulting in high cost of production, demand for printing not being met in time besides non-availability of spare parts requiring their refabrication.

With redevelopment and modernisation, the production capacity of the Government of India Printing Press at Minto Road in the national capital will increase from the present 16 lakh pages per day (60 cr pages per year)of A-5 size to 45 lakh pages per day (164.96 cr pages per year) marking an increase of 177% in production capacity. Multi-colour printing, which is not available presently will be made available.

This Government Printing Press meets all printing needs of both the Houses of Parliament including day to day Parliamentary proceedings, Question Lists, Bills, Acts, Synopsis, Reports, Debates, Who’s Who, Parliamentary Committee reports besides the needs of Cabinet Secretariat and various Ministries and Departments of central government. Due to lack of multi-colour printing facility at present, such work as in the case of printing of Annual Reports of various ministries and departments is being outsourced.

The entire redevelopment and modernisation work would be completed in 52 months from now.

From the available land of 22,017 sq.mtres, about 1.50 acres would be transferred to the Ministry of Finance for construction of building for Controller General of Accounts and Public Finance Management System (PFMS).

With rapid expansion of metro rail projects in the country, Ministry of Urban Development has taken several far reaching decisions to promote Make in India campaign. These include stipulating certain mandatory conditions to be incorporated in Tender Documents of metro companies for procurement of metro cars and related critical equipment and sub-systems, procurement of only Made in India signaling equipment besides standardizing technical parameters for rolling stock (metro coaches) and signaling equipment.

The new mandatory Tender Conditions and standardized norms for a wide range of equipment, approved by the Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu have been circulated to all the metro companies on Friday this week making them effective immediately.

These initiatives will incentivize  setting up manufacturing facilities in the country by increasing the volumes of procurement of rolling stock and all kinds of equipment by removing variations in the present technical norms for rolling stock and signaling equipment. This will in turn result in reduction of cost through economies of scale.

The Ministry has stipulated the following mandatory conditions to be incorporated in Tender Documents:

1.Minimum 75% of the tendered quantity of metro cars shall be manufactured indigenously with progressive indigenization of content, for which the contractor may either establish independent manufacturing facility in India or partner with Indian manufacturers, if the procurement is more than 100 cars;

2.To facilitate ease in maintenance through easy availability of spares beyond the warranty period, an identified list of critical equipment and sub-systems shall be included in the Tender Document for ensuring indigenous manufacturing of a minimum of 25% of such equipment, either by Original Equipment Manufacturers themselves by establishing a wholly owned subsidiary in India or through Indian manufacturers;

3.  Requirement of metro cars at State level shall be clubbed to enable applicability of local procurement norms; and

4.To develop in-house expertise on long term basis, metro companies with large size fleet to undertake in-house maintenance.

A total number of 1,912 metro coaches are currently operational in the country with another 1,420 under procurement. Over the next three years more than 1,600 metro cars would be required.  Each metro coach is estimated to cost about Rs.10 cr.

The Ministry has concluded the long pending standaridisation of norms for rolling stock and signaling equipment  applicable to over 90% of the present imports. Further, to promote indigenous manufacturing, the Ministry has stipulated procurement of 9 types of signaling equipment from within the country. Metro companies have also been directed to develop maximum possible local competence so that knowhow and technical support is available within the country. Indian companies have to be associated with production of a wide range of signaling and train control project equipment.

Indigenization of several metro functions has also been prescribed. These relate to communication systems, managing operational disturbances, time table preparation, fault reporting, control traction power, maintenance, infrastructure supervision, rolling stock management etc.

The new standardized norms prescribe that the rolling stock and related equipment and systems shall enable Unattended Train Operations, Driverless Train Operations, Standard rail gauge of 1,435 mm, Metro cars with body width of 2.90 meters for passenger capacity of up to 45,000 Peak Hour Peak Distance capacity, body width of 3.20 meters for capacity above 45,000 PHPD, only 3 car, 6 car or 9 car rail combination, operational speed of 80 kmph, minimum 67% motorization for all rolling stock etc. Norms have also been prescribed for Acceleration Rates, Energy Consumption, Noise and Vibration levels, Collision Standards etc.

Further to these initiatives, Ministry of Urban Development will soon evolve common eligible criteria for suppliers of rolling stock and other equipment doing away with  the present variations across different  metro companies.  

Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary(UD) discussed with Managing Directors of metro companies on Friday the variations in the present eligibility criteria. Noting that such variations adversely impact competition, he directed that a broadly uniform criteria in respect of Net Worth, Financial and technical capacities and experience of supply of rolling stock and other equipment etc should be evolved in two weeks.

Presently, metros are operating in 7 cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Jaipur, Gurgaon, Bengaluru and Chennai with a total route length of 326 kms. Metro projects with a total route length of 546 kms are under construction in 11 cities and projects with a total route length of 903 kms in 13 cities are under consideration.

            Shri Naidu said while Mahatma ensured political freedom for our country, Sardar Patel ensured its unification, Shri Modi is now working on giving content and real meaning to these accomplishments through building a New India.

The Minister said such a New India has no meaning if we don’t ensure houses for all and that too in a specific time frame. He said that the Prime Minister Shri Modi has set the year 2022 as the deadline for roofing all Indians.

Shri Naidu said that within a short span of just 21 months since the launch of PMAY(Urban) in June, 2015, his  Ministry has earlier approved construction of 17.73 lakh affordable houses for urban poor with an investment of Rs.95,660 cr in 30 States and Union Territories.. For building these houses, central assistance of Rs.27,879 cr has also been approved, he said.

These approved projects are to be executed with assistance from central and state governments and beneficiary contribution under the four components of PMAY (Urban). Under this urban housing mission, central assistance in the range of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.2.35 lakh will be provided to each beneficiary. PMAY (Urban) was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on June 25, 2015.

            The Government of India on December 31, 2017 extended the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme component of PMAY (Urban) to Middle Income Groups with annual incomes in the range of Rs.12 lakh to Rs.18 lakh under which interest subsidy of 4% and 3% on housing loans will be provided. With this, beneficiaries belonging to EWS, LIG and MIG with annual incomes up to Rs.18 lakh have been brought under the ambit of PMAY (Urban) opening up substantial investment opportunities for developers both at the bottom and middle of the pyramid.

The committee constituted to prepare draft Ganga Act submitted its report to the Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Uma Bharti in New Delhi today. Receiving the report the Minister called it a “historic day” and said that “I am very much excited to receive this report”. The Minister said that Modi Government will soon make this Act after due consultations with all stakeholders. She directed the Secretary of her Ministry to constitute a high level committee to go through the report and submit its report at the earliest. The Minister expressed the hope that sufficient provisions have been made in the draft report keeping in view the uninterrupted and clean flow of river Ganga.

The Chairman of the committee Justice Shri Girdhar Malviya (Retd.) said that it was a big challenge for them but they could meet it successfully. He thanked the officials of Union Water Resources Ministry and National Mission for Clean Ganga for their cooperation to the committee.

 

The committee recognized the enormous challenges being faced to maintain the wholesomeness (Nirmalta and Aviralta) of National River Ganga perpetuated due to over stressed water demand from agricultural, domestic and industrial sectors,  on one hand and realized pressure on account of sustaining the religious faith, historical and social belief  on other hand. The challenges become more complex with no possible increase in availability of water in river course in comparison to the increasing demands but on the contrary apprehension of decreasing flow owing to climate change affects.

 

The draft Act addresses the critical issues pertaining to National River Gaga on its Cleanliness (Nirmalta) and uninterrupted e-flow (Aviralta) and provides corresponding provisions thereof. The committee has adopted certain stricter provision to increase accountability and responsibility for use of resources made available by National River Ganga. The option and provision made in suggestive bills available with National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) were also considered and discussed by the committee.

 

 The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation constituted this committee in July last year to prepare draft Ganga Act. Justice Shri Girdhar Malviya (Retd.) was the Chairman of the committee. Other members were: Shri V.K.Bhasin, Ex-Secretary, Legislative Department, Govt. of India, Prof. A.K. Gosain, IIT Delhi and Prof. Nayan Sharma, IIT Roorkee. Shri Sundeep, Director, National Mission for Clean Ganga was the Member Secretary. 


             79 year old Justice Malviya who is Chairman of Ganga Mahasabha is associated with Ganga conservation movement. The Mahasabha was founded by his grandfather and founder of BHU Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Uma Bharti launched MIS for monitoring PMKSY project in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion the Minister said the MIS will help in quick monitoring of PMKSY projects. Expressing satisfaction over the execution of various PMKSY projects the Minister said that 21 projects having irrigation potential of 5.22 Lakh hectare will be over by June this year. She said another 33 projects will be over by 2017-18 (Potential Utilization of 12.95 Lakh Hect.) and the balance 45 projects have been identified to be completed by March, 2019 (Potential Utilization of 48.54 Lakh Ha.). 

The Minister said issues in respect of many other projects which were at standstill such as Gosikhurd in Maharashtra have been streamlined and are getting back on track so as to meet the completion targets of March 2019. This project is likely to create an irrigation potential of 2.50 lakh ha. Similarly, Polavaram Project has been put on a fast track when completed this project is likely to irrigate 2.9 lakh ha. Sushri Bharti said many States like Maharashtra have undertaken innovative means such as installation of underground pressure pipelines to get over the difficulties of land acquisition for timely completion of these projects. 

Under the new MIS, Project wise nodal officers have been nominated for regularly feeding the physical and financial progress of the projects. The MIS has been put in the public domain. Project wise/ Priority wise /State wise physical/financial details in tabular/graphical format are available in MIS. It has the feature of comparing the progress of the project on quarterly basis and also provides details of the constraints affecting the progress of the project. 

The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has taken up a programme for completion of 99 prioritised incomplete major and medium irrigation projects in the country under PMKSY. Total fund required for completion of all the 99 identified projects have been estimated at Rs.77595 crore (Rs.48546 crore for Project Works and Rs.29049 crore for Command Area Development works). The Central Assistance (CA) is estimated at Rs.31342 crore. The likely total potential utilization through these projects is estimated to be 76.03 lakh hectares. 

During 2016-17, Central Assistance (CA) of Rs.3308 crore was released for projects under AIBP and Rs.854 crore for projects under CAD&WM. Further, an amount of Rs.3334 crore towards State share has been released through NABARD, for six States. In addition, an amount of Rs.2514 crore has been released for Polavaram project of Andhra Pradesh.

The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on April 06, 2017 was 50.435 BCM, which is 32% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 33 for the week ending on March 30, 2017. The level of April 06, 2017 was 129% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 105% of storage of average of last ten years.  

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 157.799 BCM which is about 62% of the total storage capacity of 253.388 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

The storage during corresponding period of last year was 24% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 29% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is equal to the corresponding period of last year and is less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

            EASTERN REGION

The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura. There are 15 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.83 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 9.74 BCM which is 52% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 42% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 37% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

            WESTERN REGION

The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 27 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 27.07 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 11.07 BCM which is 41% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 21% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 40% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

CENTRAL REGION

The Central region includes States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 12 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 42.30 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 18.76 BCM which is 44% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 31% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 28% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

SOUTHERN REGION

The Southern region includes States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states) Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 31 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 51.59 BCM.

                Central Water Commission (CWC) compiles the flood damage data every year reported by the States/ UTs in the predefined proforma.

As per the assessment done by CWC in the year 1993, the river basin-wise average annual water availability in the country is 1869 billion cubic meters (BCM). It is estimated that owing to topographic, hydrological and other constraints, the utilizable water with conventional approach is 1123 BCM which comprises of 690 BCM of surface water and 433 BCM of replenishable ground water resources.  Further, it has been estimated in the year 2009 by CWC that about 450 BCM of surface water is being utilized for various purposes. Also, as per the July 2014 report of CGWB titled ground water draft for irrigation, domestic and industrial uses is 245 BCM. Thus, the quantity of water flowing down to the sea can be approximately considered as 1174 BCM.

                The pollution abatement works under Namami Gange is proceeding as per plan. The pollution abatement schemes would yield the desired results once the schemes are implemented and commissioned.

Water quality monitoring of river Ganga is carried out on monthly basis by respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The water quality assessment indicates that water quality does not meet the bathing water quality criteria at Down Stream (D/s) Haridwar in Uttarakhand, to downstream of Kanpur. There is a fluctuation in the water quality parameters over the years, however, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Coliform and Fecal Coliform values have declined invariably.

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 764 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) which discharge their effluent into River Ganga and its tributaries Ramganga river and Kali-East river. 583 units were found non-complying and have been issued directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. CPCB also issued direction u/s 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to Municipal authorities of Dehradun, Kanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Dhanbad, Kolkata for treatment and utilization of sewage for restoration of water quality of rivers.

CPCB has identified five sectors, namely, Pulp & Paper, Distillery, Sugar, Textile and Tannery for priority action and sector specific action plan has been prepared for implementation by the concerned industrial units. Pulp & Paper units have been directed to reduce their fresh water consumption and effluent generation upto about 50 %-60 %. The mills have been asked to upgrade their Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) upto tertiary level to achieve quantum improvement in treated water quality. Distilleries have been directed to implement zero liquid discharge. Sugar sector has been directed to reduce the water consumption to 200 lit./tonne of cane crushed. Out of 764 units, 574 have installed Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring Systems and 266 have provided connectivity for data transmission. CPCB has periodically carried out drain monitoring to identify the polluting sources and to take concerted action.

                Central Water Commission (CWC) is monitoring water quality of river at 429 key locations covering 67 main rivers including Ganga, 138 tributaries and 55 sub-tributaries. CWC has published a report based on analysis of data for nine parameters viz. Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Mercury, Nickel and Zinc from 2011 to 2013. The report titled “Status of Trace and Toxic Metals in Indian Rivers” is available on the Website www.cwc.gov.in.

Out of total 195 rivers/tributaries monitored by Central Water Commission during the period 2015 to 2016, there are 126 rivers where one or more parameters related to heavy metals exceeded the permissible limit.

NITI Aayog has developed a Composite Water Management Index as a useful tool to assess and further improve the performance in efficient management of water resources. The index would provide useful information for the States and also for the concerned Central Ministries/Departments enabling them to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources. The Index has 28 key Performance Indicators (KPIs) covering irrigation status, drinking water and other water-related sectors. It is targeted to prepare the index for States/Union Territories from the current financial year (2017-18).

                A comprehensive module for capacity building of Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) of Panchayats and a training program for Trainers of women panchayat leaders across the country was launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in collaboration with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj today. The training program was launched at Ranchi, Jharkhand through a video conference, by the Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in the presence of Minister of Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi today. The training program seeks to empower EWRs of panchayats by enhancing their capacity, capability and skill in governance and administration of villages.

Addressing the select women trainers/women sarpanches of Jharkhand at the video conference today, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that inspite of 33% reservation for women in the panchayat bodies, the EWRs continue to remain ineffective since they do not have appropriate knowledge and skill to administer the village, and the show continues to be run by their husbands. 

These women representatives will have to be trained in order to ensure that they take up the responsibility of all the tasks entrusted upon them on being elected, Smt Maneka Gandhi said. The Minister explained that it is due to this reason, the WCD Ministry has initiated this countrywide program of training the women sarpanches and other women representatives at the grassroots level in various areas like engineering (building of roads, drains, latrines etc.), finance, social development, education, health, and environment among others. Similarly, several new schemes have been launched by the Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi which bring benefit to the common man especially those in distress and the under privileged. The women sarpanches can be helpful in taking these schemes to the people at the grassroots level, the Minister said. These schemes include Fasal Beema Yojana, Pradhanmantri Awas Yojana, Suraksha Bima Yojana, Sukanya Samridhi Yojana, maternity benefits schemes among others. Apart from this, the training programme will help to raise these women to the next level of leadership , said Smt Maneka Gandhi. 

The WCD Minister said that safety of women, education of the girl child, health of women, creation of assets under MGNREGA, immunization and ensuring nutrition through lakhs of Anganwadis of the country have become important issues at the grassroots level in which the women sarpanches can play a pivotal role in effective delivery. The Minster suggested that the women sarpanches should form a whatsapp group and share their good practices as well as assist one another in finding solutions to common problems.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister for Panchayati Raj, Rural Development and Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar said that under the 14th Finance Commission, the Panchayats will get Rs 2 Lakh crore in 5 years as against the earlier amount of Rs 30,000 crore for the overall development of the villages. He underlined the  need for greater accountability, honesty and transparency in the execution of the developmental projects like building of roads, drainage system, toilets, farm ponds and dwelling units which he hoped will be ensured by the newly trained women representatives.

Shri Tomar laid stress on advance planning by the Gram Panchayats to free their villages from scourges of poverty and malnutrition. He said that women Sarpanches can form groups in the villages to spread social awareness on schemes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana, Immunisation, school enrolment, various insurance schemes for farmers and common man, benefits for pregnant women and BHIM App for cashless transaction. The training programme will lead to the empowerment of Women Sarpanches for the overall development of their villages and the country, explained the Panchayati Raj Minister.

The Chairperson, National Commission for Women, Smt Lalitha Kumaramangalam said that the training program will be closely monitored to ensure proper learning by the sarpanches and EWRs. Smt Lalitha Kumaramangalam also expressed hope that the EWRs will emerge as future leaders of the country. 

In the first phase, 40 master trainers of Jharkhand will be trained at the State institute of Rural Development, Ranchi. In the second phase, approximately 3000 EWRs will be trained by these master trainers in the three districts of Simdega, Pakur and Chatra of Jharkhand. 

Starting with Jharkhand, similar training programs will be organised in different states throughout the country with the help of National Institute of Rural Development, State Institutes of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Departments of the States to train EWRs throughout the county. There are currently around 13 lakhs EWRs in panchayats across the nation.

 

The module has been prepared by the National Commission for Women of the WCD Ministry in collaboration with TISS. The module contains training guidelines, timeline, implementation guidelines, training schedules and monitoring and evaluation. The training will be participatory with group discussions, brainstorming lectures, demonstrations, field visits, case studies, games, exercise, role play, small workshops and individual assignments. The module discusses various topics like ‘What is an ideal Panchayat’, composition of the Gram Panchayat, development schemes and programmes, resources of panchayats and their utilization, laws for protection of the vulnerable sections among others.

                The safety measures, recommended by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, concerning safety of women commuters availing of cab services have been included in the new Taxi Policy Guidelines. These measures have been recommended by the WCD Minister , Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Shipping (MoRTH).

The recommendations come in the background of numerous cases of sexual harassment of women in cabs being reported to Smt. Maneka Gandhi on social media after women took to Twitter and Facebook to flag their ordeal.

Following this, the WCD Minister held a meeting with radio cab service providers to find a solution to the grave problem. Based on this, the WCD Minister wrote to Sh. Nitin Gadkari , Minister of Road Transport and Highways and Shipping to incorporate the necessary safety measures in the regulatory guidelines being prepared by MoRTH.

Recommendations of WCD Ministry included in the New Taxi Policy Guidelines:

•The taxis should be mandatorily fitted with GPS panic devices.

•For the safety of women and child passengers, the central locking system in the taxis should not be allowed.

•The driver's identification along with the photo and registration number of the vehicle should also be prominently displayed in the taxi.

•Violation of the stipulated rules by the taxi operators/drivers should be strictly dealt in accordance with law.

•Sharing of seat should be subject to willingness of passengers.

The recommendations made by the WCD Minister have now been approved for inclusion in the regulatory guidelines. Smt. Gandhi has thanked Sh. Nitin Gadkari for accepting the recommendations to help implement measures for increased safety of women in taxis/cabs.

Women commuters have been expressing their concern via social media to Smt Maneka Gandhi regarding safety in taxis. The WCD Minister has launched a hashtag, #HelpMeWCD, where any woman or child facing harassment/ violence can directly report their cases by tweeting.

                As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total number of 44256, 42521 and 42088 women committed suicide during 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, which shows a declining trend. The main reasons behind the committing of suicide by women are family problems, illness, marriage related issues such as Cancellation/Non-settlement of marriage, Dowry disputes, Extra marital affairs, love affairs, etc.

Health being a State subject under List-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, States are empowered to implement their own programmes. However, the Government of India attaches highest importance in the matter and is implementing the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) in some districts of the country with added components of suicide prevention services, work place stress management, life skills training and counselling in schools and colleges.

This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                An Inter-Ministerial Group was constituted by NITI Aayog to examine the emerging data on undernutrition and prepare a specific strategy for poor performing States/Districts. The recommendation of the Inter-Ministerial Group has been finalized in a report entitled “Toward Kuposhan Mukt Bharat: National Nutrition Strategy”. For this, consultations were held with the States/UTs, Central Government Ministries and a clutch of institutions and experts and the suggestions/recommendations received from Members of the Inter-Ministerial Group have been incorporated in the report. 

Some of the core strategies to address the issue of undernutrition in the country as envisaged in the report are convergence of States/District Implementation plans; reaching the most vulnerable communities in the districts/blocks with highest levels of child undernutrition; counselling to reach the critical age group through skilled counsellors; continuum of care that includes preventive, promotive and curative care; innovative service delivery models with evidence of impact; community based monitoring; implementing innovative components of ICDS and strengthening nutrition within the health system.

Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel has said that there is Zero Tolerance for doping and there is a need to encourage clean sports. In his inaugural address at the Consultation Meeting to consider a legislation against doping at Vigyan Bhawan here today, the Sports Minister said that towards this end, there is a need to discuss the necessary preventive and curative measures to be put in place for necessary deterrence, to get rid of the menace of doping. Shri Vijay Goel assured all support in taking appropriate measures towards this end. 

In his keynote address, Secretary, Department of Sports, Shri Injeti Srinivas, highlighted the need for appropriate safeguards for clean athletes and desired that improvement in sports eco-system is the need of the hour. He added that while the athlete is taken to task if a prohibited substance is found in his body, there is a need to regulate the activities of the athlete’s support personnel, as well some of whom, are at times responsible for inducing dope in the athletes. 

The Consultative Committee meeting was convened by National Anti Doping Agency (NADA). NADA has an ambitious plan to significantly increase the number of tests during the current year. The quality of tests has shown an increase in the detection rate from 2.25 per cent to 3.50 per cent. 

In recent years, NADA has taken a number of steps to increase education and awareness against doping, not only in Sports Authority of India (SAI) SAI training centres, but also at various university games and events conducted above state-level by various federations. In all national competitions, an undertaking is being taken from the athletes that they know the ill-effects of doping and will not indulge in doping. 

Director General, NADA, Shri Navin Agarwal, highlighted that the nutritional supplements presently available in the market do not carry any label, which may help the athlete in making an informed choice. The easy availability of drugs in the market without prescription is another issue. He highlighted the challenge of physically unfit candidates getting recruited in the Armed Forces and Police by clearing physical proficiency test by resorting to doping. 

Detailed discussions were held by various stakeholders at today’s meeting, which included officers from Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences, Food Safety Standards Authority of India and representatives from various Federations and sports bodies, athletes, medical professionals and sports administrators.

The Minister has asked NADA to organize a seminar with all stakeholders tomorrow to discuss the issue threadbare and finalize an effective strategy to deal with the menace, including the possibility of making doping a criminal offence.

He has also directed the NADA to sensitize the players at grassroots level about the ill-effects of doping through regular seminars and information campaigns at schools and colleges.

                India and Australia today launched Sports partnership in Mumbai aimed at increasing  cooperation in sports.  The Partnership, which was launched by the Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports Mr. Vijay Goel and the visiting Australian Prime Minister Mr. Malcolm Turnbull, in the presence of cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, will advance India – Australia cooperation in four areas - athlete and coach training and development, sport science, sport governance and integrity, and grassroots participation.”

 

Speaking on the occasion, Sports Minister Vijay Goel said “we have a lot to learn and share with Australia in the field of sports. The India-Australia Sports Partnership would facilitate exchange of athletes, coaches, technical officials, sports scientists between two countries.” 

 

He said India has started taking sports as a very important component of public health management as well as education. “We have launched a major grassroots programme - Khelo India for developing a sporting culture at grass-roots level.  We are planning to introduce sports as a compulsory subject in schools” he said. 

 

The Minister said that the National Sports Talent Identification and Development Portal would be launched shortly.   

 

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said under the new partnership Victoria University and the University of Canberra would work with India to assist in the establishment of a National Sports University similar to the Australian Institute of Sport.

 

Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Goel also met with some young girls from Mumbai’s slums who are being taught to play sports byApnalaya, an organization with which Sachin Tendulkar’s mother-in-law Ms. Annabel Mehta is associated with. The Australian PM  praised the work saying that sport builds up social capital.

 

Wrapping up his four day visit, Mr. Turnbull said India, which is evolving as an economic superpower,  is now enormously important in the region. He said “my trip has been all about deepening more engaged collaboration between Australia and India in the fields of economics, sports, health, science and education.”

These academies have been established in the discipline of : Swimming at Dr. SPMSPC, Hockey at MDCNS, Cycling at Cycling Velodrome,  IGSC. (It has also been declared as  World training Centre –Satellite by UCI.), Athletic Academy at JNS, Regional Football Academy at JNS

Sports Authority of India   entered into   MOU with    Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY)   on 31.05.2016 for a period of 5 years for conducting Yoga Training Programs for Athletes and Public at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Swimming Pool Complex and Indira Gandhi Sports Complex.

The scheme of Come & Play was reviewed and in order to encourage mass participation in sports, the fee for admission for public under Come & Play Scheme has been reduced to the bare minimum and free/ concession in some cases. Efforts are being made to increase the footfall by involving Kendriya Vidyalaya and Govt. schools .

To encourage schools, colleges and Universities and also NGOs working for the promotion of sports, the tariff plan has been made reasonable for booking of venues including FOP. This would persuade schools to book the venues for the sports events, thereby giving an opportunity to students to visit various stadia and to pursue sports.

Competitions are being held from December, 2016, on weekly basis at each stadium to remove monotony from training and also to develop the spirit of competition amongst the trainees of Come and Play.

A portal for Online booking of SAI Stadia has been launched from 01.09.2016 onwards to make Stadia bookings more users friendly.

                Thursday, April 27, 2017: Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) collaborated with NITI Aayog to retrofit LED lights, energy efficient ACs, Ceiling fans, Energy saver ACs, energy efficient Water Pumps and also installed chiller system in the NITI Aayog premises. This has resulted in an annual energy savings of 11.4 lakh kVAh, an annual monetary savings of Rs 1.02 crore and led to an annual CO2 reduction of 966 tons.



The total cost of the project is Rs 2.67 crore. EESL has retrofitted 3061 LED lighting, 591 energy efficient fans, 415 energy efficient air conditioners and installed 2 energy efficient chillers. Additionally, other energy efficient appliances such as energy efficient water pumps, APFC control and CEMS (Central Energy Management Systems), which tracks the buildings energy consumption has also been installed. With these interventions, BEE has certified NITI Aayog building with 5-star rating with Energy Performance Index of 72 (kWh/Sqm/annum).

NITI Aayog initiated the energy efficiency interventions in March 2014 in consultation with EESL. EESL analysed the connected load of NITI Aayog building and based on the highest components of energy utilization, target areas for interventions were identified. Additionally, monitoring and verification of the interventions was also carried out through physical verification of the replaced energy systems with wattage and operating hours by EESL.

The retrofitting and installation is executed in two phases with different models of implementation process.

Phase-I was done through PMC (Project Management Consultancy) mode in which entire capital cost was paid upfront by NITI Aayog and entire savings arising out of lower electricity bills accrue to NITI Aayog.

The chiller systems which is already installed in NITI Aayog under Phase-II, where EESL has implemented the project in ESCO shared saving model through collaboration with CPWD (Central Public Works Department). Under ESCO model, the upfront capital cost is borne by EESL and the resultant savings from projects are been used to repay for EESL investments on deemed basis. The highlight of features of the NITI Aayog building based on interventions is a follows:

                Several newspaper reports published on April 26th, 2017, state that NITI Aayog or its Draft Three year Action Agenda has recommended that Farm Income in India be taxed to expand the existing Income Tax base.  The NITI Aayog categorically states that this is neither the view of the Aayog nor is such a recommendation made anywhere in the Draft Action Agenda document as circulated to the Governing Council at the meeting on 23rd April 2017.

NITI Aayog notes that the views on Taxing Farm Income expressed by Member Shri BibekDebroy were personal and not those of the Aayog.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today called upon State Governments to work with the Union Government, as “Team India,” to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. Delivering the closing remarks at the third meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, he urged States, local Governments and all Government and Non-Government organizations to decide goals for 2022, and work in mission mode towards achieving them. 

Describing the discussions at today’s meeting as constructive, the Prime Minister said that the circulated vision document is a draft, and all suggestions given by the Chief Ministers will be taken into account before finalizing it. He laid emphasis on good governance and said it leads to optimum utilization of resources, even when resources are less than desired. 

The Prime Minister noted that the theme of regional imbalance was raised by a number of Chief Ministers. He agreed that this has to be addressed on priority, both nationally, and within States. 

Noting the invitation given by the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister suggested that States could organize events there. He also seconded the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister’s suggestion that States should take interest in the students from her State who are studying in other States. He urged States to reach out to these students from time to time. 

The Prime Minister reiterated that the legislative arrangements at the State-level for GST should be put in place without delay. 

The Prime Minister called upon States to use the GeM platform – Government e-Marketplace, to reduce corruption and increase transparency in Government procurement. He said the use of technologies such as BHIM and Aadhaar would result in significant savings for the States. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that the District Mineral Fund, the CAMPA Fund, and the construction workers welfare fund, would provide significant boost to the resources of the State. He asked NITI Aayog to come up with a roadmap for better utilization of such funds by the States. 

The Prime Minister urged States to join the Ek-Bharat, Shresth Bharat initiative, which was launched on Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary last year. He said India’s richness of culture and heritage should no longer be ignored. 

The Prime Minister said a constructive discussion has begun on the subject of holding Union and State elections simultaneously. The Prime Minister said that for long, India had suffered from economic and political mismanagement. He said that because of poor time management, many good initiatives and schemes had failed to deliver the anticipated results. He emphasized on the need to develop robust arrangements that could function amidst diversity. 

The Prime Minister mentioned the advancing of the budget presentation date. Stating that in a country where agricultural income is exceedingly important, budgets should be prepared immediately after the receipt of agricultural incomes for the year. He said that there have been suggestions to have the financial year from January to December. He urged States to take the initiative in this regard.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today said that as a former Chief Minister, he is convinced that the vision of “New India” can only be realised through the combined effort and cooperation of all States and Chief Ministers. Delivering the opening remarks at the third meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, the Prime Minister said that “Team India” has once again assembled today to discuss and reflect on ways to prepare India for changing global trends. He said the meeting today would be an opportunity to exchange views on policies and implementation. 

The Prime Minister said that it is the collective responsibility of this gathering to envision the India of 2022 – the 75th anniversary of independence – and see how we can swiftly move forward to achieve these goals. 

Recalling the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, on the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, the Prime Minister said NITI Aayog has been taking steps to transform India, with fresh vigour. He said the Government, private sector and civil society, all need to work in sync. He noted that NITI was a collaborative federal body whose strength was is in its ideas, rather than in administrative or financial control. He pointed out that the Chief Ministers did not have to come to NITI for approval of budgets or plans. He said NITI Aayog had gone beyond relying on government inputs and taken on board a number of outside specialists, subject experts, and Young Professionals; and States can also contribute to policy formulation. He gave the example of e-NAM, where experiences of States played a key role in the final policy. 

The Prime Minister noted that sub-groups of State Chief Ministers had given vital inputs on subjects such as Centrally Sponsored Schemes, Swachh Bharat, Skill Development and Digital payments. Stressing the importance given to the views of Chief Ministers, he noted that it was the first time Chief Ministers had been asked to recommend the list of Centrally sponsored schemes and the sharing pattern; despite funding constraints, the recommendations were accepted immediately. 

The Prime Minister mentioned that while there has been a 40 percent increase in overall fund allocation to States between 2014-15 and 2016-17, the percentage of funds tied to central schemes has declined from 40 percent of the earlier total, to 25 percent of the enhanced total with a corresponding increase in the untied share. 

The Prime Minister urged States to speed up capital expenditure and infrastructure creation. 

Speaking of the historic change in budget presentation date, the Prime Minister said this would enable timely availability of funds at the beginning of the financial year. Earlier, budgeted scheme funds were generally not approved by Parliament till May, after which they would be communicated to states and ministries. By that time, the monsoon arrived. Hence the best working season for schemes was typically lost. He also mentioned the ending of the distinction between plan and non-plan expenditure, based on the recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee in 2011, which had found the distinction to be counter-productive. Several important items of expenditure were included as ‘non-plan’ and hence neglected. Hereafter the emphasis would be on distinguishing between development and welfare expenditure on one hand, and administrative overheads on the other. 

The Prime Minister said that the Goods and Services Tax shows the strength and resolve of the federal structure. He gave credit to all Chief Ministers for coming on one platform for this cause, keeping aside ideological and political differences. Thanking the Chief Ministers, he said consensus on GST will go down in history as a great illustration of cooperative federalism. He said GST reflects the spirit of “One nation, One aspiration, One determination.” 

The Prime Minister called for carrying forward the debate and discussion on simultaneous elections. 

He said the NITI Aayog is working on a 15 year long term vision, 7 year medium term strategy, and 3 year action agenda. He said this effort needs support of States, and will eventually reflect in benefits to States.

 Digital transactions have gathered momentum giving a fillip to the less cash economy post demonetization thanks to the initiatives taken by the Government. NITI Aayog’s two schemes- Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana for the merchants have played a catalytic role in making it a mass movement.

A mega draw of lots was held at Rashtrapati Bhawan today to select the winners of the Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana. The President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee picked up six lucky winners on the final day of the 100 day scheme.

The winners will be felicitated by the Prime Minister on April 14th, 2017 at Nagpur, on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti.

Union Ministers Shri Ravishankar Prasad, Shri Kalraj Mishra, Shri Thavarchand Gehlot, Shri Jual Oram, Shri Piyush Goyal, Shri Santosh Gangwar, Shri Rao Inderjeet Singh along with the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog  Shri Aravind Panagariya, CEO NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant and senior officials attended the event. 

In his address, the President Pranab Mukherjee urged all citizens to extend their unstinted support to the mission of a less cash India. He said India is on the cusp of a digital revolution. More than one billion Indians have a unique identity number in Aadhaar with a biometric identifier which is unique in its own way. He appreciated that the Aadhaar enabled payment system has made digital payments possible for even those section of the population who may not have mobile phones. The President complemented the Government on its bold initiatives for promoting the culture of digital payment in the country. He said it was in line with such bold initiatives that the Parliament made a new beginning in Financial Management through passage of Annual Budget by March 31, 2017. 

 

The two schemes were launched on December 25th, 2016. Under the scheme, daily, weekly and monthly rewards worth Rs. 256 crore has been disbursed to over 16 lakh citizens over the past 100 days for making and accepting small transactions digitally. Modeled after a careful study of best practices undertaken internationally to create an economy that is minimally reliant on cash, the schemes have been executed over a period of 100 days. Combined with Digi Dhan Melas held across India, in 100 cities over a period of 100 days, the initiative has had a transformational impact in enabling the adoption of digital payment methods in all walks of life.  

 

Over the past 100 days, everyday 15,000 consumers have qualified for total prize money of Rs. 1.5 crore. Additionally, 14,000 weekly winners, both consumers and merchants, have received a total prize money of over Rs. 8.3 crore every week.  Customers and merchants using RuPay Card, BHIM / UPI (Bharat Interface for Money / Unified Payments Interface), USSD based *99# service and Aadhaar Enabled Payment Service (AePS) have been eligible for wining daily and weekly lucky draw prizes.

 

“The draw has seen a positive impact from various age groups and occupations in adopting digital payments methods. We have seen a steady increase in the number of transactions made using all payment methods,” said A. P. Hota, MD & CEO, NPCI, which has been responsible for conducting the draws.

 

An analysis of digital payments’ users across India reveals that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka have emerged as the top five states / UTs with maximum number of winners. An analysis of winners profiles’ reveals that they are spread across a range of occupational categories including salaried employees, housewives, farmers and daily wage labourers. While majority of the winners were in the age group of 21 to 30 years, there are also a significant number of winners who are above 60 years of age.

 

Over 18 million people have downloaded Bharat Interface for Money or the BHIM App, creating a new world record. The UPI based transactions crossed Rs.2000 crore mark in the month of March showing an increase of 20% since January this year. The rise in digital transactions is a reflection of the people’s resolve to give a push to the Prime Minister’s quest for ending the black money through digital payments and penetration of formal finance in the hinterland of the country. Digital payment methods are now gaining the proportions of a mass movement.
