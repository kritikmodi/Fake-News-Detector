                My dear fellow citizens,

Namaskar!

My heartiest greetings in advance to all Indians living in the country and abroad on the eve of the 76th Independence Day. I am delighted to address you on this momentous occasion. India is completing 75 years as an independent nation. Fourteenth August is observed as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ so as to promote social harmony, unity and empowerment of people. Tomorrow marks the day when we had freed ourselves from the shackles of colonial rulers and decided to reshape our destiny. As all of us celebrate the anniversary of that day, we bow to all those men and women who made enormous sacrifices to make it possible for us to live in a free India. 

It is a cause of celebration not only for all of us but also for every advocate of democracy around the world. When India won independence, there were many international leaders and experts who were skeptical about the success of democratic form of government in India. They had their reasons to be doubtful. In those days, democracy was limited to economically advanced nations. India, after so many years of exploitation at the hands of foreign rulers, was marked by poverty and illiteracy. But we Indians proved the skeptics wrong. Democracy not only grew roots in this soil, it was enriched too. 

In most other well-established democracies, women had to wage long-drawn struggles to get the right to vote. But India adopted universal adult franchise right since the beginning of the Republic. Thus, the makers of modern India enabled each and every adult citizen to participate in the collective process of nation-building. Thus, India can be credited to have helped the world discover the true potential of democracy. 

I believe this was not a coincidence. At the beginning of civilisation, saints and seers of this land had developed a vision of humanity that was defined by equality of all; indeed, oneness of all. The great Freedom Struggle and its leaders like Mahatma Gandhi re-discovered our ancient values for modern times. Then, it is no wonder our democracy has Indian characteristics. Gandhiji advocated decentralisation and power to the people. 

For 75 weeks now, the nation has been commemorating these noble ideals that won us freedom. In March 2021, we began the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ with the re-enactment of the Dandi March. This way, our celebrations began with a tribute to that watershed event which had put our struggle on the world map. This festival is dedicated to the people of India. Based on the success achieved by the people, the resolve to build 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' is also a part of this Mahotsav. Citizens from all age-groups have keenly participated in a series of events held across the country. This grand festival is going ahead with the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga Abhiyan’. The Indian tricolours are fluttering in every nook and corner of the country. Great martyrs would have been thrilled to see the spirit of the Independence Movement coming alive again on such a massive scale. 

Our glorious Freedom Struggle was waged bravely across the vast territory of our country. Many great freedom fighters did their duty and passed on the torch of awakening leaving little trace of their heroic deeds. Forgotten for long were many heroes and their struggles, especially among the peasant and tribal populations. The government’s decision last year to observe 15th November as ‘Janajatiya Gaurav Divas’ is welcome because our tribal heroes are not merely local or regional icons but they inspire the entire nation. 

Dear Citizens,

For a nation, particularly an ancient one such as India, the passage of 75 years is merely a blink of an eye. But for us as individuals, it is a lifetime. Senior citizens among us have witnessed a dramatic change in their lifetime. They have seen how, after Independence, all the generations have toiled hard; how we met great challenges and how we have taken charge of our destiny. The lessons learnt in the process will prove useful as we move towards the next milestone in the journey of the nation – the Amrit Kaal, the 25 years to the celebration of the centenary of our Independence. 

By the year 2047, we will have fully realised the dreams of our freedom fighters. We will have given a concrete shape to the vision of those who, led by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, drafted the Constitution. We are already on course to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat, an India that would have realised its true potential.

The world has seen a new India rising in recent years, more so after the outbreak of COVID-19. Our response to the pandemic has been appreciated everywhere. We launched the biggest vaccination drive in human history with vaccines manufactured in the country itself. Last month we crossed the 200-crore mark in cumulative vaccine coverage. In combating the pandemic, our achievements have been better than those of many developed countries. For this feat, we are grateful to our scientists, doctors, nurses, paramedics and the staff associated with vaccination.   

The pandemic has uprooted lives and also economies in the entire world. When the world has been battling the economic consequences of the great crisis, India got its act together and is now moving forward. India is among the fastest growing major economies in the world. India's start-up eco-system ranks high in the world. The success of start-ups in our country, especially the growing number of unicorns is a shining example of our industrial progress. The government and policy-makers deserve credit for beating the global trend and helping the economy flourish. During the last few years, unprecedented progress has been made in the development of physical and digital infrastructure. Through the Pradhan Mantri Gati-Shakti Yojana, all the modes of connectivity based on water, land, air etc. are being integrated in the whole country to enable seamless transportation across the country. For the vibrancy of growth visible in our country, credit must also be given to workers and farmers whose hard work has made it possible and entrepreneurs whose business acumen has created wealth. What is all the more heartening is that the growth is becoming more inclusive and regional disparities too are reducing. 

But this is only the beginning. A series of economic reforms and policy initiatives have been preparing the ground for a long term. Digital India, for example, is creating the bedrock of a knowledge economy. The ‘National Education Policy’ is aimed at preparing the future generation for the next stage of industrial revolution while also reconnecting it with our heritage. 

Economic success is leading to an ease in living too. Economic reforms are rightly accompanied by innovative welfare initiatives. A home of one’s own is no longer a dream for the poor, but a reality for more and more people, thanks to the ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’. Similarly, under the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’, tap water connection is being provided to every household since the launch of the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme. 

The aim of these and many other similar efforts is to provide basic amenities to all, particularly the poor. The keyword for India today is compassion; for the downtrodden, for the needy and for those on the margins. Some of our national values have been incorporated in our Constitution as the Fundamental Duties of the citizens. I appeal to every citizen to know about their Fundamental Duties and follow them in letter and spirit so that our nation reaches new heights.

Dear Citizens,

At the core of the transformation, we have been witnessing in healthcare, education, economy as well as a number of related areas is the stress on good governance. When work is done with the spirit of ‘Nation First’, it is bound to reflect in every decision and every sector. This is also reflected in India’s standing in the world.

India’s new-found confidence stems from the spirit of its youth, its farmers, and above all, its women. Gender inequalities are reducing and women are moving ahead, breaking many glass ceilings. Their increasing participation in social and political processes will prove decisive. At the grassroots level, we have more than 14 lakh elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions.   

Our daughters are the biggest hope for the nation. Some of them brought laurels for the country at the recently held Commonwealth Games. Of course, India’s sportspersons have been making the country proud by their performance in international competitions. A large number of our winners come from underprivileged segments of society. From becoming fighter pilots to space scientists, our daughters are scaling great heights. 

Dear Citizens, 

In celebrating Independence Day, we are celebrating our ‘Bharatiyata’. Our country is full of diversity. But, at the same time, we all have something in common. It is this common thread which binds all of us together and inspires us to walk together with the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat. 

India is a very beautiful country, also because of its mountains, rivers, lakes and forests and the animals and birds that live in such landscapes. When the environment is facing new challenges, we must remain determined to preserve all that makes India beautiful. Conserving water, soil and bio-diversity is our duty towards our children. Caring for Mother Nature has been part and parcel of Indian culture. With our traditional life style, we Indians can show the way to the rest of the world. Yoga and Ayurveda are India's invaluable gifts to the world. Their popularity is on the rise all over the globe.

Dear fellow citizens, 

Our beloved country has given us everything we have in our life. We should pledge to give everything we can for the sake of safety, security, progress and prosperity of our country. Our existence will become meaningful only in building a glorious India. The great nationalist poet Kuvempu, who enriched Indian literature through Kannada language, had written: 

 

Naanu aliwe, Neenu aliwe

Namma elubugal mele

Mooduvudu – Mooduvudu

Navabharatda leele

 

Which means:

‘I will pass

So will you

But on our bones will arise

The great tale of a new India’

This is a clarion call of the nationalist poet for making total sacrifice for the motherland and upliftment of fellow citizens. To follow these ideals is my special appeal to the youth of the country who are going to build the India of 2047.  

Before I conclude, I would like to extend Independence Day greetings to the armed forces, to the members of Indian missions abroad, and to the Indian diaspora who continue to make their motherland proud. My best wishes to all of you.

 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

                My dear fellow citizens,

Namaskar!

My heartiest greetings in advance to all Indians living in the country and abroad on the eve of the 76th Independence Day. I am delighted to address you on this momentous occasion. India is completing 75 years as an independent nation. Fourteenth August is observed as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ so as to promote social harmony, unity and empowerment of people. Tomorrow marks the day when we had freed ourselves from the shackles of colonial rulers and decided to reshape our destiny. As all of us celebrate the anniversary of that day, we bow to all those men and women who made enormous sacrifices to make it possible for us to live in a free India. 

It is a cause of celebration not only for all of us but also for every advocate of democracy around the world.

We are already on course to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat, an India that would have realised its true potential.

The world has seen a new India rising in recent years, more so after the outbreak of COVID-19. Our response to the pandemic has been appreciated everywhere.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee presented the Malti Gyan Peeth Puraskars for the year 2017 today (May 29, 2017) at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the 15 distinguished teachers who were bestowed with the Malti Gyan Peeth Puraskars. The President said that he was delighted to confer the award instituted in the name of Smt. Malti Mohinder Singh Syngle, an eminent educationist and crusader for promoting education for girls whose 96th birthday was today. He also complimented Shri Manoj Singhal, President of Mohinder Singh Syngle Education & Research Society for his commitment to the cause of promoting education and for instituting this award. 

The President said that development, to his mind, is not merely the installation of more industrial units; construction of high rise buildings; dams; roads etc. The connotation of development incorporates culmination of people’s adherence to values and their faithfulness to their spiritual and cultural heritage. A holistic education system enables us to put values at the forefront of the educational enterprise in schools and colleges. Such a system is conducive to the ideal development of society. He saw a pivotal role for teachers in this endeavour. The teachers share an onerous responsibility of instilling in the minds of students, rich cultural ethos, tolerance and innovation for the wellbeing of society. 

The President said that the teachers who have been awarded today represent the dedicated teachers of our nation. They are the ones who are educating and extending learning opportunities to students. From the Vedic era to modern times, we have had ‘gurus’ who nourished the minds and intellect of our people. Such teachers are there even today. He said that he calls them inspired teachers. They encourage students to be inquisitive about extant knowledge. They prompt them to question the established facts in their disciplines. They do not seek only answers from students; rather they want students to raise questions. Inspired teachers themselves have deep knowledge of their subject areas. They are able to assist students in understanding and appreciating the subject from different perspectives, and in fact, help them in constructing the frontiers of knowledge. The competent and motivated pool of teachers, through their collective efforts, can create a society full of strong minds and courageous hearts, and through them alter the history of a nation. Education is the true alchemy that can bring India to its next golden age. 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister of Women and Child Development; Shri Prakash Jawdekar, Union Minister of Human Resource and Development; Dr. K. K. Paul, Governor of Uttarakhand and Smt. Aruna Chaudhary, Education Minister, Govt. of Punjab.

                I am indeed very happy to be amidst this august gathering of distinguished dental professionals, academicians and research scholars and to receive the first copies of these two books – Color Atlas of Oral implants and Conservative Dentistry – Basics. At the outset, let me congratulate the authors of both these books Dr. Praful Bali, Dr. Lanka Mahesh, Dr. Dildeep Bali and Dr. Deepika Chandhok for their efforts in writing these two publications.

Dentistry as a whole has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few decades and dental awareness has started spreading across India. All this has been possible due to the hard work and commitment of the dental fraternity. But, inspite of so many dentists graduating every year, there is still a dearth of health care professionals and dental surgeons. India being heavily populated country and in rural India, the local population lacks basic knowledge on dental cases and thus indulge in habits and practices, harmful for oral health. As responsible trained and qualified individuals, people like all of you are needed to deliver oral health to the community. I would encourage each one of you to step out of your comfort zone and serve in hinterland. The quantum of work required to be done in this field is huge. Unless citizens enjoy good health, their productive potential cannot be realized fully and this puts pressure on us to provide good dental care where its most needed.

The standards of oral and dental health are challenging in the Indian sub-continent. Most people are ignorant of the significance of oral health and its impact on general health. Oral diseases and tooth decay are considered a part of aging process and ignored by large number of people. To my mind, dentists are the custodian of oral health in the country. They have a very important role to play to raise awareness of the need and reach out to the masses, especially in the rural area.

Dental issues affect 70-75% of our children and gum diseases affect nearly 90% of the entire population. Oral cancer is also one of the major health challenges of the 21st century and India is also facing the challenge of treatment and prevention of this disease.

Having said that, I am happy to know that advances in dental treatment technologies and research are making dentistry a technology driven discipline. In this ever-changing world one needs to update oneself by learning newer technologies and make its apt use in clinical practice.

Dentistry has also attained new level of excellence in India today and we are witnessing revolutionary changes in dental technology. Latest technology has improved all aspects, from diagnosis to patient comfort, to good effective dental care and better prognosis. I am sure the two books which I have received today will be helpful for dental students, fresh dentists and experienced ones alike.

The color atlas – authored by Dr. Praful Bali and Dr. Lanka Mahesh focuses on advanced procedures performed by the authors in the field of dental implantology. I am told that the cases are very well documented and I am sure budding and experienced dentists in this field will surely have a lot to gain from this book.

Unlike the Color Atlas, the other book titled Conservative dentistry – Basics, focuses on the basic fundamentals of the subject, with a lot of text, clinical pictures, and schematic diagrams for better understanding of students.

Smile is a universal language and I am glad that you all play a vital role in bringing real smiles on faces of people. This is how Dr. Bali, has made me to smile & masticate my food properly.

I once again congratulate the authors for bringing out the said books. I also congratulate Dr. R.K. Bali and Dr. Mazumder for their continuous and untiring efforts in providing dental care to the farthest of regions in India.

Thank you.

Jai Hind.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee received the first copies of books ‘Color Atlas of Oral implants’ and ‘Conservative Dentistry – Basics’ at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (May 13, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that dentistry as a whole has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few decades and dental awareness has started spreading across India. All this has been possible due to the hard work and commitment of the dental fraternity. India being a heavily populated country, despite many dentists graduating every year, there is still a dearth of health care professionals and dental surgeons. In rural India, the local population lacks basic knowledge on dental cases and thus indulge in habits and practices, harmful for oral health. Unless citizens enjoy good health, their productive potential cannot be realized fully and this puts pressure on us to provide good dental care where it is most needed.

The President said that dentistry has attained a new level of excellence in India today and we are witnessing revolutionary changes in dental technology. Latest technology has improved all aspects, from diagnosis to patient comfort, to good effective dental care and better prognosis. The President said that he was sure the two books he had received from the authors today would be helpful for dental students, fresh dentists and experienced ones alike. He also congratulated the authors of both the books - Dr. Praful Bali, Dr. Lanka Mahesh, Dr. Dildeep Bali and Dr. Deepika Chandhok for their efforts.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia on the eve of their National Day (May 28, 2017).

In a message to His Excellency Mr. Mulatu Teshome, the President of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government, the people of India and on my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to convey to you and to the people of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, warm greetings and felicitations on the occasion of your National Day.

India and Ethiopia share age-old bilateral ties based on mutual respect and understanding, strengthened by our engagement in areas of common interest-particularly bilateral trade and commerce.

I take this opportunity to extend to Your Excellency, my best wishes for your personal well being and for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Ethiopia”.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee presented the Dr. Ambedkar National Awards for outstanding contribution to the promotion of social understanding and for the upliftment of weaker sections of the society for the years 2011, 2012 and 2014 today (May 26, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the winners of Dr. Ambedkar National Awards. He said that we deeply appreciate and value the works done by Professor S K Thorat, a well known scholar, ‘Samta Sainik Dal’ a non-political organization founded by Dr. Ambedkar, ‘Amar Sewa Sangam’ an institution working in the field of empowering differently abled persons and Shri Babu Lal Nirmal, a social activist from Rajasthan. All of them have done tremendous work in furthering the vision of Bharat Ratna, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, which was to create a society in which everybody is treated equally irrespective of his or her caste, community, status or belief. 

The President quoted Dr. Ambedkar and said “Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life”. He stated that Dr. Ambedkar’s vision of liberty, equality and social justice found appropriate place in our Constitution which puts a lots of emphasis on removing social injustice and promoting positive actions to bring the disadvantaged sections in the mainstream. He stated that the generation of today, identifies Baba Saheb as the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, but he was much more than this. Dr. Ambedkar strongly believed that political Independence cannot assure either solidarity or national integration in the absence of social justice. 

The President congratulated Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot and his colleagues for working to extend a helping hand to those in need and mobilizing social forces to ensure that all can enjoy the fruits of development.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee received the first copies of books ‘Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’ and ‘Marching with a Billion- Analysing Narendra Modi’s Government at Midterm’ from Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, Speaker Lok Sabha who formally released these books at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan today in the presence of Mohd. Hamid Ansari, Vice President of India, Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Finance and Defence and other dignitaries. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said effective communication is important for any leader. Without having the capacity to communicate, a leader may not be able to inspire people to follow his ideas and approach. He said that undoubtedly, in the contemporary period Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is one of the most effective communicators of the times. In independent India, Prime Minister Pt. Nehru effectively propagated the values in our Constitution including secularism. Smt. Indira Gandhi mobilized public in favour of the Liberation war of Bangladesh effectively. Various initiatives taken by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi have resulted in the Indian economy moving forward in a steadfast manner. 

The President congratulated and expressed gratitude to the publishers for bringing out the two books. He said the books cover important issues of topical concern and should have a wide readership because of their inherent merit. 

Vice President of India, Mohd. Hamid Ansari, Speaker Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan and Union Minister for Finance and Defence, Shri Arun Jaitley also addressed the gathering and gave an account of how the books capture key aspects of the personality of Shri Narendra Modi and achievements of the Government. 

The book ‘Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’ is a compilation of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s addresses to the nation on radio every month under the programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. It contains a comprehensive, qualitative and academic analysis of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ – the themes, the choice of topics, the salient features. It illustrates how ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has connected with the ‘New India’ – the youth in particular. It also presents a coherent narrative about the manner in which ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has created mass movements, be it in cleanliness, in promoting India’s tourism potential, safer roads, drugs free India etc. The book has been compiled by Shri Rajesh Jain. 

The book ‘Marching with a Billion- Analysing Narendra Modi’s Government at Midterm’ analyses the monumental changes that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has brought on multiple fronts as Prime Minister on India’s governance landscape by ushering in an unprecedented culture of transparency to create a level playing field so necessary in a developing country. It is authored by Shri Uday Mahurkar. 

The books have been brought out by ‘BlueKraft Digital Foundation’ and ‘LexisNexis’.

                It is indeed a privilege as well as a pleasure for me to be invited to deliver the Ramnath Goenka Memorial Lecture. 

When I think of The Indian Express, I think of Shri Ramnath Goenka.

Ramnath ji embodied the finest virtues of journalism: fierce independence, fearlessness and a determination to always stand up to the powerful and fight against the abuse or misuse of power. In fact, there was nothing he enjoyed more than a fight to protect the right of The Indian Express to publish what he thought was proper and just. 

He was a fighter. In the face of attempts to control the press, exemplified his willingness to stake all for his principles and to set the highest standards for press freedom in India. The blank editorial published by The Indian Express during Emergency, under the leadership of Ramnath ji, was perhaps one of the strongest protests ever published against censorship in India. 

It spoke more loudly than any words could have. 

As Ramnath ji wrote in an editorial in August 1942 when he announced suspension of the paper rather than give in to censorship by the British authorities. He said and I quote: “The hard fact of the situation is that if we went on publishing, The Indian Express maybe called a paper, but cannot be a newspaper.” (unquote)

It is also worth remembering today that Ramnath ji was a true patriot. When he founded The Indian Express in 1936 it was in response to a need articulated by Mahatma Gandhi for a national newspaper. He fought for the freedom of the country and for freedom of the press. He took on the Establishment – in colonial times and after Independence – to make democracy more secure and zealously guard the right to free speech as is enshrined in our Constitution. Better than most, he realized that democracy without a free press was like a blank piece of paper. 

The ideals he personified need to be reiterated time and again, cast in stone and followed by all journalists who love democracy and freedom. 

I am happy to say that The Indian Express has maintained the standards under the leadership of Ramnathji’s son, Shri Viveck Goenka. It has not wavered in its commitment to fairness and accuracy, to independence and a pursuit of the truth. 

These are not old-fashioned values. 

In fact, the values espoused by Ramnath ji were relevant then, are relevant now and will remain relevant in times to come. 

In a way, everyone with a phone can be a publisher and a broadcaster, a schoolteacher, a mother, a student and a political activist.

Technology has led to a phenomenal growth in the means of communication, bombarding the public with unprecedented volumes of data, information and, not least, opinion. This has had many positive outcomes: foremost, it has broken the shackles of silence imposed on the powerless. The sense of liberation that the Internet and social media especially, allows, has ensured that everyone has a voice and that even small voices in the remotest areas can be heard. 

The average citizen has been truly empowered in her ability to speak out and to find out. All of this growth has resulted in a plurality and diversity in the access to information. There is a whole new information world out there to be tapped by our people across the length and breadth of the country. 

However, the downside is that the sheer scale and volume of data and information means that much of what is available today remains unfiltered and unmediated. In many cases, even unchecked.

Take the case of recent developments in the United States of America and France, where personal communications of political leaders during an election were leaked and made available freely to anyone roaming the Internet. 

Such information, in order to make sense needs to be carefully vetted – checked and rechecked -- contextualized and made sense of for it to have value or equally importantly, not be misused. 

When so many people speak in so many voices across mediums, many voices are drowned out in the cacophony that is created: and in that noise it is difficult to hear or make sense of what is being said. 

This is where good journalism plays a vital and irreplaceable role: it intervenes. It sifts through all the data, separates facts from what is now described as “fake news,” ensures accuracy and provides context, analysis and opinion so that the public can be better informed and form informed opinions. 

Aggregation and algorithms, the multiplicity of choices, have meant that while our access to the news is unfettered and vast, it has become increasingly, personalized. People now have the choice to read only what they want to and more importantly, only what they agree with. Inherent in this process of selective sourcing of news, is the danger of people turning a deaf ear to one another, and a refusal to listen to points of view that may differ from our own. This in turn diminishes the room for agreement and can increase intolerance. 

As I have said on many occasions earlier, discussion, dissension are crucial to public debate for decision-making in a vibrant, healthy democracy such as India’s. There should always be room for the Argumentative Indian but not for the Intolerant Indian. 

That would be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution of India, to the very idea of India itself. 

I believe that the bedrock of Indian civilization has been its pluralism and its social, cultural, linguistic and racial diversity. It mesmerises me when I shut my eyes and think that in our country 1.3 billion people who are using more than 200 languages, practicing 7 major religions, belonging to 3 major ethnic groups are residing under one system, one flag and one identity of being Indian. That is the celebration of our diversity. That’s why we need to be sensitive to dominant narratives, of those who make the loudest noise, drowning out those who disagree. That’s why social media and broadcast news have seen angry, aggressive posturing by state and non-state players literally hounding out contrarian opinions. 

People in power, across the spectrum of politics, business or civil society, by virtue of the position they enjoy, tend to dominate the discussions and influence its direction. Due to technological advancement, they can now reach out directly to their audience, completely bypassing this crucial process of filtration and mediation. 

This often becomes a one-way only communication from the powerful to the less privileged, and an effort to push the narrative in one direction. Indian civilization has always celebrated plurality and promoted tolerance. These have been at the core of our very existence as a people, binding us together for centuries despite our many differences. We must continue to “throw open the windows for fresh breezes” as Mahatma Gandhi observed, without being blown away. 

Thus the need to ask questions of those in power is fundamental for the preservation of our nation and of a truly democratic society. 

This is a role that the media has traditionally played and must carry on playing.

All stakeholders in the democratic system, from parties to business leaders, citizens to institutions, have to realize that asking questions is good, asking questions is healthy and, in fact, is fundamental to the health of our democracy.

As its role of the primary source of information has diminished due to the variety of mediums now available, the media’s other responsibilities have increased: it must be the watchdog, the gatekeeper and the mediator between the leaders and the public. 

It must raise and create awareness about issues concerning public welfare, hold public or private institutions and their representatives accountable for all their actions or indeed, their inactions. 

In particular, the media has a duty to give space to the millions who still face the injustices of deprivation, gender discrimination, caste and social bias. 

I believe the media must safeguard the public interest, and provide a voice to the marginalized in our society. Our people face enormous inequalities which need to be articulated and highlighted continuously – by the media -- in order to ensure they are addressed by those who govern. 

The media can help the one-way communication become a multi-faceted, multi-layered conversation between those who exercise any form of power and the average citizen. It can build a thoroughfare where ideas can travel up and down, to and fro, as it strives continually for accountability and transparency in public life. 

I have said before that the media plays a crucial role in educating Indians and providing space for the expression of diverse views. This role of giving a voice to all has become more important than ever before in an atmosphere where there is too much noise out there jostling for our attention. 

At the same time, more than ever before, the media needs to play its role with greater responsibility and the utmost respect for facts. I believe fact-checking is one of the most significant roles the media can play in the contemporary space where extreme opinions to the left and to the right, present what is now called `alternative facts’. 

When opinion is deeply divided on issues of public importance, be they related to governance, the law, social change or personal beliefs and conduct, objectivity is at a premium. Facts must never be sacrificed to elevated opinions as truth. 

In such a situation, journalists must strive – as I know many of you do – to obtain the facts and restore their sanctity.

For it to be able to aim for the highest standards of professionalism, journalists and media organizations must turn the spotlight inwards, on themselves. They must hold themselves to the standards they demand of others. 

There is the ever present danger of ‘paid news’. Ownership of media, concentration of ownership and distribution platforms in a few hands, and the personal beliefs of individual journalists can and do create conflicts of interest. They also reduce the plurality and diversity of the media. Objectivity has to be restored to regain public trust.

As Ramnathji showed us, the moral courage of the owner or the publisher is fundamental to the level of freedom in the newsroom. 

The sheer scale and diversity of growth in media has been breath-taking and had its own consequences. India already has 400 million Internet users, 300 million smartpthone users; Facebook and Whatsapp have close to 200 million users in India while Twitter has become the most immediate source of information and opinion.

The media too, has witnessed continuous growth, although not on the same scale. Print media continues to grow at a healthy 5 per cent – the regional language press has been at the vanguard of this growth. There are over 400 TV channels which carry news and over 150 dedicated news channels in all regions and languages. 

This abundance of media outlets has led to a highly competitive media environment which often results in the survival of the shrillest voices rising above the others to be heard. Dumbing down the news to attract an audience is another consequence of the phenomenal growth of the media. 

Together, these compulsions have led to complex issues being reduced to binary opposites which, in turn, create a polarity of views and distort the facts. 

Media houses need to ask themselves how they can find sustainable economic models that will allow them to resist all kinds of pressures and let them perform their role with honesty and transparency.

We are living in challenging times, globally and nationally. In India, as awareness has grown and spread through literacy and technology, the people’s aspirations have increased. A young and vibrant population—over 65 per cent of Indians are below the age of 35 -- is eagerly looking towards a future which will offer it sufficient opportunities to fulfil its ambitions. 

Even as the youth look to the future, there has been considerable questioning of the past in the public discourse over the last few years. Each generation has the right to look back and reassess the strengths and weaknesses of the past. Let the brave new India draw its own conclusions.

However, such inquiry should not be blinkered by biases or resisted with a closed mind. Indian history and centuries’ old civilization is replete with examples of a willingness of the people to, as I have said, `doubt, disagree and dispute intellectually’. This is the bedrock of our nation; our Constitution is a testament to the accommodation of our differences within the framework of an overarching idea of India. What makes us Indians is our spirit of tolerance and accommodation towards each other and those who differ from us. That has been the survival mantra of our civilization over generations. Dear Friends, 

The Press and the media are considered to be the fourth pillar of the democracy. It wields extra ordinary powers of not only holding the other three pillars accountable, but also influencing and shaping public opinion like no other institution of democracy can. While this enormous power, to sustain itself requires the basic dictum of freedom of expression, at the same time it puts an equally enormous responsibility of accountability and credibility on the media itself. To my mind, while the press will be failing in its duty if it does not pose questions to the powers that be, it will have to simultaneously judge the frivolous from the factual and publicity from reportage. 

This is a tremendous challenge for the media and one that it must stand up to. It must resist the temptation to take the path of least resistance which is to allow a dominant viewpoint to prevail without questioning it or allowing others the opportunity to question it. 

Media must learn the art of withstanding pulls and pressures without sacrificing its commitment to free and fair reportage and always remain on guard against conformity. Because any tendency towards conformity to be enforced, often requires disguising or dissembling the truth and the facts. This is completely alien to the ideals which inform professional journalism which lives and even dies by chasing the facts and the truth. 

The question that faces all of us including the media is whether we will choose to define ourselves as a nation enriched by the diversity of views or allow partisan views to dominate our national narrative? 

We ought to remember that democracy will be the loser when and if we cease to hear voices other than our own. 

For centuries, India has witnessed a clash of civilizations and philosophies – and survived it all to grow into the world’s largest functioning democracy. 

As we go forward as a nation we face contradictory forces: on the one hand is a country with immense potential for growth and prosperity; on the other is a growing sense of unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. The media should reflect both in equal measure but it can only do so if it truthfully reflects the reality on the ground. 

Such a reality is a contested space where different points of view jostle to be heard. Will the media give a hearing to the voices from Ground Zero? Will it continue to be a forum where people debate, disagree, dissent? 

If the media believes in the freedom of expression, a free and a fearless independent media as Ramnath Goenka did, it must choose to reflect a plurality of opinions for that is what breathes life into our democracy and has defined us as Indians. It must always remember that its fundamental task is to stand up and ask questions with honesty and fairness. That’s the sacred compact it has with citizens in a democracy. 

Thank you.

Jai Hind!

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee delivered the Ramnath Goenka Memorial Lecture today (May 25, 2017) in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Shri Ramnath Goenka embodied the finest virtues of journalism: fierce independence, fearlessness and a determination to always stand up to the powerful and fight against the abuse or misuse of power. In fact, there was nothing he enjoyed more than a fight to protect the right of The Indian Express to publish what he thought was proper and just. 

The President said that technology has led to a phenomenal growth in the means of communication, bombarding the public with unprecedented volumes of data, information and, not least, opinion. This has had many positive outcomes: foremost, it has broken the shackles of silence imposed on the powerless. The sense of liberation that the Internet and social media especially, allows, has ensured that everyone has a voice and that even small voices in the remotest areas can be heard. The average citizen has been truly empowered in her ability to speak out and to find out. All of this growth has resulted in a plurality and diversity in the access to information. There is a whole new information world out there to be tapped by our people across the length and breadth of the country. However, the downside is that the sheer scale and volume of data and information means that much of what is available today remains unfiltered and unmediated. In many cases, even unchecked.

The President said that he believes the media must safeguard the public interest, and provide a voice to the marginalized in our society. Our people face enormous inequalities which need to be articulated and highlighted continuously – by the media -- in order to ensure they are addressed by those who govern. For it to be able to aim for the highest standards of professionalism, journalists and media organizations must turn the spotlight inwards, on themselves. They must hold themselves to the standards they demand of others.

While this enormous power, to sustain itself requires the basic dictum of freedom of expression, at the same time it puts an equally enormous responsibility of accountability and credibility on the media itself.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee will receive the first copies of books ‘Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’ and ‘Marching with a Billion- Analysing Narendra Modi’s Government at Midterm’ from Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, Speaker Lok Sabha who will formally release it at a function to be held at Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow (May 26, 2017) in the presence of Mohd. Hamid Ansari, Vice President of India, Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Finance and Defence and other dignitaries.  

The book ‘Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’ by Shri Rajesh Jain is a compilation of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s addresses to the nation on radio every month under the programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. It contains a comprehensive, qualitative and academic analysis of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ – the themes, the choice of topics, the salient features. It illustrates how ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has connected with the ‘New India’ – the youth in particular. It also presents a coherent narrative about the manner in which ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has created mass movements, be it in cleanliness, in promoting India’s tourism potential, safer roads, drugs free India etc.

The book ‘Marching with a Billion- Analysing Narendra Modi’s Government at Midterm’ written by eminent journalist Shri Uday Mahurkar analyses the monumental changes that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has brought on multiple fronts as Prime Minister on India’s governance landscape by ushering in an unprecedented culture of transparency to create a level playing field so necessary in a developing country.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana on the eve of their Independence Day (May 26, 2017).

In a message to His Excellency Brig. (Retd) David Arthur Granger, the President of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, the President has said, “It gives me great pleasure to felicitate you on behalf of people and Government of India and on my own behalf on the occasion of the Independence Day of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana.

Bilateral relations between India and Guyana are based on the solid foundations of our shared history and culture.  Both our countries can look forward to further co-operation in various sectors of shared interest to the benefit of our two peoples.  Our close cooperation in international fora is an important dimension of our strengthening ties.  The recent visit of Prime Minister Moses Nagamootoo to India has deepened our mutual understanding.

I am glad to learn that Guyana holds the current Presidency of CARICOM.  I am confident under your presidency, India’s engagement with the Caribbean Community will be further enhanced.

 I take this opportunity to convey to Your Excellency my best wishes for your personal well-being and for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Guyana”.

This is not an attack just against the UK and its people; it is an attack against the humanity and the values that we all live for. These repeated terror attacks are a grim reminder, yet again, of the need for us to intensify the global fight against terrorism. India is fully committed to working with the UK and the international community in defeating these evil forces.

The people of India join me in conveying our sincere condolences for those whom we have lost. Our prayers are also with the injured. I wish them a speedy recovery”.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee addressed the 159th Founder’s Day Celebrations of Lawrence School at Ootacamund, The Nigiris today (May 23, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that education does not merely imply imparting information. Rather, values imparted by schools have to be absorbed in the personalities of students so that they become worthy citizens of our great nation. We do not want merely informed robots without any soul. We want human beings who are sensitive to the needs of society. He stated that the beaming and confident faces of students in the school, inspired confidence in him that the future of our country is safe in the hands of our young children who have the competence to face all odds and challenges.

The President said that Lawrence school is a premier residential public school of our country. Established in 1858, it was set to impart vocational education to the orphans and children of European soldiers in India. Over the years, the school has developed its own unique character. He wished the management, staff and students of the school all success in their future endeavours.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee received the books ‘Jnan, A-Janan and Bijnan: Popper-er Jnantatta’ and ‘Samudra Banijjer Prekshite Sthala Banijjya, Bharat Mahasagar Anchal, 1500-1800’ from Dr. Sushil Chaudhury and Dr. (Smt.) Mahasweta Chaudhury in Kolkata, West Bengal today (May 19, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was happy to receive the first copies of the above books. The topics of the books in itself suggests that these are researched monographs on the subjects that they have been written on. He said that he was sure that the books are interesting and instructive for the common reader. The President stated that he knows the authors of the books - Shri Sushil Chaudhury and Smt Mahasweta Chaudhury for long and they have been dedicated to academics throughout their professional lives. 

The President said that “Jnan, A-Janan and Bijnan: Popper-er Jnantatta” is an exceptional work in as much as, no such work has yet been done in the Bengali language on the subject. The main thrust of the book is to acquaint people with the concept of knowledge – especially scientific knowledge in the context of Popper’s conception. 

The President said that Shri Sushil Chaudhury’s monograph ‘Samudra Banijjer Prekshite Sthala Banijjya, Bharat Mahasagar Anchal, 1500-1800’ tries to explode some of the myths which prevailed for long in the historical world. The Eurocentric position that the traditional overland trade from India/Bengal through the Middle East and Central Asia to Europe was doomed with the advent of the European Trading Companies in the early 17th Century has been convincingly challenged by authors. Shri Chaudhury has tried to establish this with the help of new qualitative and quantitative evidence.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee presented Dr. Malati Allen Noble Award, Dr. Sarkar Allen Mahatma Hahnemann Award and Dr. Sankar Allen Swamiji Award instituted by the Dr. Malati Allen Charitable Trust to the recipients in various categories in Kolkata, West Bengal today (May 19, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the efforts undertaken by Dr. Malati Allen Charitable Trust and the Dr. Sarkar Allen Mahatama Hahnemann and Swamiji Trust in encouraging and strengthening the education and practice of Homeopathy are praiseworthy.

The President said that as an alternate system of medicine along with the indigenous Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani, Homeopathy has an important role in our country. Apart from the obvious advantages that Homeopathy has because of low cost of treatment, recent trends that establish limitations of the allopathic system of medicine such as side effects, etc, has increasingly made homeopathy and other systems of alternate medicine an attractive and feasible option for many patients. Similarly, the limitations of allopathic medicine in addressing chronic diseases have led to more and more people looking for alternate options.

The President said that Homeopathy has had a long and successful history in India, especially in Bengal. Brought in by a Romanian, Dr. John Martin Honigberger in 1835 to the Court of Maharaja of Patiala, it flourished when he shifted to Calcutta and fast became known as the ‘Cholera Doctor’ for his treatment of the dreaded disease. The names of Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, Babu Rajen Dutta, Dr. P.C. Majumdar, Dr. V.L. Bhaduri and Dr. B.N. Banerjee apart from many others are primary in establishing Homeopathy in India. The first Homeopathy college in India in 1878 was also the Calcutta Homeopathy Medical College. After systematic neglect from the colonial administration, it was Sir Satish Chandra Samanta, MP from West Bengal who first moved to establish the Central Council of Homeopathy in 1948.

The President congratulated all individuals including those from Bangladesh who received the awards and wished them success in all their future endeavours. He also informed the gathering that Rashtrapati Bhavan has also established an AYUSH Clinic pertaining to various traditional systems of medicine and an ever increasing number of people are availing the facilities.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a Bio-Solar-Wind Microgrid Centre and Centre for Water and Environment Research at Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, West Bengal today (May 19, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was happy to inaugurate these initiatives of IIEST. IIEST is a historic institution and amongst the first few higher learning centres to be established in the country. Since its existence, this premier institution has been imparting high quality education in the field of civil and mechanical engineering.

The President said that the facilities inaugurated today - Integrated Bio-Solar-Wind Micro-grid centre and Centre for Water and Environment Research, are crucial from the perspective of socio-economic development. Centres such as these are the need of the hour, with resource sustainability and environmental protection having become pressing global issues.

The President said that in present-day circumstances, energy availability has become uncertain with augmentation in power generation capacity unable to meet the rising demand for power of various consuming centres such as industry, household, etc. A micro-management of power system using renewable energy sources will lead to self-sufficiency in high consuming destinations like institutions and industry. The integrated Bio-Solar-Wind micro-grid centre of IIEST is one cog in the wheel of sustainable development. We must ensure that electricity is available for ordinary people and potable water is provided for consumption of both humans and animals. For this our knowledge and expertise has to be implemented in finding practical solutions to problems in our day to day life. In this context, he appreciated the innovations displayed by large number of grassroot innovators during the annual Festival of Innovations at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

The President said that a large population of this country has no access to any form of electricity. However, we must ensure that we do not harm the environment to meet our energy requirements. India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement and we are committed to have a specific rate of reduction in carbon emission over the years. We must emphasize on renewable energy to ensure sustainable development. We as a nation have to work more intensely towards developing solutions for such important global challenges, which have wide import for a developing country with large population like ours.

The President said that access to water in the 21st Century is a challenge. Potable water is not available to a large population in many villages in India. The demand for safe potable water is increasing rapidly with the exponential growth in population. This problem needs to be addressed.

The President said that in 1961, as a state scholar of the Government of West Bengal Prof. Mukhopadhyay joined as a research scholar at the London School of Economics and began his Ph.D. research on T.H. Green, the 19th century English idealist political philosopher. In 1965, on the basis of his thesis, Prof. Mukhopadhyay was awarded Ph.D. degree by London University. His thesis was published in a book titled ‘The Ethics of Obedience’. Later, he decided to bring out his original thesis contradicting and elaborating some of his earlier arguments. Now, the book has come with a new title ‘Metaphysics, Morals and Politics’. 

The President said that politics without morality is no politics. He stated that tremendous changes have taken place in the 2nd half of the last century because of internet, mobile phones and technological revolution in the field of communication. Many old concepts are rapidly undergoing changes. He said that Green established a bridge between morals and politics. He applauded Prof. Mukhopadhyay for establishing the extreme relevance of Green’s ideas in the modern world.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee yesterday (May 16, 2017) received His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the State of Palestine at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also hosted a banquet in his honour. 

Welcoming the President of Palestine, the President recalled his visit to Palestine in October 2015 and warm hospitality of the Government and people of the State of Palestine. The President congratulated Mr. Mahmoud on his re-election as chairman of Fateh Party. He said in the re-election of Mr. Mahmoud people of Palestine have made it clear that their primary aspiration is for peace and strong leader who will lead them towards their aspirations. 

The President said India attaches great importance to its bilateral relations with Palestine which have gained momentum and expanded in recent years. He expressed hope that this visit will take the two countries cooperation further and diversify their relations for the benefit of both the people. He also expressed happiness over the fact that most of the projects announced during President’s visit to Palestine are taking shape. 

The President said India’s commitment to the Palestinian cause and its friendship with the people of Palestine have become an integral part of its time tested foreign policy. 

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Pranab Mukherjee said India attaches high value to its long standing friendship and close co-operation with Palestine. Over the years, our bilateral relationship has expanded - to encompass many more areas of common interest. India remains firmly committed to assist the Palestinian people in achieving their developmental goals. 

The President said India earnestly hopes for early resumption of talks between Palestine and Israel leading to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine. We wish that the creation of a Palestinian State - that is a full member of the comity of nations, becomes your lasting personal legacy to your people. India has been happy to contribute to Palestine’s nation-building endeavour through technical and financial assistance. 

The President said it is a matter of satisfaction that our Governments have agreed to intensify our mutual co-operation in the fields of security, information and communications technology, agriculture, education, culture, healthcare and sports. The youth exchange programme initiated by our Governments will help in forging a partnership between our future leaders for enhancing the mutual understanding between our peoples. 

The President said this is a time of unprecedented global challenges. The scourge of terrorism is, unfortunately, one of the biggest threats faced by the international community. India believes that there can be no justification, whatsoever for terrorism. Its use as an instrument of state policy is perilous and reprehensible. We believe that closer co-ordination and concerted efforts by the international community are necessary to tackle this menace effectively.

                Your Excellency Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine, 

Distinguished guests, 

Ladies and gentlemen, 

It is with great pleasure that I extend a very warm welcome to you, Mr. President and the distinguished members of your delegation. 

Excellency, I recall, with pleasure, my own visit to your beautiful country in October, 2015. The warmth of the friendly people of Palestine throughout my visit has made a lasting impression on me. I am happy that your State Visit has given me the opportunity of receiving you once again in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Mr. President, 

India attaches high value to her long standing friendship and close co-operation with Palestine. Over the years, our bilateral relationship has expanded - to encompass many more areas of common interest. India remains firmly committed to assist the Palestinian people in achieving their developmental goals. 

Excellency, India has been unwavering in its support for the aspiration of the Palestinian people to have their own country and, themselves, be the masters of their destiny. In 1938, Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of our Nation voiced our country’s rejection of the partition of Palestine and the creation of a state based on religion. 

Later in 1947, India voted against the partition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly. India was the first Non-Arab State to recognize PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974 and one of the first to recognize the State of Palestine in 1988. 

We were delighted when the UNGA voted on November 29, 2012 to upgrade Palestine’s status to “non-member observer state” and in favour of the installation of Palestinian flag at the UN premises along with the flags of other observer states in April, 2015. 

Consistent with these efforts, India has expressed support for the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet Road Map. We have persistently advocated for the implementation of relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and its Security Council. We were happy to have participated in the Middle East Peace Process Conference held in Paris in January, 2017. 

Now, we earnestly hope for early resumption of talks between Palestine and Israel leading to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine. We wish that the creation of a Palestinian State - that is a full member of the comity of nations, becomes your lasting personal legacy to your people. 

Excellency, 

India has been happy to contribute to Palestine’s nation-building endeavour through technical and financial assistance. I am glad to note that most of the projects announced during my State Visit to Palestine are making good progress. I am also happy to learn that the foundation stone has been laid for the US$ 12 million Palestine India Techno Park – which had been announced during my visit. 

Mr. President, both our Governments recognize the indispensability of investing in human resources for building the strong foundation of a modern nation. My Government is pleased to have hosted over 700 Palestinian nationals in training programmes offered under the Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation programme. 

Going forward, it is a matter of satisfaction that our Governments have agreed to intensify our mutual co-operation in the fields of security, information and communications technology, agriculture, education, culture, healthcare and sports. The youth exchange programme initiated by our Governments will help in forging a partnership between our future leaders for enhancing the mutual understanding between our peoples. 

Excellency, this is a time of unprecedented global challenges. The scourge of terrorism is, unfortunately, one of the biggest threats faced by the international community. India believes that there can be no justification, whatsoever for terrorism. Its use as an instrument of state policy is perilous and reprehensible. We believe that closer co-ordination and concerted efforts by the international community are necessary to tackle this menace effectively. 

I am confident that your State Visit will be an occasion for our Governments to review, together, all aspects of our co-operation and decide the next steps that we will take to further enhance it. India looks forward to the outcomes of our joint efforts. 

With these few words, Mr. President, I once again welcome you and wish you a very successful visit to India. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I invite you to join me in raising a toast : 

to the health and well-being of President Abbas; 

to the enduring friendship between India and Palestine and; 

to peace in this region and the continued progress and prosperity of the people of the State of Palestine.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee delivered the 1st Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Memorial Lecture on the topic “History of Parliamentary Democracy in India” today (May 15, 2017) in Jaipur, Rajasthan. He also presented the 1st Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Life Time Achievement Honour in Public Service to Shri Pawan Kumar Chamling, Chief Minister of Sikkim on the occasion. 

Addressing the gathering the President said he was honoured to be invited to deliver the inaugural Memorial Lecture instituted in memory of our former Vice-President Shri Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, an outstanding statesman and a man of the masses. 

The President stated that Shri Shekhawat and he shared a long history of friendship. Both of them served together in the Rajya Sabha in the 1970s. Later, while Shri Shekhawat was Chief Minister of Rajasthan and the President was Vice Chairman of the Planning Commission, he had opportunity to see Shri Shekhawat’s extensive knowledge about problems being faced by citizens of Rajasthan, and his will to eradicate these day to day problems. He was deeply impressed by Shri Shekhawat’s commitment to the downtrodden and poor. 

The President also congratulated Shri Pawan Kumar Chamling, Chief Minister of Sikkim on being conferred the 1st Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Life Time Achievement Honour in Public Service. He said that Shri Chamling has made unique contribution to the State of Sikkim which has emerged as a role model. 

In his Memorial Lecture, the President spoke about the History of Parliamentary Democracy in India. He said that he had outlined the history of representative Government for a specific purpose which was to underline the fact that if prominent legislators of pre-independence days with limited powers, could have done so much, how much more can be done by our MPs, MLAs and MLCs of today. 

The President said that the 3 Ds – Debate, Dissension and Decision are essential in a Parliamentary system of democracy. Democracy should provide for an enabling environment which helps every section of the society to fully participate in the process of governance.

                1. I am honoured to be invited to deliver the inaugural Memorial Lecture instituted in memory of our former Vice-President Shri Bhairon Singh Sekhawat, an outstanding statesman, humble son of the soil and a man of the masses. 

2. Shri Shekhawat and I share a long history of friendship. We served together in the Rajya Sabha in the 1970s. Later, while he was Chief Minister of Rajasthan, I was Vice Chairman of the Planning Commission, I had opportunity to see his extensive knowledge about problems being faced by citizens of Rajasthan, and his will to eradicate these day to day problems. I was deeply impressed by his commitment to the downtrodden and poor. 

3. During his illustrious public life spanning over five decades, he held several important offices. He was a member of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly for over a period of forty five years beginning 1952 and also a member of the Rajya Sabha for about three years. He served as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan for three terms and also held the office of the Leader of the Opposition of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly. He was elected to the august office of the Vice-President of the country in August 2002 and served till July 2007. As ex-officio Chairman, Rajya Sabha he conducted the proceedings of the Upper House with great distinction and added grace and elegance to the office. Besides holding these high offices, Shri Shekhawatji was associated with several welfare projects which touched the lives of ordinary citizens. Today, his rich legacy remains with us and he is fondly remembered as a sagacious statesman, a distinguished legislator and a committed votary of humanitarian values. 

4. Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I have chosen the topic of “History of Parliamentary Democracy in India” for today’s lecture. 

5. Our modern Parliamentary system of governance and legislative institutions owe their origin and growth to our British legacy. Yet, these institutions attained organic growth on the Indian soil because India was home to republican forms of government, deliberative representative bodies and self-governing institutions in many parts of country from as early as the Vedic age, circa 3000-1000 B.C. The rulers of ancient India were bound by Dharma, which was akin to the rule of law, constitutionalism or limited government. The Rigveda and the Atharvaveda make mention of Sabha (General Assembly) and Samiti (House of Elders). Besides, the Aitareya Brahmana, Panini's Ashtadhyayi, Kautilya's Arthashastra, the Mahabharata, Ashokan pillar inscriptions, Buddhist and Jain texts, among many others, bear witness to the existence of several republics during the post-vedic period in our history. 

6. Representative bodies at the village level like the Gram Sanghas, Gram Sabhas or Panchayats continued to function and flourish through many dynasties, including the medieval and Mughal periods till the advent of the British rule.

7. The origins of the modern day legislative process can be traced back to the 1601 Charter which authorized the Governor and the East India Company “to make, ordain and constitute such and so many laws, constitutions, orders and ordinances”, as shall seem necessary and convenient for good government. The Charter of 1726 vested, for the first time, the Governors and the Councils of the three Presidencies with legislative power. 

8. The Regulating Act of 1773 holds a special significance in the legislative history of India because it marks the beginning of parliamentary control over the government of the Company. This Act is also said to have started the process of territorial integration and administrative centralization in India. It accorded supremacy to the Presidency of Bengal and the Governor of Bengal was appointed as the Governor-General. A Council consisting of four members was constituted to assist the Governor-General. 

9. The Charter Act of 1833 terminated the trading rights of the Company and rendered it merely an administrative agency of the Crown in India. The Governor-General of Bengal was, thereafter, designated as the Governor General of India and empowered to administer the whole of British India. For the first time, the Governor General’s Government was known as the Government of India and his Council as the Indian Council. This Act set up one legislative council for all the British territories in India and introduced an element of institutional specialization by differentiating the law-making meetings of the Council from its executive meetings. Legislative functions of the state was thus for the first time separated from its executive functions. 

10. In 1852, the British Indian Association of Kolkata petitioned the British Parliament for establishment of a legislature in India possessing a popular character reflecting the growing political consciousness of the period. It was perhaps for the first time that Indian opinion was being expressed on the subject of legislative reforms. 

11. Under the Charter Act of 1853, discussions in the Council, when acting in its legislative capacity, became oral instead of in writing. Bills passed through the usual three stages and were referred to Select Committees. Legislative business was conducted in public instead of in secret and reports of proceedings were officially published. Standing orders were adopted to conduct and regulate proceedings. The new Council conceived its duties not to be confined only to legislation but also began to assume the character of a miniature representative assembly, assembled for the purpose of enquiry into and redress of grievances. 

12. The Act of 1853 gave the legislature for the first time the right to frame its own rules and procedure. Shri Prasanna Kumar Tagore was appointed to the post of Clerk of the Council and he went on to provide the Council with a parliamentary form of procedure and encouraged it to assert its independence as a separate organ of government. Public were allowed to witness the proceedings of the Council and press reporting was permitted in 1856. Despite the progressive establishment of legislative practices and procedures, there was, however, no Indian participation in the Council. 

13. The Government of India Act 1858, initiated for the first time non-official participation in the Council. The Governor-General was authorized to nominate to his council ‘not less than six nor more than twelve’ additional members at least one half of whom were to be non-officials. In 1862, Viceroy Lord Canning appointed three Indians- Maharaja Sir Narendra Singh of Patiala, Raja Deo Narain Singh of Benares and Raja Sir Dinkar Rao Raghunath of Gwalior to the newly constituted Legislative Council. Between 1862 and 1892, forty-five Indians were nominated to the Legislative Council. Most of them were ruling princes or chiefs and rich zamindar families. During the Viceroyalty of Lord Rippon, Durga Charan Law, a merchant, Raja Shiva Prasad, an Inspector of Schools and Syed Ameer Ali, a Presidency Magistrate were nominated. Editor of the Hindoo Patriot, Kristodas Pal recommended by the British Indian Association and after his death Peare Mohan Mukherjee were also nominated to the Council by Lord Rippon. Intellectuals such as Syed Ahmed Khan, V.N. Mandlik, K.L. Nulkar and Rash Behari Ghosh were among those nominated to the Council during 1872-92. 

14. The nominated Indian members however took little interest in the discussions and usually read out short prepared speeches. They remained docile and presented little opposition to the Government. There remained at the same time strong opposition to Indian involvement in the Councils on the part of many Englishmen. A satirical pamphlet in 1883 argued “any encouragement to the Bengalee Baboos would result in nothing less than complete extinction of British rule, that a self governing India would prove an abortive parliamentary democracy which would run into chaos and subjected to military dictatorship”. 

15. Introduction of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill (1883-84) or Ilbert bill led to the first meeting of the first National Conference at Kolkata on 29 December 1883. Surendranath Banerjee and Ananda Mohan Bose were its leading organizers. Bose depicted this conference as the first stage towards the formation of a National Indian Parliament. The Conference demanded introduction of representative assemblies for the advancement of the people of India. The National Conference was in many ways the precursor of the Indian National Congress. 

16. The founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 hastened the evolution of responsible Government. At its very first session, the Congress passed a resolution asking for constitutional reforms and for the admission of a considerable proportion of elected members to the Legislative Councils and the right to discuss the budget. Delivering his Presidential Address at the first session in Kolkata, W.C. Banerjee described the Congress as the National Assembly of India. 

17. The demand for reform and expansion of the Legislative Councils continued to be made by every annual Congress and became more vociferous from year to year. The Congress considered the reform of the Councils at the root of all other reforms. At the same time, Viceroy Lord Dufferin publicly dismissed Congressmen as “a microscopic minority” and said democratic methods of government or the adoption of parliamentary system to India would be a very big jump into the unknown. 

18. In response, speaking on the resolution on the reform of Legislative Councils at the fifth Congress Session at Bombay (1889), Bannerjea said “If you get that, you get everything else. On it depends the entire future of the country and the future of our administrative system”. 

19. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 enlarged the Legislative Council to consist of ‘not less than ten nor more than sixteen’ additional members. In the case of the Governor-General’s Legislative Council, or the Indian Legislative Council as it came to be known, five more ‘additional’ members were brought in, one being nominated by the non-official members of each of the four Provincial Councils and one by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. Though the term ‘election’ was scrupulously avoided, the fact that non-official members of the Provincial Councils recommended and returned their nominees to the Central Council, indicated implicit acceptance of the principle of indirect election. 

20. The system of preparing an annual budget and laying it before the Legislature was first introduced in India in 1860 by James Wilson who was a Member of the British Parliament, sent to India as Finance Member of the Viceroy’s Council. The first budget was presented on 18 February, 1860. While discussion on the budget as such was not allowed, this was sometimes sought to be made possible by linking the budget with some proposal for taxation. During 1861-62, there were 16 occasions when budget was discussed in that manner. The Council had no right to vote on the Budget. 

21. The Act of 1892 conceded to both the Central and Provincial Councils the privilege of financial criticism or the right to discuss the budget under certain conditions for the first time. Members of the Council however still had no powers to submit or propose any resolution or to divide the Council in respect of any financial discussion. 

22. Under the Act of 1892, Members were for the first time granted the privilege of asking questions and interrogating Government Members. The first question was asked on 16 February 1893. The questioner was the Maharaja of Bhinga and the question concerned hardships caused by the system of collecting supplies of provision for government officers on tour. During the two years – 1905 and 1906 – only 13 questions were asked and the subjects were Services, Railways, Revenue and Exchange. Sometimes information could be denied on the ground that an answer would involve lengthy preparation by officials. 

23. The entry of elected members marked the beginning of the new era in the life of the Council. Congress veteran Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, the first elected Indian Member was frank, bold and vigorous in his criticism of government policies. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta was known as ‘Lion of Bombay’ for his contributions to the city and at the same time, ‘Ferocious Mehta’ because of his role as a Legislator. In order to stem the growth of the nationalist movement in India, Lord Lytton decided to censor the vernacular press. Pherozeshah Mehta vehemently opposed the move. He believed that the press should be as free as possible, and that it was the fundamental duty of the government to educate the masses. “England must raise India to her own level, or India will drag her down to hers,” he warned. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta’s career was summarized by a leading British journalist who said that Mehta ""had stood alone against the bureaucracy, had displayed a courage equal to Gokhale's, an eloquence hardly second to Surendranath Banerjea's, and power of sarcasm hardly rivaled by Motilal Ghose’s"". 

24. During 1890-1909, besides Sir Mehta, the Council had great stalwarts like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ashutosh Mukherjee, Rash Bihari Ghose, G.M. Chitnavis, P. Ananda Charlu, Bishambarnath, Muhammad Rahimtullah Sayani and Salimulla who made full use of limited opportunities for ventilating the grievances of the people on political, economic and social issues. Gokhale whom some people had started calling ‘The Leader of the Opposition’ was a great authority on economics. He exposed the Government’s contention that budget surpluses showed the health of the economy and showed with facts and figures the extent of dismal and deepening poverty in India resulting from heavy expenditure on the Army, policy of heavy taxation, imposition of excise duties on indigenous industries like textiles, lack of irrigation facilities for farmers etc. 

25. The shortcomings of the Act of 1892 were obvious. There remained an official majority in the Councils. The Government could always pass Bills disregarding opposition by Indian members. The vehement criticism by Indian members proved ineffective in preventing the Government from following a policy of repression, large scale imprisonments, deportations etc. following the agitation against the partition of Bengal, natural calamities like the Great Famine and Plague epidemic etc. which in the 1880s resulted in the death of a large number of people. 

26. At its 22nd session at Kolkata presided over by Dadabhai Naroji in 1906, the Congress declared Swaraj as its goal and demanded immediate expansion of the Legislative Councils to secure larger control over the financial and executive administration of the country. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 empowered the Governor General to nominate one Indian member to the Executive Council leading to the appointment of Shri Satyendra Prasanno Sinha as the first Indian member. 

27. The Government of India Act 1909 increased the number of members of the Indian Legislative Council from 16 to 60. Elected members were to be returned by constituencies, such as municipalities, district and local boards, universities, chambers of commerce and trade associations and groups of persons such as land-holders or tea planters. 

28. The Act of 1909 created non-official majority in all the Provincial Legislative Councils, but maintained official majority in the Central Legislative Council. The constituencies were small, the largest of them comprising only 650 persons. Out of 27 elected members in the Central Council, only 9 were supposed to represent the people of India as a whole. It is this Act which regrettably introduced for the first time the principle of communal representation in India and created separate electorates. 

29. The 1909 Act also for the first time gave members of the Council power to move resolutions on any matter of general public interest and to divide the Council upon them. This was the beginning of non-official resolutions. The first resolution under the rules was moved on 25 February 1910 by Gopal Krishna Gokhale recommending prohibition of indentured labour for Natal in South Africa. On the Rowlatt Bill, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya spoke for two and a half hours. Similarly, on Indemnity Bill he spoke for four hours continuously and in all, he spent six and a half hours speaking on the Bill. It was very rare that non-official members could have their way. Still, they made their presence felt by moving amendments, resolutions and asking questions. 

30. The Rules of the Council framed in 1909 also enlarged the scope of discussion on the Budget. The Budget was considered in two stages. The presentation of a preliminary budget called the financial statement was followed by a general discussion. Some items of expenditure such as that of the Army were however treated as non votable. 

31. The right to put questions for seeking information from the government was provided in 1892 but right to ask supplementary questions was not conceded until 1909. Though non-official members were in no position to defeat government measures in the Council, they took question procedure very seriously. While in 1911 only 151 questions were put and answered, the number rose to 397 by the year 1919. 

32. Two Bills, the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Bill and the Indian Criminal Law Emergency Powers Bill, commonly called the Rowlatt Bills were introduced in the Council in February 1919 with a view to give extensive powers to the government to put down revolutionary nationalist movements. These were met with bitter and prolonged opposition both inside and outside the Legislature. Debate went on for eight hours extending over two days in which as many as 20 non official members took part. The Indian members opposed the Bill not only at the introduction stage but at every stage. 

33. During the course of the passage of the Bill, the Council was divided 16 times. On all occasions, Indian members voted solidly together. Some members such as Malaviya and Sukul resigned their membership of the Council in protest. 

34. The Government of India Act 1919 introduced the system of ‘dyarchy’ in eight major Provinces known as Governors Provinces. This system established a dual form of government in each province. Control of some areas of government called the “transferred list”, were given to a Government of Indian ministers answerable to the Provincial Council. At the same time, all other areas of government (the ‘reserved list’) remained under the control of the Viceroy. The ‘reserved list’ included Defence, the Foreign Affairs and Communications. The ‘transferred list’ included agriculture, supervision of local government, Health and Education. 

35. Under the 1919 Act, the Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged and a bicameral legislature introduced. The lower house was the Legislative Assembly of 144 members, of which 104 were elected and 40 were nominated with tenure of three years. The upper house was the Council of States consisting of 34 elected and 26 nominated members and tenure of five years. The 1919 Act also provided for classification of subjects of administration as Central and Provincial and for the devolution of authority in respect of provincial subjects to local governments; and for the allocation of revenues and other moneys to those governments. 

36. I have mentioned earlier the role and contribution of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, Shri Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. This address will be incomplete without a special mention of ‘Swarajists’ like S. Satyamurti, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Pandit Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, Srinivasa Sastry etc. These leaders disagreed with the Congress policy of non-cooperation with the Government on the matter of entry into the Council. They believed that work within the legislatures could be an equally effective instrument for furthering the nationalist cause. It could highlight the deficiencies of alien rule and at the same time, demonstrate to the British our ability to master the nuances of the parliamentary system. 

37. S. Satyamurti, a lawyer and outstanding orator, entered the Madras Legislative Council in 1923 and his fame as a legislator spread all over the country. He excelled himself in the question hour and became a master of the art of interpellation. He was known as the ‘terror of the question hour’. His brilliant and effective speeches earned him the name “Trumpet Voice”. When the time came for elections to the Madras Legislative Council, Gandhiji declared that it was enough if one Satyamurti was sent to the Legislatures. Shri Satyamurti was member of the Central Legislative Assembly from 1935 to 1939 where his success as a legislator led Gandhiji to remark that if there had been ten Satyamurtis in our legislatures, the British would have quit long ago. 

38. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru broke openly with the Congress after the ascent of Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated non-violent civil disobedience against British rule. Sir Sapru was opposed by those who considered the legislatures to be unrepresentative ""rubber stamps"" for the Viceroy. However, many Congress politicians respected Sir Sapru as an eminent jurist. His ties with the British made him valuable as a mediator and Sir Sapru mediated between Gandhi and the Viceroy Lord Irwin, helping to forge the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Sir Sapru also mediated between Gandhi, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and the British over the issue of separate electorates which was settled by the Poona Pact. Sir Sapru was chosen as the representative of Indian Liberals at the Round Table Conferences of 1931-1933. His last prominent role was as one of the main lawyers engaged to defend captured soldiers of the Indian National Army. 

39. Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das as leader of the Swarajya Party in Bengal Council assisted by H.S. Suhrawardy, Kiran Sankar Roy, Tulsi Goswami etc. shook the foundation of the British rule with his oratory and parliamentary skill. At the same time, Pandit Motilal Nehru as leader of the Swarajya Party in Central Council laid the basic foundation of constitutional government in India. Both Motilal and Chittaranjan were able to keep the Muslims with the Swarajya Party to project a united India. 

40. The 1919 Act was followed by the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935 which introduced federal features and provincial autonomy in the system and also made provisions for the distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the provinces. The Government of India Act, 1935 which, among others, envisaged a 'federation of all-India', consisting of the British provinces and the Indian states willing to join it. Till the Round Table Conference of 1930, India was a completely unitary state and whatever powers the Provinces had were given to them by the Centre. That is, the Provinces were only agents of the Centre. The 1935 Act for the first time provided for a federal system which would consist of not only the Governors' Provinces of British India but also the Chief Commissioners' provinces and the princely states. It finally sought to break up the unitary system under which British India had hitherto been administered. The principle of the constitution of 1919 had been decentralization rather than federation. Under the new Act the Provinces were for the first time recognized in law as separate entities, exercising executive and legislative powers in their own field, in their own right, free in normal circumstances from Central control, in that field. However, even after the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, the constitution of the Central Government in India, by and large, remained what it was under the Act of 1919. The federal part of the 1935 Act never came into operation. 

41. The Constituent Assembly, the first representative body of the people of India, commenced its momentous task on 9 December 1946. The members of the Constituent Assembly were chosen through indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 enacted by the British Parliament declared the Constituent Assembly to be a fully sovereign body and the Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States ceased to exist from 14 August 1947. With the dawn of our Independence on the midnight of 14-15 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly assumed full powers and took over as the Legislative Assembly of Independent India. The two functions of the Constituent Assembly, that is Constitution-making and Legislation, were clearly separated and the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) commenced functioning from 17 November 1947. 

42. The Constituent Assembly, with Dr. Rajendra Prasad as its President and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, held intensive deliberations in the Central Hall of Parliament House for a long period of 2 years, 11 months and 17 days spread over eleven Sessions and gave an outstanding parchment, an ideal for a resurgent India. Thereafter, the Constitution was adopted by We, the People of India, on 26 November 1949 and the members of the Constituent Assembly appended their signatures to it on 24 January 1950. The Constitution which came into force on 26 January 1950 had 395 Articles and 8 Schedules and the distinction of being the lengthiest Constitution in the world. Immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India and functioned as such until the first General Elections based on adult franchise were held in 1952. Ever since, the nation has been guided by the ennobling ideals laid down in the Constitution which has turned out to be one of the finest republican Constitutions. 

43. Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I have expounded in such great detail the history of representative Government for a specific purpose. It is to underline the fact that if prominent legislators of pre-independence days with limited powers, could have done so much, how much more can be done by our MPs, MLAs and MLCs of today. 

44. Our modern day legislators must recognize that the Constitution of India places our Parliament and Assemblies at the centre of governance and conceives them as the primary instrument of good governance and socio-economic change. The job of a legislator is a 24x7 responsibility. Legislators must at all times be sensitive and responsive to the problems and concerns of the people. They must give voice to the grievances of the public by raising them on the floor of the Legislature and act as the link between the people and the Government. 

45. Legislation is the first and foremost responsibility of a Parliamentarian. It is most unfortunate that time devoted towards legislation has been gradually declining in our Parliament. To illustrate, the first Lok Sabha from 1952-57 had 677 sittings in which 319 bills were passed. In comparison, the fourteenth Lok Sabha from 2004-2009 had 332 sittings and passed just 247 bills. The fifteenth Lok Sabha had 357 sittings and passed 181 bills while the sixteenth Lok Sabha has had 197 sittings and passed only 111 bills (upto the 10th session). 

46. Figures are available for the time lost due to interruptions/adjournments from the Tenth Lok Sabha (1991-96) onwards. 9.95% of total time was lost due to interruptions in the Tenth Lok Sabha, 5.28% in the Eleventh Lok Sabha, 11.93% in the Twelfth Lok Sabha, 18.95% in the Thirteenth Lok Sabha, 19.58% in the Fourteenth Lok Sabha, a shocking 41.6% in the Fifteenth Lok Sabha and about 16% in the Sixteenth Lok Sabha (upto the 10th session). 

47. Presiding Officers Conferences have time and again reiterated the need for holding a minimum of 100 days of sittings every year. With the heightened complexity of administration, legislation must be preceded by adequate discussion and scrutiny, if not, it will fail to deliver the desired results or meet its objectives. There is need for collective thinking by political parties and leaders of our country on how to ensure smooth running of our Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. 

48. At independence, India was faced with apparently insurmountable challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, ethnic and linguistic diversity, diverse castes and classes and the rural base of the economy all of which militated against India’s democratic transition. The odds were stacked high against its political consolidation as civil strife on grounds of religious identity tore society apart at Partition. But, our critics have been proved completely wrong. 

49. Today, India has a vigorously free press, a robust system of political parties, an independent and active judiciary, an apolitical military and a thriving civil society. Its democracy has an array of institutions such as an effective Election Commission, an autonomous Union Public Service Commission, a proactive watchdog of public accounts in the Comptroller and Auditor General, an independent National Human Rights Commission, to name but a few. The institutional efficacy of these democratic institutions is beyond doubt. 

50. India’s democratic transition was a courageous leap for a country that was emerging from colonial rule. It was an audacious decision of India’s leaders to adopt a constitution that enshrines liberal democracy as the guiding principle for its polity in one masterly stroke, while democracy evolved in a gradual manner over a long period in the older democratic states in the West. India’s democratic transition and consolidation owes much to the dominant legacy of the national freedom movement. Men and women, in millions, rose to the nationalist call and took active part in the mass movement. India has not only sustained its democracy but is today the world’s largest democracy and a thriving one. 

51. India’s parliamentary democracy is safeguarded by the zeal of the Indian people for democracy. Our people have through their overwhelming and enthusiastic participation in 16 General Elections given the seal of approval for our political system. In the last general elections in 2014, nearly 66.3 percent of the 84.3 crore plus electors voted to choose 543 representatives to the Lok Sabha. 

52. India’s institutions of democratic governance are hailed across the developing world as a model political system, just as India’s hugely multi-cultural society is seen as a beacon light for those transitional societies, which are struggling to cope with complexities of race, religion, language and culture. Today, the developing world looks up to India with admiration and rightly so, as India successfully treads the difficult path of democratic governance with a billion-plus people. 

53. Despite the successful working of our parliamentary democracy, many people still live under conditions of poverty, deprivation and illiteracy. A substantial section of our society still remains untouched by the lofty ideals and objectives of our governance. It is only when we succeed in making a positive impact upon the lives of those sections of people, can we claim that the democratic system of governance we adopted has become relevant for all our people. 

54. The challenge before us is to realize the guiding principle of Indian democracy as envisioned by our Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, namely, “It is one where the weakest should have the same opportunity as the strongest.” Democracy should provide for an enabling environment which helps every section of the society to fully participate in the process of governance. 

55. In conclusion, I congratulate the organisers for putting together this event. I request the State Government of Rajasthan Government to do its best to carry forward the life, beliefs, memories and legacy of Shri Shekhawat. 

Thank you, Jai Hind.

Relations between our two countries have been cordial and constructive. I am confident that our close ties will be further intensified and diversified in the coming years. The early expansion of India-MERCOSUR PTA Trade Agreement will open up new opportunities in trade and investments relations – to the benefit of our two peoples. 

I avail this opportunity to extend my best wishes for your good health and well-being as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Paraguay”.

1.        It is indeed a great pleasure for me to be amidst you on the occasion of presentation of the National Florence Nightingale Awards for 2017. It is a fitting tribute to the iconic ‘Lady with the Lamp’.

2.        I congratulate all the award winners and extend my best wishes to the entire nursing community of our country.

Ladies and gentlemen,

3.        Nurses in India are at the forefront of our national healthcare system. Their contribution is central to its success.  In a developing economy such as ours, nurses and midwives are crucial in delivering cost-effective and, at the same time, good quality healthcare. Our nation is proud of their services.

4.        I welcome the guiding theme selected by the International Council of Nurses this year: ""Nurses: A Voice to Lead, Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals”. No doubt this is the most appropriate theme in the current situation. 

 

5.        The need to adapt our standards to the evolving demands of healthcare and update our capacities is self-evident. Our country needs to respond swiftly to healthcare challenges that keep coming up. I am glad to see that the National Health Policy, 2017 envisages a new momentum in innovation and nursing. As Indian nurses take on greater local, national and international roles, we need to ensure appropriate professional development and human resource policies in our country – and increased involvement of nurses in policy development. The complexity of medical and healthcare practices today demands that nurses are fully involved in the planning, implementation, research and evaluation that goes into the successful delivery of patient care. These functions come with responsibilities and accountability. The legal and policy framework of nursing protocols and standards of practice must facilitate optimal utilization of competencies.

6.        Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, thanks to the improving quality of nursing services, significant gains have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing child and maternal mortality in both urban as well as rural India.

7.        It is, nevertheless necessary to be conscious that while most countries have a shortage of nurses, the situation continues to be quite acute in India, primarily due to the migration of the large number of nurses we produce from our institutions. India’s low nurse to population ratio reminds us that much more capacity needs to be built with closer co-between States and the Central Government. I am glad that Government of India is addressing these concerns to strengthen the nursing sector in our country and that there has been a positive rate of growth in our training capacity over the past decade.

8.        I call upon nurse educators to inculcate – if not surpass - the world’s best, professional, nursing and midwifery educational standards. This endeavour will raise the quality of nursing education in India and also create paths for professional advancement in line with national, regional and global health needs.

9.        As we recognize and honour the meritorious nursing professionals of India, I wish you all success. The nation is grateful for your services and compassionate selfless care. I am confident that the Florence Nightingale Awardees-2017 will inspire the entire nursing fraternity to rededicate themselves to quality healthcare. I take this opportunity to also extend my best wishes to the Hon'ble Union Health Minister, Ministers of State for Health and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the success of their efforts towards improvement of healthcare services in the country.

JAI HIND!

	I am indeed very happy to be present amidst you this afternoon for the nineteenth National Technology Day function being organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology. When we celebrate Technology Day, it is not only to commemorate the spectacular technological achievements of our nation. It is also to encourage the upcoming innovators and entrepreneurs, whose efforts are helping in percolating the benefits of science and technology to the society at large and the common man in particular.
	Scientific and technological developments are a key to any nation’s success. India is one of the top-ranking countries in the field of basic research. Indian science has progressed to become one of the most powerful instruments of knowledge. Yet in the wake of new demands of economic growth, it is necessary to embark on translating science and technology into developmental needs in all sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, health, communication and education. 
	I am proud to state that our nation has been making rapid strides. Last year, we witnessed a number of remarkable achievements in the field of science and technology. It was a proud moment for every Indian when ISRO’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle successfully launched 104 satellites into the orbit, marking the thirty-eighth consecutive successful mission of PSLV. India’s first Light Combat Aircraft Tejas was inducted into the Indian Air Force, marking the culmination of many years of painstaking research and hard work. Successful test firings of Medium and Long Range Surface to Air Missiles, which have been developed by DRDO in collaboration with Israel, were conducted. Maiden test flight of the Rustom-II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was also successfully carried out by DRDO. 


Ladies and gentlemen:


	While we applaud these significant achievements, we must also contemplate on whether the technological developments have been limited to only a few sectors. Our pursuits in science and technology have to be more inclusive and encompassing, improving the lives of our vast population. In building such a scenario, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) plays a pivotal role. It promotes new areas of scientific development and supports the entire eco-system, from seeding and capacity building in cutting-edge research to translational research. DST works deep in technology development and deployment; innovations and start-ups; and international collaborations. This, they do so, by supporting infrastructure, scientists and students in academic and R&D institutions across the country. DST has established strategically important systems and mechanisms to foster excellence and leadership in scientific R&D, aligned with India’s developmental aspirations. 
	It is heartening to know that DST’s initiatives like “National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovation”, called NIDHI, is aimed at building an innovation-driven entrepreneurial eco-system for wealth and job creation. The INSPIRE programme, or “Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research”, tap students early in life and nurture them to take up science and pursue careers in research. “Scholarship for Higher Education”, or SHE, encourage students to undertake higher studies in science-intensive programmes by providing scholarships and mentoring through summer attachment. “Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing” called KIRAN empower women scientists who had a break in their career. I compliment DST for its efforts towards encouraging S&T as a mission and career in the country. 
	Technology Development Board, which is the commercial wing of DST, is playing a stellar role in the development and commercialization of indigenous and imported technologies. In its twenty years of existence, the Board has vigorously pursued its mandate of providing financial assistance to Indian companies. In that respect, its role is aligned to the “Make in India” initiative of the government. Some projects of TDB have had a global impact especially in the pharmaceuticals and vaccines domain. Due to its efforts, India has emerged as a global supplier of childhood vaccines to UNICEF and World Health Organization.


Ladies and gentlemen:


	Disparity between haves and have-nots, urban and rural areas, and exclusion or marginalization of certain groups can give rise to social unrest. It is crucial that more technological innovations are geared towards eliminating these disparities and differences. In our endeavor for global excellence, not even a single citizen should be left behind. ‘Technology for sustainable and inclusive growth’ is the need of the hour. And it is where you all – innovators, technocrats, entrepreneurs and policymakers – have an important role to play. You have to ensure that science and technology does not remain confined to a select few sectors only. Progress and growth of the country will be sustainable only if development for all is the overarching goal. For that, we have to ensure that all strata of the society enjoy the benefits of technological innovation and scientific advancements equally. 
	India is a land of rich diversity, with outstanding talent hidden away even in the remotest areas and minutest villages. Such potential needs to be discovered and nurtured. Our nation has been making steady progress towards increasing connectivity between far-flung regions and integrating people from all walks of life. It is essential that we continue to move forward in this direction and use technology to create stable employment opportunities, encourage entrepreneurship, and build growth models that allow for inclusion of women and the disadvantaged. This will lead to the empowerment of citizens, which is the hallmark of a strong nation.


Ladies and gentlemen:


	The challenges facing us are many. Ground-breaking innovations are required in key sectors like energy, education, healthcare and agriculture. Technological initiatives in these fields will have wide implications. I, therefore, urge the prominent gathering present here to give singular emphasis on these areas. On this occasion, I also take the opportunity of congratulating our agricultural scientists who have contributed to increasing foodgrain production in India to record levels.   
	I must, however, add that radical innovations, which are long-term drivers of growth, must not come at the cost of our environment. With rapid industrialization and the consequent mechanization of different sectors, keeping carbon emissions in check has become imperative. In our quest for technical supremacy, we must always remember that a country’s progress, in the true sense, hinges upon striking a balance between fulfillment of economic needs and protection of the natural environment. The rising concerns about global climate change must spur us on to find novel technological solutions to achieve this objective. 
	Devising strategies for inclusive and sustainable development will require collaborative efforts among the public and private sectors. Strong political will and commitment, backed by firm and effective policies; investment in infrastructure and education; and focus on adoption of eco-friendly technologies will enable us to promote inclusive growth without compromising on sustainability.
	I encourage the innovators, policymakers, and technological spearheads gathered here today to join hands and take our nation to the upper echelons of development. Make India a force to reckon with in the world. I wish each one of you present here the very best for the future.


Thank you.

Jai Hind.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee attended the National Technology Day Celebrations today (May 11, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that scientific and technological developments are a key to any nation’s success. India is one of the top-ranking countries in the field of basic research. Indian science has progressed to become one of the most powerful instruments of knowledge. Yet in the wake of new demands of economic growth, it is necessary to embark on translating science and technology into developmental needs in all sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, health, communication and education.

The President said that disparity between haves and have-nots, urban and rural areas, and exclusion or marginalization of certain groups can give rise to social unrest. It is crucial that more technological innovations are geared towards eliminating these disparities and differences. In our endeavor for global excellence, not even a single citizen should be left behind. ‘Technology for sustainable and inclusive growth’ is the need of the hour. And it is where all - innovators, technocrats, entrepreneurs and policymakers - have an important role to play. They have to ensure that science and technology does not remain confined to a select few sectors only. Progress and growth of the country will be sustainable only if development for all is the overarching goal. For that, we have to ensure that all strata of the society enjoy the benefits of technological innovation and scientific advancements equally.

The President said that India is a land of rich diversity, with outstanding talent hidden away even in the remotest areas and minutest villages. Such potential needs to be discovered and nurtured. Our nation has been making steady progress towards increasing connectivity between far-flung regions and integrating people from all walks of life. It is essential that we continue to move forward in this direction and use technology to create stable employment opportunities, encourage entrepreneurship, and build growth models that allow for inclusion of women and the disadvantaged. This will lead to the empowerment of citizens, which is the hallmark of a strong nation.

“On the joyous occasion of Buddha Purnima, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to all the citizens of the country.

Lord Buddha is a resplendent symbol of lofty idealism and concern for humanity. The messages preached by Tathagatha, of compassion, non-violence and equality serve as beacon-lights for humanity in its path towards spiritual emancipation. Lord Buddha’s profound teachings of equality, love, kindness and tolerance are of increasing relevance in the present times.

May the message of Lord Buddha inspire us to follow the path of truth and compassion and work unitedly for the peace, progress and prosperity of our nation”.

The SMARTGRAM initiative of Rashtrapati Bhavan was inaugurated for five villages of Haryana i.e. Tajnagar, Dhaula, Alipur, Harchandpur and Rojka Meo by the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee on July 2, 2016. On May 1, 2017, it was approved that the initiative be extended to 100 villages in the vicinity of the initially selected five village of Haryana. A meeting with people’s representative from 100 villages now included under the SMARTGRAM initiative and selected stakeholders on expansion of SMARTGRAM initiative was taken by the Secretary to the President, Smt. Omita Paul today (May 8, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The aim of the meeting was to sensitize them on the initiative and discuss plans for implementation of various programmes in these villages. 

A large number of projects have been undertaken in the initially selected five villages of Haryana under the SMARTGRAM initiative in the fields of agriculture, skill development, energy, education, heath, employment generation, developing entrepreneurship etc. These initiatives have generated a lot of enthusiasm in the nearby areas. Therefore, this initiative was extended to 95 more villages in the vicinity of the earlier selected five villages taking the total number of villages under the SMARTGRAM initiative to 100.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee in his message on the eve of birthday of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, which falls on May 9, 2016, has said: -


“On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, I pay humble tribute to this great creative genius, who authored India’s national anthem and won for Asia its first Nobel Prize in literature. 
   
An intellectual giant, he was fascinated by the idea of interaction between civilizations through the exchange of knowledge about their cultures and literatures.  He was the perfect ambassador of our country at a time when little was known about India in the outside world.

Gurudev Tagore set forth a vision of peace and fraternity that continues to have relevance and global appeal. In a world fettered by race, creed and colour, Gurudev Tagore promoted internationalism for a new world order based on diversity, open-mindedness, tolerance and co-existence.

Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a great soul, who not only illumined the time he lived in, but continues to remain an inspiration for humanity. Let us use this occasion to draw inspiration from Tagore’s idea of oneness of humanity.”

In a message to her husband, Shri Prem Nath Seth, the President has said, “I am sad to learn about the passing away of Smt. Justice Leila Seth, who was the first woman Judge of Delhi High Court and first woman Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court. 

Justice Leila Seth was an eminent jurist and made immense contribution to the development of jurisprudence. She will remain an inspiration for all members of legal fraternity, especially women. 

Kindly accept my heartfelt condolences and convey the same to other members of your family. I pray to the Almighty to give you and your family the strength and courage to bear this irreparable loss”.

The participants of the 8th Annual Heads of Missions Conference called on President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee today (May 6, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said the world is tiring of statements and resolutions. Our efforts should be to work with like-minded nations and global institutions to swiftly generate effective solutions and implement them efficiently. Every well conceived effort will have some positive outcome. 

The President said there is a new World Order. All of humankind is, today, challenged by compelling transnational issues that need to be urgently addressed collectively and innovatively. Whether it is drug-resistant viruses, environmental degradation, pollution and climate change - or energy , water and food security, no single nation can claim to be free of deep concerns on account of these issues. 

The President said the dynamics of the new world order must be well analyzed and understood. As Heads of Missions, they shall have to ensure that India, as a respected and responsible player in world affairs and an emerging economic power, responds to the new challenges appropriately - to its best advantage, safeguarding its core interests at all times. He stressed that this is a moment for strategic policy making, leadership, and pursuit of an independent foreign policy - based on principle, pragmatism and the time-honored philosophy of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. 

The President said the reforms and recent initiatives of Government of India have made our economy attractive for investors and our industrial sector viable for prospective partners. The renewed emphasis of our Government on outcomes rather than processes is also a welcome step. Today, technology has revolutionized the way we share knowledge, do business, consult and even the way we do our diplomatic work. In some countries, it is being used to create vast capacities for eavesdropping and cyber warfare.

It is a pleasure to meet you on the occasion of your annual conference.

 

1.             At the outset, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of External Affairs, for once again hosting this Conference. It is always a very useful exercise for a Ministry to take stock, make frank assessments and enunciate policy guidelines for implementation in the ensuing period.  The theme, “Smarter Diplomacy, Swifter Delivery” appropriately reflects the need of the hour.  I am glad that you have had the opportunity to work on it as a group - and define the manner in which you will make this phrase your motto and also your goal.

 

2.             I understand that you have already had three days of stimulating sessions - in which you have reviewed the full range of your responsibilities. Each of you functions in a distinct local environment as you strive to realize India’s foreign policy objectives in the country where you are posted.  With each host country, you need to have a perception and historical knowledge, pursue a definite agenda and address a specific set of bilateral issues. You are expected to prioritise your endeavours – in the short, medium or long term, keeping in mind bilateral convergences and the larger - regional and global context.

 

3.             This year, you have had to address the dramatic changes in the international political and security scenario. The traditional equations of power, ‘hyper-power’ and global influence have been altered in a manner that few anticipated.  There is a new World Order. All of humankind is, today, challenged by compelling transnational issues that need to be urgently addressed collectively and innovatively. Whether it is drug-resistant viruses, environmental degradation, pollution and climate change - or energy , water and food security, no single nation can claim to be free of deep concerns on account of these issues.

 

4.             The conflicts in the Middle East have become more complex. Economic migration from the African continent, followed by a mass influx from war-torn countries has brought a once-flourishing European continent to the brink. Populations across the continents are becoming inward looking and apprehensive. The starting point or causative factors matter less now – at this point it is far more pertinent to deal with the impact that these events will have on the world.

 

5.             I have visited that region in 2015 and 2016 - and have hosted many Heads of State and Government from the Middle East, Gulf and African continent during my Presidency. All of these leaders, without exception, had a common vision – that peace in their region, imperative for development, was their highest priority. Their approaches were similar - they shared with me their belief that to succeed, any reform process adopted by them should be owned and led by their own people; and that lasting solutions could be achieved by abjuring force - and choosing tolerance , dialogue and persuasion instead.

 

6.             Thus, I do believe that at this stage, the dynamics of the new world order must be well analysed and understood. As Heads of Missions, you shall have to ensure that India, as a respected and responsible player in world affairs and an emerging economic power, responds to the new challenges appropriately - to her best advantage, safeguarding her core interests at all times. I would stress that this is a moment for strategic policy making, leadership, and pursuit of an independent foreign policy - based on principle, pragmatism and the time-honored philosophy of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam.  In this context, I cannot but marvel at the enduring relevance of the philosophy of ‘unity’ and ‘dharma’ enunciated by Swami Vivekananda and the values of truth and non-violence that Mahatma Gandhi exemplified. Sustainable development, recycling, giving back to nature, preservation of our environment, conservation of energy, harmony between peoples, tolerance among religions, equality between men and women, peace and disarmament: these principles continue to hold the key to resolving the most complex challenges that confront the world today. I do feel optimistic that sincere and closely co-ordinated efforts by the international community – through bilateral, multilateral, regional as well as sub-regional  initiatives can and will eventually prevail.

 

7.             As the world’s largest democracy, we have assisted many friends in building and strengthening their democratic institutions, but we have always taken care to avoid being prescriptive. Our efforts in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping under the aegis of the United Nations and its organs have been appreciated and valued and virtually every Member of the UN agrees with the logic of India having a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.  It is also a matter of great satisfaction that one of the pillars of India’s foreign policy is the sound doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. It has served us well and has helped India to earn the trust of friends and partners across the globe. Our sincere adherence to this doctrine has also signaled that we will expect our friends and others to treat us the same way.

 

8.             We may be a developing country but we are among the fastest growing emerging economies. I am glad that the reforms and recent initiatives of Government of India have made our economy attractive for investors and our industrial sector viable for prospective partners. I also welcome the renewed emphasis of our Government on outcomes rather than processes. Today, technology has revolutionized the way we share knowledge, do business, consult and even the way we do our diplomatic work. In some countries, it is being used to create vast capacities for eavesdropping and cyber warfare. You are, no doubt, looking at all of these issues and addressing them comprehensively.

 

9.             I would like to most emphatically add that in addressing global and trans-national issues like maritime security, proliferation risks surrounding weapons of mass destruction, cyber security, international terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal migration and trans-national crime, our plan should be comprehensive and clear. 

 

10.         The world is tiring of statements and resolutions. Our efforts should be to work with like-minded nations and global institutions to swiftly generate effective solutions and implement them efficiently. Every well conceived effort will have some positive outcome. So, I, would say take the initiative. You are out in the field and your efforts and input are critical.

 

11.         Many of you have met me on various occasions and briefed me on our government’s dialogues and initiatives with your host countries, the issues and bilateral agenda - based on common aspirations. I am aware that you are working in challenging circumstances. Most of you have small teams. While visiting your capitals I have often noticed our Missions stretching resources to use them optimally. I congratulate you all for managing so well. 

 

12.         In your consular, visa and passport services as well as your interaction with the Indian Diaspora, I am glad that you accord due priority the Indian community. Whether it is persons of Indian origin, expatriates, tourists or businessmen, they all consider the Indian Embassy and the Indian Ambassador to be their own. From Papua New Guinea to Belarus, and Ivory Coast to Finland, I found the so called “Indian community” not only very supportive but also often supplementing our Missions’ resources.  This was heartening - and yet another example of their generosity and spirit. Please convey to them my best wishes.

 

13.         As you prioritise your resources to project India positively and bring her closer to partners and populations across the world, I call upon you to keep close to you the ‘talisman’ of Gandhiji – the simple test – of asking yourself at every step, how your endeavours will impact the humblest in India. 

 

14.         As I look back I am convinced that there is much to look forward to. I continue to have great expectations from you. With these words, I offer you my best wishes and safe travel back to your posts.

                It is indeed a great pleasure to be present amidst you on the occasion of the convocation of the Indian Forest Service Officers of the batch of 2015-17. Convocation is no doubt a landmark day in your life as you graduate from formal training and leave the portals of your alma mater in service of the Nation. It is also a landmark event for your teacher, parents and friends. Constituted under the All India Service Act of 1951, the Indian Forest Service, has the unique responsibility of not only overseeing and supervising the huge bio-diversity of India, but also the diverse culture, traditions and livelihoods associated with this bio-diversity.

Situated in this Green Doon Valley, I am sure that the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, would have amply inculcated skills and training amongst the officers and groomed them to deliver their best in the service of the country and humanity as a whole. Indeed, the fact that, the Academy is one of the premier institutions of higher education in the field of forestry, goes a long way in testifying its core-competency.

Ladies & Gentlemen,

3. Owing to the great bio-diversity in flora, fauna and wildlife, India is rightfully known as the ‘Heaven on Earth’. While our forests provide for water, clean oxygen and various herbal plants, our wildlife sustains that very essential food chain, that is essential for maintenance of ecology.

Friends,

4. The importance attached to the sustenance and maintenance of our ecology and bio-diversity has transcended ages. The Atharvaveda mentions that “our land should be so fertile that the yield taken from it should be recuperated very soon and it should not be harmed by any activity of ours”. Forest management is an important aspect in Indian cultural and ethos. This thought takes back even to the times of Chandragupta Maurya. If it was relevant in those days, it is relevant even today when the world is facing the challenges of sustainable development.

5. However, the earlier colonial period witnessed uncontrolled deforestation and exploitation of forest resources in the larger game of ‘drain of wealth’. Once the colonial masters realized that the exploitation of such resources could not go on forever, the Imperial Forest Department for Scientific Forest Management was established in the year 1864. While initially, the officers of the Imperial Forest Department were sent to France, Germany and Britain for a two-year training, in 1926, the Imperial Forest Research Institute was established in Dehradun.

Ladies & Gentlemen and the Officers passing out today,

6. I sought to draw your attention to the more than 100 year old history of Modern Indian Forestry to underline the enormous legacy that you will be joining. You are now part of a greater tradition and you must live up to its standards.

Friends,

7. Today, India has an area of 79.4 million hectares designated as forests. This is about 19.32 % of the country. The Forest Policy of the year 1952, calls for maintaining one third of the total land of the country as forest cover. This clearly indicates a gap of about 15%, which has to be bridged. In fact, to achieve this goal of 33% of forest cover was one of the professed goals behind setting up the Indian Forest Service in 1966, and it is time that concrete measures are ensured in this direction.

8. As I said earlier, the Indian Forest Service does not only have the responsibility of serving the sector of forestry in the country, but a much larger onus of arresting climate change apart from preservation of bio-diversity and enhancement of forest cover and encouraging forest based livelihood. It is indeed a matter of satisfaction that, aided by technology like e-surveillance and GIS application along with the hard work being put in by the officers of the Indian Forest Service, the forest cover in the country has increased from 64.2 million hectares in 1987 to 79.4 million hectares, as per recent reports. While this is a tremendous achievement in itself, but yet there are many more miles to be covered.

Friends,

9. The responsibility of carrying on this task is in your hands now, and at this juncture, I would like to draw your attention to four aspects of your job, that have assumed greater significance to the national life and humanity at large:-

i) The first call of your job should be to protect the forests, enhance its productivity and support the local populace in terms of their requirements from the forests, by the means of scientific interventions. Climate change has emerged as a major global issue, as we all know. Its impact on the poor, due to their limited capacity to cope with it, assumes paramount significance. Since forests are known to moderate local climate effects, protecting people from natural disasters, in addition to providing supplementary income to local population, your job should be to preserve these effective tools to counter climate change.

ii) The second aspect you need to focus on is to enhance the delivery mechanism of your unit. Efficiency and efficacy should be the corner stone in the discharge of your responsibilities. When people come to you with a problem, you should put in your best efforts to solve their issues in a professional manner. The files put up before you are not merely bunch of papers, they contain people’s aspirations, someone’s dream and someone’s livelihood. Governance with a human face and efficiency should be the hallmark of an All India Service, like yours.

iii) Thirdly, you should continuously strive to enhance your personal capacity and that of your subordinate staff, to improve upon delivery. This would be possible by upgrading your technical skill sets and revisiting the laid down procedures followed by your subordinate staff so as to find scope for improvement by using appropriate technology. I am confident that your training in IGNFA would have given you ample exposure to understand cross-sectoral linkages so that means could be devised to harness synergy in the delivery of services.

iv) Last, but not the least. You will have to provide expert solutions to the development versus conservation debates. In this debate, the first thing that we need to understand is that, though apparently contradictory, development and conservation are not antithetical. They can very much go hand-in-hand. People often take a stand on side of environment or development. However, both of these need to be seen as complementary and not antagonistic. The solution to this issue is inclusive development which factors in the importance of environmental aspects in the developmental agenda.

10. While I am confident that your training at IGNFA would have equipped you to handle all these aspects effectively, the talisman given by Mahatma Gandhi that “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need but not every man’s greed” (unquote) should guide you in every decision you take in the discharge of your duties. We have no right to destroy the resources of Mother Earth which we have inherited.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

11. I congratulate all of you once again for successful completion of your training program today. My best wishes are with you for all times to come. Always remember to be just, rights and honest in your decisions.

12. Before I conclude, young officers, I wish you Godspeed in your endeavours!

Thank you,

Jai Hind.

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the probationers for successfully qualifying the very difficult and competitive civil services examination. He also appreciated the fact that they had chosen to join the civil services as it would give them ample opportunity to contribute to the building of the nation. In no other service or career is such tremendous responsibility entrusted on young shoulders. 

The President said that the huge and diverse population of India lives under one system, one Constitution and has one identity. Our country is striving to solve the problems of poverty, ignorance and having access to modern amenities of life for a vast section of people. He said that civil servants can be a very effective tool for the transformation of society. 

The President said that probationers of IDAS, ICAS and IP & TAFS who were present had the crucial responsibility of ensuring financial management and proper accounting. They had to ensure that there was proper utilization of public funds. He wished the officers all success in their future career and advised them that when they look back after retirement, they should have the satisfaction of having done their job to their own satisfaction as well as that of others. 

The probationers of IDAS, ICAS and IP & TAFS are presently undergoing their training at the National Institute of Financial Management, Faridabad.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee yesterday (May 1, 2017) received His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of the Republic of Turkey and Mrs. Emine Erdogan at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also hosted a banquet in their honour. 

Welcoming the President of Turkey on his first State Visit to India, the President recalled his visit to Turkey in October 2013. The President expressed confidence that President Erdogan’s State Visit will impart new impetus to bilateral co-operation between India and Turkey. 

The President said terrorism is a major threat to our societies. India unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe that the international community should cooperate closely to address this menace. Collective, coordinated action by the international community against terrorism can no longer be postponed. 

The President said he was happy to note that the bilateral trade turnover between India and Turkey has grown manifold during the last ten years. Presently it is at the level of about USD 5 billion. However, the potential is much more. Our business community and investors on both sides should actively work together to avail the current opportunities. 

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Pranab Mukherjee said the relationship between India and Turkey pre-dates the establishment of our diplomatic ties as two modern and independent nations. Down the centuries and through our shared history, it has evolved and deepened. The Turkish contribution to Indian art and architecture, our language, the political and military organizational structure that was developed in our country, some of our laws, our costumes, customs and cuisine, is substantial. Our spiritual and philosophical bonds have been forged by the greatest exponents of Sufism - Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, Yunus Emre, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khurso. The socio-religious legacy of these poet philosophers emphasised tolerance, universal brotherhood and humanism - timeless values - which are the key to peace and social harmony in present, turbulent times. 

The President said India’s unambiguous support for Turkey during the Balkan War - and again during Turkey’s independence struggle, demonstrate the depth of friendship and sympathy shared by our peoples at defining moments in our history. We all remember the mission of Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari to Turkey in 1912 which he undertook to render medical assistance during the Balkan War. Our national leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru had empathized, without reservation, with Turkey’s leaders as they fought for the freedom of their country from foreign rule. 

The President said today, as two emerging economies in a globalised world, we both seek to enhance our economic co-operation to avail the current opportunities and build on our complementarities for our mutual benefit. India’s recent economic reforms and flagship initiatives have made us an attractive business destination. India welcomes Turkish companies to invest in India - especially in the infrastructure sector where they have exceptional expertise. Equally, we encourage Indian companies to explore prospects in Turkey.

                Your Excellency, Mr. RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN 

President of the Republic of Turkey, 

Madam EMINE ERDOGAN, 

Excellencies, 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 

It is a privilege to welcome you all this evening. 

I am reminded, at this moment, of the famous words of Yunus Emre - “A heart makes a good home for the friend.” We greet you, President Erdogan, Madam Emine Erdogan and the distinguished members of your delegation in this very spirit. 

2. Excellency, I recall, with pleasure, my own visit to your beautiful country in 2013. The warmth of the friendly people of Turkey throughout my visit is still fresh in my mind. I am happy that your State Visit to India has given me this opportunity of receiving you and Madam Emine Erdogan in the Rashtrapati Bhavan – and reciprocating the gracious hospitality of your Government and people. 

Ladies and gentlemen, 

3. The relationship between India and Turkey pre-dates the establishment of our diplomatic ties as two modern and independent nations. Down the centuries and through our shared history, it has evolved and deepened. The Turkish contribution to Indian art and architecture, our language, the political and military organizational structure that was developed in our country, some of our laws, our costumes, customs and cuisine, is substantial. Our spiritual and philosophical bonds have been forged by the greatest exponents of Sufism - Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, Yunus Emre, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khurso. The socio-religious legacy of these poet philosophers emphasised tolerance, universal brotherhood and humanism - timeless values - which are the key to peace and social harmony in present, turbulent times. 

Excellency, 

4. India’s unambiguous support for Turkey during the Balkan War - and again during Turkey’s independence struggle, demonstrate the depth of friendship and sympathy shared by our peoples at defining moments in our history. We all remember the mission of Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari to Turkey in 1912 which he undertook to render medical assistance during the Balkan War. Our national leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru had empathized, without reservation, with your leaders as they fought for the freedom of your country from foreign rule. 

5. Today, as two emerging economies in a globalised world, we both seek to enhance our economic co-operation to avail the current opportunities and build on our complementarities for our mutual benefit. 

Excellency, 

6. Trade between our two countries has increased manifold since your last visit to India in 2008. This should motivate us to take further steps to enhance bilateral flows of goods and services as well as investments. 

7. India’s recent economic reforms and flagship initiatives have made us an attractive business destination. We welcome Turkish companies to invest in India - especially in the infrastructure sector where they have exceptional expertise. Equally, we encourage Indian companies to explore prospects in Turkey. 

8. The amity between our two countries and the reservoir of goodwill between our peoples is a valuable basis for success - not only in the economic and commercial space, but also in science and technology, the energy sector, agriculture, education, tourism and information technology. Between us, we have the capabilities that, if combined, can achieve the desired results. 

9. Excellency, this is a time of unprecedented global challenges. The scourge of terrorism, a reality of our times, has afflicted India and Turkey for decades. India believes that there can be no justification, whatsoever for terrorism. Its use as an instrument of state policy is perilous and reprehensible. We believe that closer co-ordination and concerted efforts by the international community are necessary to tackle this menace effectively. 

10. Another global challenge of unprecedented scale is the impact of climate change. There is an urgent need for the world to use science, technology and best practices to achieve the agreed targets so that we can honestly claim to have made the world a better place to live in. 

11. I am confident that your State Visit, like your previous visit, will be remembered for its important outcomes, for bringing a fresh impetus to the fruitful cooperation between India and Turkey and for strengthening the mutual understanding and enduring friendship between our two nations. 

12. With these words, Mr. President, I thank you for your visit. Please accept the best wishes of the people of India for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Turkey. I wish you and Madam Emine Erdogan a comfortable and safe flight home. 

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the State of Israel on the occasion of their National Day (May 02, 2017). 

In a message to His Excellency Mr. Reuven Rivlin, the President of the State of Israel, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I extend warm greetings and felicitations to you, the Government and the people of Israel on the occasion of your National Day. 

As India and Israel celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, we look forward to closer cooperation between our Governments and peoples in all areas of our shared interest. Your historic visit to India in November last year opened new avenues for our joint efforts in diverse fields including defence, water resources development, agriculture, dairy farming innovation and scientific research and development. 

I am confident that our long-standing friendship will be further strengthened and our mutual understanding enhanced in the years to come. 

Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your personal well-being and success as also for the progress and prosperity of the people of Israel”.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee attended the 8th Convocation of the Lovely Professional University (LPU) today (May 2, 2017) at Phagwara, Punjab. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President reiterated his call for enhancing the quality of basic as well as applied research in institutions of higher learning in the country. Stating that good placement records alone do not bear testimony to an institution's international ranking, he stressed that for quality of higher education in the country to improve, it was necessary that importance be given to nurturing intellectual capital in institutions. 

Pointing out that the LPU has students from more than 50 Countries, the President said while this was a good achievement, one couldn't be satisfied‎ with just this. He recalled that India, with its Universities in Taxila and Nalanda had been a world leader in higher education for more than 1300 years. It was time that all our Institutions of higher learning once again strove to become magnets for mighty minds - students and faculty from all across the world. The trend of Indian students going abroad for higher studies will have to be reversed, and only then will our education system succeed. 

The President said in a nation of 1.3 billion people, 757 Universities and more than 38,000 degree colleges is insufficient. More people require to have access to higher education. However, increasing numbers alone is not enough. It is essential that mind is applied to enhancing numbers with commensurate enhancement in the quality of education being offered. 

The President emphasized the importance of research and cross fertilization of ideas in higher education institutions. He said it was such a free flow of ideas from across the world that had led to flowering of great diversity in India. This diversity was the key quality of our civilization.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of Marshall Islands on the occasion of their Constitution Day (May 01, 2016).

 

In a message to Her Excellency Dr. (Ms) Hilda C. Heine, the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I extend warm greetings to Your Excellency, the Government and people of the Republic of Marshall Islands on the occasion of your Constitution Day.

 

Bilateral relations between our two countries are growing stronger.  India’s dialogue with Pacific Island Countries (PIC) under the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) through the FIPIC-I Summit held in Suva in November 2014 and FIPIC-II Summit held in Jaipur in August 2015 has given us opportunities to  work together to address issues and challenges currently being faced by Pacific Island  Countries.  India’s initiative in creating a Centre for Excellence in Information Technology and solar electrification of two hundred houses through the efforts of “Solar Mamas” trained in India has been fruitful and has contributed to the diversification of our relationship to include bilateral cooperation in the IT, tele-medicine, tele-education and renewable energy sectors. 

 

I am confident that the relations between India and the Republic of Marshall Islands will continue to strengthen in the years to come to the mutual benefit of both our peoples.

 

Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your good health and well-being, as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Republic of Marshall Islands”.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that Dr. Ranjitsinh converted an opportunity that came his way as a civil servant into a passion. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘A Life with Wildlife: from Princely India to the Present’ authored by Dr. M.K. Ranjitsinh, here today. The Publisher, HarperCollins India, Shri Udayan Mitra and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the objective, and admirable part, of Dr. Ranjitsinh is that he is a deviationist. Those familiar with political vocabulary know that this is usually a loaded term, used for persons who for have indulged in right or left deviation from a certain path, he added.

The Vice President said that as the first Director of Wildlife Preservation of India, Dr. Ranjitsinh designed schemes for establishing national parks and sanctuaries. He further said that the author was the Member Secretary of the task force that formulated Project Tiger, one of our most successful conservation projects. He also worked as an Advisor for the UN Environmental Programme, he added.

The Vice President said that this book - part autobiography, part a conservationist’s handbook and part travelogue - traces the course of wildlife from the princely and British era to the present. It is an insider’s narrative, an authoritative account of conservation efforts in India, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

“For the past decade, book release functions have become somewhat of a second calling in life for me, almost an occupational hazard. Despite it, today’s gathering is different for a mix of subjective and objective reasons.

I begin with the subjective and personal. Dr. Ranjitsinh and I both belong to the 1961 batch of the civil services and have, therefore, known each other for more than half a century. My fondness and respect for him is considerable.

The objective, and admirable part, of him is that he is a deviationist. Those familiar with political vocabulary know that this is usually a loaded term, used for persons who for have indulged in right or left deviation from a certain path. I use the word for him because he neither went right nor left but instead elevated himself to a higher plane beyond the normal calling of a civil servant, into a world that runs parallel to our human existence and is mysterious, fascinating and enchanting.

The result is before us. The author converted an opportunity that came his way as a civil servant into a passion.

As the first Director of Wildlife Preservation of India, he designed schemes for establishing national parks and sanctuaries. He was the Member Secretary of the task force that formulated Project Tiger, one of our most successful conservation projects. He also worked as an Advisor for the UN Environmental Programme.

His efforts have been recognized by the award of the Order of the Golden Ark of Netherlands in 1979 and by election to the Global 500 Roll of Honor of the United Nations Environment Program(UNEP) in 1991.

This book- part autobiography, part a conservationist’s handbook and part travelogue- traces the course of wildlife from the princely and British era to the present. It is an insider’s narrative, an authoritative account of conservation efforts in India.

I felicitate him for this commendable work.

Jai Hind.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that Ayurvedic medicine still remains an important component of our healthcare system. He was addressing the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Rashtriya Ayurveda Vidyapeeth, here today. The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, the President of Rashtriya Ayurveda Vidyapeeth, Shri Devender Triguna and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Ayurveda is a traditional healing system of India, going back at least to the Vedic times. He further said that it is amongst the oldest and most elaborate forms of traditional medicine in the world. It needs to be seen as not just a system of disease treatment but a system of positive health for disease prevention and balanced lifestyle, he added. 

The Vice President said that with proper development and study of the traditional methods and substance using the tools available to us now from modern science, the traditional medical systems, including Ayurveda, can become an important and affordable part of a holistic healthcare system. He further said that alternative medicine, including Ayurveda, has gained wide recognition and become popular, not only in India but internationally. As our traditional medical systems, including Yoga and Ayurveda are being adopted worldwide, India can develop principles and standardized practices to make sure that this adaptation is systemic and true to the authentic traditions of these disciplines, he added. 

The Vice President said that there is a need for strategic partnering involving Ayurvedic medical experts, Ayurvedic pharmacy experts, botanical authorities across India, agricultural and environmental experts, drug discovery experts, medicinal chemists, clinical trial experts, large pharmaceutical companies, major universities as well as relevant governmental agencies and ministries. With the application of modern scientific methods to the ancient knowledge system, we can have the best of both the worlds, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“The World Health Organization defines health as ‘physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’. 

Modern medicine has been a boon for mankind but all too often we are also shown the limits of modern medicine, especially in dealing with lifestyle diseases and those relating to human psychology. 

One of the biggest challenges to providing healthcare to all are the escalating medical costs, which now consume a significant portion of the budget of both countries and families. 

According to WHO estimates, because of lack of access to modern medicine, and cultural reasons, about 65-80% of the world's population depends essentially on traditional medical systems for primary health care. 

Hence the urge to know how other societies, in different times, dealt with the challenges health and physical and mental wellbeing. 

History tells us that based on experience and requirement, the practice of medicine developed independently in ancient Egypt, ancient China, ancient India, ancient Greece, Persia and elsewhere. 

Ayurveda is a traditional healing system of India, going back at least to the Vedic times. It is amongst the oldest and most elaborate forms of traditional medicine in the world. Over centuries, Ayurveda has grown, changed and transformed as a holistic wellness method, addressing the physical and psychological well-being of individuals. It needs to be seen as not just a system of disease treatment but a system of positive health for disease prevention and balanced lifestyle. 

Other ancient Indians systems of medicine such as Yunnai and Siddha also encompass a holistic view of health. They recognize good health as a complex system involving interconnectedness with the environment, recognition of cultural traits, and social, mental, physical and emotional wellbeing, both of the individual and of the community. 

This slow and progressive development led to the birth of the modern pharmaceutical industry. In spite of the great advances observed in modern synthetic medicine in recent decades, plants, many of them known to the ancients, still make an important contribution to health care. 

Before European colonization, these traditional methods were the mainstream medical treatment, and had well developed and established methods, practices and knowledge systems. Many of the medicines found in plants, trees, herbs, soils and water that are used in traditional healing like Ayurveda, have counterparts on conventional pharmacy shelves. 

Ayurvedic medicine still remains an important component of our healthcare system. A recent study estimated that more than 90 percent of the our population, particularly in rural areas, use some form of Ayurvedic therapy, including following its dietary principles, practicing traditional or ‘house-hold remedies’ or seeking professional help from trained Ayurvedic practitioners. 

With proper development and study of the traditional methods and substance using the tools available to us now from modern science, the traditional medical systems, including Ayurveda, can become an important and affordable part of a holistic healthcare system. 

In this age of science, no one can claim that modern medicine with its substance and surgical innovations is wrong or unnecessary, but it need not be the only line of treatment. Traditional medical systems, like Ayurveda, can offer a first line of defense, focusing on wellness and improvement of health by addressing the preventative aspect, particularly for lifestyle induced diseases and psychological conditions that are increasingly common in our stress filled way of life. 

Such medical pluralism will entail the adoption and integration of biomedical healthcare with traditional methods, or concurrent treatment. The two systems of traditional and modern medicine can blend together in a beneficial harmony, using the best features of each system, and compensating for certain weaknesses in each. 

There is growing awareness among the scientific community and the general public about the intrinsic value of traditional medicine, and as a result Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha have entered the mainstream to compliment modern biomedicine. 

Alternative medicine, including Ayurveda, has gained wide recognition and become popular, not only in India but internationally. With millions placing their faith in alternative treatments, it has also become an important and lucrative business. In a recent survey of NHS users in UK, it was reported that nearly 40 percent of adults had used complementary and alternative medicine. In the United States, Ayurveda is considered a complementary healthcare option, with many Americans employing Ayurvedic elements such as massage, meditation, or cleansing therapies. 

As our traditional medical systems, including Yoga and Ayurveda are being adopted worldwide, India can develop principles and standardized practices to make sure that this adaptation is systemic and true to the authentic traditions of these disciplines. This requires that the highest level of research, teaching and practice is promoted in India. It also requires that the Ayurvedic medicines and products coming out of India are of the best quality. 

We have taken definite steps towards developing an integrated system of health care that includes thinking about and using what has been working in different cultures for thousands of years. The establishment of department of AYUSH and its growing linkages with our mainstream medicine is a step in this direction

If a traditional medical system to be thoughtfully, respectfully, yet vigorously evaluated, research must involve both scientific experts trained in relevant scientific rules of evidence as well as Ayurvedic experts trained in all aspects of Ayurvedic practice. To place traditional medical systems on a sound footing and ensure its wide acceptance, our ancient knowledge has to be tested on the scientific lodestone before it is either accepted or rejected. Mere antiquity does not grant respectability. Nor should ancient and traditional knowledge be dismissed just because it is old. 

There is a need for strategic partnering involving Ayurvedic medical experts, Ayurvedic pharmacy experts, botanical authorities across India, agricultural and environmental experts, drug discovery experts, medicinal chemists, clinical trial experts, large pharmaceutical companies, major universities as well as relevant governmental agencies and ministries. 

With the application of modern scientific methods to the ancient knowledge system, we can the best of both the worlds. The pre-clinical and clinical trials for new Ayurvedic drug formulations have been prescribed by the Department of AYUSH with the intention of providing appropriate evaluation methods to facilitate the development of regulation and registration in Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicines. Efforts such as the work of the Yunnai and Ayurveda Pharmacopia Committee under AYUSH, which aims to list the medicinal ingredients and their uses so as to allow for replication and standardization, will go a long way in establishing the credentials of traditional medical systems . 

Since its establishment in 1988, the Rashtriya Ayurveda Vidyapeeth has played an important role in not only the promotion of Ayurvedic medical system but also in preservation and cataloging of the traditional knowledge, its principles and practices. In its Silver Jubilee year, the Vidyapeeth is recognized as a leading institution in Ayurvedic medicine. 

I am confident that this venerable institution would continue to facilitate the scientific evaluation and the eventual integration of traditional medicine into the national healthcare system. 

Jai Hind.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that Mann Ki Baat is an ingenious and influential communication platform created by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He was addressing, here today, an event to mark the release of two books; ‘Man Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’ authored by Shri Rajesh Jain and ‘Marching with a Billion: Analysing Narendra Modi’s Government at Midterm’ authored by Shri Uday Muhurkar. The President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, the Speaker of Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, the Union Minister for Finance, Corporate Affairs and Defence, Shri Arun Jailtey, the Secretary to the President, Smt. Omita Paul and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Man Ki Baat takes a traditional medium like the radio and marries it to the entire spectrum of communication technologies available — from television to the internet, from social media to mobile telephony. Mann Ki Baat has become an important element of Modi ji’s direct-to-people communication strategy, he added. 

The Vice President said that history abounds in instances of leaders moving crowds with the power of words. Semantics differentiates between an orator and a demagogue; both speak to persuade; both play on emotions, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“This is a special occasion, by virtue of its subject, its theme, and its venue. The two books released here relate to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji. One is the text of his weekly radio broadcasts, the other a commentary to highlight its virtues. Both have been commented upon by previous speakers. 

I may add that like on somewhat similar occasions in the academia, today’s ceremony would be conferment of an honour in absentia. 

Leaders of men and women necessarily feel the need to communicate with their followers in order to get the message across, generate enthusiasm and repel doubts. To do so effectively, they need verbal skills. Some are born with it, others cultivate it. Success often depends on the occasion, the nature of the audience, and the right mix of facts, logic and sentiments to exude a sense of authenticity. 

History abounds in instances of leaders moving crowds with the power of words. Semantics differentiates between an orator and a demagogue; both speak to persuade; both play on emotions. The difference is often subjective and depends on the trust reposed by of the audience. A good example of it was the four-term American President Franklin Roosevelt who once confessed to being a juggler who never let his left hand know what the right hand does and who was perfectly willing to mislead and tell untruths. 

The two books before us capture important facets of an important personality of our times. Given its sophisticated, multi-level dissemination and its large potential audience, Mann Ki Baat is an ingenious and influential communication platform created by PM Modi. It takes a traditional medium like the radio and marries it to the entire spectrum of communication technologies available — from television to the internet, from social media to mobile telephony. 

Mann Ki Baat has become an important element of Modi ji’s direct-to-people communication strategy, encompassing social media platforms like Twitter, the government’s citizen engagement platform, MyGov.in, and his personal App. 

A new complementary ‘Jan ki Baat’ programme has recently been announced and would make the process increasingly interactive. 

I congratulate the authors and publishers for their efforts in compiling these volumes. 

Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that arbitration process in India has evolved over the years and now offer a useful and speedy tool for resolution of disputes that saves both the court's and the litigants’ time. He was addressing, here today, the inaugural session of a two-day Conference on Dispute Management in Infrastructure Projects - New Challenges, organized by the Indian Institute of Technical Arbitration, Delhi State Centre. The President of Indian Institute of Technical Arbitrators, Shri R.P. Seshadri, the Spl. Director General, Central Public Works Department (CPWD), Shri N.L. Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 

Recalling its achievements, the Vice President said that the CPWD today is a multifaceted infrastructure construction and maintenance Agency with some of the best construction engineering, architectural and horticultural capabilities.

 

The Vice President said that arbitration is considered an efficient alternative to litigation because it is quicker, less expensive, and provides greater flexibility of process and procedure. The parties often select the arbitrator and exercise control over certain aspects of the arbitration procedure, he added.

 

The Vice President said that arbitrators also bring domain expertise to the specific subject matter of the dispute, providing for a more efficient and quicker process. The renovated Arbitration Act of 2015 has further sanctified the arbitration process by granting even more finality to the arbitral award, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“The Director General has requested me to inaugurate a conference on a subject about which I know next to nothing. I am nevertheless grateful to him for inviting me today.

 

A department of public works, anywhere and in any period of history, has been an essential part of governance systems. It is difficult to visualise that edifices like the Meenakshi Temple, the Taj Mahal or the Red Fort or innumerable other iconic structures could have been built without a body of persons designated to translate the visions of the rulers into visible reality.

 

The Central Public Works Department, or the CPWD, as the principal Public Works Organisation of the Government of India has had a long and interesting history since its inception in July 1854 as the Ajmer Central Division for colonial works. 

 

The city of New Delhi, as we see it, as well as the buildings in Imperial Shimla and other prestigious buildings like Mayo College Ajmer, can largely be credited to the works of CPWD. This has been true, with greater intensity and diversity, of the period after Independence.

 

The CPWD today is a multifaceted infrastructure construction and maintenance Agency with some of the best construction engineering, architectural and horticultural capabilities. It is the main agency entrusted with the largest, most prestigious and most difficult construction works.

 

The average citizen, however, sees only the end product. Little does he know that the execution of complex infrastructure projects involves a multitude of stakeholders and vendors, occurrence of disputes, despite careful planning and risk assessment, is but natural. 

 

It was Mahatma Gandhi who said that ""Differences we shall always have but we must settle them all, whether religious or other, by arbitration.""

 

Our legal framework provides for lawsuits and trials as the legal method for resolving disputes. However, concerns about court congestion and delays, rising litigation costs, and the negative psychological and emotional impact of litigation have led to search for alternative methods.

 

Arbitration is one of the preferred alternative dispute resolution processes and is finding increasing use in both the private and public sector.

Arbitration is often understood as a process where the disputing parties present their case to a neutral third party, who renders a decision. It is considered an efficient alternative to litigation because it is quicker, less expensive, and provides greater flexibility of process and procedure. The parties often select the arbitrator and exercise control over certain aspects of the arbitration procedure. Arbitrators also bring domain expertise to the specific subject matter of the dispute, providing for a more efficient and quicker process. Such domain skills are particularly useful in cases involving technical arbitration.

 

Nor is this an innovation of modern times. Evidence of commercial arbitration has been found in all periods of history. In India, mediation and arbitration have enjoyed respectable place as a means of resolving disputes since the Vedic times.

 

The first modern arbitration law in India, however, was enacted as early as 1772 in form of the Bengal Regulation Act of 1772. It was updated in 1940, and again through the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, enacted in 1996. Aimed at reducing the excessive workload on our courts, the Act streamlined the arbitration process. It provided for enforcement of the arbitral awards with the same force as a court decree, in order to provide for speedy solution to disputes. The Legislation covered both international and domestic commercial arbitration and conciliation. The renovated Arbitration Act of 2015 has further sanctified the arbitration process by granting even more finality to the arbitral award.

 

There is much demand today for an internationally proven and judicially supported private method of civil dispute resolution, and arbitration is increasingly being seen as a crucial element in functioning of market economies.   

 

Arbitration process in India has evolved over the years and now offer a useful and speedy tool for resolution of disputes that saves both the court's and the litigants’ time.  It has provided the business and private citizens with an approachable alternative to litigation. However, for arbitration to become a widely accepted practice, arbitration needs to be based on judicious application of law and fair and just treatment of the facts. In short, the quality of arbitrators will determine the credibility of the process.

 

For business dispute resolution, it is becoming ever popular for the advantages it brings. While the Courts provide a public forum for dispute resolution, arbitration, and mediation, allow for the private resolution of disputes away from media attention and with confidentiality

 

I am sanguine that the deliberations that would take place in this conference would enrich the participants and generate the novel ideas that can be utilised for betterment of the field of arbitration.

 

Thank You.

 

Jai Hind.”

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel today co-chaired the 4th India Germany Inter-Govermental Consultations in Berlin.

Addressing the media after the meeting, Prime Minister Modi appreciated Chancellor Merkel's vision for Europe and for the world.

He said outcome oriented momentum is perceptible in relations between the two countries.

The Prime Minister said foreign investment from Germany to India is rising, especially for the Make in India initiative. The Prime Minister said German partnership is important for the Skill India Mission, with German parameters being ""global benchmarks"" which are crucial for India. The Prime Minister said cooperation is also envisaged in the sports arena, particularly in football.

The Prime Minister spoke of themes such as climate protection and smart cities, which came up for discussion. He said German innovation and Indian youth could together add great dynamism in the start-up space.

The Prime Minister said a global order based on democracy is the need of the hour, in an interconnected and interdependent world.

Responding to a question, he said Germany and India are ""made for each other."" He explained the huge synergy that exists between German capabilities and Indian requirements. He spoke of India's pursuit of excellence in areas such as engineering, infrastructure and skill development. Describing the values of innovation and democracy, as a blessing for mankind, he said India and Germany share these values.

In response to a question on climate change, the Prime Minister reiterated India's timeless values of nurturing and protecting nature. He recalled India's commitment to generate 175 GigaWatts of energy from renewable sources by 2022. Emphasizing the importance of protecting nature, the Prime Minister said ""playing with the well-being of future generations would be an immoral and criminal act.""

Earlier, during the IGC, Prime Minister Modi emphasized the big role that the European Union has to play in nurturing a rule-based global order. Both leaders shared deep concern over the global menace of terrorism, and decided to strengthen mutual counter-terrorism initiatives.

The Prime Minister thanked Germany for support of Indian membership of export control regimes. Themes such as clean coal, electric mobility, science and technology cooperation, cyber-security and aviation security came up for discussion. The consultations also touched upon Afghanistan and other global matters.

Both countries signed 12 agreements. A comprehensive joint statement was also issued, covering various aspects of the negotiations.

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Germany, Spain, Russia and France

“I will visit Germany on 29-30 May 2017 on the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the Fourth India-Germany Intergovernmental Consultations (IGC).

India and Germany are large democracies, major economies and important players in regional and global affairs. Our strategic partnership is based on democratic values and commitment to an open, inclusive and rules-based global order. Germany is a valuable partner in our development initiatives and German competencies fit well with my vision for India’s transformation.

I would begin my visit from Meseberg near Berlin in Germany, where Chancellor Merkel has very graciously invited me to hold discussions on issues of regional and global importance.

On 30 May, Chancellor Merkel and I will hold the 4th IGC to review the state of our bilateral relationship. We will also chart out a future roadmap of cooperation with focus on trade and investment, security and counter-terrorism, innovation and science & technology, skill development, urban infrastructure, railways and civil aviation, clean energy, development cooperation, health and alternative medicine.

I would also call on H.E. Dr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Germany is our leading partner in trade, technology and investment. In Berlin, Chancellor Merkel and I will interact with top business leaders of both the countries to further strengthen our trade and investment ties.

I am confident that this visit will open a new chapter in our bilateral cooperation with Germany and further deepen our Strategic Partnership.

I will pay an official visit to Spain from 30 – 31 May 2017. This will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Spain in almost three decades.

I will have the honour of calling on His Majesty King Felipe VI during this visit.

I look forward to my meeting with President Mariano Rajoy on 31 May. We will discuss ways to enhance bilateral engagement, especially in the economic sphere, and cooperation on international issues of common concern, particularly in combating terrorism.

There is significant potential for deepening bilateral trade and investment ties. We seek active participation of Spanish industry in various Indian projects including infrastructure, smart cities, digital economy, renewable energy, defence and tourism.

I will also meet top CEOs of Spanish industry and encourage them to partner with us in our 'Make in India' Initiative.

The first meeting of the India-Spain CEOs Forum will be held on the sidelines of my visit. I look forward to their valuable recommendations for strengthening India-Spain economic partnership.

I will be visiting St. Petersburg, Russia from 31st May to 2nd June for the 18th India-Russia Annual Summit.

On 1st June, I will be conducting detailed discussions with President Putin to take forward our dialogue from the last Summit in Goa in October 2016. With a spotlight on economic ties, both President Putin and I will also be interacting with CEOs from both countries.

On the next day, I will be addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) together with President Putin. I appreciate the invitation to be the Guest of Honour at this year’s Forum. India is the Guest Country at the SPIEF this year.

In a first meeting of its kind, I will also have the opportunity to engage with Governors from various Russian regions to further broad base bilateral cooperation and more actively involve States/Regions and other diversified stakeholders.

At the beginning of my visit, I will go to Piskarovskoye Cemetery to pay homage to those who perished during the siege of Leningrad. I will also have occasion to visit the world famous State Hermitage Museum and the Institute of Oriental manuscripts.

I greatly look forward to my visit to St. Petersburg in this special year for the bilateral relationship as both countries celebrate the 70th Anniversary of our diplomatic relations.

I will be visiting France from 2-3 June, 2017. During the visit, I will have an official meeting with the newly elected French President H.E. Mr. Emmanuel Macron on 3 June.

France is one of our most important Strategic Partners.

I look forward to meeting President Macron and have discussions on issues of mutual interest. I would be exchanging views with the French President on important global issues including UN Security Council reforms and India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council, India’s membership of the various multilateral export control regimes, counter-terrorism cooperation, collaboration on climate change and International Solar Alliance.

France is our 9th largest investment partner and a key partner in our development initiatives in the area of defence, space, nuclear and renewable energy, urban development and railways. I am committed to substantially strengthening and advancing our multi-faceted partnership with France.”

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. It will perhaps be difficult for us to forget the year’s summer.. But, we are now awaiting the rains. As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced . I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan ,. Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan. We, Indians, are very lucky that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India and and its 1.25 billion people can take pride in the fact that people from all communities and faith are available here.. This is a country where both theists and atheists ; . idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist. We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living . In the ultimate , ny religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill. This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill. I, once again convey my best wishes to all. Last time around while sharing my thoughts in Mann ki Baat I had mentioned) a new word and had specially exhorted our youth to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone, experience new things; as this is the age when one can experiment and take risks and accept new challenges of life. I am glad that many people have given me feedback. All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me. I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language. Some are learning cooking, some others are learning dance and drama ; Some have written that they have now started to write poems. They are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world. I am extremely happy and want to share one of the phone-calls with you. 

“I am Diksha Katiyal speaking. I had almost left the habit of reading. Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations. When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison. I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age. Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.” 

I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country. Countless great men spent their youth in jails. Several youngsters went to the gallows . They suffered despicable miseries and that is how we can now breathe in a free India. We see all those great men who spent their time in jails did a great job of writing and reading. Their writings provided a great strength and inspiration to our Freedom Movement. 

Many years ago, I visited Andaman & Nicobar Islands. I went to see the Cellular Jail there. Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji. Veer Savarkarji had written a book “Majhi Jannmathep” while in incarceration . He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell. He was confined to a very small cell. These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture. I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarji’s book “Maazi Janmthep”. 

A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring. There was hardly any state in India youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of Andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this Cellular Jail during the freedom movement. included people of every language, every state and every generation had faced tortures during this struggle 

Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarjee. I would definitely want to tell our younger generation that to even perceive what kind of torture and trouble these freedom fighters had suffered to achieve freedom for us one must visit this Cellular Jail. Once we go there We come to know as to why this was called Kaalaa Paani or the dark waters If you get a chance, please pay a visit to this place which is actually a pilgrimage of our freedom struggle. 

My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month. Everything is otherwise normal. Yet, 5th of June is a special day as this is observed as “World Environment Day”. This year the United Nations have chosen the theme ‘Connecting People to Nature’. In other words, we may say “back to basics”. And What’s the meaning of connecting with nature?? In my view, it means getting connected with one’s own self. Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet. And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi? Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, “One must care about a world one will not see”. This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that. Nature possesses a special power. You might have also observed that whenever we feel tired and exhausted, splashing a glass of water on our face has a wonderful rejuvenating effect. If you return after a tiring day’s work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air – this will fill you with fresh energy. Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy. All of us have experienced this but we do not register this, we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence. Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you. So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well. And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment. And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits. Vedas, describe the Earth and the Environment as the basic sources of energy. And, Atharva Veda, written thousands of years ago, is the most authentic guiding scripture about nature and environment. In India, it has been said – “Earth is the mother and I am her son”. According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth. The Earth is our mother and we all are her children. If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree. We have many festivals and religious rituals which are based on worshiping nature and affection towards nature is a part of our everyday life. This is true in case of all sections of society whether lettered or unlettered , rural or urban and even tribal communities. But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments. 

These days , I keep receiving news from our states. Almost in every state, a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon. Millions of trees are planted. School children, social organizations and NGOs also get connected with the campaign. Even State Governments take an initiative. Let us also make our contribution in enhancing this campaign. 

My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a well known day world over. The whole world observes this as World Yoga Day. In a very short time, 21st June has got worldwide recognition as World Yoga day and is connecting people. At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been India’s great contribution to the world.. We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga. Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now. Because of life style, because of the mad race to achieve success and because of increasing responsibilities, leading a stress- free life has become very difficult. It is seen, this situation is coming up even at a comparatively younger age. At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life. Yoga is a guarantee of wellness and fitness both. Yoga is not merely an exercise. How to mount on the journey of life with the inter-play of body, mind, thoughts and behavior can be better realized and understood through Yoga. Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day. 

Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well. We shall gradually advance in that direction. I have received one suggestion and I compliment the gentleman who has made this creative suggestion. It is a very interesting suggestion. He has said since this is the Third International Yoga Day I should make an appeal that on this third international Yoga Day, three generations of the family should do yoga together. Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos. It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga. I express my gratitude for this suggestion and I feel that as our ‘Selfie with Daughter’ campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience. So will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world. You should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on Narendra ModiApp or on Mygov. This will be the picture of “yesterday, today and tomorrow” and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow. I invite all of you. We are still left with about three weeks for the International Yoga Day. Start practicing from today itself. From 1st June, I will post something or the other about Yoga on twitter and continue to do so till 21st June. I will share with you. You too kindly spread the message of Yoga and connect people with it. This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care. I invite you all to get connected to it. Ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the people and when for the first time when I got a chance to address from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had talked of cleanliness. From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country. And, I have seen that people closely follow as to what Modi does, where does Modi go, what all has Modi done. I received a very interesting phone call and I had also not visualized from this angle. But, I am thankful to him for having seen the campaign in this way. This phone call will also attract your attention. 

“Pranam Modi ji, I’m Naina from Mumbai. Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness. Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission. Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness. Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads. The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.” 

You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event. Five, seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held. Media also prominently highlights such programmes., A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat. A big cleanliness drive was conducted there. I also did not see a connect is in this. But, after receiving this phone call, I also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent. You can very well imagine how much pleasure I derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme. There cannot be any bigger pleasure for me than to know that my visit has been connected with the cleanliness campaign. Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda. This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person. I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it. Someone gave me a suggestion. This is in a way a humorous suggestion. I do not know whether I would be able to do it or not. Modi ji, when someone asks for your visit , your stay, you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness, if they wish to invite you. How many tonnes of waste would you present to me so that I may accordingly decide the duration of stay. The idea is very good but I will have to think. But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts. How many people shall we be able to save from ill health. This will be a big service to humanity. One thing I would certainly like to say is that we should always consider these waste as resources and wealth. . Do not see it as just garbage. Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management. Young persons connected with Start-ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments. 

The Central Government has along with State Governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management. On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country. 

Two types of waste bins will be available, one would be of green colour and the other blue. There are two types of waste generated, is the liquid waste and the other is dry waste. If we follow discipline, then the waste bins that are going to be placed in these 4 thousand towns will collect dry garbage in blue waste bins and liquid garbage in green waste bins. The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins. This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins. The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin. I’ve a firm belief that we will develop a culture and the new steps that we take towards achieving cleanliness will continue, only then will we achieve the dream of Gandhiji, achieve the kind of cleanliness that he dreamt of, today. I must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge Public campaign can be launched . Cleanliness is also one such drive; a A few days ago, you must have heard that the Versova beach in Mumbai, which was infamous for its filth has now transformed into a a clean and beautiful beach. People toiled for about 80-90 weeks, unceasingly and turned Versova beach around by extracting thousand of tonnes of waste materials and today Versova beach is clean and beautiful. This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV. A gentleman called Afroz Shah started this mission from October, 2015 whole heartedly with all his might, slowly people started joining his bandwagon and turned into a people’s movement. For this outstanding work, United Nations Environment Programme or UNEP awarded ‘Champion of the Earth’ Award to Sh. Afroz Shah, and thus he has become the first Indian to achieve this distinction. I congratulate Sh. Afroz Shah, and felicitate this people’s movement. The manner in which Sh. Afroz Shah gathered the people of the area into a people’s collective and gave it the shape of a People’s movement in itself an inspiring example. 

Brothers and Sisters, it is with great happiness that I wish to tell you, that I am given to understand that under the aegis of ‘Swachch Bharat Campaign’, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become completely free of open defecation. I wish to congratulate the people of Riyasi Block and also the public servants of Riyasi Block. Jammu & Kashmir has presented an excellent example. I congratulate one and all in the state. I have been told that this movement found maximum leadership amidst women. The women of that area took out torch rallies to spread awareness, went from house to house, street to street and inspired the people towards this goal. I felicitate the mothers and sisters of Riyasi from the bottom of my heart. I also congratulate the administrators there for making an excellent beginning by turning one block in the state of Jammu and Kashmir open defecation free. 

My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.. Three years ago you vested the responsibility of ‘Pradhan Sewak’- the Chief Servant of the People upon me. There have been many surveys and several opinion polls. I see this entire process as a very healthy sign. The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone . It was analyzed by every segment of society. And this is a great process in democracy. I firmly believe that governments must be accountable in democracy and the public at large must be provided with report card of works done. I wish to congratulate those who took out time for an in depth analysis of our work, there were some praises some support and sometimes shortcomings were also pointed out, I understand the importance of all these things. I thank those people, who provided critical and important feedback. The mistakes and the shortcomings once highlighted can be rectified. Whether something is good, little less effective or bad, whatever it is, one has to learn from it and move ahead in life putting the learning from it into practice. 

Constructive criticism strengthens democracy; for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important. 

My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things. Some people take ‘Mann Ki Baat’ as a monologue and some criticize it from a political angle but after a long experience, I now feel, that when I had first started ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ I had not given thought to the fact that ‘Mann Ki Baat’ would make me a member of every family in India. Now I feel as if I’m conversing with my family while sitting at home. And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings. And as I said, as an ordinary citizen, I too get affected emotionally. Two days ago there was a launch of an analytical book on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was attended by the Hon’ble President, Hon’ble Vice President , Madam Speaker of the Lok sabha and as an ordinary citizen and as an individual this was very inspirational event for me. I’m grateful to the Hon’ble President, Hon’ble Vice President and Madam Speaker that inspite of their such high stature they took out time and they accorded importance to ‘Mann Ki Baat’. In fact it in itself has given a new dimension to ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Some of our friends, while working on this book had discussed it with me also. And some time ago, I was pleasantly surprised when this book was in the news again because Akbar Sahab an artist living in Abu Dhabi, proposed that he wishes to sketch the topics on which various episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ were based, and without taking a single rupee Akbar sahab transformed ‘Mann Ki Baat’ into art as a gesture of his love. I am grateful to Akbar Sahab. 

My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma ! Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere. 

My many felicitations and best wishes to you. Thank you.

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, नमस्कार, इस वर्ष की गर्मी शायद ही हम भूल पाएँगे। लेकिन वर्षा की प्रतीक्षा हो रही है। आज जब मैं आप से बात कर रहा हूँ तब, रमज़ान का पवित्र महीना प्रारम्भ हो चुका है। रमज़ान के पवित्र महीने के आगमन पर, मैं भारत और विश्व-भर के लोगों को, विशेष करके मुस्लिम समुदाय को, इस पवित्र महीने की हार्दिक शुभकामनायें देता हूँ। रमज़ान में prayer, spirituality और charity को काफी महत्व दिया जाता है। हम हिन्दुस्तानी बहुत ही भाग्यवान हैं कि हमारे पूर्वजों ने ऐसी परंपरा निर्माण की कि आज भारत इस बात का गर्व कर सकता है, हम सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासी इस बात का गर्व कर सकते हैं कि दुनिया के सभी सम्प्रदाय भारत में मौजूद हैं। ये ऐसा देश है जो ईश्वर में विश्वास करने वाले लोग भी और ईश्वर को नकारने वाले लोग भी, मूर्ति पूजा करने वाले भी और मूर्ति पूजा का विरोध करने वाले भी, हर प्रकार की विचारधारा, हर प्रकार की पूजा पद्धति, हर प्रकार की परंपरा, हम लोगों ने एक साथ जीने की कला आत्मसात की है और आखिरकार धर्म हो, सम्प्रदाय हो, विचारधारा हो, परंपरा हो, हमें यही सन्देश देते हैं – शान्ति, एकता और सद्भावना का। ये रमज़ान का पवित्र महीना शान्ति, एकता और सद्भावना के इस मार्ग को आगे बढ़ाने में ज़रूर सहायक होगा। मैं फिर एक बार सबको शुभकामनायें देता हूँ। पिछली बार जब मैं ‘मन की बात’ कर रहा था। तो मैंने एक शब्द प्रयोग किया था कि और खास करके नौजवानों को कहा था, कुछ नया करें, comfort zone से बाहर निकलिए, नये अनुभव लें, और यही तो उम्र होती है ज़िन्दगी को इस प्रकार से जीना, थोड़ा risk लेना, कठिनाइयों को न्योता देना। मुझे खुशी हो रही है कि बहुत सारे लोगों ने मुझे feedback दिया। व्यक्तिगत रूप से मुझे अपनी बात बताने का उत्साह सबने दिखाया। मैं हर चीज़ को तो पढ़ नहीं पाया हूँ, हर किसी के सन्देश को सुन भी नहीं पाया हूँ, इतनी ढ़ेर सारी चीज़ें आयी हैं। लेकिन, मैंने सरसरी नज़र से भी जो देखा – किसी ने संगीत सीखने का प्रयास किया है, कोई नये वाद्य पर हाथ आज़मा रहा है, कुछ लोग YouTube का उपयोग करते हुए नयी चीज़ें सीखने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं, नयी भाषा सीखने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं। कुछ लोग cooking सीख रहे हैं, कुछ नृत्य सीख रहे हैं, कुछ drama सीख रहे हैं, कुछ लोगों ने तो लिखा है कि हमने अब कविताएँ लिखनी शुरू की है। प्रकृति को जानना, जीना, समझना उस दिशा में प्रयास कर रहे हैं। मुझे बहुत ही आनंद हुआ और मैं एक फ़ोन कॉल तो आपको भी सुनाना चाहूँगा। 

“दीक्षा कात्याल बोल रही हूँ। मेरी पढ़ने की आदत लगभग छूट ही चुकी थी, इसलिए इन छुट्टियों में मैंने पढ़ने की ठानी। जब मैंने स्वतंत्रता संग्राम के बारे में पढ़ना शुरू किया, तब मैंने अनुभव किया कि भारत को आजादी दिलाने में कितना संघर्ष करना पड़ा है, कितना बलिदान देना पड़ा है, कितने स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों ने जेलों में वर्षों बिताए। मैं भगत सिंह जिन्होंने बहुत कम उम्र में बहुत कुछ हासिल किया उससे काफी प्रेरित हुई हूँ, इसलिए मैं आपसे अनुरोध कर रही हूँ कि इस विषय में आप आज की पीढ़ी को कुछ सन्देश दें।” 

मुझे खुशी है कि युवा पीढ़ी हमारे इतिहास को, हमारे स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों को, इस देश के लिए बलिदान देने वाले लोगों को, उनके विषय में जानने में रूचि रख रही है। अनगिनत महापुरुष, जिन्होंने जवानी जेलों में खपा दी।, कई नौजवान फांसी के तख़्त पर चढ़ गए। क्या कुछ नहीं झेला और तभी तो आज हम आज़ाद हिन्दुस्तान में सांस ले रहे हैं। एक बात हमने देखी होगी कि आज़ादी के आन्दोलन में जिन-जिन महापुरुषों ने जेलों में समय बिताया, उन्होंने लेखन का, अध्ययन का, बहुत बड़ा काम किया और उनकी लेखनी ने भी भारत की आज़ादी को बल दिया। 

बहुत वर्षों पहले मैं अंडमान निकोबार गया था। सेलुलर जेल देखने गया था। आज वीर सावरकर जी की जन्म जयन्ती है। वीर सावरकर जी ने जेल में ‘माज़ी जन्मठे’ किताब लिखी थी। कविताएँ लिखते थे, दीवारों पर लिखते थे। छोटी सी कोठरी में उनको बंद कर दिया गया था। आज़ादी के दीवानों ने कैसी यातनाएँ झेली होंगी। जब सावरकर जी की ‘माज़ी जन्मठे’ एक किताब मैंने पढ़ी और उसी से मुझे सेलुलर जेल देखने की प्रेरणा मिली थी। वहाँ एक light and sound show भी कार्यक्रम चलता है, वो बड़ा ही प्रेरक है। हिन्दुस्तान का कोई राज्य ऐसा नहीं था, हिन्दुस्तान की कोई भाषा बोलने वाला नहीं होगा जो आज़ादी के लिए काले पानी की सजा भुगतता हुआ अंडमान की जेल में, इस सेलुलर जेल में, अपनी जवानी न खपाई हो। हर भाषा बोलने वाले, हर प्रांत के, हर पीढ़ी के लोगों ने यातनाएँ झेली थी। 

आज वीर सावरकर जी की जन्म जयन्ती है। मैं देश की युवा पीढ़ी को ज़रूर कहूँगा कि हमें जो आज़ादी मिली है उसकी कैसी यातना लोगों ने झेली थी, कितने कष्ट झेले थे, अगर हम सेलुलर जेल जाकर के देखें, काला पानी क्यों कहा जाता था! जाने के बाद ही पता चलता है। आप भी कभी मौका मिले तो ज़रूर, एक प्रकार से हमारी आज़ादी की जंग के तीर्थ क्षेत्र हैं, ज़रूर जाना चाहिए। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, 5 जून, महीने का पहला सोमवार है। वैसे तो सब कुछ सामान्य है, लेकिन 5 जून, एक विशेष दिवस है क्योंकि ‘विश्व पर्यावरण दिवस’ के रूप में इसे मनाया जाता है और इस वर्ष UN ने इसका theme रखा है - ‘Connecting People to Nature’, दूसरे शब्दों में कहें तो back to basics और nature से connect का मतलब क्या है? मेरी दृष्टि से मतलब है - ख़ुद से जुड़ना, अपने आप से connect होना। Nature से connect का मतलब है - Better planet को nurture करना और इस बात को महात्मा गाँधी से ज़्यादा अच्छे से कौन बता सकता है। महात्मा गाँधी जी कई बार कहते थे – “One must care about a world one will not see” अर्थात् हम जो दुनिया नहीं देखेंगे हमारा कर्त्तव्य है कि हम उसकी भी चिंता करें, हम उसकी भी care करें और प्रकृति की एक ताक़त होती है, आपने भी अनुभव किया होगा कि बहुत थक करके आए हो और एक गिलास भर पानी अगर मुहँ पर छिड़क दें, तो कैसी freshness आ जाती है। बहुत थक करके आए हो, कमरे की खिड़कियाँ खोल दें, दरवाज़ा खोल दें, ताज़ा हवा की सांस ले लें - एक नयी चेतना आती है। जिन पंच महाभूतों से शरीर बना हुआ है, जब उन पंच महाभूतों से संपर्क आता है, तो अपने आप हमारे शरीर में एक नयी चेतना प्रकट होती है, एक नयी ऊर्जा प्रकट होती है। ये हम सबने अनुभव किया है, लेकिन हम उसको register नहीं करते हैं, हम उसको एक धागे में, एक सूत्र में जोड़ते नहीं हैं। इसके बाद आप ज़रूर देखना कि आपको जब-जब प्राकृतिक अवस्था से संपर्क आता होगा, आपके अन्दर एक नयी चेतना उभरती होगी और इसलिए 5 जून का प्रकृति के साथ जुड़ने का वैश्विक अभियान, हमारा स्वयं का भी अभियान बनना चाहिये और पर्यावरण की रक्षा हमारे पूर्वजों ने की उसका कुछ लाभ हमें मिल रहा है। अगर हम रक्षा करेंगे तो हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ियों को लाभ मिलेगा। वेदों में पृथ्वी और पर्यावरण को शक्ति का मूल माना गया है। हमारे वेदों में इसका वर्णन मिलता है। और अथर्ववेद तो पूरी तरह, एक प्रकार से पर्यावरण का सबसे बड़ा दिशा-निर्देशक ग्रंथ है और हज़ारों साल पहले लिखा गया है। हमारे यहाँ कहा गया है – ‘माता भूमिः पुत्रो अहम् पृथिव्याः’। वेदों में कहा है हम में जो purity है वह हमारी पृथ्वी के कारण है। धरती हमारी माता है और हम उनके पुत्र हैं। अगर हम भगवान् बुद्ध को याद करें तो एक बात ज़रूर उजागर होती है कि महात्मा बुद्ध का जन्म, उन्हें ज्ञान की प्राप्ति और उनका महा-परिनिर्वाण, तीनों पेड़ के नीचे हुआ था। हमारे देश में भी अनेक ऐसे त्यौहार, अनेक ऐसी पूजा-पद्धति, पढ़े-लिखे लोग हों, अनपढ़ हो, शहरी हो, ग्रामीण हो, आदिवासी समाज हो, प्रकृति की पूजा, प्रकृति के प्रति प्रेम एक सहज समाज जीवन का हिस्सा है। लेकिन हमने उसे आधुनिक शब्दों में आधुनिक तर्कों के साथ संजोने की ज़रूरत है। 

इन दिनों मुझे राज्यों से ख़बरें आती रहती हैं। क़रीब-क़रीब सभी राज्यों में वर्षा आते ही वृक्षारोपण का एक बहुत बड़ा अभियान चलता है। करोड़ों की तादात में वृक्ष बोये जाते हैं। स्कूल के बच्चों को भी जोड़ा जाता है, समाजसेवी संगठन जुड़ते हैं, NGOs जुड़ते हैं, सरकार स्वयं initiative लेती है। हम भी इस बार इस वर्षा ऋतु में वृक्षारोपण के इस काम को बढ़ावा दें, योगदान दें। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, 21 जून, अब दुनिया के लिये 21 जून जाना-पहचाना दिन बन गया है। विश्व योग दिवस के रूप में पूरा विश्व इसे मनाता है। बहुत कम समय में 21 जून का ये विश्व योग दिवस हर कोने में फ़ैल चुका है, लोगों को जोड़ रहा है। एक तरफ़ विश्व में बिखराव की अनेक ताक़तें अपना विकृत चेहरा दिखा रही हैं, ऐसे समय में विश्व को भारत की एक बहुत बड़ी देन है। योग के द्वारा विश्व को एक सूत्र में हम जोड़ चुके हैं। जैसे योग, शरीर, मन, बुद्धि और आत्मा को जोड़ता है, वैसे आज योग विश्व को भी जोड़ रहा है। आज जीवन-शैली के कारण, आपा-धापी के कारण, बढ़ती हुई ज़िम्मेवारियों के कारण, तनाव से मुक्त जीवन जीना मुश्किल होता जा रहा है। और ये बात देखने में आई छोटी-छोटी आयु में भी, ये स्थिति पहुँच चुकी है। अनाप-शनाप दवाईयाँ लेते जाना और दिन गुज़ारते जाना, ऐसी घड़ी में तनाव-मुक्त जीवन जीने के लिए योग की भूमिका अहम है। योग wellness और fitness दोनों की guarantee है। योग ये सिर्फ व्यायाम नहीं है। तन से, मन से, शरीर से, विचारों से, आचार से स्वस्थता की एक अंतर्यात्रा कैसे चले - उस अंतर्यात्रा को अनुभव करना है तो योग के माध्यम से संभव है। अभी दो दिन पहले ही मैंने योग दिवस को लेकर के विश्व की सभी सरकारों को, सभी नेताओं को चिट्ठी लिखी है। 

पिछले वर्ष मैंने योग से सम्बंधित कुछ स्पर्धाओं की घोषणा की है, कुछ इनामों की घोषणा की है। धीरे-धीरे उस दिशा में काम आगे बढ़ेगा। मुझे एक सुझाव आया है और ये मौलिक सुझाव देने वालों का मैं अभिनंदन करता हूँ। बड़ा ही interesting सुझाव दिया है। उन्होंने कहा कि ये तीसरा अंतर्राष्ट्रीय योग दिवस है और मुझे कहा एक आप अपील करें कि इस बार तीसरा अंतर्राष्ट्रीय योग दिवस पर एक ही परिवार की तीन पीढ़ी एक साथ योग करे। दादा-दादी हो या नाना-नानी हो, माता-पिता हो, बेटे-बेटी हो, तीनों पीढ़ी एक साथ योग करें और उसकी तस्वीर upload करें। कल, आज और कल एक ऐसा सुखद संयोग होगा कि योग को एक नया आयाम मिलेगा। मैं इस सुझाव के लिए धन्यवाद करता हूँ और मुझे भी लगता है कि जैसे हम लोगों ने selfie with daughter का अभियान चलाया था और एक बड़ा ही रोचक अनुभव आया था। ये तीन पीढ़ी की तस्वीर योगा करती हुई तस्वीर ज़रूर देश और दुनिया के लिए कौतुक जगाएगी। आप ज़रूर NarendraModiApp पर MyGov पर तीन पीढ़ी जहाँ-जहाँ योग करती हो, तीनों पीढ़ी के लोग एक साथ मुझे तस्वीर भेजें। कल, आज और कल की ये तस्वीर होगी। जो सुहाने कल की guarantee होगी। मैं आप सबको निमंत्रित करता हूँ। अभी अंतर्राष्ट्रीय योग दिवस के लिये क़रीब तीन सप्ताह हमारे पास हैं। आज ही practice में लग जाइऐ। मैं 01 जून से twitter पर daily योग के संबंध में कुछ-न-कुछ post करूँगा और लगातार 21 जून तक post करता रहूँगा, आप से share करूँगा। आप भी तीन सप्ताह लगातार योग के विषय को प्रचारित करिए, प्रसारित करिए, लोगों को जोड़िए। एक प्रकार से ये preventive health care का आंदोलन ही है। मैं निमंत्रित करता हूँ आप सब को इसमें जुड़ने के लिए। 

जब से आप लोगों ने मुझे प्रधान सेवक के रूप में कार्य की ज़िम्मेदारी दी है और लाल किले पर से मैंने, जब पहली 15 अगस्त थी मेरी, मुझे पहली बार बोलने का अवसर मिला था। स्वच्छता के संबंध में मैंने बात कही थी। तब से लेकर के आज तक हिंदुस्तान के अलग-अलग भागों में मेरा प्रवास होता है। और मैंने देखा है कि कुछ लोग बारीकी से मोदी क्या करते हैं? मोदी कहाँ जाते हैं? मोदी ने क्या-क्या किया? बराबर follow करते हैं। क्योंकि मुझे एक बड़ा interesting phone call आया और मैंने भी शायद इस प्रकार से चीज़ को सोचा नहीं था। लेकिन मैं इस बात को उन्होंने जो पकड़ा इसके लिए मैं आभारी हूँ। ये phone call से आपको भी ध्यान में आएगा। 

“प्रणाम मोदी जी, मैं नैना मुंबई से। मोदी जी T.V. पर और Social Media में आज कल मैं हमेशा देखती हूँ आप जहाँ भी जाते हैं वहाँ के लोग साफ़-सफाई पर विशेष ध्यान देते हैं। मुंबई हो या सूरत आपके आह्वान पर लोगों ने सामूहिक रूप से स्वच्छता को एक mission के रूप में अपनाया है। बड़े तो बड़े, बच्चों में भी स्वच्छता को लेकर जागरूकता आई है। कई बार उन्हें सड़क पर बड़ों को गंदगी फैलाते हुए, टोकते हुए देखा है। काशी के घाटों से जो आपने स्वच्छता की एक मुहिम शुरू की थी वो आपकी प्रेरणा से एक आंदोलन का रूप ले चुकी है। 

आपकी बात सही है कि मैं जहाँ-जहाँ जाता हूँ, वहाँ सरकारी मशीनरी तो सफाई का काम करती है लेकिन इन दिनों समाज में भी एक सफाई का उत्सव बन जाता है। मेरे जाने के पाँच दिन पहले, सात दिन पहले, दस दिन पहले, काफी मात्रा में सफाई के कार्यक्रम होते हैं। मीडिया भी उसको बड़ा प्राधान्य देता है। अभी मैं कुछ दिन पहले कच्छ गया था गुजरात में। बहुत बड़ा सफाई अभियान चला वहाँ। मैंने भी इसको जोड़ कर के नहीं देखा था। लेकिन जब ये phone call आया तो मैं भी सोचने लगा और मैंने देखा कि हाँ ये बात सही है। आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं मुझे कितना आनंद होता है इस बात को जानकर के और देश भी इन चीज़ों को कैसे बढ़िया ढंग से notice कर रहा है। मेरे लिए इससे बढ़कर के क्या खुशी होगी कि मेरी यात्रा से भी स्वच्छता को जोड़ दिया गया है। प्रधानमंत्री के स्वागत के लिए बाकी जो तैयारियाँ होने की आदत होगी-होगी, लेकिन स्वच्छता प्रमुख बात होगी। ये अपने आप में स्वच्छता-प्रेमी किसी को भी आनंदायक है, प्रेरक है। मैं इस स्वच्छता के काम को बल देने वाले सभी को बधाई देता हूँ। किसी ने मुझे एक सुझाव दिया। वैसे वो बड़ा मज़ाकिया सुझाव है। मैं नहीं जानता हूँ, मैं इसको कर पाऊंगा कि नहीं कर पाऊंगा। मोदी जी अब आप प्रवास तय करते समय जो भी प्रवास माँगे, उनको कहो कि भई अगर मुझे बुलाना है तो स्वच्छता का स्तर कैसा होगा? कितना टन कूड़ा-कचरा आप मुझे भेंट करोगे? उसके आधार पर मैं अपना प्रवास तय करूँ। Idea बहुत अच्छा है लेकिन मुझे सोचना पड़ेगा। लेकिन ये बात सही है कि ये movement तो बनना चाहिए कि और चीजें भेंट-सौगात में देने की बजाय अच्छा ही होगा कि हम भेंट-सौगात में इतना टन कूड़ा-कचरा सफाई कर के दे देंगें। कितने लोगों को हम बीमार होने से बचाएँगे। कितना बड़ा मानवता का काम होगा। एक बात मैं ज़रूर कहना चाहूँगा कि ये जो कूड़ा-कचरा है, इसको हम waste न मानें, वो wealth है, एक resource है। इसे सिर्फ garbage के रूप में न देखें। एक बार इस कूड़े-कचरे को भी हम wealth मानना शुरू करेंगें तो waste management के कई नए-नए तरीके हमारे सामने आयेंगे। Start-Up में जुड़े हुए नौजवान भी नई-नई योजनाएँ लेकर के आयेंगे। नए-नए equipment लेकर कर के आएँ। भारत सरकार ने राज्य सरकारों की मदद के साथ शहरों के जनप्रतिनिधियों की मदद के द्वारा waste management का एक बड़ा महत्वपूर्ण अभियान छेड़ना तय किया है। 5 जून, विश्व पर्यावरण दिवस पर देश के करीब 4 हज़ार नगरों में solid waste, liquid waste इसको collect करने के लिए उस प्रकार के साधन उपलब्ध होने वाले हैं। दो प्रकार के कूड़ेदान उपलब्ध होंगे, एक green colour का, दूसरा blue colour का। दो प्रकार के waste निकलते हैं - एक liquid waste होता है और एक dry waste होता है। अगर हम discipline follow करें, इन चार हज़ार नगरों में, ये जो कूड़ेदान रखे जाने वाले हैं। सूखा कचरा नीले कूड़ेदान में डालें और गीला कचरा हरे कूड़ेदान में डालें। जैसे kitchen का जो waste निकलता है, साग-सब्जियों के छिलके हों, बचा हुआ भोजन हो, अंडे के छिलके हों, पेड़-पौधों के पत्ते आदि हों ये सारे गीले waste हैं और उसको हरे कूड़ेदान में डालें। ये सारी चीज़ें ऐसे हैं जो खेत में काम आती हैं। अगर खेत का रंग हरा, इतना याद रखोगे तो हरे कूड़ेदान में क्या डालना है वो याद रह जाएगा। और दूसरा कूड़ा-कचरा ये है जैसे रद्दी-काग़ज है, गत्ता है, लोहा है, कांच है, कपड़ा है, plastic है, polythene है, टूटे हुए डिब्बे हैं, रबड़ है, धातुएँ है, कई चीज़े होंगी - ये सारी चीज़ें एक प्रकार से सूखा कचरा है। जिसको machine में डाल करके recycle करना पड़ता है। वैसे वो कभी उपयोग नहीं आ सकता। उसको नीले कूड़ेदान में डालना है। मुझे विश्वास है कि हम एक culture develop करेंगे। स्वच्छता की ओर हर बार नये कदम हमें उठाते ही जाना है। तब जा करके हम गाँधी जी जिन सपनों को देखते थे, वो स्वच्छता वाला सपना, हम पूरा कर पाएँगे। आज मुझे गर्व के साथ एक बात का ज़िक्र करना है - एक इंसान भी अगर मन में ठान ले तो कितना बड़ा जन आन्दोलन खड़ा कर सकता है। स्वच्छता का काम ऐसा ही है। पिछले दिनों आपके कान पर एक ख़बर आई होगी। मुंबई में गंदा माने जाने वाला वर्सोवा beach आज एक साफ़-सुथरा, सुंदर वर्सोवा beach बन गया। ये अचानक नहीं हुआ है। करीब 80-90 सप्ताह तक नागरिकों ने लगातार मेहनत करके ये वर्सोवा beach का कायापलट कर दिया। हज़ारों टन कूड़ा-कचरा निकाला गया और तब जा करके आज वर्सोवा beach साफ़ और सुंदर बन गया। और इसकी सारी जिम्मेवारी Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) उन्होंने संभाली थी। एक सज्जन श्रीमान अफरोज़ शाह अक्टूबर 2015 से, वे जी-जान से इसमें जुट गए। धीरे-धीरे ये कारवाँ बढ़ता चला गया। जन-आन्दोलन में बदल गया और इस काम के लिए श्रीमान अफरोज़ शाह को United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), उन्होंने बहुत बड़ा award दिया। Champions of The Earth Award ये पाने वाले वो पहले भारतीय बने। मैं श्रीमान अफरोज़ शाह को बधाई देता हूँ, इस आंदोलन को बधाई देता हूँ। और जिस प्रकार से लोक-संग्रह की तरह उन्होंने सारे इलाके के लोगों को जोड़ा और जन-आंदोलन में परिवर्तित किया। ये अपने आप में एक प्रेरक उदाहरण है। 

भाइयो और बहनों, आज मैं एक और ख़ुशी भी आप से बताना चाहता हूँ। ‘स्वच्छ भारत अभियान’ के सन्दर्भ में जम्मू-कश्मीर का ‘रियासी ब्लॉक’। मुझे बताया गया कि रियासी ब्लॉक open defecation free खुले में शौच से मुक्त हुआ है। मैं रियासी ब्लॉक के सभी नागरिकों को, वहाँ के प्रशासकों को जम्मू-कश्मीर ने एक उत्तम उदाहरण दिया है। इसके लिए मैं सबको बधाई देता हूँ और मुझे बताया गया इस पूरी movement को सबसे ज्यादा lead किया है जम्मू-कश्मीर के उस इलाके की महिलाओं ने, उन्होंने जागरूकता फ़ैलाने के लिए ख़ुद ने मशाल यात्राएँ निकाली। घर-घर, गली-गली जाकर के लोगों को उन्होंने प्रेरित किया। उन माँ-बहनों को भी मैं हृदय से अभिनन्दन करता हूँ, वहाँ बैठे हुए प्रशासकों का भी अभिनन्दन करता हूँ कि जिन्होंने जम्मू-कश्मीर की धरती पर एक ब्लॉक को open defecation free बनाकर के एक उत्तम शुरुआत की है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, पिछले 15 दिन, महीने से, लगातार अख़बार हो, टी.वी. चैनल हो, social media हो, वर्तमान सरकार के 3 वर्ष का लेखा-जोखा चल रहा है। 3 साल पूर्व आपने मुझे प्रधान सेवक का दायित्व दिया था। ढ़ेर सारे survey हुए हैं, ढ़ेर सारे opinion poll आए हैं। मैं इस सारी प्रक्रिया को बहुत ही healthy signs के रूप में देखता हूँ। हर कसौटी पर इस 3 साल के कार्यकाल को कसा गया है। समाज के हर तबके के लोगों ने उसका analysis किया है और लोकतंत्र में एक उत्तम प्रक्रिया है और मेरा स्पष्ट मानना है कि लोकतंत्र में सरकारों को जवाबदेह होना चाहिए, जनता-जनार्दन को अपने काम का हिसाब देना चाहिए। मैं उन सब लोगों का धन्यवाद करता हूँ, जिन्होंने समय निकाल करके हमारे काम की गहराई से विवेचना की, कहीं सराहना हुई, कहीं समर्थन आया, कहीं कमियाँ निकाली गई, मैं इन सब बातों का बहुत महत्व समझता हूँ। मैं उन लोगों को भी धन्यवाद देता हूँ जिन्होंने critical और important feedback दिये हैं। जो त्रुटियां होती हैं, कमियाँ होती हैं, वो भी जब उजागर होती हैं तो उससे भी सुधार करने का अवसर मिलता है। बात अच्छी हो, कम अच्छी हो, बुरी हो, जो भी हो, उसमें से ही सीखना है और उसी के सहारे आगे बढ़ना है। constructive criticism लोकतंत्र को बल देता है। एक जागरूक राष्ट्र के लिए, एक चैतन्य पूर्ण राष्ट्र के लिए, ये मंथन बहुत ही आवश्यक होता है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, मैं भी आप की तरह एक सामान्य नागरिक हूँ और एक सामान्य नागरिक के नाते अच्छी-बुरी हर चीज़ का प्रभाव मुझ पर भी वैसा ही होता है, जैसा किसी भी सामान्य नागरिक के मन पर होता है। ‘मन की बात’ कोई उसको एक तरफ़ा संवाद के रूप में देखता है, कुछ लोग उसको राजनीतिक दृष्टि से टीका-टिप्पणी भी करते हैं। लेकिन इतने लम्बे तज़ुर्बे के बाद मैं अनुभव करता हूँ, मैंने जब, ‘मन की बात’ शुरू की तो मैंने भी सोचा नहीं था। ‘मन की बात’ इस कार्यक्रम ने, मुझे हिन्दुस्तान के हर परिवार का एक सदस्य बना दिया है। ऐसा लगता है जैसे मैं परिवार के बीच में ही घर में बैठ करके घर की बातें करता हूँ और ऐसे सैकड़ो परिवार हैं, जिन्होंने मुझे ये बातें लिख करके भी भेजी हैं और जैसा मैंने कहा कि एक सामान्य मानव के रूप में, मेरे मन में जो प्रभाव होता है, फिर दो दिन पूर्व राष्ट्रपति भवन में आदरणीय राष्ट्रपति जी, आदरणीय उपराष्ट्रपति जी, आदरणीय स्पीकर महोदया सबने ‘मन की बात’ की, एक Analytical Book का समारोह किया। एक व्यक्ति के नाते, सामान्य नागरिक के नाते, ये घटना मुझे बहुत ही उत्साह बढ़ाने वाली है। मैं राष्ट्रपति जी का, उपराष्ट्रपति जी का, स्पीकर महोदया का आभारी हूँ कि उन्होंने समय निकाल करके, इतने वरिष्ठ पद पर बैठे हुए लोगों ने ‘मन की बात’ को ये अहमियत दी। एक प्रकार से अपने आप में ‘मन की बात’ को एक नया आयाम दे दिया। हमारे कुछ मित्र इस ‘मन की बात’ की किताब पर जब काम कर रहे थे, तो मेरे से भी कभी चर्चा की थी और कुछ समय पहले जब इसकी बात चर्चा में आई तो मैं हैरान था। अबु धाबी में रहने वाले एक artist अक़बर साहब के नाम से जाने जाते हैं। अक़बर साहब ने सामने से प्रस्ताव रखा कि ‘मन की बात’ में जिन विषयों पर चर्चा हुई है, वो अपनी कला के माध्यम से उसका sketch तैयार करके देना चाहते हैं और एक भी रूपया लिये बिना, अपना प्यार जताने के लिए अक़बर साहब ने मन की बातों को कला का रूप दे दिया। मैं अक़बर साहब का आभारी हूँ। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, अगली बार जब मिलेंगे तब तक तो देश के हर कोने में बारिश आ चुकी होगी, मौसम बदल गया होगा, परीक्षाओं के परिणाम आ चुके होंगे, नये सिरे से विद्या-जीवन का आरंभ होने वाला होगा, और बरसात आते ही एक नई खुशनुमा, एक नई महक, एक नई सुगंध। आइए हम सब इस माहौल में प्रकृति के प्रति प्यार करते हुए आगे बढ़ें। मेरी आप सब को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएँ हैं। धन्यवाद।

                My dear brothers and sisters.

I was fortunate to meet you people during 2014 General Election when I came here to campaign for Sarbanananda Ji. In a short span of time you made Sarbananada Ji the Chief Minister. I sincerely thank the people of Assam for this. The BJP government in Assam has completed one year under the leadership of Sonowal Ji in very difficult circumstances; you know it better than me what the condition of Assam was. It was a challenge; the state was in a mess. You trusted us to get Assam out of that mess. You gave us the opportunity to form the government in Assam. And now that the government has completed one year, I sincerely congratulate Sarbananda Ji, his cabinet colleagues, all our political allies, all the friends of Assam government and the people of Assam for getting Assam out of that mess.

Brothers and sisters, I have come here for a very important task, to lay the foundation of not an organisation but of creating a system. The task that is going to have an auspicious start here, will not only change the fortune of the state of Assam or North-East, but it will also change the fortune of rural India.

India is an agrarian country. We are such a fortunate people that we have all the weathers. Most of the people in this world would be familiar with three weathers, but we are familiar with more than just three weathers.

In a country where agriculture was considered the most important aspect of life, in a country, where, Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned Ram Rajya (ideal state) through Gram Rajya (where village is the primary unit of governance), we need to transform the agriculture, rural life to suit the needs of the 21st century. We have come thus far by using old methods. Some efforts were made in the meantime, some new things were added. However, this is not the time for going slow. Time doesn’t wait for anyone. The science and technology that had not changed for hundreds of years, changed in the past twenty five years. Our farmers must reap the benefit from these rapid changes. Our country is full of diversity, not just in languages and attires. Our land, our way of agriculture, our parks, our fruits, our flowers all have their own uniqueness. Therefore, we must start with a holistic approach to modernize our agriculture in a manner that takes into consideration the special needs of different regions about conducting scientific research, bringing about scientific changes, what should be the intervention of modern technology and how we can move in the direction of mechanising our agriculture.

We have big dreams. And this is a dream to transform the fortune of every single farmer of India. We have a dream of doubling farmer’s income by 2022 when India completes seventy five years of its independence. And we’re working in that direction. We have five years. We want to bring about those changes in the next five years, want to make that progress through which we can fulfil our dream of doubling the farmers’ income.

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has taken several important steps in the last three years. Three years is a very small period for such a huge country. However, the country has seen the feat of accomplishing many great things in such a short span of time. The 112 years old institution stands in Delhi. It will be immensely beneficial if that institution conducts research in different regions of the country. South has a different ecosystem, North has a different ecosystem, North-East and Western parts too have different eco systems. Keeping that in mind, we have decided to start two new research institutes. The foundation of one of those two institutes is being laid here in your area today. And now more research will be done here as per the special needs of the area. Scientists and youth of this area will get an opportunity to carry out their research here. And it will be easier to translate the benefits of the research conducted here from the laboratory to the land because people of this area will be familiar with the research. Therefore, it is our government’s thinking to decentralise the system according to the area, time and situation and prepare systems accordingly so that they can give faster results. We recently created a complete chain from the seed, providing seeds to the farmers till the time he takes his produce to market. It was essential to create a seamless chain without any hindrances. And we focussed on this thing when I say from ‘seed to market’; and we put lot of emphasis on soil health cards in the last three years. Our farmers were unaware about the health of their soil. Today, if we fall sick then doctor first sends us to a laboratory for blood test so that he can determine the nature of the problem, to diagnose the disease. Our mother earth is like a human body. As we conduct blood test, urine test in laboratory to figure out the problems afflicting our body, to find out what’s good in our body, similarly, the strength and deficiencies of our soil can be assessed in a laboratory, like for which crop this land is suitable this too can be determined; what ingredients, which manure, which fertiliser is needed can be determined too. That’s why we have decided to provide every Indian farmer with a soil health card. We have launched an ambitious programme.

Brothers and sisters,

It’s not that we got to know about the soil health card through modern science. The previous government was also aware about them. It’s not like that scientists are born after coming of my government to power. Scientists were there earlier too. However, mere tokenism cannot change the country. There were only 15 soil health card labs in the country. Only 15 soil health card labs for such a massive country! Even if they do work for 15 farmers in the country in a day even then how much they can do. How they will serve such a massive country? Brothers and sisters, we started a big movement. Today, we have established more than 9,000 soil health card labs in the country. And, we are inviting youth to take that forward. We have urged Indian youth working in the start-ups to prepare small machines that can work as a lab in farmer’s household; if he puts soil in it so that he can get the information about the potential use of the soil and also the information about the crop for which that soil is suitable. And these youth running the start-ups have developed new machines; in near future, you may come across to these machines working as labs in some houses in your village.

Brothers and sisters,

I would urge the farmers, as we go for blood test in a laboratory when we fall sick, similarly, they should get their soil health cards made from a laboratory every year to find out about any deficiency in the soil and choose crops as per the suggestion given in that soil health card. And you would be able to harvest good crop, bumper crop in low budget. This is what we’re doing.

Brothers and sisters,

If our farmers get enough water they can do wonders. That’s why we have put emphasis on Prime Minister’s Krishi Sinchai Yojna (PMKSY). This is the state that gets abundant water. That’s why, sometimes, we fail to understand the value of water. But the areas with deficient rainfall, without rivers, they know the value of the water. That’s why we are pushing for schemes like ‘per drop more crop’, ‘micro irrigation’ and irrigation through ‘sprinkler’. We are running Prime Minister’s Agriculture Irrigation Scheme. We have undertaken 90 such schemes worth thousands of crores of Rupees so that water could reach to fields; farmers can use that water in micro irrigation and the water should reach those parts of the country where there is no agriculture due to lack of water, we’re working in that direction.

Brothers and sisters,

We’ve launched Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme (PMFBY). Indian farmer is dependent on nature’s mercy. If there is extra rain or deficient rain either way our farmers are in trouble, they are in trouble if there is a hailstorm or storm, so such farmers must get protection. This is the first time that a Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme has become so popular among farmers. Those farmers who don’t borrow loans from banks are opting for crop insurance scheme. It has registered 700 per cent growth. It has become the favourite scheme of farmers. And the farmer will get enough funds for a year due to the insurance scheme if he suffers any kind of loss. We are working in the direction of implementing the scheme throughout the country so that farmers can face any difficulty with the help of crop insurance scheme.

Brothers and sisters,

There is a huge potential for organic farming in our country, particularly in North-East. And there is a special attraction and huge market for organic farming and organic products in the global market. While ordinary agro products are traded in rupees, organic products fetch dollars. I want Assam, North-Eastern states to adopt organic farming, and we have example of Sikkim. The entire Sikkim state is doing organic farming. If North-East adopts organic farming then it can become the largest organic farming region in the country, in the world. And if the global market wants to source any organic product then it will have to look at North East, will have to look at Assam, and will have to eat the food that carries the scent of Assam’s soil. I saw that possibility, that’s why, brothers and sisters, we have launched a mega programme for compost. Scores and scores of people are working in that direction to turn the ‘waste’ into ‘best’ to provide compost for organic farming. And the government is helping every farmer, to those who want to work in this direction. And it will improve the quality of our soil, improve our agriculture, boost production and help us in doubling our farmers’ income.

Brothers and sisters,

With agriculture, I also discuss a ‘New India’. So far we have been praising the first ‘Green Revolution’. We are now discussing the second ‘Green Revolution’. However, I can clearly see that in ‘New India’ we won’t have to stop at the second green Revolution. We will have to march forward in the direction of ‘ever green revolution’. Not just the second ‘green revolution’, but we need to develop our agriculture science in the direction of ‘ever green revolution’ – ‘all the time, green time’. And this research institution would help us in that. Which are the things that are related to agriculture in that direction? How to bring down the cost of farming? We have launched a mega programme of ‘solar pumps’; the cost of the pump that runs on solar energy is coming down gradually. This can be used by installing a solar panel in the field itself. It will bring down the cost of electricity. It will remove a huge burden on farmers. We’re working in that direction. A farmer can install a solar panel at the corner of his field and can produce enough electricity to meet his requirement. We’ve been encouraging him. Farmers can plant timber trees at the border of their fields. We’ve been importing timber to make furniture for our houses, if we encourage our farmers in that direction then we will not have to import timber. We can produce enough timber in our fields without compromising on agriculture. We want to support that. We want to emphasise on animal husbandry in agriculture sector. You must have heard of ‘white revolution’. But we’re still counted among those countries that have low per capita milk production. We should increase the productivity of our animals instead of increasing their numbers; we should have scientific animal husbandry, scientifically developed food for animals and scientific treatment for them. We want to take all these things forward by focussing on agriculture research. Farmers can supplement their income by simultaneously engaging in areas like fisheries, poultry, honey-bees alongside farming. We are trying to focus in that direction as well.

Brothers and sisters,

As my government has completed three years, today I want to announce a scheme for the country, especially in the direction of the agricultural revolution. The name of that scheme is ‘SAMPADA’. Our country has immense potential for value addition to increase the value of agro-products. The scheme will be implemented initially with an investment of Rs.6000 crores and later with public-private partnerships through Foreign Direct Investment. The full form of SAMPADA is ‘Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing And Development of Agro-Processing Clusters’. How to add value to agricultural yields? We sell mangoes but receive a meagre amount. But we can get higher return by processing the same mangoes into mango pickle. Similarly, we get a small amount from tomatoes. But tomato ketchup can earn more money for you. Likewise we produce fruits; but by processing them into fruit juices we can get higher value. In this manner the value of our country's agro products will increase thereby increasing the strength of our agro processing industry. As my government has turned three, on this occasion I welcome this scheme ‘SAMPADA’ which promises to change the fate of the farmers of our vast country by stressing on the importance of food processing industry and by introducing foreign direct investment from all over the world. It will ensure employment opportunities for the young generation in order to transform rural livelihood. Our government has decided to move forward to achieve this objective.

Brothers and sisters,

When we are moving forward in the direction of agricultural development, for our country’s ‘North East’ - the region of ‘Ashta-Lakshmi’ - the ‘panch-path’ or five paths have been prescribed for furthering the endeavour. Through these five paths, we wish to connect the entire North East with the country - with its future and to fulfil the hope and aspirations of the youth. The five paths which are basically related to the 21st century infrastructure are as follows: Highways- the first path; Railways, the second; Waterways, the third; Airways, the fourth and the fifth path is the Highway of Information Way - Optical Fibre Network. Through these five paths, the roots of modern infrastructure will have a stronghold in the North East and this Ashta Lakshmi region which was called North East till yesterday will be known as ‘New India’ and the ‘N-E’ will mean the New Economy; NE will mean New Energy; NE will mean New Empowerment. In a way, this will become an engine for growth for this ‘New India and a new engine for the North-East. With this confidence, I would like to convey my best wishes to my farmer brothers who have come in hundreds and thousands from each and every corner. And I firmly believe that this research institute will fulfil your dreams. Once again I congratulate Sarbananda ji, his entire team and the people of Assam for the successful journey of one year. And I hope that in the remaining four years, Assam will go ahead in its endeavour to fulfil the dreams of the people at a fast pace. And I assure the people of Assam that the central Government is always ready to lend a helping hand to change the fate of Assam. Assam has immense potential. This strength will not only change the fate of Assam but also change the destiny of India. It has to move forward with this feeling. I convey my very best wishes to you.

Thanks!

                आज अनेक वर्षों से आप जिसकी प्रतीक्षा कर रहे थे, वो दलोंग का निर्माण हो गया, लोकार्पण हो गया। मैं आप सबसे आग्रह करता हूं इस खुशी के समय आप अपना मोबाइल फोन बाहर निकालइये, अपने मोबाइल फोन का लाइटफ्लैश किजिए और सबको यह सिगनल दीजिए कि कितना बड़ा उत्‍सव मना रहे हैं आप लोग, हर कोई अपने मोबाइल फोन का फ्लैश चालू करें। शाबाश। हर कोई। चारों तरफ, हर कोई। लगना चाहिए कि कोई बड़ा उत्‍सव मना रहेहैं आप हर किसी की लाइट जलनी चाहिए। हां, वहां पीछे भी हो रहा है। वाह। देखिए कैसा उत्‍सव मनाया जा रहा है। ये सारे कैमरा वाले भी आप ही को ले रहे हैं। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद आप सबका। भाईयों-बहनों यह मेरा सौभाग्‍यहै कि मुझे आज उस स्‍थान पर आने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है, जो कभी कुंडिलनगर के रूप में जाना जाता था, और द्वारका के नाथ श्री कृष्‍ण यहां पधारे थे। मेरा जन्‍म गुजरात में हुआ, जहां पर द्वारिका जी हैं और श्री कृष्‍णभगवान का नाता कुंडिल नगर से रहा और आज यह मेरा सौभाग्‍य है कि उस विरासत पर आ करके पिछले पांच दशक से आप सब जिसकी प्रतीक्षा कर रहे थे, वह ब्रिज आज आपको प्राप्‍त हो रहा है। अगर अटल बिहारी वाजपेयीकी सरकार 2004 में दोबारा चुन करके आई होती तो यह ब्रिज आज से दस साल पहले आपको मिल गया होता। 29 मई, 2003 उस समय के हमारे विधायक जगदीश भोयन ने एक चिट्टी लिख करके इस ब्रिज के लिए आग्रह किया।और अटल जी की सरकार ने इसकी feasibility रिपोर्ट के लिए काम सुपर्द कर दिया  गया। गंभीरता से लिया गया। अगर उसके तुरंत बाद यह काम चला होता, तो आज से दस साल पहले आपको ब्रिज मिल गया होता। लेकिन बीचमें सरकार बदल गई, रूकावटें आई, होती है, चलती है, ऐसा ही चला और उसके परिणाम आपका सपना डगमगाता रहा, लेकिन पिछले तीन साल में अटल जी ने जो सपना देखा था, उसको पूरा करने के लिए लगातार प्रयास हुएऔर आज जब असम में भारतीय जनता पार्टी की सरकार को एक वर्ष पूर्ण हो रहा है। सर्बानंद जी के नेतृत्‍व में असम अनेक समस्‍याओं से मुक्‍त तो होता चला जा रहा है। ऐसे अवसर पर यह ब्रिज आपको समर्पित करते हुए नसिर्फ असम की जनता के लिए गर्व का विषय है, लेकिन यह पूरे हिंदुस्‍तान के लिए गर्व का विषय है कि इतना हिंदुस्‍तान का सबसे लम्‍बा ब्रिज आज असम के दूसरे छोर पर बन रहा है।

यह बात निश्चित है अगर विकास को स्‍थायी रूप देना है, स्‍थायी रूप से विकास को गति देनी है, तो infrastructure पहली आवश्‍यकता होती है। physically infrastructure, social infrastructure यह दो पटरी पर संतुलितविकास संभव होता है। अगर हम infrastructure का महत्‍वमय नहीं समझेंगे तो छुटमुट प्रयासों का परिणाम बहुत ही अल्‍पकालीन होता है, अस्‍थायी होता है और इसलिए हमारी सरकार का यह लगातार प्रयास है कि विकास कोस्‍थायी रूप दिया जाए, व्‍यवस्‍थाएं विकसित की जाए और जिसके कारण जिस सपने को ले करके देश आगे बढ़ाना चाहता है। उन सपनों को हम भलिभांति पूर्ण कर पाएं। अरूणाचल प्रदेश और असम को यह ब्रिज जोड़ दे रहा है, निकट ला रहा है। 165 किलोमीटर का अंतर कम होना व्‍यक्ति के जीवन के मूल्‍यावान 6-7 घंटे बच जाना और एक बार ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था खड़ी होती है तो आर्थिक विकास के भी नये द्वार खुल जाते हैं।

अब हमारा सदिया, वहां का अदरक, वहां के किसान जो ginger पैदा करते हैं। उत्‍तम कक्षा का ginger जहां पैदा होता है पूरी भूमि पर, अब यह ब्रिज बनने के बाद एक बहुत बड़े मार्केट के लिए इन किसानों के लिए नया रास्‍ता खुलजाएगा। उनकी कमाई में वृद्धि होगी। और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि north-east में सदिया जैसा क्षेत्र जहां ginger उच्‍च कोटि का अदरक माना जाता है। अगर यहां के किसान organic की तरफ चले गए तो यहां के ginger का ग्‍लोबलमार्केट खड़ा हो सकता है। दुनिया में उसका एक बड़ा मार्केट खड़ा हो सकता है। और इसलिए यह ब्रिज सिर्फ पैसे बचाएगा, समय बचाएगा ऐसा नहीं, लेकिन यह ब्रिज एक नई अर्धकांति का अधिष्‍ठान ले करके आता है। एक नईeconomical revolution का base बनने वाला है, और इसलिए आज के इस ब्रिज का लोकार्पण पूरे हिंदुस्‍तान के लोगों का इस पर ध्‍यान है कि भारत में इतना बड़ा निर्माण कार्य होता है किसी भी हिंदुस्‍तानी को एक गर्व देने वालाकाम है। भाईयों-बहनों दो राज्‍यों के विकास में यह ब्रिज कड़ी बन रहा है। अरूणाचल का विकास, असम का विकास और एक प्रकार से हमारा जो सपना है कि भारत को विकास की नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने में सबसे बड़ी ताकतप्राप्‍त करने की अगर कोई जगह हैं संभावना है तो वो पूर्वी हिंदुस्‍तान है। पूर्वोत्‍तर हिंदुस्‍तान है। ईस्‍टर्न इंडिया है, नॉर्थ ईस्‍ट भी है। और इसलिए हमने हमारे विकास की जो योजनाएं लागू की है, उन सबमें पूर्व हिंदुस्‍तान को बलदेना, north-east को व्‍यवस्‍थाएं देना, north-east के अंदर वो ताकत है अगर उनको थोड़ी सी भी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं मिल जाए तो बहुत बड़ा चमत्‍कार कर सकते हैं। और इसलिए हमने हमेशा इस बात पर बल दिया है कि विकास को नईऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने के लिए इसको प्रयास किया जाए।

प्रति दिन सिर्फ डीजल की बचत से इस इलाके के नागरिकों का रोजाना दस लाख रुपया बचने वाला है, इस ब्रिज के कारण। समय तो मूल्‍यावान है ही है, लेकिन डीजल की बचत से भी रोजाना 10 लाख रुपये की बच‍त सामान्‍यनागरिक के जेब में पैसे बचने वाले हैं। यह अपने आप में सामान्‍य मानव के जीवन में...पहले हम फैरी सर्विस से जाते थे, अगर मौसम ठीक नहीं रहा तो फैरी सर्विस बंद हो जाती थी। ब्रह्मपुत्रा रूठ गई हो फैरी सर्विस रूक जाती थी।अब यह ब्रिज के कारण 24/7, 365 days हमारे लिए व्‍यवस्‍था बन गई है और इसलिए प्राकृतिक प्रकोप से हमारी गति को कभी रूकावट नहीं आएगी। यह काम इसके द्वारा हुआ है। और इसके कारण इसके साथ-साथ जैसानितिन जी बता रहे थे कि देश में हम लोगों ने रास्‍तों का महत्‍व, पूल का महत्‍वमय, ब्रिजेज का महत्‍वमय, रेल का महत्‍वमय, हवाई यात्रा के महत्‍वमय अब उसके साथ-साथ water way को भी बल देने की दिशा में हम प्रयासकर रहे  हैं। बड़ा महत्‍वकांक्षी कार्यक्रम है कि जहां-जहां नदी है, पानी है क्‍यों न हमारे transportation को उस तरफ shift कर दिया जाए। enviornment freindly होगा, आर्थिक रूप से कम खर्चें वाला होगा और जो समय की बर्बादीहोती है, उससे भी बचाव होने वाला हो उस काम को भी इसी ब्रह्मपुत्रा के इसी छोर पर से बहुत तेज गति से आगे बढ़ाने की दिशा में हजारों करोड़ रुपयों की लागत से वो काम यहां हो रहा है और आने वाले दिनों में एक नया क्षेत्र जलपरिवहन का भी यही से आगे बढ़ने वाला है। तब जा करके आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं। यह पूरा क्षेत्र विकास की एक ऐसी नई ऊंचाईयों को पार करेगा इसका आप भलिभांति अंदाज कर सकते हैं।

भाईयों-बहनों,

यह खर्च जब हम कर रहे हैं तब पूरे north-east के विकास के लिए भी, चाहे बिजली के infrastructure की बात हो, चाहे optical fiber network के infrastructure की बात हो, चाहे road के infrastructure की बात हो, चाहे रेल केinfrastructure की बात हो, पूरे north-east को हिंदुस्‍तान के हर कौने से जोड़ना, हिंदुस्‍तान के हर कौने के लोगों को हमारे इस पूर्वोत्‍तर भातर के साथ जोड़ना उस दिशा में हम तेज गति से आगे चल रहे हैं। जो काम 15-15, 20-20 सालों में नहीं होते हैं। जो धन 15-15, 20-20 सालों में नहीं खर्च किया जाता है, हमारी सरकार ने आ करके उतनी बड़ी मात्रा में धन north-east के infrastructure और विकास के कामों के लिए खर्च करने की दिशा में हमने बल दियाहै।

Act East Policy के तहत अगर हम इस क्षेत्र को एक विश्‍वस्‍तरीय infrastructure के नमूने के रूप में तैयार करे तो पूरे south-east एशिया उसकी economy के केंद्र बिंदु में भारत का यह भू-भाग बहुत बड़ी अहम भूमिका अदा करसकता है। और इसलिए हम उस vision के साथ पूरे south-east एशिया के अंदर भारत किस प्रकार से जुड़े आर्थिक-व्‍यापारिक व्‍यवस्‍थाओं में हमारा यह क्षेत्र के साथ केंद्रवर्ती बने, एक economical activity का hub कैसे बने औरइसके लिए जिन-जिन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का विकास करना चाहिए उसी के तहत हम बल दे रहे हैं। और जिसके परिणाम आने वाले दिनों में आपको नजर आने वाले हैं।

भाईयों-बहनों,

रेलवे का महत्‍वमय आजादी के 50 सालों के बाद भी रेलवे को जितना महत्‍व देना चाहिए था  north-east में हमने उसको प्राथमिकता दी है, ताकि एक सुरक्षित यातायात की व्‍यवस्‍था हम निर्माण कर सके। north-east Tourism के लिए भी एक बहुत बड़ा केंद्र बन सकता है। यहां की प्रकृति मां कामाख्‍या के दर्शन करने हो या कोहिमा तक जाना हो यह ऐसा सुंदर प्रदेश है जिससे आज हिंदुस्‍तान के बहुत लोग अनभिज्ञ है। अगर देश से लाखों लोग हर सालइस भू-भाग पर आना शुरू कर दें तो यहां की economy को कितनी बड़ी ताकत मिल सकती है, जिसका हमें पूरा अंदाजा है और इसलिए इन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं के विकास के द्वारा हिंदुस्‍तान के कौने कौने से और धीरे-धीरे विश्‍वभर केलोगों को टूरिज्‍म की दृष्टि से आकर्षिक करने के लिए यह क्षेत्र एक बहुत बड़ी हमारी प्राकृतिक सम्पदा का हिस्‍सा है और उसको बल देने की दिशा में हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

भाईयों-बहनों,

आज जब मैं इस महत्‍वपूर्ण ब्रिज का लोकार्पण कर रहा हूं, तो आपके यहां इसको धौला, सदिया, दलंग के नाम से जानते हैं आप लोग। आज एक ऐसा अवसर है कि हमारी सरकार ने निर्णय किया है कि इस दलंग को अब से हमइसी धरती की संतान जिसकी आवाज़ ने हिंदुस्‍तान को आज भी प्रेरणा दी है और इसी धरती की संतान श्रीमान भूपेन हजारिका यह इस ब्रिज का नाम भारत सरकार ने भूपेन हजारिका के नाम से करने का तय किया है। इस धरतीकी संतान को यह हमारी उत्‍तम श्रद्धांजलि है आने वाली पीढि़यों को प्रेरणा देने वाला यह नाम, वो ब्रह्मपुत्र के सपूत थे, वे ब्रह्मपुत्र के उपासक थे उनकी हर बात में ब्रह्मपुत्र का गुणागान हुआ करता था। वो जिये भी ब्रह्मपुत्र कागुणगान करते हुए, वो जीवनभर ब्रह्मपुत्रा को देश और दुनिया में परिचित कराने का अद्भुत काम उस महापुरूष ने किया था, आज उसी महापुरूष के नाम पर इस सेतु का नाम भी, इस ब्रिज का नाम, इस दलंग का नाम भूपेनहजारिका के नाम से जोड़ने का हमने तय किया है। मैं फिर एक बार श्री मान सर्बानंद जी को उनकी पूरी टीम को असम की एक साल की सरकार को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। मैं संतोष प्रकट करता हूं कि एक साल में ऐसी-ऐसी कठिन बातों को उन्‍होंने स्‍पर्श किया है, हाथ लगाया है और रास्‍ते खोजने का प्रयास किया है। 

पहली बार सरकार बनी हो, पहली बार मुख्‍यमंत्री का दायित्‍व आया हो और 15 साल तक असम का जो हाल हुआ था। ऐसी परिस्थिति में से असम को बाहर निकालने के लिए जो मेहनत यहां की सरकार कर रही है। यहां केमुख्‍यमंत्री और उनकी टीम काम कर रही है, मैं उनको बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं और जिस गति से, जिस लगन से एक साल में काम करके दिखाया है, 5 साल के भीतर-भीतर तो असम इन सारी कठिनाईयों से बाहर निकलकररहेगा यह मैं अपना विश्‍वास प्रकट करता हूं। और भारत सरकार कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर A for असम, यह जो हमने सपना देखा था उसको पूरा करने के लिए कंधे से कंधा मिला करके काम करेंगे। इसी एक विश्‍वास के साथ मैंफिर एक बार आप सबका धन्‍यवाद करता हूं। भारत माता की जय।

                Finally the opportune day has arrived, and several years of your wait are over! Presenting to you the Dalong of your dreams! Today, as we come together to unveil the most awaited infrastructure,  I request you all to share your happiness with everyone by brandish the flashlights of your mobile phones to signal to the nation about this momentous occasion. All of you here must show your happiness by flaunting this achievement through the flash of your mobile phones. Wonderful!  Everyone-from all corners! Let’s see your gleam! Show us what a great celebration this is!

What a sight to behold! Superb! Dalong is glowing! Yes, there! The audience at the rear too! Indeed a fantastic occasion! You all are the showstoppers! All the cameras are vying to capture your jubilant faces! I am truly grateful to all of you! Dear ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege that I was ordained to be here today at such a pious place, the erstwhile Kundilnagar, which has been blessed by the visit of Dwarkadheesh Lord Shri Krishna himself.  I was born in Gujarat, which is home to the pilgrimage for Lord Krishna’s devotees- the Dwarika ji. Lord Krishna’s steps have blessed Dalong, and hence, I feel fortunate to visit this place of such historical legacy. Today, I feel elated to gift to you the bridge for which you all had been waiting for the last five decades. Had Shri Atal ji’s government been re-elected in 2004, I believe this bridge would have been serving you all since last 10 years for sure. Our MLA Shri Jagdish Bhoyan had requested for this game changing bridge on 29 May, 2003. Atal ji’s government was immediately entrusted with the task of preparing a feasibility report. It was taken up with fire fighting spirit. Had the work been initiated promptly then, this bridge would have seen the light of the day a decade back. Sadly then, an unwarranted change in the ruling government caused several hiccups in the planning of the project which abortively put a halt on your dream of having this bridge in Dalong. But, for the past three years, the current government is fully dedicated to actuate Atal Ji’s dreams of a developed nation. We left no stone unturned, and here we are today commissioning the Dhola-Sadiya Bridge to commemorate the first anniversary of BJP Government in Assam. Under the proactive leadership of Mr. Sarbanand Ji, it is heartening to see, that the state is getting rid of so many problems. On this occasion dedication of country’s longest bridge, which is built in the faraway north-eastern state of Assam, to the nation, is a moment of extreme pride and jubilation, not only for the people of Assam, but for the entire country.

It is an unwavering truth that for sustained and enduring development, right infrastructure is the prime catalyst. Physical and social infrastructure put together lead to a balanced growth. If we do not give optimum value to infrastructure, then the result of our random efforts will only be rendered trivial and will not lead to a lasting impact and growth. It is therefore pertinent that our government should plan development in a phased manner to maintain the momentum of growth. We are committed to creating an ecosystem which facilitates the fulfilment of the nations’ aspirations. This Dhola Sadiya Bridge has brought the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam closer by 165 kilometers. This amounts to an evincive saving of 6-7 hours of travel time by a native of these states.

No sooner than we have imagined, this high quality ginger produced at Sadiya will capture the larger markets. This bridge shall undoubtedly open up all the opportunities to the ginger farmers to enhance their revenues. I also envision that in the near future the high quality Sadiya variety of ginger is sure to become a brand to reckon with at the global market if the farmers here embrace organic farming methods. It has all the potential then to become one of the significant players in the world market. This bridge will not only save money and time of the farmers, but it will also open the golden gate towards economic revolution for these states. Such a commendable infrastructure development is the pride of every Indian, and all eyes are glued to see Sadiya becoming the base of economic stability for North-eastern states.

Dear brothers and sisters, This Bridge is fostering the development of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. The world is waiting to witness how North Eastern states of India have the potential to take the country to higher levels of development and growth. North East is India! Our government has laid a lot of emphasis on developing North East through its present schemes; such schemes which will strengthen all the north-eastern states and bring them into the mainstream by putting certain systems in place. Even a small infrastructure development can catapult these states to magical advancements. Such is the potential of our North East. The government, in all its forthcoming agenda of nation building, has directed its vision towards growth of the northeast to phenomenal heights.

Come to think of it! This bridge is fostering a gross saving of up to Rs. 10 lakhs daily for the citizens of this region by mere reduction in the diesel consumption. Surely, time is money but the reduced expenses on diesel mean more money in households. Earlier, we were commuting on ferries. Often due to fortuitous weather, the ferry services had to be discontinued. With Brahmaputra in deluge, of course ferry services are bound to be discontinued. But with the construction of this bridge we can now boast of having 24x7 and 365 days of uninterrupted transportation support notwithstanding any natural calamity. We are fortunate that this bridge has seen the light of the day to bind the eight states and make it a part of the mainstream. Nitinji rightly said that the construction of this bridge reinstates the importance of a robust transport infrastructure. Our government is now focussing on providing state of the art roadways, bridges, railways, air transportation along with preponderance on waterways.

Though it may seem a highly ambitious mission as of now, but it would certainly be pertinent to shift our focus towards expanding waterway networks to capitalise on natural resources like rivers of the regions. Also, at the same time this will provide a highly cost effective and time efficient sustainable green solution for the states. This region alongside the river Brahmaputra is developing with a great momentum due to the multi crores of investments in transport infrastructure. In the days to come, this region will boast of the most advanced waterways transport technology. One can only envisage the magnitude of development that north eastern states are prepared for.

Dear brothers and sisters,

Our government is making concerted efforts to bring the North Eastern states into the mainstream by investing massively in infrastructure development in all sectors; be it electricity, optical fiber network, roads or railways. We ensured the release of Priority funding from government coffers for expeditious implementation of socio-economic development projects which had been languorously left unutilised for almost two decades.

Under the visionary “Act East Policy”, if we are able to develop NER as a prototype of world class economic trade centre, it is anyone’s guess that this region of India has all the potential to play a pivotal role in driving the South East Asian economy. Therefore, we are keenly working on developing such facilities that will make India the hub for economic and business activities in South East Asia region. The nation will soon witness the results of the efforts made in this direction. 

Brothers and sisters,

The central government has realised the importance of the railway infrastructure development in NER which was due to this region for the last 50 years of independence. Right endeavours are being initiated by the government so as to provide these states with a secure transport system. A vibrant tourism industry can also contribute phenomenally to the revenue of these states. Very little is known to public about the surreal landscapes of north east which boasts of locales like the pristine temple of Mother Kamakhya or the ethereal vista of Kohima. The government conjectures strengthening of economy in the wake of escalating footfall of tourists from other parts of the country to this region. State tourism is bound to flourish due to the abundance of serene natural landscapes of NER. Coupled with advanced development of tourism infrastructure it will add to the wanderlust of national as well as international travellers.

Brothers and sisters,

On this auspicious day, when I commission this valuable bridge to the nation, it is known to you all as Dhola Sadiya, Dalong. On this august occasion, it gives me immense pleasure to convey to you that our government has decided to dedicate the bridge to the son of this soil whose sonorous voice has been inspiring us till today. It has been decided to rechristen this bridge after Shriman Bhupen Hazarika ji. What can be a more fitting tribute to the son of river Brahmaputra?  His life and times continue to be an inspiration to the future generations.

Throughout his lifetime this great soul, a venerator of Ganges of the East, dedicated all his melodies to Brahmaputra. His commendations brought this place on the international globe. This legendary name is synonymous with Dalong, hence we are declaring today that the Dhola Sadiya bridge shall henceforth be called as Bhupen Hazarika Setu. Once again I would like to heartily congratulate Shriman Sarbanand Ji and his team on the commendable efforts they have made for the advancement of the state of Assam in the first year itself.

I feel satisfied that in the maiden year alone, despite all adversities, the team has touched the right chord and identified the ailing pulse of the state. It’s a first for us on many fronts- a first time BJP government in the Assam state, a maiden stint of a Chief Minister posed with the challenge of setting right past 15 years of debacle! It is indeed heartening to see the measures taken by the CMs team to reinstate Assam to its past glory and richness. Going by the momentum of development that has been set in the first year, I repose full faith in the team and trust that Assam will be freed from years of privation within the next five years. I firmly believe in this and assure that the central government will support all advancements wholeheartedly.

The dream of “A for Assam” shall soon be a reality if we walk hand in hand towards development. With this credence I once again thank you all! Hail Mother India!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated India's longest bridge - the 9.15 km long Dhola-Sadiya bridge, over the River Brahmaputra, in Assam.  

This was his first engagement on the third anniversary of his swearing-in as Prime Minister. 

The bridge will enhance connectivity and greatly reduce travel time between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 

After unveiling a plaque to mark the inauguration, the Prime Minister travelled, and walked on the bridge for a few minutes.  

Later, addressing a public meeting at Dhola, the Prime Minister said that the inauguration of the bridge marks the end of a long wait for the people of this area.  

The Prime Minister said infrastructure is extremely important for development, and the effort of the Union Government is to fulfil the dreams and wishes of the people. He said this bridge enhances connectivity between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and opens the door for economic development, on a big scale.  

He said the eastern and north-eastern parts of the country have the greatest potential for economic development, and this bridge is just one element of the Union Government's vision in this regard.  

The Prime Minister said the bridge will bring about a positive change in the lives of the common people. He said the Union Government is placing great emphasis on the development of waterways as well.  

The Prime Minister said enhanced connectivity between the North-East and other parts of the country is a priority for the Union Government, and work has been greatly speeded up in this regard. He said that good connectivity in the North-East will also link the region with the economy of South-East Asia. 

The Prime Minister also spoke of the immense tourism potential of the North-East. He said the Union Government has decided to name the Dhola-Sadiya bridge after the great musician, lyricist and poet, Bhupen Hazarika.

Addressing the audience of doctors and students of Tata Memorial Centre via video conferencing, the Prime Minister hailed invaluable contribution of Tata family towards humanitarian services and social responsibilities, particularly in the field of cancer cure, care and research.

The Full text of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion is extended below –

श्री रतन टाटा जी,

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के डायरेक्टर डॉ. आर. ए. बडवे,

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के सभी चिकित्सकों, विद्यार्थियों व साथियों

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के प्लेटिनम जुबली के अवसर पर आप सभी लोगों को हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं।

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के 75 वर्ष पूरे होने पर Platinum Jubilee माइलस्टोन Book रिलीज करते हुएमुझे बहुत प्रसन्नता हो रही है।

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर को इस मुकाम पर पहुंचाने में टाटा परिवार का अनवरत सेवाभाव और सामाजिकजिम्मेदारी निभाने के उनके एहसास का अमूल्य योगदान रहा है।

आज इस संस्थान से इन 75 वर्षों में जुड़े रहे सभी लोगों को याद करने का अवसर है।

इस किताब के पन्ने पलटते हुए मुझे 1931 में हुए एक वाकये का पता चला। उस समय मेहरबाई टाटाजी ने कैंसर के इलाज के लिए अमेरिका जाते हुए अपने पति सर दोराबजी टाटा को ये कहा था कि- “मैं तो खुशकिस्मत हूं कि इलाज के लिए अमेरिका जा रही हूं लेकिन अपने देश के उन लाखों लोगोंका इलाज कैसे होगा जिनके पास इतने संसाधन नहीं है”।

मेहरबाई जी के निधन के बाद दोराबजी टाटा को ये बात याद रही और आगे यही टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटरका आधार बनी।

आज 75 वर्षों बाद ये संस्थान कैंसर के इलाज, कैंसर के इलाज के लिए पढ़ाई और कैंसर पर रिसर्चतीनों का प्रमुख केंद्र है।

देश में ऐसे बहुत कम संस्थान हैं जो इतने वर्षों से लगातार राष्ट्र सेवा में लगे हुए हैं। लाखों गरीबों के इलाज के लिए जिस तरह इस संस्थान ने आगे बढ़कर काम किया है, वो देश के बाकीअस्पतालों के लिए भी प्रेरणा है।

ये संस्थान इसका भी उदाहरण है कि सरकार और प्राइवेट संगठन मिलकर कैसे गरीबों की सेवा केलिए एक साथ काम कर सकते हैं।

कैंसर जैसी गंभीर बीमारियों का असर किसी भी परिवार के लिए अग्निपरीक्षा से गुजरने जैसा होता है।शरीर को कष्ट, मानसिक परेशानी और पैसे का सवाल – सभी इससे जुड़े हैं।

जब गरीब बीमार पढ़ता है तो सबसे पहले उसके सामने दवा से पहले रोटी तथा नौकरी का संकट आताहै।

इसलिए जब टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर जैसे संस्थान, उसमें काम करने वाले लोग गरीबों के इलाज के लिए दिन रात एक करते हैं, उनका इलाज करते हैं, उनकी पीड़ा कम करते हैं तो ये मानवता की बड़ी सेवा होती है।

मैं रतन टाटा जी, टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर और उससे जुड़े लोगों को एक बार फिर टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के 75 वर्ष पूरे होने पर बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।

साथियों, कैंसर मानवता के सामने उपस्थित बड़ी चुनौतियों में से एक है। अकेले हमारे देश में ही हरसाल 10 लाख से ज्यादा लोगों में कैंसर का पता चलता है। हर साल साढ़े 6 लाख लोगों की मौत कैंसरसे होती है।

International Agency for Research on Cancer ने अंदेशा जताया है कि अगले 20 वर्षों में येसंख्या दोगुनी हो जाएगी।

इस स्थिति में हर मरीज को इलाज की सुविधा उपलब्ध कराने के लिए अलग-अलग कैंसर हॉस्पिटलोंको एक प्लेटफॉर्म पर लाना आवश्यक है।

एक ऐसा प्लेटफॉर्म जहां पर कैंसर के मरीजों को सस्ता इलाज उपलब्ध कराने में मदद मिले और इलाजके दौरान आधुनिक तकनीक का इस्तेमाल किया जाए।

2014 में जब ये सरकार बनी तो कैंसर के 36 संस्थान Cancer ग्रिड से जुड़े हुए थे। अब आज की तारीख में उससे ठीक दोगुने संस्थान यानि 108 कैंसर सेंटर इस ग्रिड से जोड़े जा चुके हैं।

अभी कुछ दिन पहले ही Digital Cancer Nerve Centre की शुरूआत‍ की गई है। इसी तरह Virtual Tumor Board की मदद से कैंसर के अलग-अलग एक्‍सपर्टस को एक ही समय पर इंटरनेट से जोड़कर मरीज के इलाज की रूपरेखा तय करने में मदद दी जा रही है।

कैंसर के क्षेत्र में टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के अनुभव का, उसकी expertise का फायदा उठाते हुए, उसकी मदद से देश में चार और बड़े कैंसर संस्थानों की स्थापना की जा रही है।

ये कैंसर सेंटर वाराणसी, चंडीगढ़, विशाखापट्टनम और गुवाहाटी में बनेंगे। इससे इलाज के लिए लंबी दूरी तय करके अस्पताल तक पहुंचने वाले मरीजों को मदद मिलेगी।

इसके अलावा हरियाणा के झज्झर में नेशनल कैंसर इंस्टीट्यूट का भी निर्माण किया जा रहा है।

साथियों, सरकार का लक्ष्य है कि गरीब से गरीब व्यक्ति को सस्ते से सस्ता इलाज मिले और सारी सुविधाओं के साथ मिले।

इसी लक्ष्य को ध्यान में रखते हुए 15 वर्षों के बाद अब इस सरकार में एक नेशनल हेल्थ पॉलिसी बनाई गई है।

Preventive और Promotive Health Care System को सरकार जन-जन तक पहुंचाना चाहती है। सरकार का इरादा आने वाले वर्षों में GDP का 2.5 प्रतिशत तकस्वास्थ्य पर खर्च करने का है।

नई हेल्थ पॉलिसी में चिकित्सा की अलग-अलग पद्धतियों को कैसे integrate किया जाए, इस पर भी काम होगा। जैसे एलोपैथी के जरिए कैंसर के इलाज के समय मरीज कोजो दूसरी तकलीफें उठानी पड़ती हैं, उसमें आयुर्वेद और योग से बहुत मिल सकती है।

इस बारे में आपका संस्थान भी कोई पहल कर सकता है।

साथियों, आज भी देश में 70 प्रतिशत मेडिकल उपकरण विदेश से ही आते हैं। इस स्थिति को भी बदलना है और क्योंकि ये भी महंगे इलाज का बड़ा कारण हैं। इसलिए नईहेल्थ पॉलिसी के तहत सरकार मेडिकल उपकरणों के भारत में ही निर्माण को भी प्रोत्साहन दे रही है।

टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर जैसे संस्थानों की इसमें भी बड़ी भूमिका है।

आपके सेंटर के डॉक्टरों की मदद से ही भाभा एटोमिक रिसर्च सेंटर ने स्वदेशी रेडिएशन मशीन ""भाभाट्रोन"" का विकास किया।

मैं जब दो वर्ष पहले मंगोलिया गया था तो देश की तरफ से मंगोलिया को ""भाभाट्रोन"" उपहार में दिया था।

इसलिए सस्ती मशीनें, बेहतर मशीनें बनाने की दिशा में भी हमें मिलकर काम करना होगा।

देश भर में हेल्थकेयर सिस्टम को मजबूत करने के लिए सरकार नए एम्स (AIIMS) खोल रही है, मेडिकल कॉलेजों का आधुनिकीकरण किया जा रहा है, ग्रेजुएट और पोस्टग्रेजुअट स्तर पर सीटें बढ़ाई जा रही हैं।

गरीबों को सस्ती दवा के लिए भारतीय जनऔषधि परियोजना शुरू की गई है। 500 से ज्यादा दवाइयों को कम करके उन्हें essential दवाइयों की लिस्ट में रखा गया है।

आपने देखा है कि कैसे स्टंट की कीमत में भी 85 प्रतिशत तक की कमी आई है। ऐसे अनेक फैसले हैं जो affordable healthcare को ध्यान में रखते हुए सरकार ने लिए।

साथियों,

हेल्थकेयर से जुड़े लोगों को ध्यान रखना होगा कि स्वास्थ्य सेवा, सेवा ही रहे कमोडिटी ना बने। किसी बीमार का इलाज बिजनेस नहीं है, ये कभी नहीं भूलना चाहिए।

ये भी नहीं भूलना चाहिए कि किसी और प्रोफेशन के व्यक्ति को भगवान का दर्जा नहीं मिला है। देश के करोड़ों लोगों की आस्था आप में है और आप ही उनके लिए भगवान हैं।

आखिर में, मैं आप सभी को टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के 75 वर्ष पूरा होने पर फिर से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। आपने अपनी माइलस्टोन बुक के विमोचन का अवसर दिया, इसकेलिए आपका फिर से धन्यवाद।

जय हिंद !!!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi released the Platinum Jubilee Milestone book on Tata Memorial Centre, at his residence in New Delhi today.



Shri Ratan Tata, in his welcome address, thanked the Prime Minister for his support, cooperation and vision towards affordable healthcare and cancer research.

Addressing the audience of doctors and students of Tata Memorial Centre via video conferencing, the Prime Minister hailed invaluable contribution of Tata family towards humanitarian services and social responsibilities, particularly in the field of cancer cure, care and research.

The Full text of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion is extended below –

Mr. Ratan Tata, Dr. R. A. Badve, Director, TMC, the doctors, students and Friends!

On the occasion of the Platinum Jubilee of Tata Memorial Centre I extend my heartiest wishes to all of you.

On this momentous occasion, I feel extremely privileged to unveil the “Platinum Jubilee Milestone Book”. The Tata family has been making invaluable contribution towards social responsibility.

Today it is time to reminisce every person who contributed in the last 75 years to make TMC a name to reckon with in the field of cancer treatment.

While delving deep into the pages of this book, I learnt about an anecdote from the year 1931. Mrs. Meherbai Tata, at the time leaving for America for her cancer treatment had told her husband Mr. Dorabji Tata that- “I am fortunate to get expensive treatment at America, but what will happen to those people of our country who do not have the resources for cancer cure.”

After the demise of Mrs. Meherbai, Mr. Dorabjee kept this in mind, which inspired the foundation of this Tata Memorial Centre.

After 75 years of quality health care service, TMC has established itself as the pioneer in the field of Cancer education, research and cure.

There are very few such institutions which have established credibility by dedicating themselves to the service of the nation by providing affordable healthcare over several decades.

The awe inspiring journey of TMC, which has worked relentlessly to provide state-of-the-art facilities for the treatment of millions of poor, is an exemplar for the rest of the country.

This longstanding service to the nation by TMC is also a testimony to how the country can be a welfare state with Public Private Partnership.

A critical illness like Cancer poses serious challenges to the family and leaves them completely devastated physically, financially, and emotionally. It becomes even tougher for the deprived to deal with the grave situation as their basic needs like food and job takes precedence over getting medicine. Institutions like TMC, are providing commendable service to mankind by relentlessly reducing the trauma of the ailing by providing world class cancer treatment and healing within the means of the underprivileged.

Once again I extend hearty congratulations to Mr. Ratan Tata and his team at TMC on completing a very successful 75 years of service in the health care industry.

Friends, Cancer is one of the major challenges before humanity. Statistics glaringly say that, Cancer is detected in more than one million people every year in our country. Alarmingly, every year about 6 million people are known to succumb to the deadly disease cancer.

International Agency for Research on Cancer has apprehended that these numbers are slated to almost double up in the next two decades. To deal with this situation it is imperative that several organisations like TMC work on a common paradigm of providing state of the art affordable healthcare facility.

In 2014, when our government took charge at the Centre, we found that 36 institutions were a part of this grid. Today these are 108 in number.

Just a few days back, a Digital Cancer Nerve Centre has been established. Virtual Tumour Board is another effort in this field. This body is a virtual platform where specialists will be connected on VC and provide consultancy in developing the treatment plan for a patient.

It has been proposed to seek guidance from the expert team of TMC, to set up four new institutions dedicated to cancer cure and research in Varanasi, Chandigarh, Vishakhapatnam and Guwahati. These centres have been thoughtfully are located  in such cities where the patients will be saved from travelling to receive treatments in time. We are also establishing a National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar, Haryana.

Friends! Our government is ensuring, in every which way possible, to arrange affordable and world class health care facilities infrastructure for the underprivileged. With this mission in mind the, we have launched a healthcare policy after a lapse of 15 years. 

Government is making all efforts to bring every citizen in the purview of Preventive and Promotive Health Care System. We intend to invest up to 2.5 % of the GDP in the health care sector. We will also try to integrate variety of disciplines of medicine in the new National Health Policy. For example, we can integrate Ayurveda and Yogic treatment with the Allopathic drugs administered for cancer cure, to deal with other ailments that entail cancer. Every institution can take a step in this direction.

Friends, we still import 70% of our medical equipments. High time we took a call on this. This adds exponentially to the cost of the treatment. The New Health Policy has proposed an ecosystem which will give impetus to the manufacturing industry of medical instruments within the country. Institutions like TMC have a big role to play in this regard. It was due to the valuable contribution of TMC doctors that Bhabha Atomic Research Centre could manufacture indigenous radiation machine called “Bhabhatrone”. I was proud to gift to our own “Bhabhatrone” to Mongolia during my visit two years back. Such landmark achievements have already set the ball rolling for other players in the domain of production of cheap yet standard machines required in the medical field. 

To consolidate the health care system in the country, we are modernising the medical colleges, increasing the intake in the current seats in UG and PG medical education, as well as establishing several new AIIMS across the nation. Public Health Medicine Schemes has been strengthened, and several medicines are now listed as “Essential” drugs. You must have noticed how the cost of stents has now reduced by 85%. Several such decisions have been taken by the government in the direction of providing affordable healthcare.

Friends,

I implore the healthcare practitioners to ensure that the healthcare should remain the domain of service and not commodity. The treatment of an ailing should never be a business for any of us.

We must never forget that no other profession has been given the godly stature. Millions of citizens have faith in you and consider you no less that their God. India carries a tradition of veneration of doctors.

To conclude, I once again congratulate the TMC fraternity on accomplishing such a laudable milestone of   Diamond Jubilee year. I am very honoured to be invited for the unveiling of Milestone book on Tata Memorial Centre and be a part of this jubilation. 

I am indeed grateful to All!

Jai Hind!

                Your Excellencies the Presidents of Benin and Senegal Your Excellency the Vice President of Cote D’Ivoire 

President of the African Development Bank 

Secretary-General of the African Union 

Commissioner of the African Union Commission 

My Cabinet colleague Shri Arun Jaitley 

Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijay Rupani 

Distinguished guests and brothers and sisters from Africa 

Ladies and Gentlemen 

We are gathered today in the state of Gujarat. The Gujarati flair for business is well known. Gujaratis are also famous for their love of Africa! As an Indian and a Gujarati, I am very happy that this meeting is being held in India and that too in Gujarat. 

India has had strong ties with Africa for centuries. Historically, communities from western India, especially Gujarat, and the eastern coast of Africa have settled in each other's lands. The Siddhis of India are said to have come from East Africa. The Bohra communities in coastal Kenya date back to the twelfth century. Vasco da Gama is said to have reached Calicut with the help of a Gujarati sailor from Malindi. The dhows of Gujarat took merchandise in both directions. Ancient links between societies have also enriched our cultures. The rich Swahili language includes many Hindi words. 

During the colonial era, thirty-two thousand Indians came to Kenya to build the iconic Mombasa Uganda railway. Many lost their lives during its construction. Around six thousand of them stayed back and brought their families. Many of them started small businesses called ""dukas"" and came to be known as the ""dukkawalas"". During the colonial years, merchants, artisans and later officials, teachers, doctors and other professionals went to East and West Africa creating a vibrant community which combines the best of India and Africa. 

Mahatma Gandhi, another Gujarati, perfected his tools of non-violent struggle in South Africa. He also visited Tanzania in 1912 along with Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Several leaders of Indian origin supported strongly, and fought alongside, the leaders of Africa's struggles for independence, including Mr. Nyerere, Mr. Kenyatta, and Nelson Mandela. After the freedom struggle, several leaders of Indian origin were also appointed in the Cabinets of Tanzania and South Africa. There are at least six Tanzanians of Indian origin who are now serving as Members of Parliament in Tanzania. 

The trade union movement of East Africa was started by Makhan Singh. It was during the trade union meetings that the first call for Kenyan independence was sounded. M. A. Desai and Pio Gama Pinto participated actively in Kenya’s independence struggle. The then Prime Minister Pandit Nehru sent an Indian Member of Parliament Diwan Chaman Lall to be part of Mr. Kenyatta’s defence team, when the latter was imprisoned and tried during the Kapenguria trial in 1953. The defence team included two other persons of Indian origin. India was steadfast in its support for Africa’s freedom. Nelson Mandela said, and I quote, “India came to our aid when the rest of the world stood by or gave succour to our oppressors. When the doors of international Councils were closed to us, India opened the way. You took up our battles, as if they were your own.” 

Over decades, our ties have become stronger. After assuming office in 2014, I have made Africa a top priority for India’s foreign and economic policy. The year 2015 was a watershed. The third India Africa Summit held that year was attended by all fifty-four African countries having diplomatic relations with India. A record forty-one African countries participated at the level of Heads of State or Government. 

Since 2015, I have visited six African Countries, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Mauritius and Seychelles. Our President has visited three countries, Namibia, Ghana and Ivory Coast. The Vice-President visited seven countries, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria, Mali, Algeria, Rwanda and Uganda. I am proud to say that there is no country in Africa that has not been visited by an Indian Minister in the last three years. Friends, from a time when we mainly had mercantile and maritime links between Mombasa and Mumbai, we have today

• this Annual meeting which connects Abidjan and Ahmedabad 

• business links between Bamako and Bangalore 

• cricketing links between Chennai and Cape Town 

• development links between Delhi and Dakar. 

This brings me to our development cooperation. India’s partnership with Africa is based on a model of cooperation which is responsive to the needs of African countries. It is demand-driven and free of conditions. 

As one plank of this cooperation, India extends lines of credit through India’s Exim Bank. 152 credits have been extended to 44 countries for a total amount of nearly 8 billion dollars. 

During the Third India-Africa Forum Summit, India offered 10 billion dollars for development projects over the next five years. We also offered grant assistance of 600 million dollars. 

India is proud of its educational and technical ties with Africa. Thirteen current or former Presidents, Prime Ministers and Vice Presidents in Africa have attended educational or training institutions in India. Six current or former chiefs of armed forces in Africa trained in India’s military institutions. Two current Ministers of the Interior have attended Indian institutions. Under the popular India Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme, more than thirty three thousand scholarships have been offered to officials from African countries since 2007. 

One of our best partnerships in the area of skills is the training of “solar mamas”. Every year eighty African women are trained in India to work on solar panels and circuits. After their training they go back and literally electrify their communities. Each woman is responsible for electrifying 50 houses in her community on return. A necessary condition for the women to be selected is that they be illiterate or semi-literate. They also learn several other skills, like basket making, bee keeping, and kitchen gardening during their stay. 

We have successfully completed the Pan Africa e-network project for tele-medicine and tele-network covering 48 African countries. Five leading universities in India offered certificate, under graduate and post graduate programmes. Twelve super-speciality hospitals offered consultations and Continuous Medical Education. Around seven thousand students have concluded their studies. We will soon launch the next phase. 

We will soon successfully complete the Cotton Technical Assistance Programme for African Countries launched in 2012. The project was implemented in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda. 

Friends, 

Africa-India trade has multiplied in the last fifteen years. It has doubled in the last five years to reach nearly seventy-two billion US dollars in 2014-15. India’s commodity trade with Africa in 2015-16 was higher than our commodity trade with the United States of America. 

India is also working with United States and Japan to support development in Africa. I gladly recall my detailed conversation with Prime Minister Abe during my visit to Tokyo. We discussed our commitment for enhancing growth prospects for all. In our joint declaration, we mentioned an Asia Africa Growth Corridor and proposed further conversations with our brothers and sisters from Africa. 

Indian and Japanese research institutions have come up with a Vision Document. I congratulate RIS, ERIA and IDE-JETRO for their efforts in putting it together. This was done in consultation with think tanks from Africa. I understand the Vision Document would be presented at the Board meeting later. The idea is that India and Japan, with other willing partners, would explore joint initiatives in skills, health, infrastructure, manufacturing and connectivity. 

Our partnership is not confined to Governments alone. India’s private sector is at the forefront of driving this impetus. From 1996 to 2016, Africa accounted for nearly one-fifth of Indian overseas direct investments. India is the fifth largest country investing in the continent, with investments over the past twenty years amounting to fifty four billion dollars, creating jobs for Africans. 

We are encouraged by the response of African countries to the International Solar Alliance initiative, which was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. The Alliance is conceived as a coalition of countries rich in solar resources, to address their special energy needs. I am happy to note that many African countries have extended their support to this initiative. 

As a founder of the New Development Bank, popularly called the “BRICS bank”, India has consistently supported establishment of a Regional Centre in South Africa. This will provide a platform to promote collaboration between NDB and other development partners including the African Development Bank. 

India joined the African Development Fund in 1982 and the African Development Bank in 1983. India has contributed to all of the Bank’s General Capital Increases. For the most recent African Development Fund replenishment, India pledged twenty nine million dollars. We have contributed to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiatives.

On the sidelines of these Meetings, the Government of India is organising a Conference and Dialogue in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry. There is also an exhibition in association with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The focus areas range from Agriculture to Innovation and start-ups and other themes. 

The theme of this event is “Transforming Agriculture for wealth creation in Africa”. This is an area where India and the Bank can fruitfully join hands. I have already mentioned the Cotton Technical Assistance Programme. 

Here in India, I have launched an initiative to double farmers’ incomes by 2022. It will require concerted steps, ranging from improved seeds and optimal inputs, to reduced crop losses and better marketing infrastructure. India is keen to learn from your experiences as we proceed on this initiative. 

My African brothers and sisters, 

Many of the challenges we face are the same: uplifting our farmers and the poor, empowering women, ensuring our rural communities have access to finance, building infrastructure. We have to do these within financial constraints. We have to maintain macro-economic stability so that inflation is controlled and our balance of payments is stable. There is much for us to gain by sharing our experiences on all these fronts. For example, in our push to a less-cash economy, we have learnt from the great strides that African countries like Kenya have made in the area of mobile banking. 

I am happy to share that India has, in the last three years, improved on all macro-economic indicators. The fiscal deficit, balance of payments deficit, and inflation are down. The GDP growth rate, foreign exchange reserves and public capital investment are up. At the same time, we have made big strides in development. 

Mr. President of the African Development Bank, it is reported that you have described our recent steps as text book chapters for other developing nations and called us a development beacon. While thanking you for these kind words, I am also glad to know that you have spent quite some time training in Hyderabad earlier. However, I must say that I remain focused on the many challenges ahead. In that context, I thought I could share with you some of the strategies we have used in the last 3 years. 

By paying subsidies directly to the poor rather than indirectly through price concessions, we have achieved large fiscal savings. In cooking gas alone we have saved over 4 billion dollars in three years. In addition, I appealed to well-off citizens to voluntarily give up their gas subsidy. Under the ‘Give it up’ campaign, we promised the saving would be used to provide a connection to a poor family. You will be surprised to know that over 10 million Indians volunteered to do so. Thanks to the savings, we have launched a programme to provide gas connections to 50 million poor families. More than 15 million connections have already been provided. This transforms the lives of rural women. It frees them from the health hazards of cooking with firewood. It also protects the environment and reduces pollution. This is an example of what I call ‘reform to transform’: a concerted set of actions which transform lives. 

Some of the subsidised urea fertiliser intended for farmers used to get illegally diverted to non-agricultural uses, like production of chemicals. We introduced universal neem-coating of urea. This makes the fertiliser unsuitable for diversion. Not only have we got substantial financial savings but in addition, studies have shown that neem coating has improved the effectiveness of the fertiliser. 

We are also providing our farmers with soil health cards which tell them the exact nature of their soil, and advise on the best mix of inputs. This promotes optimal use of inputs, and increases crop yield. 

We have made unprecedented increases in capital investment in infrastructure, covering railways, highways, power, and gas pipelines. By next year, no village in India will be without electricity. Our Clean Ganga, Renewable Energy, Digital India, Smart Cities, Housing for All and Skill India missions are preparing us for a cleaner, more prosperous, faster growing and modern new India. Our aim is that India must be an engine of growth as well as an example in climate friendly development in the years to come. 

There are two crucial factors which have helped us. The first set of changes is in the banking system. In the last 3 years, we have achieved universal banking. We launched the Jan Dhan Yojana or People’s Money campaign under which over two hundred and eighty million bank accounts have been opened for the poor in urban and rural areas. Thanks to that initiative, virtually every Indian family has a bank account. Normally banks are associated with helping businesses and the rich. We have enlisted them for helping the poor in their quest for development. We have strengthened our state-owned banks by freeing them from political decisions and appointing professional chief executives on merit through a transparent selection process. 

Our universal biometric identification system called Aadhaar has been the second crucial element. It prevents claiming of benefits by those who are not eligible. It enables us to ensure that those who deserve government aid receive it with ease, while excluding non-genuine claims. 

Friends, let me conclude by wishing you a very successful and productive annual meeting. In the sports arena, India cannot compete with Africa in long distance running. But I can assure you that India will always stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, supporting you in the long and difficult race for a better future. 

Excellencies! Ladies and Gentlemen! I now have great pleasure in officially declaring the Annual Meetings of the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group open. 

Thank you!

                उपस्थित भाइयों और बहनों, 

कंडला एक प्रकार से लघु भारत है, Mini-India और आज Airport से कंडला Port तक आने के रास्ते भर आप सबने जिस प्रकार से स्वागत सम्मान किया, एक प्रकार से आपने सड़क के दोनों किनारों पर आबे-हू भारत खड़ा कर दिया था। मैं आपके इस प्यार के इस स्वागत सम्मान के लिये आपका बहुत बहुत आभारी हूं। 

ये शब्दों में कहने की जरूरत नहीं है कि कच्छ के साथ एक मुख्यमंत्री के कार्यकाल के दरमियान मेरा लगाव कैसा था, बार-बार आपके बीच आना होता था। कच्छ की धरती में एक ताकत है। 200 साल पहले भी अगर कोई कच्छी दुनिया के किसी छोर पर गया होगा परिवार, चौथी पांचवी पीड़ी होगी, लेकिन अगर बीमान हो जाए तो उसका मन करता है की कच्छ चले जाएं, तबियत ठीक हो जाएगी। हम कच्छ के लोग पानीदार तो हैं, पर बिना पानी के जीवन गुजारते रहे। पानी का महात्मय क्या होता है। ये कच्छ के लोग भालि-भांती समझते हैं। विराट समंदर, मरुभूमि, पहाड़, गौरवपूर्ण इतिहास, 5000 साल पुरानी मावन संस्कृति के सबूत, कच्छ के पास क्या कुछ नहीं है! न सिर्फ हिन्दुस्तान को दुनिया को देने की ताकत इस धरती में है और दुनिया को magnet की तरह आकर्षित करने का सामर्थ इस धरती में है। 

अभी नितिन जी बता रहे थे कि आज जो वैश्विक अर्थव्यवस्था का रूप है, विश्व बाजार का महात्मय जिस प्रकार से बढ़ रहा है उस Competition अगर भारत को हमें आगे बढ़ाना है, तो इस वैश्विक अर्थव्यवस्था का लाभ उठाना है। विश्व व्यापार में भारत को अपनी जगह पक्की करनी है तो भारत के पास उत्तम से उत्तम व्यवस्था वाले बंदरों (बंदरगाहों) का होना बहुत जरूरी है। ये कंडला Port और आज जो चीजें वहां निर्माण हो रही हैं, एक प्रकार से कोई सोच सकता है क्या इतने कम समय में आज कंडला Port पूरे एशिया में प्रमुख बंदरों (बंदरगाहों) में उसने अपनी जगह बना ली। 

पिछले एक दो साल में चाहे Liquid Cargo हो, चाहे Dry Cargo हो, Port Sector में काम करने वाले हर कोई समझते हैं कि इसका जो Growth है वो Port Sector के अर्थनीति के जानने वाले लोगों के लिये बड़ा ही Surprise कर रहा है। ये Achievement किया है। और धीरे – धीरे Port पर काम करने वाले लोगों को भी लगने लगा है। Union चलते हैं चलते रहेंगे। लेकिन मिलजुल कर के अगर हम इस Port की ताकत को बढ़ाते हैं। एक ताकत है Infrastructure की दूसरी ताकत है Efficiency की, Transparency की और उससे इतना बड़ा परिणाम देश को मिल सकता है, जिसकी हम कल्पना नहीं कर सकते। 

अभी नितिन जी बता रहे थे कि ईरान के साथ चाहबहार Port उसका एक निर्णय हम लोगों ने किया है। उस पोर्ट का सीधा संबंध कंडला के Port के साथ आने वाला है। चाहबहार Port और कंडला Port इन दोनों का जुड़ना, इसका मतलब ये होता है कि विश्व व्यापार में अंगद की तरह कंडला अपना पैर जमाएगा, इतना बड़ा परिवर्तन आने वाला है। आज कंडला Port को Mechanise करने की दिशा में कुछ कदम उठाए जा रहे हैं। Capacity Building के लिये 14 और 16 वर्ग के विस्तार और विकास के लिये योजना बन रही है। और बदलते हुए युग में Port City का Concept, Development का एक Economic Activity का एक व्यवस्था उस दिशा में भी योजना बन रही है। Transportation को बल मिले और इसलिये उस प्रकार के मार्ग की रचना जो Traffic को Smooth करे हिन्दुस्तान के कोने कोने में हमारा सामान तेजी से पहुंचे। जिस प्रकार से समंदर में Turn Around Time कोई जहाज आए खाली हो या भरे और कितने दिन में आ के चला जाए उसमे जितना समय कम लगता है उतनी Efficiency की गणना वैश्विक स्तर पर होती है। आज भारत में उस Turn Around Time कम करने के लिये हमारे नितिन जी के नेतृत्व में अनेक Initiatives लिये गए। इस Turn Around Time को कम करने में एक वर्गता होती है- पोर्ट से बाहर निकलने के बाद आपके सारे ट्रक्स कितनी तेजी से आगे बढ़ जाते हैं। अगर आगे बोटल लेट होगा तो Turn Around Time के लिये पोर्ट में कितनी ही टैक्नॉलॉजी हम लाएं रुकावट बनी रहेगी। और इसलिये आपने देखा होगा कि आज कंडला पूरे गुजरात के हिसाब से देखें तो भी एक कोने में एक छोटा सा नगर। देश के हिसाब से तो ध्यान भी नहीं जाए। लेकिन आज कंडला में करीब करीब 1000 करोड़ रुपयों के Investment के Project आ रहे हैं। 1000 करोड़ कोई सामान्य रकम नहीं है। हम कल्पना कर सकते हैं कि कितनी तेजी से आगे बढ़े हैं। 

अभी वो बता रहे थे कि रोड का काम है हम दो साल में टारगेट किया है। मैं नितिन जी को बता रहा था कि हिन्दुस्तान में रोड के सैक्टर में नितिन जी ने जो गति लाई है, कई वर्षों तक हिन्दुस्तान ने देखी नहीं। मैंने उनको कहा कि आपकी जो विशेषता है, आपकी जो क्षमता है उसका लाभ गुजरात को भी तो मिलना चाहिए। उन्होंने मुझे कहा कि भाई क्या करना है? ये रोड बनाने का काम 24 महीने नहीं 18 महीने में पूरा करके दिखाओ। और मुझे विश्वास है कि नितिन जी को इशारों इशारों में कह दे तो उस काम को पूरा कर देंगे। मुझे विश्वास है हो जाएगा। 

आज यहां बाबा साहब आम्बेडकर के नाम से एक Convention Centre भी बन रहा है। विशाल भू भाग में बन रहा है। यहां के लोगों की आवश्यकता के अनुसार बन रहा है। लेकिन मैंने उसका जो plan देखा तो मुझे लगता है शायद रवि भाई ने डरते – डरते बनाया है। उनको लगता है पता नहीं इतने पैसे कहां से आएंगे। कैसे होगा। तो मैंने नितिन जी को कहा है कि अच्छा छोटा मत करो, उसे कुछ नये सिरे से सोचो उन्होंने कहा कि मुझे थोड़ा समय दीजिये मैं सोचकर के बताता हूं। ये Convention Centre भी क्योंकि जिस प्रकार से कच्छ का Development हो रहा है, आज हिन्दुस्तान में कोई एक district तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रहा है तो उस district का नाम कच्छ है। और कोई कल्पना कर सकता है 1998 में भंयकर Cyclone ने हमको तबाह कर दिया था। 2001 भूकम्प ने हमें जमीनदोज़ कर दिया था। लेकिन ये district की ताकत देखिए, यहां के लोगों की खुमारी देखिए आज कच्छ फिर से चल पड़ा। और कांडला ये न सिर्फ गुजरात की अर्थव्यवस्था का केन्द्र बिन्दू बन सकता है, यातायात की दुनिया में कंडला पोर्ट हिन्दुस्तान की अर्थव्यवस्था में भी एक अहम भूमिका निभा सके, इस परिस्थिति में काम कर सकता है। और हम भी उस दिशा में उसे आगे बढ़ाना चाहते हैं। भारत की सामुद्रिक व्यापार विरासत हजारों साल पूरानी है। लोथल में 5000 साल पहले सामुद्रिक व्यापार का इतना बड़ा केन्द्र था। उसके बगल में बल्लभी University थी। उस बल्लभी University में 80 से ज्यादा देशों के बच्चे पढ़ते थे। और लोथल का जो पोर्ट था, बंदर था कहते हैं कि 84 देशों के झंडे वहां हमेशा दिखाई देते थे। हजारों साल पहले! इस देश में दरियाई जहाज बनाने का काम कच्छ में हमारी पूर्वजों की विरासत रही है, हम दुनिया को जहाज देते थे यहाँ से। ये ताकत रही थी हमारी। इस सामर्थय को फिर से जीवित किया जा सकता है। 

आज कंडला पोर्ट में इमारती लकड़ी बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में आती है। और हमारे कच्छी लोग हिन्दुस्तान के कोने कोने में लकड़ी के व्यापार में लगे हुए हैं। ये इमारती लकड़ी का Value addition कच्छ की धरती पर हो सकता है। दुनिया से लकड़ी आ जाये उसमें Art Work हो Man Made कला उसपर लगे फिर दुनिया में वापस जाये घर बने, बिल्डिंग बने, मकान बने, मंदिर बने, पूजा घर बने दुनिया को बहुत बड़ी भेंट सौगात यहां से Develop की जा सकती है। नमक का व्यापार समुद्री मार्ग से जितना ज्यादा हम कर सके उतना खर्च कम आएगा। तटीय जल परिवहन साढ़े सात हजार किलोमीटर समुद्री तट हो, तो फिर हमें रोड और रेल से हमारा सामान क्यूं लेजाना चाहिए। क्यों न समुद्री तट से एक जहाज से हिन्दुस्तान में ही कलकत्ता सामान भेजना होगा। तो यहीं से समुद्र के मार्ग से कलकत्ता क्यों न जाए। पूरे हिन्दुस्तान को चीर कर के जाने की जरूरत क्या है। ये पूरा बदलाव, व्यवस्था में परिवर्तन लाने की दिशा में हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। जिसका लाभ आने वाले दिनों में मिलने वाला है। 

हमारे नितिन जी का एक Dream है, लोथल में भारत की जो महान ताकत है उसका विश्व को परिचय हो। इस प्रकार का एक Museum कैसे बने। विश्व व्यापार के दृष्टि से American University का काम महत्वपूर्ण है Human Resource Development का काम महत्वपूर्ण है। और अभी मुख्यमंत्री जी बता रहे थे, उन्होंने Maritime University का अभी वहां एसेम्बली के अंदर बिल भी पास कर लिया है। मेरी उनको शुभकामनाएं हैं। Human Resource Development का ये काम और न सिर्फ गुजरात को समुद्री तट का लाभ होगा और हिन्दुस्तान के व्यापार के लिये भी एक ताकत के रूप में उभरेगा ऐसा मेरा विश्वास है। 

भाइयों बहनों, 2022 भारत की आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं। मैं आज जब कांडला की धरती पर आया हूं, कंडला के लोगों को कच्छ के लोगों को गुजरात के लोगों देश के लोगों को बार बार यह कहना चाहूंगा के 2022 आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं, हम देश के उन वीर सपूतों को याद करें उन महापुरुषों को याद करें जिन्होंने आजादी के लिये अपनी जिन्दगी खपा दी। कई महापुरुषों ने जेलों में खपा दी कई महापुरुषों ने फांसी के तख्त पर चढ़ गए। कई महापुरुषों ने चार चार पीढ़ी तबाह कर दी, ये देश आजाद हो इसलिये। उस आजादी के 75 साल 2022 में हम कैसे मनाएंगे? एक नागरिक के नाते हम भी तो संकल्प करें कि हमें आजादी के जंग में लड़ने का मौका नहीं मिला था लेकिन भारत को दुनिया में सिरमौर बनाने में इस विकास कि यात्रा में शरीक होने का हमें सौभाग्य मिला है, हम भी कुछ सकारात्मक करेंगे। हम कुछ न कुछ ऐसा करेंगे नागरिक के नाते 2022 में देश को नई ऊंचाई पर लेजाने में मेरा योगदान माना जाए, मेरा संतोष हो। संस्था हो तो वो भी करे, केन्द्र हो तो वो भी करे, नगरपालिका हो तो वो भी करे, पंचायत हो वो भी करे, राज्य सरकार है तो वो भी करे, हर कोई अपने आप को संकल्पबद्ध करे। और अभी पांच साल हमारे पास है, पांच साल में कुछ कर के दिखाए। और तब जा कर के 2022 को मनाएं इस संकल्प के साथ हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं जैसा हमने सोचा है। 

इस देश के गरीबों की जिन्दगी में बदलाव लाना। चाहे गैस के चूल्हे का कनेक्शन हो, चाहे गरीब की झोपड़ी में बिजली पहुंचाने का प्रयास हो। 2022 तक हमारा सपना है, हिन्दुस्तान के गरीब से गरीब परिवार को भी रहने के लिये अपना खुद का घर हो। और घर में बिजली भी हो, घर में पानी भी हो और घर में शौचालय भी हो, ऐसा घर उसको मिले ये बहुत बड़ा सपना लेकर के काम चलाना है। 

ये वर्ष पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी की शताब्दि का वर्ष है। भारत के गरीब से गरीब व्यक्ति अंतिम छोर पर बैठे हुए व्यक्ति का कल्याण कैसे हो। इस विचार को केन्द्र में रखते हुए। उन्होंने देश को एक चिंतन दिया था। आज देश पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय की जन्मशती बना रहा है। तो मैं कंडला पोर्ट ट्रस्ट को, नितिन जी को, उनके विभाग को एक सुझाव देना चाहता हूं कि क्यों न हम ये कंडला पोर्ट है, उसको पंडित दीनदयाल ट्रस्ट पोर्ट कंडला, विधिवत रूप से उसकी प्रक्रिया करें, निर्णय करें और पंडित दीनदयाल ट्रस्ट पोर्ट कंडला के रूप में, क्योंकि गरीबों के लिये काम करना है, दीनदयाल गरीबों के पहचान करता है मेरे देश में। जो दीन-दयालु हैं, वो भाव हमारे सामने रहेगा, तो हमारे अंदर समाज के दबे कुचले, शोषित, पीड़ित वंचित, उनकी जिंदगी में बदलाव लाने के लिये काम कर सकते हैं। 

मैं फिर एक बार कच्छ की धरती में फिर एक बार मुझे आपके सामने आने का अवसर मिला। आप सब इतनी बड़ी मात्रा में आकर के आशीर्वाद दिये। इसके लिये आभारी हूं। नितिन जी का आभारी हूं। इस कार्यक्रम में मुझे शरीक होने का सौभाग्य मिला। बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद।

                Brothers and sisters,

 

Kandla can be perceived as a mini-India and today the way you all welcomed me all the way from the Airport to Kandla port, I feel extremely honoured and grateful to you all for this gesture.

 

My attachment with Kutch as a former Chief Minister need not be articulated into words; time and again I had to visit this place. There is some sort of a power in the soil of Kutch. Even if a person leaves kutch to live in some other corner of the world, and even if he is the fourth or fifth generation of a family; when he falls ill he would still think of returning to kutch in the hope that he would recover there.We, the people of kutch have water resources but we have learnt to live without it. The people of kutch understand the importance of water very well. Kutch possesses everything – the vast sea, desert, mountains, a glorious history of 5000 year old culture. Kutch has the power to open up its vast resources not only to India but also to the entire world, thus having an ability to attract the world like a magnet.

 

Just now, Nitinji was telling us that today the way the global market and economy is growing, we ought to take advantage of that competitive environment if India is to move ahead. If India wants to make its place in the world trade, then it is imperative for us to have the best quality ports. Can anyone imagine how Kandla Port with the things that are being manufactured here has made its place among the major ports of Asia in such  a short span of time?

 

In the last two years, be it Liquid Cargo or Dry Cargo, everyone working in the Port Sector have realised that the growth of this sector is surprising for the people who know the economics of the Port Sector. This is a great achievement. And gradually people who work in the port sector, have started realising that workers’ union will keep moving. But if we strive together to develop and strengthen this port - one strength is that of infrastructure, the second being that of the efficiency, and of transparency - then the country can achieve unbelievable results. 

 

Right now, Nitin ji was telling us that we have taken a decision to develop Iran’s Chabahar Port. Chabahar port will be directly linked with the Kandla port. The linking will mean Kandla will put its best foot forward  like Angad  in the world trade which promises to bring in a sea change. Today some steps are being taken to mechanize Kandla Port. Plans are being made for expansion and development of 14 and 16 classes for capacity Building. And in the changing era, plans are underway for Port City's concept and each and every economic activity for development.  This way our transport infrastructure would get impetus and the traffic system will be smooth so that our goods reach rapidly in every corner of the country. The ‘Turnaround Time’ in the sea is calculated on a global scale. That means, the efficiency of the port is calculated on the basis of the time spent by a vessel – empty or loaded,   at the port and how many days it takes to come and go. The less time it takes, the more it is efficient.  Today, many Initiatives have been taken under the leadership of our Nitin ji to reduce that ‘Turnaround Time’ in India. There is another classification in reducing the Turnaround Time - how fast all your trucks move after you exit the port. If there is a bottleneck on the road and the trucks are delayed; then howsoever technologies we may apply for reducing the Turnaround Time in the port, the hurdle will continue. Hence Kandla may be a small town within Gujarat and even smaller within India, but today about Rs 1000 crore investment projects are being made here. 1000 crore is not a miniscule amount. Just think how fast we are inching forward.

 

He was just telling me that we have set the target for the road-project for 2 years. I was telling Nitin ji that India has never before witnessed such a rapid progress in the road sector which has been brought out by Nitin ji. I told him that Gujaratis should also get the benefit of your talent. He asked me,  “what is to be done?”  I said, “complete this work in 18 months instead of 24 months”. And I believe that Nitin ji will definitely get that work done.

 

 A Convention Center is also being established here covering a vast area, which will be named after Babasaheb Ambedkar. It is being established as per the requirement of the people. But on seeing the plan I felt that Ravi has made it hesitatingly thinking about how the project would get funds? How the job will get accomplished? So I told Nitin ji to think of some innovative ideas. He asked for some time. Kutch is one of the rapidly growing districts of India. Could anyone imagine that Kutch is the very district that was destroyed by the 1998 cyclone; the 2001 earthquake shattered it. But see the strength of this district and its people. Today Kutch has started off to the path of progress. And Kandla can not only be the focal point of Gujarat's economy but can also play a significant role in driving India’s economy through the transport sector. We too want to move in that very direction. India's maritime trade legacy is thousands of years old. 5000 years ago, Lothal was such a great centre of maritime trade. There was Vallabhi University near it. Students from more than 80 countries used to study at Vallabhi University.  People could see the flags of more than 84 countries in the Port of Lothal. Thousands of years ago in Kutch, the art of ship-building in the country has been the legacy of our ancestors. We used to provide ships to the world from here. It was our strength. This strength can be restored again.

 

Today, timber comes in a very large quantity at Kandla Port. And our brothers from Kutch are engaged in the timber trade in every corner of India. Kutch can provide value addition to this timber. We can add value to the wood that is being sent to other countries by adding art work on the wood. This wood can be exported throughout the world where it can be used for constructing buildings, temples etc.  This can be a huge gift to the world. The more we trade in salt via sea route, the lesser will be the cost. India has a coastline of 7500 kilometres and water transport system; then why should we need to carry our goods via roads and railways? Why not send the goods from here to Kolkata via sea route instead of cutting across the land of whole of India? We are moving towards this change and bringing about this transformation in the whole system which shall soon bear the fruits in the near future.

 

Our Nitin ji talks of a vision to demonstrate the great power of India possessed by Lothal to the outside world. How to create such a museum? American University's work is important in terms of world trade; the work in Human Resource Development is significant.  The Chief Minister was saying that the Maritime University bill has been passed in the assembly recently. My good wishes are with him in this venture. I strongly believe that this work of Human Resource Development will not only benefit Gujarat and the coastal areas but will also emerge as a strong force for proliferating trade in India.

 

Brothers and sisters, in the year 2022 we will be celebrating 75 years of India's independence. Today, as I have come to Kandla,  I want to appeal to the people of Kandla, to the people of Kutch, to the people of Gujarat and to the people of this country, as we will enter 75th  year of independence in 2022, let us not forget those brave sons of the country, those great men who laid down their lives for freedom. Many great men died in prisons, faced the gallows. Many great men have sacrificed generation after generation for the freedom of our country. How should we celebrate 75 years of independence in 2022? As a citizen, we should take this resolution that even though we did not get the chance to take part in the battle of freedom, but we have got this great fortune to make India a world leader. Thus, we should do something constructive for the development of our country. As citizens we should do something by the year 2022 so that our contribution can take the country to a new pinnacle. Every institution should make this resolve – the municipality, the Panchayat, the state governments. We should move ahead with this resolution that we have five years to prove ourselves before we celebrate 2022. 

 

We want to transform the lives of the poor of this country – whether by providing them with gas connection, or by bringing electricity to their huts. Our dream is to see that the poorest of the poor from India has his own house by 2022 with amenities like electricity, water supply and toilet in that house. Providing such a home to the poor is a great dream in itself that needs to be pursued.

 

This year is Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji's centenary year. How can we lift the poorest of the poor in India out of poverty? He gave a new vision to the country making this idea as the focal point. The country is celebrating Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's birth centenary. So I want to suggest to the Kandla Port Trust, Nitin ji and to his department that why don’t we rename Kandla Port as Pandit Deendayal Port Trust, Kandla because this work will be dedicated to the poor and Pandit Deendayal identifies with the poor people of our country. This will create a sense of ‘fellow- feeling’ within us and we can work with this feeling  to bring about a change in the lives of the oppressed, exploited, and the deprived section of the society.

 

Once again, I had this opportunity to visit Kutch and be amongst you. You have assembled here in such large numbers and have showered your blessings. I am grateful to you all. Thank you Nitin ji for giving me the opportunity of being a part of this programme. 

 

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched various projects of Kandla Port Trust at Gandhidham in Gujarat.

He unveiled plaques to mark the laying of Foundation Stone for construction of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Convention Centre; and the development of the 14th and 16th General Cargo Berth.

He handed over Letters of Award for Construction of Interchange-cum-ROB at Kutch Salt Junction; Deployment of two Mobile Harbour Cranes; and Mechanization for handling of fertilisers at Kandla Port.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari said that the Sagarmala project, and port-led development would have a positive impact on the State of Gujarat, and would lead to job creation as well.

Gujarat Chief Minister Shri Vijay Rupani spoke of the rich maritime traditions of the State, and added that the spirit continues even today.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the people for the warm welcome accorded to him on the way from the helipad to the venue of the function.

He said the people of Kutch are well aware of the importance of water. He spoke of the rich and glorious history and culture of the Kutch region.

The Prime Minister said that if India wants to make a place for itself in global trade, it should have the best of arrangements in the port sector.

The combination of infrastructure and efficiency is vital for the port sector to thrive, he said, adding that the Kandla Port has emerged as one of the finest in Asia.

The Prime Minister said that the Chabahar port, being developed with Indian participation in Iran, would further spur the growth of Kandla Port. The Prime Minister also mentioned the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Convention Center whose Foundation Stone was laid today.

The Prime Minister asked the people to resolve to make whatever contribution they can for the nation over the next five years, in the run-up to the seventy-fifth anniversary of Independence.

Stating that the nation is celebrating the centenary year of Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay, the Prime Minister suggested that Kandla Port Trust be renamed as ""Deendayal Port Trust - Kandla.""

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will be on a two-day visit to Gujarat from today.  The Prime Minister will inaugurate and lay foundation stone for various development projects in Kutch today. On Tuesday, 23 May, Prime Minister will participate in the opening ceremony of the African Development Bank Annual Meetings in Gandhinagar.

 

In a series of tweets yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the details of his two-day visit to Gujarat.

 

“Tomorrow I will begin a two day Gujarat visit, during which I will join programmes in Kutch and Gandhinagar.

 

I shall inaugurate & lay the foundation stone for various projects of the Kandla Port and address a public meeting at Gandhidham.

 

In Bhachau, a pumping station would be inaugurated & I shall join a public meeting. Watch it on your mobile. http://nm4.in/dnldapp 

 

Kutch has a very special place in my heart. It is blessed with wonderful people and a remarkable spirit of resilience.

 

From suffering unimaginable destruction due to the 2001 quake, Kutch is today known as one of India’s fastest growing districts.

 

On Tuesday, I will be in Gandhinagar to participate in the opening ceremony of the meetings of the@AfDB_Group.

 

The Annual Meetings of @AfDB_Group have chosen the very relevant theme of ‘Transforming Agriculture for Wealth Creation in Africa.’

 

On the sidelines of @AfDB_Group Annual Meetings, I shall meet some of the distinguished delegates who will be taking part in #AfDBAM2017.”, the Prime Minister tweeted.

Respected Shri Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Ji, my Cabinet colleague Shriman Radha Mohan Singh Ji and all the dignitaries present here today.

When I was taking over in the capacity of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had the honour of getting introduced to Dr. Swaminathan Ji. With his support, we had then launched the Soil Health Card Scheme.  Incidentally, this idea had met strong bureaucratic resistance then. However, it was one of Dr. Swaminathan’s public addresses at Chennai that eventually established the importance of the scheme and changed the mindset of all my colleagues. During this public meet, he had reiterated the importance of Soil Health Card Scheme introduced by the erstwhile Gujarat Government, hailing it as a landmark step which was bound to reap great benefits in the future. While I had been struggling to convince my colleagues since long, this statement of Dr. Swaminathan released in press hammered it down well, and very soon the same colleagues were with me on this decision.  They could now believe in the importance of the initiative. This just proves the diligence, dedication and commitment of Dr. Swaminathan, which I have personally experienced. I am honoured to have witnessed the genesis of this visionary scheme which is slated to be implemented nation wide.

Though he is described as “Krishi Vaigyanik” – an Agricultural Scientist, but I believe that he is a true “Kisan Vaigyanik” – a Farmers’ Scientist; there is a real farmer in him. His scientific inquiries have not only explored the agricultural productions and quality in the confines of a laboratory, but they are deeply rooted in the Indian agri context. His scientific papers present studies focussing on the farmers, and hence are very contextual, practical and relevant. The findings are useful and hence can be implemented by the farmers to enhance the quality of their produce. This is the speciality and relevance of Dr. Swaminathan’s research.

How can Dr. Swaminathan be a role model for today's youth? Ironically, today’s youth is more familiar with political leaders but not scientists. While every by lane makes the political faces a household name, huge contributions of the likes of Dr. Swaminathan are rarely brought to light. Unfortunately, this is a systemic issue or idiosyncrasy of few. Paradoxically, today’s youth finds a role model in players, famed artistes, political leader or a business tycoon; but, they rarely seek inspiration from renowned scientists. Imagine that time when the world was of the view that India will die of hunger and perish as a nation; here was a young scientist who took to the global belief head on, and pledged to change the scenario.  Little do the youth of today know that the curator of Green Revolution was none other than Dr. Swaminathan.

While the country today is highly conducive to the start up culture, the youth has many domains to work on, and malnutrition is one of the concerning challenges they could address. Our pulses and oilseeds also have lower productivity; they also need to suggest measures to increase the protein contained value. Our youth must take up the challenge of eradicating malnutrition and bring about such innovations in agricultural revolutions that help to combat malnutrition. Mahatma Gandhi used to say that for the poor food is their God. It is time to bring in such scientific interventions that will take this mission forward.

Certain things from his personal life have appealed to me greatly. I am aware that you have worked with almost all PMs till date, yet one has never seen any highhandedness reflected in Dr. Swaminathan’s personality; he comes out as simplicity personified.  I am not saying so on the basis of the book, but it is out of my personal experiences with him. When I was in Gujarat he would often walk in with deep humility. During our interactions one would never realise that he is THE great scientist. It is a great virtue to remain untouched and unfazed by the success in public life. A virtue worth emulating by all of us! As a person his face is always jubilant. Unlikely that one would have ever seen his glum face. Unfortunately, most scientists sitting here (with due apologies), even in this 21st Century choose to live as if they are still in the 18th Century. They look morose and over burdened with the responsibility of the entire world. They look so lost that even their families are worried about their introvert nature. On the contrary, Dr. Swaminathan exudes immense positivity and joie de vivre. It is indeed commendable.  This is possible not only because of cognitive intelligence but when one internalises some life lessons too.  I truly believe that he is been endowed with divine grace and rich family values to have attained this iconic status.

In the field of agriculture, our country is continually facing the same challenges since several decades. We talk of advancing from Green Revolution to the Second Green Revolution but situation remains dismal. For a nation like India, the target is Evergreen Revolution.  It is about time that we know our potentials and map them.  Compared to Western India, we notice economic imbalance in North Eastern India. No country can progress in the long term if two parts of the same nation show varied economic growth. Such a country’s economy is bound to collapse. To strengthen the entire nation it is now important to replicate the Ist Agro Revolution; the same way that wheat from Western India had led this, the rice of Eastern India has full potential to spearhead the Evergreen Revolution.

I am of the firm opinion that we have sufficient resources like water, irrigable land, toiling farmers, hence the need of the hour is supporting these resources with scientific methods and technological interventions. The Union Government is leaving no stone unturned to achieve this goal, and Dr. Swaminathan has been our constant source of guidance. A while back when I met him I requested him to guide the team. This morning he very courteously spent a lot of time delving deep into the issue with my team and suggested some key areas to focus on. In the wake of population bomb ticking really fast, and land crunch alarmingly becoming critical, immediate measures of Soil Management takes precedence.

It becomes essential to work out a holistic approach which addresses critical issues on how to enhance productivity and quality of agri products. There are approximately 85% marginal farmers who toil on small pieces of land for maximum produce which barely allows them to meet their basic consumption. Such strategies must be introduced which ensure that these farmers are able to harvest high quality produce and get increased market value apart from just fulfilling their personal needs.

Another global challenge which poses a threat to agri-development in the country is the huge water crisis. The natural resources are depleting at an alarming rate which poses a threat to agricultural development. Though several measures like water recycling and conservation have been undertaken, however, it cannot be ignored that the crisis must be attended to with a fire-fighter’s spirit. We must display farsightedness in these matters and take immediate steps.  It is not easy to sensitize the society. Haven’t we noticed in the case of air pollution how even the highly educated could not pre-empt the impending crisis. Similarly, it would be a humungous challenge to make the common man realise that water could also soon become scarce. Along with water conservation techniques, we need to invent scientific ways of water consumption too.

Presently, we are promoting the “Per drop more crop” philosophy to tackle the global problem of water scarcity in agricultural practices. The campaign to join rivers is a step towards cost effective farming which would ensure that sufficient water is available for irrigation. We must also take effective measures towards soil management by curbing the use of pesticides and chemicals in fertilizers. They ruin the purity of soil and destroy cultivable land. There is a perpetual complain by farmers who have fields alongside river banks that pollution from the industries damage their crops. However, they do not realise that the use of chemicals in the fields precipitate with the rains and inundate into the river making them highly acidic and harmful for irrigation. The launch of “Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee Yojana” aims to protect the rivers and make optimal usage of river water. This catapulted the importance of research and innovation in the domain of protection of rivers.

It helps to be mindful of the local stories in the villages as they often are a glimpse of the culture and norms. I would like to share one of my experiences of a place in Gujarat called Bhal. It was located along the sea shore in the gulf area of Khambat. Since our childhood we had heard a lot about “bhaliya” variety of wheat, and it was primarily consumed by the upper class as it was an expensive variety. I was always intrigued by this story about how the upper class would hoard the special wheat variety. When I became the Chief Minister of Gujarat I started learning more about the quality of the “bhaliya” wheat. The findings revealed that while most wheat varieties are carbon rich, the “bhaliya” wheat was Protein Rich and a rare variety.   

During one of my visit to Switzerland, I met some people from Nestle and requested them to guide me on how to resolve the issue of nutrition. I had involved a local university to conduct genetic study of the bhaliya variety. Like the rice variety Basmati is synonymous with high nutrition and quality, we could also find the brand value of other rich varieties of cereals and grains.  I can recall today that I was very curious whenever someone affluent wished to buy millet, the most sought after variety came from the Amreli district of Gujarat. Incidentally, the MLA from the district had gifted me a bag full when I was sworn in as the Chief Minister. Then I wasn’t aware of the richness of the variety of millet from this district. I immediately asked a few scientists to document the local adages from around the country about high yielding varieties of crops which might have made a certain produce very famous. It would be relevant to identify such varieties and ascertain its genetic value. 

It will be really great if we amalgamate such traditional knowledge with the scientific inquiry if the produce of any region is known for productivity, high yielding variety with extraordinary nutritional values. If they are found to be of great value to humankind in terms of both quality and nutrients, then certainly some research should be taken up promptly.

Keeping this in mind, I instructed the people from my department to become more vigilant about the crop varieties of the districts they enter. Each district has its agricultural identity; whether it is recognised from a rice variety it produces or isabgol or cumin. One should create awareness among the farmers and residents of that village about how a certain produce can give them their identity.

During one of my visit to Himachal Pradesh when Shri Dhumal ji was Chief Minister, I was thrilled to visit the Solan district where mushroom farming is being done on a large scale. I used to reside in Himachal then. I was surprised that no one capitalised on this strength of the state. There was immense potential of branding through this agricultural identity. Today the entry board to Solan reads “Welcome to the Mushroom City”. One can now also see boards highlighting Kiwi fruit and apple productions. The district and the farmers of that region get their identity and are well known in the market due to their crop variety. During business such identity really helps. On the lines of Industrial Cluster, Agricultural Clusters will also emerge when, for example, there are 16 districts are known for a rice variety and there are 20 others famous for their oil seeds. Such concepts need to be developed to market the product well. This opens up the potential for the business of processing which brings immense value addition. With unique packaging required for a specific variety of fruit or storage redesigned for a new rice variety, the discipline of Supply Chain Management gains advantage. The more specialised a product, the more customised would be its packaging and transportation. the sooner we bring it into the DNA of our country, the closer we are to our target of “double income” for the farmers by the 75th year of our Independence in 2022.

A while back when I met Dr. Swaminathan, I requested him to connect me to leading agro economists to discuss the agenda of “double income” by 2022. He simply handed over a note to me which listed things which require immediate action. I am making efforts to work on those lines. We need to be target oriented and work on three crucial things i.e., cost effectiveness, enhanced productivity and value addition. We all know that Neem Coated Urea was not here out of the blue. It was never given importance earlier. However now, it is seen how it has helped in the curbing theft and corruption. In fact, it came to light that despite heavy reduction in the consumption of urea, the production of rice and wheat has increased effectively. These are some of the subtle ways of popularising best practices in the regions and gaining long term benefit.

The Indian Government is ensuring THAT at every level with the support of Dr. Swaminathan and his scientific research fraternity.  We are moving towards Evergreen Revolution and making all attempts to reinstate a sustainable agriculture system in the country. 

Right efforts are being made in that direction by encouraging experimentations and technological advancements which has been one of our major challenges. “Lab to land” should be our target. Scientists dedicate their entire lives in developing something for us but sadly these are never implemented in the fields. It is cause of concern as farmers are not ready to take risks unlike the businessmen. To encourage them to accept new inventions in their farming practices, we have introduced Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme. This has developed a lot of trust among the farmer community. Now farmers covered under this scheme are seven times more compared to the previous scheme. There would be many iffs and buts when a new scheme is launched primarily due to lack of awareness.  However, seven times hike in the acceptance of the scheme in the launch year is indeed laudable. It clearly indicates that our farmers are feeling more secure. The feeling of security is certainly going to enhance their risk taking capacity. They are open minded to the scientific experimentations and excited to implement latest interventions in farming. The Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme is a strong catalyst in strengthening the “lab to land” process.


I once again congratulate Dr. Swaminathan from the core of my heart for serving the nation and the farmers, as well as, for dedicating himself like an ascetic for the cause of hunger. 

Hearty Congratulations!

Thank You!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released a two-part book series on the eminent agricultural scientist Dr. M.S. Swaminathan. The series is titled - M.S. Swaminathan: The Quest for a world without hunger. Several Union Ministers and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled how the Soil Health Card initiative had been started in consultation with Prof. Swaminathan, during the Prime Minister’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minister. 

Praising the dedication and commitment of Prof. Swaminathan, the Prime Minister described him as a “Kisan Vaigyanik” – Farmers’ Scientist; rather than just a “Krishi Vaigyanik” – Agricultural Scientist. The Prime Minister said that Prof. Swaminathan’s speciality is that his work has been grounded in practical reality. He also appreciated the simplicity of Prof. Swaminathan. 

Talking about challenges in the agricultural sector today, the Prime Minister said that the success in agriculture needs to be extended to eastern India; and scientific and technological interventions are required to make this a reality. 

The Prime Minister said a combination of modern scientific methods and traditional agricultural knowledge would bring about the best possible results. Giving examples from some States, he said each district in India should have its own “Agri-Identity.” He said this can boost the marketing process, and help develop agri-clusters, on the lines of industrial clusters. 

The Prime Minister spoke of the target of doubling farm incomes by 2022, and said this requires a targeted approach in several key areas. He noted with satisfaction that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is finding much higher acceptance among farmers, than previous agricultural insurance schemes. He said this will help increase the risk-taking ability of farmers, and facilitate the process of taking innovation from “Lab to Land.” 

Dr. M.S. Swaminathan thanked the Prime Minister for his words, and appreciated his vision. He emphasized the importance of synergy between technology and public policy.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Thursday evening, reviewed the progress of the Namaami Gange programme. 

During the course of a presentation on the subject, senior officials from various Government departments apprised the Prime Minister of action taken so far, and progress made on this programme. 

Officials said that the Sewage Treatment Capacity in towns along the river is being enhanced substantially. Considerable focus is being placed on large cities along the Ganga main stem, including Haridwar, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Howrah and Kolkata. 

Intensive monitoring and inspection of Grossly Polluting Industries has been taken up. Officials said that this has led to considerable improvement in the water quality of some of the tributaries of the River Ganga. Parameters such as “Dissolved Oxygen” and “Biochemical Oxygen Demand” have been studied as part of this assessment. 

The Prime Minister was also apprised of the considerable progress made in Rural Sanitation in villages along the banks of the River Ganga. The Prime Minister stressed on the need to further increase public awareness and participation in the task of cleaning the River Ganga. 

Top officials from the PMO, NITI Aayog, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, National Mission for Clean Ganga and Central Pollution Control Board were present at the meeting.

                Your Excellency, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine,
Members of the Palestinian and Indian delegations, 
Members of the media, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 


I am delighted to welcome back President Mahmoud Abbas, an old friend of India, on his State visit to India. The relationship between India and Palestine is built on the foundation of long-standing solidarity and friendship since the days of our own freedom struggle. India has been unwavering in its support of the Palestinian cause. And ,we hope to see the realization of a sovereign, independent, united and viable Palestine, co-existing peacefully with Israel. I have reaffirmed our position on this to President Abbas during our conversation today. 


Friends, 

President Abbas and I have just concluded useful and detailed discussions that will add further strength to our partnership. We had extensive exchange of views on the situation in West Asia and the Middle East Peace Process. We agreed that the challenges in West Asia must be addressed through sustained political dialogue and peaceful means. India hopes for early resumption of talks between Palestinian and Israeli sides to move towards finding a comprehensive resolution. At the bilateral level, India is committed to be a useful development partner of Palestine. President Abbas and I agreed that both sides, through practical cooperation, will work together to build Palestine’s economy and contribute to improving the lives of its people. We will continue to support the development and capacity-building efforts of Palestine. The agreements concluded today are reaffirmation of our intent to strengthen cooperation in this direction. We have also taken up for particular emphasis the areas of information technology, youth and skills development in the assistance provided by India. India is undertaking project assistance for a flagship Techno-park project in Ramallah. Once completed, it will serve as an IT hub in Palestine offering a one-stop solution for all IT-related training and services. We also look forward to enhancing our cultural exchanges by adding new elements including Yoga exchanges. We look forward to the Palestinian people participating in large numbers during the International Day of Yoga celebrations next month. In the end, I wish President Mahmoud Abbas and his delegation a pleasant and productive stay in India. I look forward to working together with President Abbas to further strengthen our bilateral relations.


Thank you. 

Thank you very much.

                विशाल संख्‍या में पधारे हुए मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो और बहनों, 

हमारे शास्‍त्रों में एक मान्‍यता बनी हुई है कि अगर हम यात्रा कर नहीं सकते हैं, लेकिन किसी यात्री को अगर प्रणाम कर लें तो यात्रा का पुण्‍य प्राप्‍त होता है। तो मैं भी आप सभी यात्रियों को प्रणाम करके, जो पुण्‍य आपने कमाया है; वो आपसे कुछ हिस्‍सा मांग रहा हूं। लेकिन वो हिस्‍सा मैं मेरे लिए नहीं मांग रहा हूँ, आपकी ये यात्रा से कमाया हुआ पुण्‍य मां भारती के काम आए, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के काम आए, इस देश के गरीब से गरीबी की जिंदगी के बदलाव लाने में काम आए। 

और मुझे विश्‍वास है नर्मदा यात्रा ही है वो यात्रा जिसको नर्मदा परिक्रमा से जोड़ा गया है। और मैं इस शास्‍त्र से भली-भांति परिचित हूं, मैंने उस दुनिया को जीने का कभी प्रयास किया था, और उसमें मुझे पता है कि जब नर्मदा परिक्रमा करते हैं, तब अहंकार कैसे चूर-चूर हो जाता है; अहंकार कैसे मिट्टी में मिल जाता है। और परिक्रमा करने वाले व्‍यक्ति को मां नर्मदा जमीन पर लाकर खड़ा कर देती है। सारे बंधनों से मुक्‍त करा देती है। सारे पद-उपाधियों से अभिभूषित हो, उससे भी परिक्रमा के दौरान मुक्ति मिल जाती है। मां नर्मदा और नर्मदा के सेवक के बीच कोई द्ववैत नहीं बचता है, एक अद्वैत की अनुभूति होती है। आपने भी आज जब मां नर्मदा की इस महान सेवा करने का संकल्‍प किया है। 

जब वक्‍त बदलता है, तो कहां से कहां पहुंचा देता है। और जब अतिकार भाव प्रबल हो जाता है, कर्तव्‍य भाव क्षीण हो जाता है, तब ये समस्याएं पैदा होती हैं; जो आज हमें नर्मदा सेवा के लिए निकलना पड़ा। यही तो मां नर्मदा हैं जिसने हजारों साल से हमें बचाया है, हमें जीवन दिया है, हमारे पूर्वजों की रक्षा की है, लेकिन हमने अपना अधिकार मान लिया, हम कर्तव्‍य से विमुख हो गए, और मां नर्मदा से जितना लूट सकते थे लूटते रहे। अपने स्‍वार्थवश अपनी आवश्‍यकता के अनुसार मां नर्मदा की तो परवाह नहीं की, हमने अपनी परवाह जरूरी की। मन में वो अधिकार भाव था कि मैं मां नर्मदा पर तो मेरा अधिकार है, मैं उसको जैसे चाहूं वैसे उसका उपभोग कर सकता हूं, और उसी का परिणाम हुआ कि जिस मां नर्मदा ने हमें बचाया था, आज हमें उस मां नर्मदा को बचाने के लिए पसीना बहाने की नौबत आई है। अगर कर्तव्‍य भाव से हम विमुख न हुए होते, मां के प्रति हमारे कर्तव्‍यों को हमने निभाया होता तो मां नर्मदा, उसको बचाने की नौबत मनुष्‍य के जिम्‍मे नहीं आती। और इसलिए समय से रहते मध्‍य प्रदेश के मुख्‍यमंत्री, मध्‍य प्रदेश की जनता, वो सजग हो गई। 

हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में कई नदियां हैं, नक्‍शे पर निशान है, पानी का नामो‍-निशान नहीं। कई नदियां इतिहास के गर्त में खत्‍म हो चुकी हैं। हमारे देश में केरल में एक नदी है, शायद एक ही नदी है जिसका नाम भारत पर है; भारत पूजा। उस केरल की नदी बचेगी कि नहीं बचेगी, ये चिंता का विषय है। ऐसा तो नहीं था कि पानी के उपयोग के कारण नदी खत्‍म हुई है। नदी की रक्षा के लिए जिन तत्‍वों के साथ उस रक्षा का दायित्‍व होता है, वो अगर हम नहीं निभाएंगे तो मानव जाति को कितना बड़ा नुकसान होगा। 

हम भली-भांति जानते हैं कि मां नर्मदा बर्फीली पहाड़ियों से नहीं आती, बर्फ के चट्टानों से पिघल कर नहीं आती है। मां नर्मदा एक-एक पौधे के प्रसाद से प्रकट होती है और जो हम लोगों को जी हमारे जीवन को पुलकित करती है। और इसलिए मध्‍य प्रदेश सरकार ने मां नर्मदा के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य के लिए, मां नर्मदा की गारंटी के लिए, सबसे प्रमुख काम हाथ में लिया है, वो है पेड़ लगाने का; वृक्षारोपण। हम जब पेड़ लगाएंगे तब हमें भी अंदाज नहीं होगा कि हम आने वाली पीढ़ियों की कितनी बड़ी सेवा कर रहे हैं। हमारे पूर्वजों ने जो तप किया, साधना की, सेवा की, उसी का परिणाम है कि‍ आज हम नर्मदा मैया का लाभ रहे रहे हैं। आज हम जो पुरुषार्थ करेंगे, आने वाली अनेक पीढ़ियां हमें याद करेंगी कि कोई एक वक्‍त था, जब मां नर्मदा को बचाने के लिए पेड़-पौधों की मदद ले करके फिर एक बार मां नर्मदा को पुनर्जीवन दिया गया था। 

करीब-करीब डेढ़ सौ दिन यात्रा ये असंभव कार्य है, लेकिन हमारे देश का दुर्भाग्‍य है कि जहां कहीं सरकार जुड़ जाए, जहां कहीं राजनेता जुड़ जाएं, तो सके महात्‍मय को खंडित करने का ही प्रयास होता है। वरना ये ऐसी घटना है, और मैं मध्‍य प्रदेश की जनता को नर्मदा यात्रा से जुड़े हुए, इस सेवा यात्रा से जुड़े हुए, लक्षावधि लोगों को, नर्मदा तट पर बसे हुए हर नागरिक को हृदय से बधाई देता हूं। ये ऐसी घटना है कि दुनिया के किसी देश में नदी की रक्षा के लिए डेढ़ सौ दिन तक इतनी तपस्‍या की गई होती, तो पूरे विश्‍व में उस की चर्चा हुई होती, पूरे विश्‍व में उसका जयकारा बोला गया होता, दुनिया के बड़े-बड़े टीवी चैनल इस घटना को अंकित करने के लिए दौड़ पड़ते। लेकिन ये हमारे देश का दुर्भाग्‍य है कि हम हमारी अपनी इन प्रयासों का वैश्विक सामर्थ्‍य क्‍या है, न उसको जान पाते हैं न समझ पाते हैं, और मौके गंवा देते हैं। 

आज कहीं एक Solar park लग जाए तो भी दुनिया में चर्चा होती है कि उस देश के उस इलाके में Solar park लगा है मानवता की रक्षा के लिए। ये नदी बचाने का इतना बड़ा काम हुआ है, पर्यावरण की रक्षा का इतना बड़ा काम हुआ है, 25 लाख से ज्‍यादा लोगों ने संकल्‍प लिए हैं, कोटि-कोटि जन उससे जुड़े हैं, शरीर को कष्‍ट दिया है, कठिनाइयों से गुजारे हैं दिन, स्‍वयं परिश्रम करके; पैदल चलके, मां पृथ्‍वी की रक्षा के लिए, नदी की रक्षा के लिए, पर्यावरण की रक्षा के लिए, मानवता की रक्षा के लिए, इतना बड़ा अहम कदम उठाया है। और इसका नेतृत्‍व करने के लिए मैं शिवराज जी को, उनकी पूरी टीम को, और मध्‍य प्रदेश की जनता को बधाई देता हूं। 

मेरा जन्‍म गुजरात में हुआ। नर्मदा की एक-एक बूंद पानी का मूल्‍य क्‍या है, वो गुजरात के लोग भली-भांति जानते हैं। और आज आपने जब नर्मदा के भविष्‍य के लिए इतना बड़ा अभियान उठाया है, तो मैं गुजरात के गांव की, किसानों की तरफ से, वहां के नागरिकों की तरफ से; राजस्‍थान के गाव की तरफ से, किसानों की तरफ से, वहां के नागरिकों की तरफ से; महाराष्‍ट्र के गांव की तरफ से, महाराष्‍ट्र के किसानों की तरफ से, महाराष्‍ट्र के नागरिकों की तरफ से, मध्‍य प्रदेश की जनता का, मध्‍य प्रदेश की सरकार का, मध्‍य प्रदेश के मुख्‍यमंत्री का अनेक-अनेक अभिनंदन करता हूं, उनका धन्‍यवाद करता हूं। 

इन दिनों देश में स्‍वच्‍छता अभियान, उसको अब एक ढांचागत व्‍यवस्‍था मिली है। लगातार Third party के द्वारा, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में Evaluation हो रहा है। कौन सा राज्‍य में स्‍वच्‍छता का क्‍या चल रहा है, कौन सा शहर स्‍वच्‍छ है। जन-भागीदारी, लोकतंत्र की सबसे बड़ी ताकत होती है। और अगर हम जन-सामर्थ्‍य, जन-शक्ति, जन-भागीदारी, इसकी उपेक्षा करेंगे तो सरकारें कुछ भी करने में समर्थ नहीं होती हैं। कितने ही अच्‍छे विचार क्‍यों न हों, कितना ही अच्‍छा नेतृत्‍व क्‍यों न हो, कितनी ही अच्‍छी व्‍यवस्‍था क्‍यों न हो, लेकिन जन-समर्थन के बिना कभी भी कोई चीज सफल नहीं होती है। और जन-समर्थन से कैसे सफल होती है, इसका उत्‍तम उदाहरण मध्‍य प्रदेश ने प्रस्‍तुत किया है। 

पिछली बार जब सर्वेक्षण हुआ तब स्‍वच्‍छता की दिशा में मध्‍य प्रदेश का नाम बदनामी की सीमा में आ गया था, लेकिन मध्‍य प्रदेश ने मन में ठान ली, ये कलंक मिटाने का संकल्‍प किया, जन-जागरण किया, जन-भागीदारी बढ़ाई, जन-जन को जोड़ा, और आज मैं मध्‍य प्रदेश को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। देश में जो hundred city सफाई के लिए आकलन किया गया, उन hundred में, 100 में 22 मध्‍य प्रदेश के हैं। ये बहुत बड़ी सिद्धि है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के और राज्‍यों को भी प्रेरणा देने वाला काम, स्‍वच्‍छता की दिशा में मध्‍य प्रदेश ने जन-भागीदारी से करके दिखाया। इंदौर और भोपाल हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के Top पर पहले और दूसरे नंबर पर आये। 

100 में से 22 शहर स्‍वच्‍छता के अंदर अग्रिम पंक्ति में आ जायें, इसका मतलब ये हुआ कि पूरे राज्‍य में प्रशासन ने, शासन ने, जनता-जनार्दन ने इसे अपना काम माना। और उसी का परिणाम हुआ है ये नर्मदा योजना सेवा यात्रा की सफलता। ये सफलता भी सरकार की ताकत के भरोसे नहीं हुआ है, ये जनता-जनार्दन की ताकत के भरोसे हुआ है। और जनता की ताकत जब जुड़ती है तो कितने बड़े परिणाम आते हैं; शिवराज जी ने 6 करोड़ का लक्ष्‍य रखा है, 2 जुलाई को पेड़ लगाने का। और उन्‍होंने ये 6 करोड़ पेड़ की व्‍यवस्‍था के लिए भी पिछले डेढ़ साल से लगातार काम कर रहे हैं; ये जो ये अचानक नहीं हो रही है। उसके लिए नर्सरी के अंदर सारी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं करी, की जाती हैं तब जा करके होती है। लेकिन हम जैसे परिवार में एक संतान की देखभाल करते हैं, वैसे ही इन नए हम बोने वाले पेड़-पौधों की माहवजत करेंगे, चिंता करेंगे, तब जा करके वो वटवृक्ष तैयार होगा। 

हमारे यहां शास्‍त्रों में कहा जाता है जो एक साल का सोचता है वो आनाज बोता है, लेकिन जो आगे का, भविष्य का सोचता है, वो फलदार वृक्ष बोता है। ये फलदार वृक्ष बोने का काम, ये आने वाले दिनों में अनेक परिवारों को एक आर्थिक गारंटी का भी कारण बनने वाला है। मुझे विश्‍वास है कि मध्‍यप्रदेश सरकार ने जो बीड़ा उठाया है और जो उन्‍होंने कार्य योजना बनाई है उस कार्य योजना की किताब मुझे उन्‍होंने पहले पहुंचाई थी, मैंने उसका अध्‍ययन किया; हर किसी के लिए उसमें काम है, हर जगह के लिए काम है; कब करना, कैसे करना, उसका विधि-विधान है; कौन किस काम को देखेगा इसका पूरा प्रारूप है; एक प्रकार से perfect document हैं future vision का। मैं देश के अन्‍य राज्‍यों से भी आग्रह करूंगा और शिवराज जी से भी आग्रह करूंगा कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सभी राज्‍यों को एक किताब भेजें और प्राकृतिक संसाधनों की रक्षा का तरीका क्‍या होता है; मध्‍य प्रदेश को एक नमूना के रूप में, एक उदाहरण के तौर पर, उसे ले करके सब अपनी-अपनी योजना बनाएं। 

जल ही जीवन है, ये तो हम कहते हैं; नदी माता, ये हम कहते हैं; लेकिन हमारी पूरी अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था उसी पर आधारित है। उसके बिना अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था खोखली हो जाती है। अगर आज मध्‍य प्रदेश में कृषि विकास 20 प्रतिशत पहुंचा तो उसमें सबसे बड़ा योगदान माता नर्मदा का है। ये ताकत है, किसान की जिंदगी बदलने की ताकत, ये माता नर्मदा में है। 

2022 तक हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के किसान की आय दोगुना करने का संकल्‍प ले करके पूरे देश में काम चल रहा है, मध्‍य प्रदेश ने उसकी पूरी योजना तैयार कर दी है। और उसका लाभ किसानों के सहयोग से हिंदुस्तान के हर गांव को मिलेगा, ये मेरा विश्‍वास है। 

भाइयो, बहनों! 2022, आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं। क्‍या हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी हर पल 2022 का स्‍मरण नहीं कर सकते हैं? हर पल आजादी के 75 साल की याद नहीं कर सकते हैं? जिन महापुरुषों ने देश के लिए बलिदान दिया, जीवन लगा दिया, जवानी जेलों में खपा दी, कुछ फांसी के तख्‍ते पर चढ़ गए, जिन्‍होंने अपने जीवन के परिवार के परिवार तबाह कर दिए; मां भारती की आजादी के लिए क्‍या उनके सपनों को याद करते हुए हम संकल्‍प नहीं कर सकते कि 2022 तक, व्‍यक्ति के नाते मैं देश के लिए इतना करूंगा, परिवार के नाते इतना करूंगा, समाज के नाते इतना करूंगा। हम गांव के लोग मिलके ये करेंगे; हम नगर के लोग मिल करके ये करेंगे; हम संस्‍था के नाते ये काम करेंगे, हम समाज के नाते ये काम करेंगे, हम राज्‍य के नाते, देश के नाते ये संकल्‍प करेंगे। 

2022, ‘नया भारत’ बनाने का सपना ले करके चलना है। हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी को जोड़ना है। आजादी के आंदोलन में जैसे देश जुड़ गया था; देश को नई ऊंचाइयों पर ले जाने के लिए, ‘नया भारत’ बनाने के लिए हर देशवासी को जोड़ना है। और इसलिए मैं आग्रह करूंगा, देशवासियों से आग्रह करूंगा, मैं मध्‍य प्रदेश के सभी संगठनों से आग्रह करूंगा; आप भी मिल-बैठ करके तय करिए कि 2022 तक देश के लिए आपकी संस्‍था, आपका परिवार, आपका समाज, आपका संगठन, आपका दल क्‍या करेगा; आप लोग तय कीजिए। एक बार देश में माहौल बने, अभी हमारे पांच साल हैं। पांच साल में हम देश को कहां से कहां पहुंचा सकते हैं। मुझे विश्‍वास है अगर सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी एक कदम देश के लिए आगे चल पड़ेंगे तो देश पांच साल के भीतर-भीतर सवा सौ करोड़़ कदम आगे निकल जाएगा। और इसलिए हम इस संकल्‍प को ले करके चलें। 

मैं आज पूज्‍य अवधेशानंद जी का विशेष आभारी हूं, जो आाशीर्वचन उन्‍होंने मेरे लिए कहे हैं, जो भाव उन्‍होंने प्रकट किए हैं; मैं ईश्‍वर से यही प्रार्थना करूंगा कि हम सब में वो क्षमता आएं, वो अच्‍छाइयां आएं, वो समर्पण का भाव आए; ताकि देश की सही सेवा करने के लिए हम अपने-आप को योग्‍य पाएं, योग्‍य बना पाएं। मैं उनके इस आशीर्वाद वचन के लिए हृदय से बहुत-बहुत आभार प्रकट करता हूं और उनको प्रणाम करता हूं। 

मैं आप सबको भी हृदय से बधाई देता हूं, और जैसा शिवराज जी ने कहा, यात्रा का यहां विराम है; लेकिन अब यात्रा में जो भी सोचा, जो भी देखा, जो भी किया, इसको चरितार्थ करने का यज्ञ शुरू हो रहा है। ये सेवा का यज्ञ शुरू हो रहा है। यात्रा समाप्‍त हुई, यज्ञ आरंभ हुआ। यज्ञ में आहुति देनी पड़ती है, समय देना पड़ता है, अपनी सारी इच्‍छा- आकांक्षाओं को समाज के लिए अहुत करनी पड़ती है। मुझे विश्‍वास है ये नर्मदा के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य का यज्ञ आप सबके सफल प्रयत्‍नों से और अवश्‍य नई ऊंचाइयों को प्राप्‍त करेगा। इसी एक भावना के साथ आप सब मेरे साथ बोलेंगे- दोनों मुट्ठी बंद करके, हाथ ऊपर करके बोलेंगे- मैं कहूंगा नर्मदे, आप कहेंगे सर्वदे। 

नर्मदे – सर्वदे 

आवाज मां नर्मदा के उस किनारे तक पहुंचनी चाहिए, खम्‍बात की खाडी तक। 

नर्मदे – सर्वदे 

नर्मदे – सर्वदे 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today offered prayers at the temple at Narmada Udgam Sthal - the origin of the River Narmada. He addressed a large gathering at the conclusion of ""Namaami Narmade - Narmada Seva Yatra,"" at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. 

Speaking on the occasion, Swami Avdheshananda ji described the Prime Minister as a ""Vikas Avatar"" and said that the Prime Minister has inspired immense public awareness towards the cause of water conservation. 

Addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the Narmada will be made one of the cleanest rivers in the world through people's participation. He said water treatment plants would be set up in all 18 cities in Madhya Pradesh which fall along the banks of the Narmada. He added that the movement will not stop here, but will be extended to other rivers as well. 

He expressed confidence that under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India will become a Vishvaguru. He also congratulated the Prime Minister on the upcoming third anniversary of the formation of the Union Government. 

The Prime Minister released Narmada Pravah - the Mission Work Plan for the river Narmada. 

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that he bows to the travellers of the Narmada Seva Yatra - and hoped that their efforts would bear fruit that serves India, and the poorest of the poor. 

Stating that the River Narmada has been a life-giver for centuries, the Prime Minister said that in recent times, the Narmada has been brutally exploited, and that is what had led to the need for a Narmada Seva Yatra. He added that if we do not protect and nurture our rivers, mankind will be the loser. 

The Prime Minister said that the Narmada Seva Yatra of nearly 150 days, is extraordinary, even by global standards. Noting that the River Narmada does not emerge from snows, but from trees, the Prime Minister said the Madhya Pradesh Government's big tree plantation programme will also be a great service to humanity. 

On behalf of the people and the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra, who benefit from the Narmada, the Prime Minister thanked the people and the Government of Madhya Pradesh, for the Narmada Seva Yatra. 

The Prime Minister complimented the Madhya Pradesh Government for the State's performance in the Swachh Bharat Mission, where out of the 100 top ranked cities, 22 are from Madhya Pradesh. 

The Prime Minister described the document of the Narmada Seva Mission, presented by the State Government, as futuristic, with an appropriate vision for protecting natural resources. 

The Prime Minister said the Union Government has resolved to double farmer incomes, and Madhya Pradesh has prepared a good vision document in this regard. He urged people to resolve to make a positive contribution to the nation by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. 

The Prime Minister thanked Swami Avdheshananda for his words of praise and appreciation. 

In conclusion, the Prime Minister exhorted the people to be ready to make a contribution and sacrifice for the River Narmada, saying that while the Yatra may have ended, the Yagya has just begun.

                Present here in large numbers, my dear brothers and sisters, 

 

Our scriptures say that if we offer our obeisance to a pilgrim when we can’t go on a pilgrimage we get the holy reward of the pilgrimage.  I am now seeking a part of that reward by offering my obeisance to you pilgrims. But, I am not seeking it for myself. The holy reward earned through your pilgrimage should benefit our motherland, should benefit 1.25 billion Indians, it should alleviate the sufferings of the poor of this country. 

 

And it’s my belief that Narmada Yatra is that same pilgrimage that has long been associated with the Narmada circuit. And, I am very well familiar with that scripture. Once I tried to live up to that expectation and so, I know that how a pilgrimage to Narmada circuit erases your arrogance. And mother Narmada cleanses the arrogance of the person doing a Narmada circuit. Mother Narmada sets the person free from all kind of bondages and attachments. Even a highly decorated, highly regarded person also gets free from those attachments and titles. Completing a Narmada circuit unite followers of mother Narmada with herself, one can feel unison with mother Narmada. Today you have taken the solemn vow to serve the mother Narmada. 

 

When time turns a page then it can turn one’s life upside down. These problems arise when arrogance dominates and your commitment to duties weakens; we are compelled to come out and serve the mother Narmada. This is the same mother Narmada that has sustained us for ages, gave us life and protected our ancestors, but we mistook all these favours as our right and turned away from our duties, and we exploited the mother Narmada to the hilt. In order to serve our self-interests we never cared for the mother Narmada, we only cared for our narrow interests. Deep down in our hearts, we had this thought of possession that we had rights over mother Narmada and we could exploit her the way we want to. And this arrogance led us to shed our sweat to save the mother Narmada that had always sustained us. Had we not turned away from our duties, had we fulfilled our duties to mother Narmada then it would not have become incumbent upon us humans to save mother Narmada. However, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, people of Madhya Pradesh got into action just in time.  

 

India has several rivers that feature in the map but they have no water. Several rivers have been lost in history. India has one river, perhaps that is the only river named after the country, it’s called Bharat Puja. However, it’s a cause of concern that whether that river would survive or not. It’s not that the rivers die due to use of their water. If we do not fulfil our obligations to protect the elements that sustain a river then it would cause unspeakable damage to mankind. 

 

We’re very well aware that mother Narmada does not emanate from snowy hills, it does not emanate from the melting snow. Mother Narmada takes her shape from the blessings of every single plant and it blesses our lives. Therefore the most important task that the Madhya Pradesh government has undertaken for the shining future of Mother Narmada; for ensuring the sustenance of Mother Narmada is to plant trees.  At this stage, we cannot fully comprehend the great service done by us to our future generations when we plant saplings. Today we’ve been reaping the benefits of mother Narmada only due to hard work, industriousness and the rigorous services done by our ancestors. Future generations would remember the hard work done by us today that there was a time when people took help of plants and trees for saving the mother Narmada; for the revival of mother Narmada.  This journey that takes nearly 150 days is an extremely difficult task, however, it’s very unfortunate for our country that attempts are made to undermine such great work if the government, politicians associate themselves with such events. Otherwise it’s a work for which I congratulate people of Madhya Pradesh, every single person of millions of people associated with this Narmada Yatra and also to every single person inhabiting on the banks of mother Narmada. This is such an important event that in any other country one fifty days of rigorous service to save a river would have become a global talking point, it would have been hailed world over and global TV networks would rush to cover such an event. However, this is unfortunate that in our country we fail to recognise and comprehend global importance of our efforts and miss out on such opportunities.  

 

The event of a solar park being set up somewhere is being discussed world over; that in that area of that country a solar park has been set up to save the mankind. This mammoth task of saving a river has been accomplished, this gigantic work of protecting the environment is being done. More than twenty five lakh people took a solemn vow, millions more associated themselves with these twenty five lakh people, suffered hardships and body pains and put up with extremely difficult days by working hard, by walking for long distances to save the mother earth, to save the river, to save the environment and to save the mankind. I congratulate Shivraj Ji, his entire team and also the people of Madhya Pradesh for spearheading this mammoth task. 

 

I was born in Gujarat. Gujaratis know very well the value of every single drop of Narmada’s water. And today when you people have embarked upon a gigantic mission for the future of Narmada then I thank and appreciate the people of Madhya Pradesh, government of Madhya Pradesh and Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on behalf of farmers, villages and people of Gujarat, and also on behalf of farmers, villages and people of Rajasthan, and also on behalf of farmers, villages and people of Maharashtra.  

 

Clean India Mission has now obtained a systematic process. The Clean India Mission is consistently being evaluated by a third party about what is happening in which state, which city is clean. People’s participation is the biggest strength of a democracy. And if we ignore the people’s strength, people’s power and people’s participation then the governments will not be able to achieve anything. Nothing will succeed without people’s participation no matter how good the idea may be, howsoever capable leadership may be, howsoever good the system may be. And Madhya Pradesh has set an example as to how these projects succeed with people’s participation. 

 

Last time when a survey was conducted to assess the cleanliness in the country then Madhya Pradesh was on the verge of losing its reputation, however, the state made a determination to get rid of this stigma, generated awareness among its people, encouraged people’s participation, people were associated with the mission and today I congratulate the state of Madhya Pradesh. Out of the 100 cities in the country that were assessed for cleanliness twenty two are from Madhya Pradesh. It’s a big achievement. In the area of cleanliness, Madhya Pradesh has set an example for other states by involving its people in the clean India mission. Indore and Bhopal respectively secured the first and second spot in the country in terms of cleanliness.  

 

Out of total 100 cities in the country if 22 cities  from one particular state secure the leading spots it means that the state administration and people of the state considered it as their own work. And it also led to the success of Narmada Yatra project. And this was accomplished due to the people’s power, it was not accomplished due to the government power. And people’s participation results in big achievements, Shivraj Ji has set a target to plant 6 crore saplings on July 02. Every necessary arrangement has to be made in the nurseries for this purpose, only then it can succeed. We need to tend these saplings the way we take care of our children, only then these saplings will grow into massive banyan trees.   

 

It is said in our scriptures that the one who thinks for next one year plants crops, but the one who thinks of future plants fruit bearing trees. And this task of planting fruit bearing trees will provide economic security to many families in future. I have studied the booklet of the scheme prepared by MP government and I believe that the program undertaken by Madhya Pradesh government and the scheme prepared by it has a very detailed account of the what needs to be done, how it is to be done, who will do what and it has something for everyone, it’s a perfect document for the future vision. I will urge upon other states and I’d also urge upon Shivraj Ji to send a copy of the booklet to each state of India to guide them how to protect their natural resources by giving example of Madhya Pradesh so that they can prepare their schemes accordingly.

  

Water is source of life, when we say: mother river, then it means that our entire economy is based on the river. Our economy will be ruined without that. If the agriculture sector of Madhya Pradesh has grown at the rate of twenty per cent then the biggest credit for this growth goes to mother Narmada. This is the power, the power to change the life of a farmer is in mother Narmada. 

 

India has embarked upon a mission to double the farmer’s income by 2022, Madhya Pradesh has prepared a comprehensive scheme for this purpose. And I believe that every single village will be able to take the benefit of that scheme. 

 

 My dear brothers and sisters, we will complete seventy five years of our freedom in 2022. Can’t the 125 crore Indians always keep in mind the 75th year of our independence? Those great men that sacrificed their lives for the country, spent their entire youth in jail, some embraced martyrdom, others sacrificed their family for the freedom of mother India; can’t we take a solemn vow that as an individual, as a family, as a society we will complete this or that for our country by 2022. We the people of our village will do this, as a city we will do this, as an institution we will do this, as a society, as a state and as a country we will do this.

   

We should carry forward the dream of making a ‘New India’ by 2022. We need to engage every Indian. We need to engage every single Indian to scale new heights, to make a ‘New India’ as we had done during the freedom movement. Therefore I’d urge my countrymen, I’d urge every organisation of Madhya Pradesh that by 2022 what will you do as an institution, as a family, as a society, as an organisation or as a group; you decide this. We have five years once we have galvanised the country. We can scale new heights in these five years. I believe that if the 1.25 billion people of this country take just one step forward then in the next five years the country would march ahead by 1.25 billion steps. 

 

I’m specially indebted to revered Avadeshanand Ji for the blessings that he bestowed upon me, his love for me; I pray to God that He give us those capacities, those virtues, those feelings of dedication; so that we can prepare ourselves to serve the country in the right way. I convey my deep regards and bow down to him for his kind words and blessings. 

 

I also warmly congratulate all of you, and as Shivraj Ji said that the journey takes a pause here, however, it’s the time to implement whatever we thought, we saw, we did during the journey. The journey is over but the Yajna begins. We need to make offerings in the Yajna, take out time for it; we need to sacrifice all our wishes and desires for the society. I believe that this Yajna for the bright future of the river Narmada will achieve great heights through your hard work. With this feeling, I urge you to join me in chanting with clenched fist and raised hands. I will say ‘Narmade’ and you will add ‘Sarvade’.   

 

Narmade – Sarvade. 

 

Your collective voice should reach to the other end of mother Narmada, to the gulf of Khambat.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the 90 years celebrations of the Essel Group in New Delhi. The event was also attended by President Pranab Mukherjee. 

Welcoming the Prime Minister, Chairman of the Essel Group Shri Subhash Chandra thanked him for graciously accepting the invitation for this event. He explained Essel Group’s recent social initiatives on themes such as water supply, power supply, Swachh Bharat and Affordable Housing. 

Two social initiatives were launched by the Prime Minister on the occasion. These include Sarthi – a people’s empowerment programme on subjects such as education, health and employment; and the DSC Foundation with a corpus of Rs. 5000 crore, to empower people in need. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister described the programme as an illustration of Indian traditions. He said that India has had a tradition where successive generations take family values forward, and contribute to the family by adding their capacities and capabilities. 

He recalled his earlier meetings with Shri Nandkishore Goenka and said the family has always been open to new ideas, and has taken every challenge as an opportunity, to create a presence in a range of initiatives from “soil to satellite.” 

Appreciating the social initiatives of the Essel Group, the Prime Minister said that the Swachh Bharat Mission provides opportunities for a large number of social entrepreneurs to emerge. He said that while “Sarthi” presented a good blend of rights and duties, the DSC Foundation would help build a large number of job creators. 

The Prime Minister urged everyone present to work towards specific goals for what they could do for the country by 2022 – the 75th anniversary of independence.

Tomorrow in Madhya Pradesh, I will be launching the Narmada Seva Mission, which will surely have a major impact on MP’s ecology.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today inaugurated a hospital in Dickoya in Central Province of Sri Lanka, built with Indian assistance. A large number of people lined the roadside, to welcome Prime Minister Modi, who later addressed a large gathering of Indian Origin Tamils at Norwood, in the presence of the Sri Lankan President, Sri Lankan Prime Minister, and a large number of community leaders. During the address, the Prime Minister spoke of the contributions of the Indian Origin Tamil community to Sri Lanka, and the long shared heritage between India and Sri Lanka. 

 

The Prime Minister also met representatives of the Ceylon Workers Congress, and the Tamil Progressive Alliance.

 

Following are some key excerpts from the Prime  Minister's address to an estimated audience of about 30,000 people, mostly Indian Origin Tamils in Central Sri Lanka:

 

It is a great pleasure to be here today. 

 

And, I am most grateful for your warm and enthusiastic welcome.

 

It is a tremendous honour to be the first Indian Prime Minister ever to visit this beautiful region of Sri Lanka.

But, it is a greater honour to have the opportunity to speak with you. 

 

People the world over are familiar with famous Ceylon Tea that originates in this fertile land. 

 

What is less known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes the Ceylon Tea the brew of choice for millions around the globe.  

 

If Sri Lanka today is the third largest exporter of tea, it is because of your hard work.

 

It is your labour of love which is instrumental in Sri Lanka meeting almost 17% of the world’s demand for tea, and earning more than 1.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange. 

 

You are that indispensable backbone of the thriving Sri Lankan tea industry that justly prides itself on its success and global reach today. 

 

Your contribution is deeply valued across Sri Lanka and beyond. 

 

I for one truly appreciate your hard work. 

 

You and I have something in common.

 

As some of you may have heard, I have a special association with tea. 

 

Chai pe Charcha, or discussions over tea, is not just a slogan. 

 

Rather, a mark of deep respect for the dignity and integrity of honest labour.

 

Today, we remember your forefathers.

 

Those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey of their life from India to then Ceylon. 

 

Their journey may have been uphill and their struggles hard, but they never gave up. 

 

Today, we remember and salute that spirit. 

 

 

Your generation also faced relentless hardships.

 

You encountered the stiff challenge of making your own mark and identity in a newly independent nation. 

 

But, you faced them boldly; you fought for your rights, but you did so peacefully. 

 

We will never forget leaders like Saumiyamurthy Thondaman, who worked hard for your rights, for your upliftment and economic prosperity. 

 

Kaniyan Pungunranar, a Tamil Scholar had declared more than two millennia ago, Yaathum Oore; Yavarum Kelir, meaning “Every town is hometown and all people are our kin”.

 

And, you have captured the true spirit of that saying.

 

You have made Sri Lanka your home. 

 

You are an intrinsic part of the warp and the weft of the social fabric of this beautiful nation. 

 

You are the children of Tamil Thai. 

 

You speak one of the oldest-surviving classical languages in the world. 

 

It is a matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala.

 

And, language is much more than a tool for communication. 

 

It defines a culture, forges relationships, joins communities and acts as a strong unifying force. 

 

There is no better sight than a multilingual society living in peace and harmony. 

 

Diversity calls for celebration; and not confrontation. 

 

Our past has always been harmoniously inter-woven. 

 

Several Buddhist texts including Jataka tales mention Saint Agastya, whom many consider to be the father of Tamil language. 

 

The Sinhalese Nayak Kings of Kandy had matrimonial alliances with the Nayak Kings of Madurai and Tanjore. 

 

Sinhala and Tamil were the court languages. 

 

Hindu and Buddhist shrines were both respected and revered.

 

We need to strengthen, not separate, these threads of unity and harmony. 

 

And, you are perhaps best placed to lead such efforts and make your contribution.

 

I come from the State of Gujarat in India, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi. 

 

Almost 90 years ago, he visited this beautiful part of Sri Lanka, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Bandarawela and Hatton. 

 

Gandhiji’s first and only visit to Sri Lanka was about spreading the message of socio-economic development.

 

In commemoration of that historic visit, the Mahatma Gandhi International Centre was set up with Government of India assistance at Matale in 2015. 

 

Another national icon of India from later years, Puratchi Thalaivar MGR  was born on this very soil, establishing a life-long connection.

 

And, in more recent times, you have gifted to the world one of the finest spinners in cricket, Muthiah Muralitharan. 

 

 

Your progress is our pride. 

 

We take much joy from your accomplishments in various walks of life. 

 

We rejoice in the success of the Indian-origin diaspora as they leave a mark across the world, near and far. 

 

I look forward to many more shining successes. 

 

You form an important link between Indian and Sri Lankan people and government. 

 

We see you as part of seamless continuum of our ties with this beautiful country. 

 

It is my Government’s priority to nurture these links.

 

And, shape our partnership and engagement in a manner that ultimately contributes to the progress of all Indians and all Sri Lankans, and also touches your lives. 

 

You have kept your bonds with India alive. 

 

You have friends and relatives in India. 

 

You celebrate Indian festivals as your own. 

 

You have soaked our culture and made it your own. 

 

India beats in your hearts.

 

And, I am here to tell you that India fully reciprocates the warmth of your sentiment. 

 

We will continue to work tirelessly for your socio-economic upliftment in all possible ways.  

 

I am aware that the Government of Sri Lanka is taking active steps to improve your living conditions, including a 5-year National Plan of Action. 

 

India will fully support their efforts in this direction. 

 

India has also undertaken many projects for your well-being, together with Sri Lankan Government, particularly in education, health and community development sectors. 

 

The Ceylon Estate Workers Education Trust (CEWET) was set up way back in 1947 in order to encourage promising students to continue their studies. 

 

Under this, we offer around 700 scholarships annually to students for studying in Sri Lanka and India. 

 

Your children have benefited from this.

 

In the area of livelihood and capacity building, we have set up vocational training centres and 10 English language training centres and labs to help impart suitable skill sets. 

 

Similarly, we have helped set up computer and science labs in plantation schools. 

 

We are also upgrading a number of plantation schools.

 

Just a while ago, President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I dedicated to the people a new 150-bed hospital complex in Dickoya, which has been constructed with Indian assistance. 

 

Its state-of-the-art facilities will cater to the health care needs of the region.

 

I am also pleased to announce that we have decided to extend the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service, currently in operation in Western and Southern Provinces, to all the other Provinces as well.

 

We are also happy to share with you India's holistic healthcare traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda.

 

As we celebrate the International Day of Yoga next month, we look forward to your active participation in popularising its multiple benefits.

 

As part of the innovative Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka, 4000 houses are being constructed in upcountry areas. 

 

I am happy that for the first time, beneficiaries are also being given ownership of the land on which the houses are being built.

 

To continue our commitment in this area, I am delighted to announce the construction of an additional ten thousand houses in upcountry areas under this project. 

 

Earlier today, I announced direct Air India flights from Colombo to Varanasi. 

 

With this, you would be able to visit Varanasi with ease and seek the blessings of Lord Shiva.

 

The Government and people of India are with you in your journey towards peace and greater prosperity. 

 

We will help you overcome the challenges of your past to realise the promise of your future. 

 

As the great poet Thiruvalluvar said, “Wealth will find its own way to the man of unfailing energy and efforts”. 

 

I am confident that it will be a bright future that matches the dreams and potential of your children and your heritage.

 

Thank you, Nandri. 

 

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Opening Ceremony of the International Vesak Day Celebrations at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo.

 

The Prime Minister was greeted on arrival at the venue by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. Ceremonial Drummers and Traditional Dancers welcomed Prime Minister Modi, who lit a ceremonial lamp at the entrance of the auditorium.

 

The function began with the recital of the 5 Buddhist precepts. The welcome speech was delivered by Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, Sri Lankan Minister for Buddha Sasana and Justice.

""For us in Sri Lanka, you are one of us, he said, addressing Shri Narendra Modi. 

 

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said it is a matter of great fortune, that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is present here today. He spoke of the ancient ties between the two nations, and said that Prime Minister Modi's presence at the Vesak Day event today is of great significance, and will be taken note of, by the entire world. He brings a message of friendship and peace, the President added. 

 

Prime Minister Modi, in his address, described Vesak as the most sacred of days, when humanity reveres the birth, enlightenment and Parinirvana of Lord Buddha. He added that it is a day to reflect on the supreme truth and timeless relevance of Dhamma, and the four noble truths. 

 

The Prime Minister said he was grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, and the people of Sri Lanka, for inviting him as the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivities in Colombo.

 

""On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyak-sambuddha, the perfectly self awakened one,"" the Prime Minister said. 

 

Placed below are some key excerpts from the Prime Minister's speech:

 

Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe.

 

Lord Buddha's first sermon in Varanasi, which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament, set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.

 

Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism.

 

Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy.

 

The divine fragrance of Buddhism spread from India to all corners of the globe.

 

Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashoka made their journey from India to Sri Lanka as Dhamma-Doot to spread the biggest gift of Dhamma.

 

Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.

 

Centuries later, Anagarika Dharmapala undertook a similar journey, but this time, from Sri Lanka to India, to revive the spirit of Buddha in the land of its own origin.

 

In some way, you took us back to our own roots.

 

The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.

 

Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate this unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism.

 

A heritage that connects our societies across generations and through centuries.

 

The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the ""Great Master"".

 

Buddhism imparts an ever present radiance to our relationship.

 

As close neighbours, our relationship spreads across many layers.

 

It draws its strength as much through our interconnected values of Buddhism as it does from the limitless possibilities of our shared future.

 

Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our people and in the fabric of our societies.

 

To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year, Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.

 

This will ease travel to the land of Buddha for my brothers and sisters from Sri Lanka, and help you directly visit Sravasti, Kusinagar, Sankasa, Kaushambi and Sarnath.

 

My Tamil brothers and sisters will also be able to visit Varanasi, the land of Kashi Viswanath.

 

I believe we are at a moment of great opportunity in our ties with Sri Lanka.

 

An opportunity to achieve a quantum jump in our partnership across different fields.

 

And, for us, the most relevant benchmark for the success of our friendship is your progress and success.

 

We are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters.

 

We will continue to invest in driving positive change and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation.

 

Our strength lies in sharing our knowledge, capacity and prosperity.

 

In trade and investment, we are already significant partners.

 

We believe that free flow of trade, investments, technology, and ideas across our borders will be to our mutual benefit.

 

India’s rapid growth can bring dividends  for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.

 

In infrastructure and connectivity, transport and energy, we are poised to scale up our cooperation.

 

Our development partnership stretches across nearly every sector of human activity such as agriculture, education, health, resettlement, transport, power, culture, water, shelter, sports, and human resources.

 

Today, India’s development cooperation with Sri Lanka amounts to US Dollars 2.6 billion.

 

And, its only aim is to support Sri Lanka in realizing a peaceful, prosperous and secure future for its people.

 

Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lanka is linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.

 

Because, whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.

 

My conversations with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickramasinghe have only reinforced our will to join hands in achieving our common goals.

 

As you make  important choices for the harmony and progress of your society, you will find in India a friend and partner that will support your nation-building endeavours.

 

Lord Buddha’s message is as relevant in the twenty first century as it was two and a half millennia ago.

 

The Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.

 

Its universality and evergreen nature are striking.

 

It has been a unifying force among nations.

 

The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.

 

The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace, chosen for the Vesak day, resonate deeply with Buddha's teachings.

 

The themes may appear independent.

 

But, they are both deeply interdependent and interconnected.

 

The issue of Social justice is linked to conflict within and among communities.

 

This arises principally because of Tanhaa, or Trishna in Sanskrit, the thirst, which in turn stems from greed.

 

Greed has driven the mankind to dominate and degrade our natural habitat.

 

Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.

 

Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today is not necessarily from conflict between the nation states.

 

It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.

 

The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.

 

Sadly, these ideologies of hate and their proponents in our region are not open to dialogue and hence only open to causing death and destruction.

 

I firmly believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world.

 

And, not just a notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.

 

But, an active peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on Karuna (compassion) and Pragya (wisdom).

 

 

As Buddha said, ""there is no higher bliss than peace"".

 

On Vesak, my hope is that India and Sri Lanka will work together to uphold the ideals of Lord Buddha and promote values of peace, accommodation, inclusiveness, and compassion in the policies and conduct of our governments.

 

This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.

 

On the blessed day of Vesak, let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth.

 

And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world.

 

As the verse 387 of Dhammapada says:

 

The sun shines by the day,

The moon lights up the night,

The warrior shines in his armour,

The Brahmin shines in his meditation,

But, the awakened one shines all day and night by his radiance.

 

Thank you once again for the honour to be with you.

 

I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.

 

May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.

Namaskaar.Ayubuvan.

Vesak is most sacred of days.

A day for humanity to revere the birth, the enlightenment and the Parinibbana of Lord Buddha, the ""Tathagatha"". A day to rejoice in Buddha. A day to reflect on the supreme truth and timeless relevance of Dhamma, and the four noble truths.

A day to contemplate the ten perfections of दान (generosity); सील (proper conduct); नेख्ख्म (renunciation); पिंन्या (wisdom); वीरि (energy); ख्न्न्ती (tolerance); सच्च (truthfulness); अदित्ठान (determination); मेत्ता (loving kindness) and उपेख्खा (equanimity).

It is a day of enormous significance for you here in Sri Lanka, for us in India, and for Buddhists around the world. And, I am most grateful to Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, Excellency Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honour to be the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivities in Colombo. On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyaksambuddha,the perfectly self awakened one.

Excellencies, and Friends,

Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings. Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe. Lord Buddha's first sermon in Varanasi,which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament,set in motion the wheel of Dhamma. Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism.

Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashoka made their journey from India to Sri Lanka as धम्मा दूत to spread the biggest gift of धम्मा.

And, as Buddha had himself said: सब्ब्दानामधम्मादानं जनाती, meaning, the gift of धम्मा is the biggest gift of all. Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning. Centuries later,Anagarika Dharmapala undertook a similar journey, but this time, from Sri Lanka to India to revive the spirit of Buddha in the land of its origin. In some way, you took us back to our own roots. The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.

Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends,

Lord Buddha’s message is as relevant in the twenty first century as it was two and a half millennia ago. The मध्यम प्रतिपदा , the Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us. Its universality and evergreen nature is striking. It has been a unifying force among nations. The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.

The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace,chosen for the Vesak day,resonate deeply with Buddha's teachings. The themes may appear independent. But, they are both deeply interdependent and interconnected. The issue of Social justice is linked to conflict within and among communities. This arises principally because of तन्हा or (तृष्णा in Sanskrit), the thirst, which in turn stems from greed . Greed has driven the mankind to dominate and degrade our natural habitat. Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.

Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today may not be necessarily from conflict between the nation states.

I firmly believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world.

And, not just a negative notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict. But, a positive peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on compassion and wisdom. As Buddha said,""नत्तीसंतिपरणसुखं"", ""there is no higher bliss than peace"". On Vesak, my hope is that India and Sri Lanka will work together to uphold the ideals of Lord Buddha and promote values of peace, accommodation, inclusiveness, and compassion in the policies and conduct of our governments. This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.

On the blessed day of Vesak, let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth. And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world.

As the verse 387 of Dhammapada says:

दिवातपतिआदिच्चो,रत्तिंगओभातिचंदिमा.
सन्न्द्धोखत्तियोतपति,झायीतपति ब्राह्मणों.
अथसब्बमअहोरत्तिंग,बुद्धोतपतितेजसा.

Meaning:

The sun shines by the day,
The moon lights up the night,
The warrior shines in his armour,
The Brahmin shines in his meditation,
But, the awakened one shines all day and night by his radiance.

Thank you once again for the honour to be with you.

I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon. May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.

Thank you, Thank you very much

The Prime Minister offered flowers at the altar of the Temple. Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Wickramsinghe together pressed a switch for the lamp-lighting ceremony on the eve of Vesak Day, characterised by brilliant multi coloured lights and a fireworks display.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will be visiting Sri Lanka on 11th and 12th May, 2017. 

In a post from his Facebook account the Prime Minister said: 

""I will be in Sri Lanka for a two-day visit starting today, 11th May. This will be my second bilateral visit there in two years, a sign of our strong relationship. 

During my visit, I will join the International Vesak Day celebrations in Colombo on 12th May, where I will interact with leading Buddhist spiritual leaders, scholars and theologians. It is my honour to join these celebrations with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 

My visit brings to the fore one of the most abiding links between India and Sri Lanka- the shared heritage of Buddhism. 

During my last visit in 2015, I had the opportunity to visit Anuradhapura, a UNESCO world heritage site and a leading centre of Buddhism for centuries. This time, I will be privileged to pay respect at the revered Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, also known as the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. 

My visit will commence in Colombo with a visit to the Seema Malaka at the Gangaramayya temple where I will take part in the traditional lamp lighting ceremony. 

I will be meeting with President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and other eminent dignitaries. 

I will also visit the up country region of Sri Lanka where I will inaugurate the Dickoya Hospital that has been built with Indian assistance, and have an interaction with the Indian-origin Tamil community. 

I will be sharing more from Sri Lanka on social media. You can watch all my programmes in Sri Lanka live on the ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App.’""

                सभाग्रह में उपस्थित सभी आदरणीय वरिष्‍ठ सुप्रीम कोर्ट के judges, बाहर के मित्रों, भाइयों और बहनों, 

आज बुद्ध पूर्णिमा है। इस बुद्ध पूर्णिमा के पावन पर्व पर मेरी आपको और देशवासियों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं। देश बदल रहा है, छुट्टी है, हम लोग काम कर रहे हैं। आज 10 मई का एक और भी महत्‍व है, 1857 का स्‍वतंत्रता संग्राम देश की आजादी का एक बहुत बडा व्‍यापक संघर्ष का प्रारंभ 10 मई, आज शुरू हुआ था। 

आज आधुनिकता की ओर एक और कदम वो भी न्‍यायव्‍यवस्‍था की तरफ से हो रहा है। मैं चीफ जस्टिस साहब और उनकी पूरी टीम को हद्य से बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं, अभिनंदन करता हूं। वैसे तो हम इलाहाबाद में एक कार्यक्रम में मिले थे, तो चीफ साहब ने बड़ा ही विस्‍तार से आंकड़ों का एक पूरा चित्र वहां प्रस्‍तुत किया था वहां सबके सामने और देश में जो cases बाकी पड़े है pendency हैं और उन्‍होंने देश की Judiciary को अपील की थी कि आप vacation का कुछ समय दीजिए। एक तो वो सुनना ही मेरे लिए बहुत आनंददायक था वहां बैठकर के और बड़ा प्रेरक था और मुझे खुशी है कि मुझे कई जगह से खबरें आ रही है कि बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में हाई कोर्ट में, सुप्रीम कोर्ट में judges अपने vacation को कम करके इस देश के गरीबों के लिए अपना समय देने वाले हैं, मैं इसके लिए आपका बहुत आभारी हूं। Quantum के रूप में इसका परिणाम क्‍या आता है वो अलग बात है लेकिन इस प्रकार का भाव पूरे वातावरण को बदल देता है। एक sense of responsibility को बल देता है और सामान्‍य मानवी के मन में भी एक नया विश्‍वास पैदा होता है और ‘New India’ के लिए नया विश्‍वास भी उतना ही आवश्‍यक है और मैं इसके लिए हद्य से आप सबका बहुत आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं।

आज हम technology के संबंध में सरकार का जो अनुभव है, मैंने राज्‍य में भी काम किया है यहां भी काम किया है, सरकारें या सरकार से जुड़ी हुई सारी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं दुर्भाग्‍य से technology का हमारा बड़ा सीमित अर्थ रहा वो hardware से रहा, hardware खरीदना, hardware बसाना, उसी को हमने technology मान लिया। कई दफ्तरों में आप जाएंगे तो पहले के जमाने में टेबल पर एक flower-pot रहता था, बड़ा अफसर आए तो बड़ा ताजे फूलों वाला रहता था। छोटा अफसर आए तो थोड़ा छोटा, लेकिन Flower-pot रहता था। युग बदल गया आधुनिकता आई तो Flower-pot की जगह बढि़या सा computer रहता है, न उसने उसको कभी खोला है, न कभी हाथ लगाया है, लेकिन बड़ा अच्‍छा लगता है। इसलिए समस्‍या technology की कम है, बजट की भी कम है mind-set is a problem. अब आज बुद्ध पूर्णिमा हैं तो भगवान बुद्ध की एक बात बड़ी प्रेरक है, वो हमेशा कहते थे कि मन बदले, मत बदले, मंतव्‍य बदले तभी बदलाव की शुरूआत होती है। भगवान बुद्ध का एक बड़ा ही प्रेरक संदेश है ये। और उस अर्थ में आज भी हमने देखा है कि हर किसी को लगता है कि अब छ: महीने हो गए मोबाइल फोन का मॉडल पुराना हो गया जरा नया मॉडल ला दें, कितना ही नया मॉडल लाएगा फिर भी उसकी जेब में contact list की डायरी रहती है। जबकि मोबाइल फोन में contact list की पूरी व्‍यवस्‍था है फिर भी उसकी डायरी रहती है क्‍योंकि हम दोस्‍तों के बीच में बैठते हैं तो हाथ में मोबाइल तो अच्‍छा होना चाहिए और green या red button से ज्‍यादा कुछ पता नहीं होता है। हम इतने, हमारी स्थिति ऐसी है कि हम बदलते कैसे नहीं हैं हम किसी को अगर SMS करते हैं बाद में फोन करते हैं, मेरा SMS मिला। चुनौती software में नहीं है, चुनौती hardware में भी नहीं है और इसके लिए एक सामूहिक मन बनाना पड़ता है एक chain अगर टूट गई तो process अटक जाती है। किसी को लगा कि मैं... अब देखिए हममें से कोई including myself जब तक अखबार हाथ में लेकर के अखबार नहीं पढ़ते तब तक मजा नहीं आता है। अखबार पड़ा ऐसा रहता है आज के बच्‍चे अखबार को छूते नहीं है यूं-यू करते हुए दुनिया भर की खबर लेकर के आ जाते हैं। तो ये जो बदलाव है इस बदलाव के साथ अपने आप को जोड़ना और ये एक environment create करना पड़ता है, तब जाकर के होता है जी। एकाध व्‍यक्ति का interest होगा वो करता रहेगा तो एकदम से पूरी व्‍यवस्‍था में isolate हो जाता है। 

और इसलिए अभी चीफ साहब मुझे कह रहे हैं कि हम अभी एक प्रकार से Training का लगातार discussion का काम कर रहे हैं ताकि ये नीचे तक कैसे percolate हो इसके लिए हम प्रयास कर रहें हैं technology की ताकत बड़ी अदभुत है जो इसको अनुभव करेगा उसको अंदाज आएगा कि इसको कैसे उपयोग में लाना चाहिए। शुरू में उसको बड़ा डर लगता है कि यार ये मेरे बस का रोग नहीं है। आपने देखा होगा आप घर में बहुत बढि़या VCR ले आए हैं, बढि़या टीवी ले आए हैं, लेकिन आपका पोता जब आपको कुछ समझ में नहीं आता तो पोते को बुलाते हो अरे देखो यार कैसे ये अटक गया तो वो ठीक कर देता है यानि इतना बड़ा gap है generation का इस सारे मामले में। 

और इसलिए इसको cop-up करना, एक generation के लिए थोड़ा कठिन है, लेकिन अगर वो generation इसको cop-up नहीं करेगी तो नीचे percolate होना impossible है। और इसलिए ये सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है, इसके साथ जुड़ी हुई है। 

मेरे हिसाब से E-Governance, Easy-Governance, Effective Governance, Economical Governance, Environment Friendly Governance हम इस e-Governance को जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में कैसे लाएं? अब जो हम एक कागज A-4 size का एक कागज उपयोग करते हैं Research कहता है कि A-4 size का एक कागज पूरी प्रक्रिया के दरम्‍यान 10 लीटर पानी consume करता है। 10 लीटर पानी ... इसका मतलब ये हुआ कि मैं अगर इस Paper-less दुनिया की ओर जाता हूं, तो मैं कितनी बड़ी आने वाली पीढि़यों की सेवा करना वाला हूं। मैं कितने जंगल बचाऊंगा, मैं कितनी बिजली बचाऊंगा, जब मैं बिजली बचाऊंगा तो मैं कितने बड़े environment के issues को address करुंगा, यानि एक प्रकार से ये व्‍यवस्‍था की अपनी एक ताकत है। लेकिन जब तक उस पूरे स्‍वरूप को हम नहीं जानते तब तक छोड़ो यार ये मेरा काम नहीं है। अगर हम इसको इसके व्‍यापक रूप में भी लोगो को provoke करेंगे, ये कोई पहले का सब बुरा था, और पुराना था, और ये करता है वही आधुनिक है, इस रूप में इसको देखने की इसको जरूरत नहीं है, ये बहुत ही सरल है, बहुत ही उपयोगी है और आज के समय में जब समय की कठिनाई है तो कम समय में करने वाला काम इससे होता है। 

सरकार में by and large हमारा अनुभव ये है कि हम लोग ये मानते हैं, हमारे विभाग ये मानते है कि हम जो करते हैं बहुत अच्‍छा है। हमारी कोई गलतिया नहीं, होती हमारी कोई कमिया नहीं होती हैं। स्‍वाभाविक है जो जहां काम करता है वो ये मानता ही है। अभी दो महीने पहले जरा मैंने जरा एक रिस्‍क लिया मैंने सब डिपार्टमेंट को कहा कि आप मुझे बताए कि आपके यहां आपको लगता है कुछ कठिनाईया हैं, कुछ गलत हो रहा है या इसको ठीक करना है या कुछ process को simplify करना है, जरा दिखाइये? कुछ दिन तो नहीं-नहीं साहब हमारा सब बढि़या चल रहा है, कुछ खास problem नहीं है। मैं पीछे लगा रहा तो करीब 400 issues को identify किया अलग-अलग department का on date कि जिसमें सुधार की जरूरत थी या कुछ न कुछ intervention की जरूरत थी। अब बाद में मैंने Universities को ये काम दिया खासकर के 18 से 20-22 साल की उम्र के बच्‍चों को, कालेज के बच्‍चों को दिया और उनका एक हैकाथान का कार्यक्रम बनाया है 36 hours nonstop एक ही छत के नीचे बैठकर के काम करना और उसके solution ढूढ़ना, 400 issues उनको दे दिए सरकार के। 42,000 बच्‍चों ने इसमें हिस्‍सा लिया more then hundred universities & colleges ने उसमें भाग लिया और 36 hours nonstop एक ही छत के नीचे बैठकर के उन्‍होंने exercise की। I was surprised अधिकतम issues के solutions उन्‍होंने दिए हैं। Process के solutions दिए हैं। ज्‍यादातर फिर सरकार के साथ उनका interface हुआ, सरकार को उन्‍होंने बताया कि देखो इसका रास्‍ता ये है, इसका ये है। कई department ने इसको adopt भी किया है। और ये पिछले दो महीनें में ही हो चुका है। इसका मतलब हुआ कि हमारे पास इतना बड़ी संभावनाएं हैं, अगर हम कोशिश करें। और मैं जो चाहता हूं कि आप भी देश के technology की field के students को ऐसे अगर issue देंगे उनको कहें के ढूंढ के लाओ रास्‍ता क्‍या निकल सकता है रास्‍ता, क्‍या हो सकता है, क्‍या software बन सकता है, कैसी technique काम आ सकती है मैं विश्‍वास से कहता हूं कि वो इतना बढि़या चीजें देते हैं और solution देते हैं हम सरलता से उसको accept कर सकते हैं मायने स्‍वीकार कर सकते हैं। और मेरा मत है कि IT+IT = IT अब ये arithmetic वालों के भी काम नहीं है। जब मैं कहता हूं बड़े विश्‍वास से कहता हूं IT+IT = IT means Information Technology + Indian talent = India Tomorrow ये सामर्थ्‍य है इसमें। इस सामर्थ्‍य का हम उपयोग करके कैसे आगे बढें। 

अब एक जमाना था जबकि currency terracotta के, मिट्टी के coin बनते थे दुनिया चलती थी। वक्‍त बदल गया कभी तांबे के सिक्‍के आए, कभी चांदी के आए, कभी सोने के आए, कभी चमड़े के आए, धीरे-धीरे करके कागज के आए। अभी ये बदलाव हमीं लोगों ने स्‍वीकार किया युग के अनुसार अब वक्‍त आ चु‍का है कि अब कागज वाली currency का वक्‍त जा रहा है अब digital currency हमको हमारे स्‍वभाव को बनाना पड़ेगा। 

मैं इन दिनों खासकर के 8 नवंबर के बाद जिस क्षेत्र में मेरा कोई अनुभव नहीं था उसमें जरा ज्‍यादा interest लेने का मौका आया Digital Currency के लिए, Demonetization का दिन था 8 नवंबर। और मैनें अनुभव किया कि नोट छापना, उसको सुरक्षित रखना, उसको पहुंचाना transportation, अरबों खरबों रुपयों का खर्च है जी एक ATM को संभालने के लिए एक.. एक ATM को संभालने के लिए छ:-छ: पुलिस वाले लगते हैं जी। जबकि technology available है जेब में एक currency न हो तो भी आप अपना गुजारा कर सकते हैं इतनी technology आज उपलब्‍ध है। हम अगर जैसे सरकार initiative लेकर के BHIM App बनाया है। एक रुपये का खर्चा नहीं है, आप अपने मोबाइल पर डाउनलोड कीजिए, सामने वाले के पास हो, अपना कारोबार शुरू कर दीजिए, कोई problem नहीं है। देश के अरबों खरबों रुपये अगर बचेंगें तो किसी न किसी गरीब के घर बनाने के लिए, गरीब बच्‍चों की शिक्षा देने के लिए काम आना वाला हैं। 

Technology पूरे economical atmosphere को change कर सकती है, ये ताकत है इसकी। हम इसको किस प्रकार से उपयोग में लाए और जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में हम इसको किस प्रकार से प्रयोग लाए हमने प्रयास करना चाहिए। मेरा स्‍वयं का अनुभव है कि बहुत तेजी से इसका महात्‍मय लोगो की समझ में आने लगा है। अगर खुद को नहीं आता है तो एक हम नौजवान रख लेते हैं, देखो भई तुम मुझे मेरे इस काम में assist करो, मुझे आदत नहीं है लेकिन तुम करो वो कर देता है। आज हम जिस technology के युग में जी रहें है शायद हजार साल में technology ने जो रोल play किया होगा, पिछले तीस साल में उससे हजार गुना ज्‍यादा technology ने रोल play किया है। जो काम हजार साल में नहीं हुआ है, वो तीस साल में हुआ है। और आज जो हो रहा है यहां से निकलने के बाद वही technology हो सकता है out dated हो जाए इतनी तेजी से technology बदल रही है, बहुत दूर तक दिन होंगे जबकि Artificial Intelligence dominate करेगा। Artificial Intelligence का पूरा field पूरी मानव जात को drive करने वाला है। Job बचेगी कि नहीं बचेगी उसका debate होगा, driver-less car आएगी, Artificial Intelligence से चलने वाली कार आने वाली है। ड्राइवर का क्‍या होगा? क्‍या Artificial Intelligence आने के बाद भी job-creation की संभावना है क्‍या? और जो उसके expert हैं उनका कहना है कि Artificial Intelligence के बाद job-creation की भारी संभावनाए बढ़ने वाली हैं। पूरा विश्‍व एक नई सोच की ओर जाने वाला है। उसके लिए नई generation तैयार होने वाली है। यानि जगत कितनी तेजी से बदल रहा है, technology मनुष्‍य को जिस प्रकार से drive कर ले जा रहा है, अगर हम उसके साथ अपने आप को थोड़ा सा भी cop-up नहीं रखगें, तो फासला इतना बढ़ जाएगा कि फिर हम इतने irrelevant हो जाएगें कि हमें कोई पूछेगा तक नहीं ये अवस्‍था दूर नहीं है। 

और इसलिए Space Technology हम लोग आज हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में Space Technology and Science में बड़ी इज्‍जत कमाई है, दुनिया में हमारी प्रतिष्‍ठा बनी हैं। हम जो Mars में गए दुनिया को वहां पर first trial में कोई सफल नहीं हुआ था, भारत first trial में सफल हुआ। और खर्चा कितना हुआ आज अगर हम टेक्‍सी किराए पर लेते हैं एक किलोमीटर का मानों 10 रूपया 11 रूपया होता है हम Mars पर गए एक किलोमीटर 7 रूपये में गए। और दुनिया में हॉलीवुड की फिल्‍म का जो खर्च होता है, उससे कम बजट में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान ने Mars success किया है आज ये हमारे Scientists की talent की कमाल है, ये हमारे देश के वैज्ञानिकों का सामर्थ्‍य है। लेकिन दुर्भाग्‍य से इतना बड़ा Space Technology भारत की इतनी बड़ी achievements, लेकिन applicable science में हम, Science को apply करने की दिशा में हम बहुत पीछे पड़ गए हैं। मेरे यहां आने के बाद मैंने एक workshop किया सभी Joint Secretaries का कई दिनों तक किया Department-wise किया Space Technology का Governance में कैसे उपयोग होता है। आज हम रोड बनाते हैं, तो ऐसे-ऐसे बनाते हैं। Space Technology का उपयोग करिए तो आप minimum curves के साथ straight-way road बना सकते हैं, आप design कर सकते हैं और सारी चीजें कर सकते हैं। मुझें tribal को rights देना था जमीन का। मैंने Space Technology का उपयोग किया। और मुझे कोई proof की जरूरत नहीं थी, Space Technology से मैं सीधे कर सकता था कि ये Forest land है, जो कभी farming के लिए आती थी, 15 साल के पुराने फोटोग्राफ से, मैं तय कर सकता हूं कि यदि उसका right बनता है, हम उसको provide कर सकते हैं। 

आज Justice System में जितनी खासकर के Criminal Justice के field में, न्‍याय की संभावना बढ़ गई है क्‍योंकि technology बहुत बड़ा support कर रही है। मोबाइल फोन ऐसे सबूत छोड़ कर के जाता है कि आपको evidence के लिए एकदम से scientific सुविधाए मिल जाती हैं। Forensics Science का बहुत बड़ा रोल हो रहा है! Accident के मसले CCTV Camera के फुटेज से आप Judgement देने के नतीजे पर पहुँच जाते हैं। कहने का तात्‍पर्य है कि पूरी Judiciary System को और अधिक सक्षम बनाना, और सरल बनाने में technology Forensics Science बहुत बड़ा role play कर सकती है। हम जितनी तेजी से इन चीजों को adopt करेंगे, हम बड़े सटीक निर्णय देंगे। 

अब कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता था किक्रेट पहले umpire तय करता था हारा कि जीता। अब third umpire तय करता है कि भई तुम्‍हारा बाल सही था, पकड़े नहीं पकड़े, वो बता देता है, तो ऊपर से light कर देता है। अब कोई कहेगा umpire की नौकरी चली गई, umpire की नौकरी नहीं चली गई efficiency आई है। और इसलिए मैं समझता हूं कि technology के संबंध में हम जितनी सरलता के साथ उसको स्‍वीकारगें उतनी सरलता से मुझे जरूर लगता है कि इसका बहुत ही लाभ मिलने वाला है। 

अभी रविशंकर जी pro-bono की बात कर रहे थे। मैं जरूर इसका आप सबके सामने उल्‍लेख करना चाहूंगा। ये जो हमारे देश में सोच है, ये देश के नागरिक ऐसे हैं, लोग ऐसे हैं, लोगों को तो अपना ही है, ये reality नहीं हैं। ये देश का मिजाज हम पहचानें, देश का मिजाज अलग है। ये platform ऐसा नहीं, मैं उदाहरण देने जा रहा हूं, उचित है लेकिन फिर भी वो ज्‍यादा suitable है इसलिए मैं दे रहा हूं, मुझे क्षमा करना, 2014 का जो इलेक्‍शन हुआ है। मेरी पार्टी ने मुझे प्रधानमंत्री के रूप में, उम्‍मीदवार के रूप में मुझे प्रस्‍तुत किया था, सामने भी कांग्रेस की पार्टी के लोग चुनाव लड़ रहे थे और उस चुनाव के पहले आपको मालूम होगा दिल्‍ली में एक बहुत बड़ी मी‍टिंग हुई थी कांग्रेस पार्टी की। और देश का पूरा ध्‍यान था कि वो क्‍या लेकर के देश के सामने आते हैं देश में चुनाव के लिए और जब प्रेस कांफ्रेंस हुआ था तो उन्‍होनें कहा था कि हमने निर्णय किया है कि 9 गैस की cylinder की बजाय 12 cylinder देंगे, यानि 2014 का चुनाव एक तरफ 9 cylinder और 12 cylinder इस तरफ था और दूसरी तरफ अलग ही वो एक। मैं उस समय की दृश्‍य की इसलिए याद दिलाता हूं, अब आप देखिए कि technology के बारह जिस देश में 9 और 12 cylinder की debate लोकसभा तक भविष्‍य तय करने के लिए हो रही थी, सरकार बनने के बाद मैंने देशवासियों से एक छोटी सी अपील की थी, लालकिले पर से और मैंने कहा था कि भाई अगर आप कोई afford कर सकते हैं तो आप सब्सिडी छोड़ दीजिए ना! इतना सा कहा और मैं आज बड़े गर्व के साथ कहता हूं कि मेरे देश के एक करोड़ 20 लाख परिवारों ने गैस की सब्सिडी surrender कर दी। हमने अपनी सोच के कारण 9 और 12 में हम उलझे थे, उनकी ताकत क्‍या है कभी उसको हमने address ही नहीं किया था जी। 

एक बार मैंने डाक्‍टरों से अपील की थी कि आप के पास बहुत काम होगा बहुत patient होंगें जब एक काम मेरी मदद कर सकते हैं क्‍या? मैंने कहा हर महीना 9 तारीख को कोई भी गरीब pregnant women आपके दरवाजे पर आएगी आप बिना फीस लिए उस गरीब pregnant मां की चिंता करिए। आपको जानकर के आनंद होगा कि इस देश के हजारों gynecologists doctors ने अपने अस्‍तपताल के बाहर बोर्ड लगाया है और नौ तारीख को वो बिना charge लिए गरीब pregnant women को सेवा करते हैं, उनको मदद करते हैं उनको guide करते हैं, दवाई करते हैं। 

जब मैं गुजरात में था बड़ा भंयकर भूकंप आया था, मैंने इंजीनियरिंग के students को कहा था छ: महीने के लिए समय दिजिए। बहुत बड़ी मात्रा में इंजीनियरिंग के students आए थे और मिशन तक मेरे साथ काम करने को खड़े हो गए थे। आज मैं देश की Legal fraternity को, खासकर के मेरे वकील मित्रों से आग्रह कर रहा हूं ये जो pro-bono की क्रमश: हमने एक App तैयार किया है आप अपने आप को register करवाइए किसी गरीब को मदद चाहिए तो मैं गरीब के लिए मुफ्त में तैयार हूं। एक पूरा देश में movement खड़ा हो गरीबों को legal help करने के‍ लिए हम आगे आएं। और ये एक technology का कमाल है कि ये pro-bono के द्वारा व्‍यवस्‍था खड़ी की गई हैं। Technology से आप उसमें register कर सकते है, technology के माध्‍यम से जो requirement वाला है वो आ सकता है, या हमारे छोटे-मोटे organization हैं उनके द्वारा link up कर सकते हैं, लेकिन एक नया initiative अगर मेरे देश के गरीब, विधवा रिटायर टीचर वो जाकर के कतार में खड़ी रहकर के गैस सेलेंडर की सब्सिडी surrender कर सकती हैं, मेरे देश का Gynecologist doctor नौ तारीख को गरीब मां की सेवा करने को तत्‍पर रहता है, मेरे देश का नौजवान आपदा के समय अपने इंजीनियरिंग skill को लगा देने के लिए तैयार होता है, मेरे देश के IT का professional मैं उसको कहूं कि 36 घंटे खाये-पिये बिना एक छत के नीचे आ जाओ और देश की समस्‍याओं के समाधान के लिए कोई रास्‍ते निकालनें आ जाओ और 42 thousand नौजवान 36 घंटें के लिए 400 समस्‍याओं के समाधान के लिए रास्‍ता खोजते हैं, मुझे विश्‍वास है मेरे देश के वकील भी मेरे के गरीबों की मदद करने के लिए इस technology के माध्‍यम से आगे आएगे, और देश का भविष्‍य बदलने के लिए काम आएगें। 

इसी अपेक्षा के साथ ये जो नया काम आपने शुरू किया है, खान्विलकर जी को मैं बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं, बधाई देता हूं चीफ साहब का मैं बहुत अभिनंदन करता हूं। मैं मानता हूं Digital India की दिशा में, न्‍याययिक व्‍यवस्‍था में technology का आना अपने आप में बहुत सेवा करेगा। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                All the hon’ble judges of Supreme Court present here in the auditorium, brothers and sisters and friends from outside.  

Today is Buddha Purnima. I wish all of you and our countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima. India is changing, today is holiday and we are working. The 10th May is important for one more reason; India’s big freedom struggle of 1857 had started on May 10.  

One more step towards modernity that too from the Judicial System of the country, is being taken today. I offer my sincere congratulations and respect to the Chief Justice of India and his entire team. CJI had presented a detailed account of the status of country’s judicial system and pendency of the cases when we had met in Allahabad last time, he had also appealed to the judiciary to spare time during the vacation period. I was extremely happy to hear about the appeal, listening to the appeal while sitting there was very inspiring. I’m happy to note that several high court and Supreme Court judges are going to cut short their vacation to spare time for the country’s poor, I am grateful to you people for this. Its outcome in the strict terms of the quantum of work done is a separate issue, however, this kind of commitment brings changes in the entire environment. It enforces a sense of responsibility and instils a new confidence in an ordinary person; and this new confidence is equally essential for a New India. I offer my sincere respect to all of you for this.

I have worked in both state and the centre. However, unfortunately, we had a very limited understanding of technology for governments or government related system, it was namely equated to hardware, procurement and installation of hardware and for us that was the technology. If you visit an office, during the earlier times, there used to be a flower-pot on the tables, flowers used to place in the pot during the visit of senior officers. Flower pot used to be a common feature then, there would be a smaller flower pot during the visits of junior officers. That era has changed, in modern time that flower pot has been replaced by a computer; it feels good even if we never open it or never use it. Therefore it’s less of a problem of technology or budget; but the mindset is a problem. Today, on the occasion of Buddha Purnima there is a very inspirational story associated with Lord Buddha; He used to say that any change only begins when someone changes his mind, changes his opinion and changes his world view. It’s a very inspirational message of Lord Buddha. And in that sense, we can experience this thing even today that people start looking for a new mobile hand set within six months of the purchase, and plan to buy a new one, irrespective of the latest model that he gets, he will always have a diary of contacts in his pocket. People keep diaries despite the full facility of contact list in their mobile phones. We want to keep good phones in our hands due to peer pressure even if we may not know more than two functions of green or red button. It’s difficult to change old habits, sometimes we call the people after sending an SMS to them to find out whether they had received the SMS or not. Software is not a challenge, even hardware is not a challenge but we need to change ourselves collectively because the entire process comes to a standstill if just one link is broken. Someone may feel that....you see, many of us, including myself, don’t enjoy reading news unless we have a print edition of the newspaper in our hand. Today’s generation, despite the easy availability of printed edition of news papers, doesn’t even bother about them but they are fully aware about all the news in the world. People need to connect with these changes and create conducive environment only then these things can be done. If someone does it due to personal interest then he will be isolated in the entire system.

That’s why the Chief Justice of India informed me that you people are regularly discussing the issue of training so that it could percolate down. The power of technology is immense, whosoever experiences this, he would know that how to take advantage of it. People are afraid of technology in its early days. However, you must have experienced this when you buy a latest VCR or a television set and if you get stuck somewhere then you take help of your grandson to solve it; and he solves it, so there is a huge generational gap in this entire affair.

That’s why it’s difficult for a generation to cope-up with these changes, however, it’s impossible for the technology to percolate down if that generation does not cope-up with this. And this is the biggest challenge with this problem.

According to me, how can we adopt this E-Governance; that is Easy-Governance, Effective Governance, Economical Governance, Environment Friendly Governance, in every sphere of our lives? According to some research, production of a single leaf of A-4 size paper consumes 10 litres of water in the entire process. 10 litres of water, it means that I will be doing a great service to the future generations if I move forward in the direction of a paperless world. How many forests will I save, how much electricity will I save, and I will be addressing a big environmental issue if I’m able to save electricity; this is the inherent power of the system. However, we tend to ignore technology if we don’t have a comprehensive knowledge of them; we simply leave them by saying that it’s not for me. And there is no need to present it in a manner that whatever a particular person does only that is modern; and whatever was old was bad. This is extremely easy, extremely useful in a time when there is a paucity of time, technology takes less time.

In the government, there is a broad feeling that whatever we do or our departments do that is very good; there is a general feeling that we don’t commit mistakes and don’t have shortcomings either. It’s natural that people broadly believe in these things in their area of work. I took a risk around two months back by asking all the departments to inform me about the difficulties faced by them, about something that was wrong that needed to be corrected or if there was a need to simplify a process.  For a few days, they continued to deny the problems; they said everything was fine.

However, due to my relentless pursuit of the matter some 400 issues have been identified where there was a need for improvement or some intervention was required. Then, I gave this task to universities, specially, to the youth, in the age group of 18 to 20-22, it’s given to college students in form of a nonstop hackathon of thirty six hours, they were required to find out the solution for the 400 issues of governance. More than 300 colleges and universities, forty-two thousand students participated in this exercise and they sat for nonstop thirty six hours under one roof to complete the exercise. I was surprised that they were able to sort out the most issues and gave solutions for the processes. Then they had an interaction with the government, they informed us that this is the solution for this, this is the solution for that problem. Several departments have adopted them and this was done in the last two months only. This means that if we make effort then we have immense possibilities. And if you ask our students in the field of technology, give them such problems and ask them to find solutions, to find a way, ask them whether a software can be developed, what technique can be used then I can say with confidence that they give us the best solutions that can be easily accepted by us, can be easily assimilated by us.  I believe in IT+IT, and it doesn’t require someone with expertise in arithmetic. When I say It+IT then I say it with confidence that IT+IT means Information Technology + Indian talent = India Tomorrow, this is the strength of IT+IT. How can we utilise this prowess in our development.

There was a time when our currency was made of terracotta; coins made of earth were used world over. With the changing time, coins made of copper, coins made of silver and gold were in circulation, even coins made of leather were used, but gradually they were replaced by paper notes. And we have accepted these changes; and the time for paper based currency is in its last days and we will have to adopt digital currency.

These days, particularly after November 8, I got the opportunity to take more interest in the areas hitherto unknown to me, like digital currency; the eighth November was the date of demonetisation. And I know that printing of currency, its security, its transportation involves expenditure of billions of Rupees; sometimes half a dozen policemen are deployed to guard one ATM. It’s at a time when technology is available; you can survive without a single paper note in your pocket that kind of technology is today available. The government took initiative to develop BHIM App. You don’t have to spend a single Rupee, you can just download in your mobile phone; if the other person also has it then you can start your business without any problem. If this saves the country billions of Rupees then this money will be utilised in providing housing to poor, in providing education to the children of disadvantaged people.


Technology is so powerful that it can completely transform the economy. We should make effort to utilise it, we should make effort to use the technology in every sphere of our life. I’ve experienced this thing first hand that people quickly understand its importance. If we can’t do it ourselves, then we hire a youth, ask him to assist us, and he helps us out. Today we’ve been living in an era of such kind of technology; the modern technology developed in the last three decades has played thousand times more important role in the society in comparison with the role played by the technology in the last millennium. What could not be done in the last thousand years was done in just thirty years. Whatever technology is being used here today that may become redundant by the time we step out, this is the pace of technological development; that day is not far away when artificial intelligence will dominate the world.

The entire field of artificial intelligence is going to drive the mankind. It will be debated whether it will affect jobs; driverless car will be a reality; car driven by artificial intelligence is going to soon become reality. What will happen to driver? Whether artificial intelligence will result in creation of jobs? Experts say that artificial intelligence has a potential of massive job creation. The entire world is going to move towards a new thinking. A new generation is getting ready for that. This world is changing so fast, technology is driving mankind in such a manner that if we could not cope-up with these rapid changes then this gap will be so wide that would make us so irrelevant that we will lose our value; that day is not far away.

We have earned respect in the field of space technology, India is respected world over in the field of space technology and science. Nobody in the world succeeded in reaching to Mars in the first attempt; but we reached on Mars, India succeeded in the first attempt. And how much money we spent? Suppose today we hire a taxi on a rent of Rs 10-11 per kilometre, in this case we just spent seven rupees of global average on our Mars mission. India spent less money on its Mars mission than the budget of a Hollywood film; this is the miracle performed by our scientific talent, this is the prowess of Indian scientists. However, this is unfortunate that we lag behind in utilising India’s scientific prowess in the field of space technology in applied sciences. I conducted a department wise workshop with all the joint secretaries after coming to Delhi as how to utilise space technology in governance. Today we build roads with plenty of curves. You can build roads with minimum number of curves, a straight road by using space technology, you can design; you can do all such things. When I wanted to give land rights to tribal people, I resorted to the use of space technology. I did not require any proof, I could do it with the help of space technology that this is forest land that was used for farming; with the help of 15 year old photographs I could decide that we can give him the title of the land if he was cultivating the land.

Today, the potential for justice delivery has increased in the judicial system, particularly in the field of criminal justice due to the support provided by technology. A mobile phone provides such stuff that you people can get scientifically valid evidence easily. Forensic science is gaining importance these days. You can arrive at a decision in an accidental case by using CCTV footage of the incident; technology and forensic science can play a very big role in strengthening and simplifying the entire judicial system. Our decisions will be as better, and as accurate as fast we adopt these changes.

Could anybody imagine, earlier umpire used to decide who wins, who loses a cricket match. Now a days it is decided by the third umpire, he decides whether the ball was proper or not even if the umpire may have missed it, but the third umpire informs about this, he signals the light. Someone may say that umpire has lost his job, the umpire has not lost his job but has gained efficiency. According to me, if we adopt the technology easily, it will be equally easier for us to reap its benefits.

Ravishankar ji was just now talking about the pro-bono work. I must discuss this issue with you people. This mentality in our country that the people of this country, citizens of this country are only concerned with their self-interest is not correct. We must recognise the nature of this country; this country has a different nature.  

Well, kindly pardon me. May be this is not the right occasion, but it is apt. hence permit me to share an example. During the 2014 General Elections my party had projected me as the Prime Ministerial candidate; you would recall that Congress had also organised a very high level meeting. Nation was waiting to hear their manifesto for 2014 elections. During their Press Conference they had declared that now people will be getting 12 cooking gas cylinders against the 9 that they were entitled to previously.  Amazingly, for them election manifesto and gas subsidy seemed pitched against each other.

I am forced to remind you of that incident because, unfortunately, Lok Sabha was debating the issue of increasing the number of subsidised gas cylinders to decide the future of the nation. After forming the government, in my address to the nation from The Lal Qila, I implored to those who can afford- how about give up their gas subsidy? I had requested just as much! And, I am proud to say that more than 1.2 Crores of my dear citizens gave up their gas subsidy; and here, due to our polarised thinking, we were embroiled in the debate of 9 or 12 cylinders and disregarded the power of the citizens.

Once I had also appealed to our doctors that while you must be enjoying a flourishing profession, why not help me too! On 9th of every month, you must promise me that you will provide free consultation to any pregnant women who visit you on that day. You will be delighted to know that several conscious gynaecologists promptly declared this outside their clinics and hospitals and pledged to provide free consultation and medicines to pregnant women visiting them on 9th of every month.

When I was in Gujarat, the state had once suffered a devastating earthquake. Then I had requested the engineering students to dedicate six months to support in rehabilitating the state. The mission was strengthened by the overwhelming response from the students.  Similarly, today I urge the legal fraternity of the country, especially my lawyer friends, to register in the pro bono app and pledge free legal aid to the poor community. Technology interventions in judiciary will help you register in these inclusive initiatives of the government by linking small organisations in nation development process.

When an old retired, widowed teacher stands in long queues to surrender the gas subsidy; a responsible gynaecologist is fervent to serve a mother-to -be on the 9th of the month; the young enthusiastic engineers apply their skills during disaster management; our IT professionals agree to brainstorm relentlessly for hours together to arrive at solution to a critical issue; if 42 thousand youth spend 36 hours looking for solutions of approximately 400 national issues, it definitely augurs well for the nation. I trust our lawyer fraternity will also, similarly, make good use of these technological interventions and contribute in the upliftment of the poor and deprived. Such endeavours are bound to alter the national fabric for good.

With this expectation, I extend my heartfelt wishes to the chief Khanvilkar ji. I believe that taking the Digital India forward, this intervention of technology in judicial system is itself a great service to the nation.  Thank you very much!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today uploaded the Integrated Case Management Information System on the Supreme Court website, which marks the introduction of digital filing – a step towards paperless Supreme Court.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Justice of India, Shri Justice J.S. Khehar, recalled the Sesquicentennial Celebrations of Allahabad High Court on 2nd April this year. He said that on that day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made a strong case for introducing technology to ease the working of courts. Explaining the benefits of the digital filing application, the Chief Justice of India described this initiative as the biggest leap towards introducing technology in the judicial system.

 

Making a presentation on the application, Shri Justice Khanwilkar said the new initiative would be an illustration of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.”

 

Union Minister for Law and Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad appreciated the Supreme Court for this digital innovation. 

 

In his remarks on the occasion, the Prime Minister greeted the gathering on the occasion of Buddha Purnima. He also recalled that today – 10th May – marks the anniversary of the beginning of the First War of Independence in 1857.

 

The Prime Minister recalled the Chief Justice of India’s appeal at Allahabad on 2nd April, for the higher judiciary to take up hearings of cases on at least some days during the vacation. He said the appeal was inspirational, and he has heard very encouraging news in this regard from the Supreme Court and the High Courts. He said this spirit brings about a positive change, and engenders a sense of responsibility. He added that it also creates trust among the common people, which is the key to ‘New India.’

 

The Prime Minister said that technology had often been equated to hardware in the past, and therefore, it is important to bring about a change in mindset. He said technology can only be embraced collectively within an institution. He said paperless initiatives save the environment, and are therefore a great service for future generations.

 

Speaking of the benefits of technology, the Prime Minister recalled the recently organized “Hackathon,” where 400 issues across Ministries in the Government of India were identified, and 42,000 students from Indian Universities spent 36 hours in an attempt to solve them. He said that Ministries were adapting many of the outcomes of this exercise.

 

The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the combination of “Information Technology” and “Indian Talent” would create “India Tomorrow.”

 

Dwelling on the theme of technology, the Prime Minister spoke of the implications and possibilities that “Artificial Intelligence” could bring about.

 

The Prime Minister mentioned several occasions in the recent past, when people from various walks of life had come forward to help the poor. In this context, he recalled the success of the “Give-It-Up” movement to give up LPG subsidy. Similarly, he mentioned the initiative taken by doctors across the country to treat poor pregnant women free of cost on the 9th of every month. In the same vein, he urged lawyers to come forward to provide pro-bono legal aid to the poor and needy.

 

Shri Justice Dipak Misra and Shri Justice J Chelameswar were also present on the occasion.

The Government of India attaches the highest priority to job creation. India suffers from a lack of reliable, timely data on employment which has made it difficult for policy makers and independent observers to assess the extent of employment generation at different points of time. Some data is collected and published by certain agencies including the Labour Bureau, but the coverage is very small. The Labour Bureau data covers only a few sectors and the methodology is not based on updated panel of survey respondents. The net result has been that both policy making and analysis are conducted in a data vacuum. 

In view of the importance of timely and reliable data on employment, the Prime Minister has directed the Prime Minister’s Office and concerned Ministries to come up with a solution to fill this long standing gap in the country’s statistical architecture. Accordingly a task force has been created under the chairmanship of the Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog Dr. Arvind Panagriya with Labour Secretary Ms. Sathiyavathy, Secretary Statistics Dr. T.C.A. Ananth, Prof. Pulak Ghosh of NITI Aayog and Shri Manish Sabharwal (Member RBI Board) as members. The Task Force will recommend solutions which can be implemented in a time bound manner. The Prime Minister has directed that this task be expedited so that policies on employment can be formulated with a proper appreciation of impacts, based on credible data.

25 leaders from the Muslim Community, under the umbrella of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today. 

Welcoming the delegation, National Security Advisor, Shri Ajit Doval, said that the whole world is looking at India today, and it is the responsibility of all segments of Indian society to take the nation forward. 

Leaders from the delegation agreed with Shri Doval. They said that the objective should be to take the country forward, together, following the Prime Minister’s call of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.

Welcoming the members of the delegation, the Prime Minister said that democracy’s greatest strength is harmony and amity (मेल मिलाप). Emphasizing that the Government does not have any right to discriminate among citizens, the Prime Minister said that India’s speciality has been its unity in diversity. He said that the new generation in India must not be allowed to fall victim to the rising global tide of extremism. 

On Triple Talaq, the Prime Minister reiterated that the Muslim community should not allow this issue to be politicized, and urged the assembled gathering to take the responsibility for initiating reform in this regard.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Monday reviewed progress of key infrastructure sectors including petroleum and natural gas, power, renewable energy and housing. The review meeting, which came soon after the review of connectivity-related infrastructure sectors in the last week of April, lasted for about three hours, and was attended by top officials from PMO, NITI Aayog and all infrastructure Ministries of the Government of India. 

In course of the presentation made by CEO NITI Aayog, it was noted that remarkable progress has been made in several sectors, including generation of renewable energy, affordable and rural housing, LED bulbs etc.

The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has benefited 1.98 crore BPL households so far. The contribution of gas to the primary energy mix has risen to 8%. 81 cities are being covered under City Gas Distribution networks.

The Prime Minister called for greater emphasis on ethanol blending, and evolution of mechanisms so that farmers can benefit the most from this process. He said that setting up of 2nd generation bio-ethanol refineries should be expedited, to utilize agricultural residues for this purpose.

The rural electrification programme is proceeding swiftly, with over 13,000 villages electrified out of a total of 18,452, and is on track for completion within the targeted 1000 days. Over 22 lakh rural BPL households were electrified in 2016-17, and over 40 crore LED bulbs were distributed in the same period. The total inter-regional transmission capacity has been significantly enhanced, with 41 GigaWatts transmission capacity being added from May 2014 to April 2017.

The total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 GigaWatts, with an increase of 24.5% being registered in the last fiscal year. The capacity addition in solar energy in FY17 was the highest-ever, at 81%. Solar and wind tariffs have now achieved grid parity, with rates well below 4 rupees per Kilowatt-Hour. The Prime Minister called for establishment of some model solar cities, where the power requirement is fulfilled solely by solar energy. A similar effort can be made to make certain localities kerosene-free, he added. 

The Prime Minister emphasized that manufacturing of solar equipment should be given priority, to drive employment generation, and derive maximum benefit from the renewable energy drive.

Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, remarkable progress has been achieved in rural areas. IT and space-based applications are being extensively used to monitor progress of the scheme. Over 32 lakh houses have been completed in rural areas in FY17. The Prime Minister enquired about the training and skills being given to rural masons, who were involved with this scheme. 

Seeking a consolidated approach to various schemes, such as electrification, IT networks and housing, the Prime Minister called for a focused approach on the 100 worst performing districts in each case. He directed that future reviews should focus on problems at the district-level, so that the progress of poorly performing districts can be better monitored.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Centenary Celebrations of Bharat Sevashram Sangha through video conference. The event is being organized at Shillong.

Welcoming the Prime Minister on the occasion, the General Secretary of Bharat Sevashram Sangha, Sreemat Swami Biswatmananda ji Maharaj, spoke of the glorious spiritual and service traditions of India.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister recalled the time that he had worked with the Bharat Sevashram Sangha in Gujarat. He conveyed his best wishes on the occasion to the Bharat Sevashram Sangha, which he said, combined the virtues of service (seva) and labour (shram).

He said the work of the organization in the North-East, and during the time of disasters, has been especially praiseworthy.

The Prime Minister explained the significance of serving the poor and the needy, as described in the scriptures.

He said Swami Pranavananda, the founder of Bharat Sevashram Sangha, had spoken of social justice a century ago, and established the Sangh for this purpose.

The Prime Minister said a myth has been sought to be created in recent times that “service” and “spirituality” are two different things. He said the Bharat Sevashram Sangha has been able to dispel this myth, through its work.

The Prime Minister said that societal development through 'Bhakti', 'Shakti' and 'Jan Shakti' was achieved by Swami Pranavananda.

The Prime Minister urged the Bharat Sevashram Sangha to work towards “Swachhagrah” – or cleanliness, especially in North-Eastern India. He spoke of the Government’s resolve to develop the North-East, and added that focus on connectivity and infrastructure could help develop the North-East to become a gateway to South-East Asia.

Sreemant Swami Ambareeshananda ji Maharaj, who had worked with the Prime Minister in Gujarat, and who was mentioned by the Prime Minister during his address, proposed the vote of thanks on the occasion.

Following are the excerpts of the Prime Minister’s address:

दिल्ली और शिलॉन्ग के बीच लगभग 2 हजार किलोमीटर की दूरी है लेकिन तकनीक ने इस दूरी को मिटा दिया है। पिछले वर्ष मई के महीने में ही मैं शिलॉन्ग गया था।

आज जब वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंस के माध्यम से आप सभी से बात करने का अवसर मिला है, तो कई स्मृतियां ताजा हो गई हैं।

गुजरात में मुझे भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के अध्यक्ष रहे स्वर्गीय स्वामी अक्षयानंद जी महाराज के साथ काम करने का अवसर मिला था।

मंच पर उपस्थित स्वामी अम्बरीशानंद जी महाराज जी तो गुजरात यूनिट के अध्यक्ष रहे हैं। स्वामी गणेशानंद जी के अनुभवों से भी मुझे बहुत कुछ सीखने का मौका मिला है।

आचार्य श्रीमत स्वामी

प्रणबानंद जी महाराज द्वारा स्थापित भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने इस वर्ष अपनी यात्रा के 100 वर्ष पूरे किए हैं।

सेवा और श्रम को भारत निर्माण के लिए साथ लेकर चलने वाले संघ के सभी सदस्यों को मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं।

किसी भी संस्था के लिए ये बहुत गौरव का विषय है कि उसकी सेवा का विस्तार, सौ वर्ष पूरे कर रहा हो। विशेषकर उत्तर पूर्व के राज्यों में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के जन-कल्याणकारी कार्य बहुत प्रशंसनीय रहे हैं।

बाढ़ हो या सूखा, या फिर भूकंप भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सदस्य पूरी तन्मयता से पीड़ितों को राहत पहुंचाते नजर आते हैं।

संकट के समय जब इंसान को मदद की सबसे ज्यादा आवश्यकता होती है, तो स्वामी प्रणबानंद के शिष्य सब कुछ भूलकर सिर्फ और सिर्फ मानव सेवा में जुट जाते हैं।

पीड़ित मनुष्य की सेवा तो हमारे शास्त्रों में तीर्थाटन की तरह मानी गई है।

कहा गया है-

एकत: क्रतव: सर्वे सहस्त्र वरदक्षिणा अन्यतो रोग-भीतानाम् प्राणिनाम् प्राण रक्षणम्

यानि- एक ओर विधि-पूर्वक सब को अच्छी दक्षिणा दे कर किया गया यज्ञ कर्म तथा दूसरी ओर दु:खी और रोग से पीड़ित मनुष्य की सेवा करना यह दोनों कर्म उतने ही पुण्य-प्रद हैं।

साथियों,

स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने अपनी अध्यात्मिक यात्रा के चरम पर पहुंचने पर कहा था कि-

ये समय महा मिलन,

महा जागरण,

महा मुक्ति और

महा समान न्याय का है।

इसी के बाद उन्होंने भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की नींव रखी थी।

1917 में स्थापना के बाद जिस सेवाभाव के साथ इस संस्था ने काम शुरू किया था, उससे बडौदा के महाराजा सयाजीराव गायकवाड़ भी बहुत प्रभावित हुए थे।

महाराजा सयाजीराव गायकवाड़ स्वयं जिस अथक परिश्रम से लोगों के उत्थान के लिए कार्य करते थे, वो जगजाहिर है। वो लोककल्याण के कार्यों की चलती फिरती संस्था की तरह थे। इसलिए श्रीमत स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी के देशभर में भेजे सेवादूतों को उन्होंने जमीनी स्तर पर कार्य करते देखा, तो उनकी प्रंशसा किए बिना नहीं रह सके।

जनसंघ के संस्थापक, श्रद्धेय डॉक्टर श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी तो स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी को अपने गुरु की तरह मानते थे। डॉक्टर मुखर्जी के विचारों में स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी के विचारों की झलक भी मिलती है।

राष्ट्र निर्माण के जिस विजन के साथ स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने अपने शिष्यों को अध्यात्म और सेवा से जोड़ा, वो अतुलनीय है।

जब 1923 में बंगाल में सूखा पड़ा,

जब 1946 में नोआखली में दंगे हुए,

जब 1950 में जलपाईगुड़ी में बाढ़ आई,

जब 1956 में कच्छ में भूकंप आया, जब 1977 में आंध्र प्रदेश में भीषण चक्रवात आया,

जब 1984 में भोपाल में गैस त्रासदी हुई, तो भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के लोगों ने पीड़ितों के बीच रहकर उनकी सेवा की।

हमें ध्यान रखना होगा कि ये वो समय था

जब देश में डिजास्टर मैनेजमेंट को लेकर एजेंसियां उतनी अनुभवी नहीं थी।

प्राकृतिक आपदा हो या इंसान के आपसी संघर्ष से पैदा हुआ संकट,

हर मुश्किल घड़ी में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने, उससे निपटने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई।

बीते कुछ वर्षों की बात करें तो जब 2001 में गुजरात में भूकंप आया,

2004 में सुनामी आई,

2013 में उत्तराखंड में त्रासदी आई,

2015 में तमिलनाडु में बाढ़ आई, तो भारत सेवाश्रम के सदस्य सबसे पहले पहुंचने वाले लोगों में से एक थे।

भाइयों और बहनों,

स्वामी प्रणबानंद कहा करते थे-

“बिना आदर्श के जीवन मृत्यु के समान है।

अपने जीवन में उच्च आदर्श स्थापित करके ही कोई भी व्यक्ति मानवता की सच्ची सेवा कर सकता है”।

आपकी संस्था के सभी सदस्यों ने उनकी इन बातों को अपने जीवन में उतारा है।

आज स्वामी प्रणबानंद जहां कहीं भी होंगे, मानवता के लिए आपके प्रयासों को देखकर बहुत प्रसन्न होंगे।

देश ही नहीं विदेश में भी प्राकृतिक आपदा आने पर भी भारत सेवाश्रम के सदस्य लोगों को राहत देने के लिए पहुंच जाते हैं।

इसके लिए आप सभी का जितना अभिनंदन किया जाए, उतना कम है।

हमारे शास्त्रों में भी कहा गया है-

आत्मार्थम् जीव लोके अस्मिन् को न जीवति मानवः।

परम परोपकार आर्थम यो जीवति स जीवति॥

यानि इस संसार में अपने लिए कौन मनुष्य नहीं जीता है परन्तु जिसका जीवन परोपकार के लिए है उसका ही जीवन, जीवन है।

इसलिए परोपकार के अनेक प्रयासों से सुशोभित आपकी संस्था को सौ वर्ष पूरे होने पर फिर बधाई।

साथियों,

बीते कुछ दशकों में देश में एक मिथक बनाया गया कि अध्यात्म और सेवा के रास्ते अलग-अलग हैं।

कुछ लोगों द्वारा ये बताने की कोशिश की गई कि जो अध्यात्म की राह पर है, वो सेवा के रास्ते से अलग है।

आपने इस मिथक को ना सिर्फ गलत साबित किया है बल्कि अध्यात्म और भारतीय मूल्यों पर आधारित सेवा को एक साथ आगे बढ़ाया है।

आज देशभर में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की सौ से ज्यादा शाखाएं और पाँच सौ से ज्यादा इकाइयां स्वास्थ्य सेवा, शिक्षा और नौजवानों को ट्रेनिंग देने के कार्य में भी जुटी हुई हैं। भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने साधना और समाज सेवा के संयुक्त उपक्रम के तौर पर लोकसेवा का एक मॉडल विकसित किया है।

दुनिया के कई देशों में ये मॉडल सफलतापूर्वक चल रहा है। संयुक्त राष्ट्र तक में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के कल्याणकारी कार्यों की प्रशंसा हुई है।

स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी महाराज पिछली शताब्दी में देश की आध्यात्मिक चेतना की रक्षा करने वाले, उसे स्वतंत्रता आंदोलन से जोड़ने वाले कुछ एक महान अवतारो में से एक थे।

स्वामी विवेकानंद और महर्षि अरबिंदों की तरह ही उनका नाम पिछली शताब्दी के महान संतों में लिया जाता है। स्वामी जी कहते थे- “मनुष्य को अपने एक हाथ में भक्ति और एक हाथ में शक्ति रखनी चाहिए। उनका मानना था कि बिना शक्ति के कोई मनुष्य अपनी रक्षा नहीं कर सकता और बिना भक्ति के उसके खुद के ही भक्षक बन जाने का खतरा होता है”।

समाज के विकास के लिए शक्ति और भक्ति को साथ लेकर जनशक्ति को एकजुट करने का काम, जनचेतना को जागृत करने का काम उन्होंने अपनी बाल अवस्था से ही शुरु कर दिया था।

निर्वाण की अवस्था से बहुत पहले, जब वो स्वामी प्रणबानंद नहीं हुए थे, सिर्फ “बिनोद” थे, अपने गांव के घर-घर जाकर चावल और सब्जियां जमा करते थे और फिर उन्हें गरीबों में बांट देते थे। जब उन्होंने देखा कि गांव तक पहुंचने के लिए सड़क नहीं है तो सभी को प्रेरित करके उन्होंने गांव तक एक सड़क का निर्माण भी करवाया।

जात-पात, छुआ-छूत के जहर ने कैसे समाज को विभक्त कर रखा है, इसका ऐहसास उन्हें बहुत पहले ही हो गया था। इसलिए सभी को बराबरी का मंत्र सिखाते हुए, वो गांव के हर व्यक्ति को एक साथ बिठाकर ईश्वर की पूजा करते थे।

19वीं सदी के आखिरी में और 20वीं सदी के प्रारंभ में बंगाल जिस तरह की राजनीतिक गतिविधियों का केंद्र बना हुआ था, उस दौरान राष्ट्रीय चेतना जगाने के स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी के प्रयास और ज्यादा बढ़ गए थे।

बंगाल में ही स्थापित अनुशीलन समिति के क्रांतिकारियों को वो खुला समर्थन देते थे। अंग्रेजों के खिलाफ लड़ते हुए वो एक बार जेल भी गए। अपने कार्यों से उन्होंने साबित किया कि साधना के लिए सिर्फ गुफाओं में रहना आवश्यक नहीं, बल्कि जनजागरण और जनचेतना जागृत करके भी साधना की जा सकती है, ईश्वर को प्राप्त किया जा सकता है।

भाइयों और बहनों,

आज से सौ वर्ष पहले देश जिस मनोस्थिति से गुजर रहा था, गुलामी की बेड़ियों से, अपनी कमजोरियों से मुक्ति पाना चाहता था, उसमें देश अलग-अलग भूभागों पर जनशक्ति को संगठित करने के प्रयास अनवरत चल रहे थे।

1917 का ही वो वर्ष था, जब महात्मा गांधी ने चंपारण में सत्याग्रह आंदोलन का बीजारोपण किया। हम सभी के लिए ये सुखद संयोग है कि इस वर्ष देश चंपारण सत्याग्रह के सौ वर्ष का पर्व भी मना रहा है।

सत्याग्रह आंदोलन के साथ-साथ ही महात्मा गांधी ने लोगों को स्वच्छता के प्रति जागरूक भी किया था। आपकी जानकारी में होगा कि पिछले महीने चंपारण सत्याग्रह की तरह ही देश में स्वच्छाग्रह अभियान की शुरुआत की गई है। स्वच्छाग्रह यानि स्वच्छता के प्रति आग्रह। आज इस अवसर पर मैं स्वच्छाग्रह को भी आपकी साधना का अभिन्न अंग बनाने का आग्रह करना चाहता हूं। इसकी एक वजह भी है।

आपने देखा होगा अभी तीन-चार दिन पहले ही इस साल के स्वच्छ सर्वेक्षण में शहरों की रैंकिंग घोषित की गई है।

उत्तर-पूर्वी राज्यों के 12 शहरों का भी सर्वे किया गया था। लेकिन स्थिति बहुत अच्छी नहीं है। सिर्फ गंगटोक ऐसा शहर है जो पचासवें नंबर पर आया है। 4 शहरों की रैंकिंग सौ से दो सौ के बीच है और बाकी सात शहर 200 से 300 रैंक के दायरे में है। शिलॉन्ग जहां आप बैठे हुए हैं, वो भी दो सौ छिहत्तर (276) नंबर पर है।

ये स्थिति हमारे लिए, राज्य सरकारों के लिए और भारत सेवाश्रम संघ जैसी संस्थाओं के लिए चुनौती की तरह है। स्थानीय एजेंसियां अपना काम कर रही हैं लेकिन इनके साथ-साथ प्रत्येक व्यक्ति को ये ऐहसास कराया जाना बहुत आवश्यक है कि वो अपने आप में स्वच्छता मिशन का एक सिपाही है। हर व्यक्ति के अपने प्रयास से ही स्वच्छ भारत, स्वच्छ उत्तर-पूर्व के लक्ष्य को हासिल किया जा सकता है।

भाइयों और बहनों,

स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी महाराज कहते थे-

“देश के हालात को बदलने के लिए लाखों निस्वार्थ कर्मयोगियों की आवश्यकता है। यही निस्वार्थ कर्मयोगी देश के प्रत्येक नागरिक का मनोभाव बदलेंगे और उस बदले हुए मनोभाव में एक नए राष्ट्र का निर्माण होगा”।

स्वामी प्रणयानंद जी जैसी महान आत्माओं की प्रेरणा से देश में आप जैसे करोड़ों निस्वार्थ कर्मयोगी हैं। बस हम सभी को मिलकर अपनी ऊर्जा स्वच्छाग्रह के इस आंदोलन को सफल बनाने में लगा देनी है।

मुझे बताया गया है कि जब स्वच्छ भारत अभियान शुरू हुआ था, तब आप लोगों ने उत्तर पूर्व के पाँच रेलवे स्टेशनों का चयन किया था कि उन स्टेशनों में सफाई की जिम्मेदारी उठाएंगे, वहां हर पखवाड़े स्वच्छता अभिय़ान चलाया जाएगा। अब आपके प्रयासों को और ज्यादा बढ़ाए जाने की जरूरत है।

इस वर्ष जब आप सभी अपनी संस्था के गठन के सौ वर्ष मना रहे हैं तो इस महत्वपूर्ण वर्ष को क्या पूरी तरह स्वच्छता पर केंद्रित कर सकते हैं।

क्या आपकी संस्था जिन इलाकों में काम कर रही है, वहां पर पर्यावरण की रक्षा के लिए, पूरे इलाके को प्लास्टिक फ्री बनाने के लिए कार्य कर सकती है। क्या लोगों को जल संरक्षण और जल प्रबंधन के फायदों के प्रति लोगों को जागरूक कर सकती है।

क्या अपने लक्ष्यों को, संस्था के कुछ कार्यों को आप वर्ष 2022 से भी जोड़ सकते हैं। 2022 में भारत अपनी स्वतंत्रता के 75वें वर्ष में प्रवेश कर रहा होगा। इसमें अभी पाँच वर्ष का समय है और इस समय का उपयोग हर व्यक्ति, हर संस्था, को अपने आसपास व्याप्त बुराइयों को खत्म करके, पीछे छोड़कर आगे बढ़ने का प्रयास करना होगा।

साथियों,

आपको ज्ञात होगा कि 1924 में स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने देशभर में स्थित अनेक तीर्थ स्थलों का पुनुरुद्धार करवाया था।

तीर्थ शंकर नाम से कार्यक्रम शुरू करके, उस समय हमारे तीर्थ स्थलों से जुड़ी कमजोरियों को दूर करने का उन्होंने प्रयास किया था। आज हमारे तीर्थस्थलों की एक बड़ी कमजोरी अस्वच्छता है। क्या भारत सेवाश्रम संघ तीर्थ शंकर कार्यक्रम को स्वच्छता से जोड़ते हुए नए सिरे से शुरू कर सकता है।

इसी तरह आपदा प्रबंधन के अपने अनुभवों को भारत सेवाश्रम संघ कैसे ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगों तक पहुंचा सकता है, इस बारे में भी सोचा जाना चाहिए। हर वर्ष देश में हजारों जिंदगियां प्राकृतिक आपदा की वजह से संकट में आती हैं। प्राकृतिक आपदाओं के समय कैसे कम से कम नुकसान हो, इसी को ध्यान में रखते हुए पिछले वर्ष देश में पहली बार National Disaster Managment Plan बनाया गया है। सरकार बड़े पैमाने पर लोगों को जागरूक कर रही है, लोगों को मॉक एक्सरसाइज के जरिए भी डिजास्टर मैनेजमेंट के तरीकों के बारे में बताया जा रहा है।

साथियों,

आपकी उत्तर-पूर्व के राज्यों में सक्रियता और संगठन शक्ति का डिजास्टर मैनेजमेंट में बहुत उपयोग हो सकता है। आपकी संस्था आपदा के बाद और आपदा से पहले, दोनों ही स्थितियों से निपटने के लिए लोगों को तैयार कर सकती है।

इसी तरह जैसे स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने देशभर में प्रवचन दल भेजकर आध्यात्म और सेवा का संदेश देश-विदेश तक पहुंचाया, वैसे ही आपकी संस्था उत्तर पूर्व के कोने-कोने में जाकर, आदिवासी इलाकों में जाकर खेल से जुड़ी प्रतिभाओं की तलाश में प्रभावी भूमिका निभा सकती है। इन इलाकों में पहले से आपके दर्जनों स्कूल चल रहे हैं, आपके बनाए हॉस्टलों में सैकड़ों आदिवासी बच्चे रह रहे हैं, इसलिए ये काम आपके लिए मुश्किल नहीं होगा।

आप जमीन पर काम करने वाले लोग हैं, लोगों के बीच में काम करने वाले लोग हैं, आपकी पारखी दृष्टि खेल प्रतिभाओं को सामने लाने में मदद कर सकती है।

स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी कहते थे कि देश की युवाशक्ति जागृत नहीं हुई, तो सारे प्रयास विफल हो जाएंगे।

अब एक बार फिर अवसर आया है, सुदूर उत्तर-पूर्व में छिपी इस युवाशक्ति को, खेल की प्रतिभाओं को मुख्यधारा में लाने का। इसमें आपकी संस्था की बड़ी भूमिका हो सकती है।

बस मेरा आग्रह है कि आप अपनी इस सेवा साधना के लिए,

जो भी लक्ष्य तय करें,

वो measurable हो,

यानि जिसे आंकड़ों में तय किया जा सकता हो।

स्वच्छता के लिए आप उत्तर पूर्व के 10 शहरों तक पहुंचेंगे या 1000 गांवों तक पहुंचेंगे, ये आप खुद तय करें, डिजास्टर मैनेजमेंट के लिए 100 कैंप लगाएंगे या एक हजार कैंप लगाएंगे, ये आप खुद तय करें, लेकिन मेरा फिर आग्रह है, जो भी तय करें वो measurable हो।

2022 तक भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ये कहने की स्थिति में हो कि हमने सिर्फ अभियान नहीं चलाया,

बल्कि 50 हजार या एक लाख लोगों को इससे जोड़ा।

जैसे स्वामी प्रणबानंद जी कहा कहते थे कि-

“ हमेशा एक डायरी मेनटेन करनी चाहिए”,

वैसे ही आप भी संस्था की एक डायरी बना सकते हैं जिनमें लक्ष्य भी लिखा जाए और तय अंतराल पर ये भी लिखा जाए कि उस लक्ष्य को कितना प्राप्त किया।

आपका ये प्रयास,

आपका ये श्रम,

देश के निर्माण के लिए,

NEW INDIA के सपने को पूरा करने के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है।

श्रम को तो हमारे यहां सबसे बड़ा दान माना गया है और हमारे यहां हर स्थिति में दान देने की प्रेरणा दी जाती है।

श्रद्धया देयम्, अ-श्रद्धया देयम्,

श्रिया देयम्, ह्रया देयम्, भिया देयम्, सम्विदा देयम्

यानि व्यक्ति को चाहिए कि वो श्रद्धा से दान दे और यदि श्रद्धा न हो तो भी बिना श्रद्धा दान देना चाहिए।

धन में वृद्धि हो तो दान देना चाहिए और

यदि धन न बढ़ रहा हो तो फिर लोक लाज से दान देना चाहिए।

भय से देना चाहिए अथवा प्रेम से दान देना चाहिए।

कहने का तात्पर्य ये है कि हर परिस्थिति में मनुष्य को दान देना चाहिए।

साथियों,

उत्तर पूर्व को लेकर मेरा जोर इसलिए है क्योंकि स्वतंत्रता के बाद के इतने वर्षों में देश के इस क्षेत्र का संतुलित विकास नहीं हुआ है।

अब केंद्र सरकार पिछले तीन वर्षों से अपने संपूर्ण साधनों से,

संसाधनों से उत्तर पूर्व के संतुलित विकास का प्रयास कर रही है।

पूरे इलाके में कनेक्टिविटी बढ़ाने पर भी जोर दिया जा रहा है।

40 हजार करोड़ के निवेश से उत्तर-पूर्व में रोड इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर तैयार किया जा रहा है। रेलवे से जुड़े 19 बड़े प्रोजेक्ट शुरू किए गए हैं, बिजली की व्यवस्था सुधारी जा रही है, पूरे इलाके को पर्यटन के लिहाज से भी मजबूत किया जा रहा है।

उत्तर पूर्व के छोटे हवाई अड्डों का भी आधुनिकी- -करण किया जा रहा है। आपके शिलॉन्ग एयरपोर्ट में भी रनवे की लंबाई बढ़ाने को मंजूरी दे दी गई है।

बहुत जल्द ही उत्तर पूर्व को “उड़ान” योजना से भी जोड़ा जाएगा।

ये सारे प्रयास नॉर्थ-ईस्ट को साउथ-ईस्ट एशिया का गेटवे बनाने में मदद करेंगे।

साउथ-ईस्ट एशिया का ये खूबसूरत गेटवे अगर अस्वच्छ होगा, अस्वस्थ होगा, अशिक्षित होगा, असंतुलित होगा तो देश विकास के गेटवे को पार करने में पिछड़ जाएगा। साधनों और संसाधनों से भरपूर हमारे देश में कोई ऐसी वजह नहीं जो हम पिछड़े रहें, गरीब रहें।

सबका साथ- सबका विकास के मंत्र के साथ हमें सभी को सशक्त करते हुए आगे बढ़ना है।

हमारा समाज- समन्वय, सहयोग और सौहार्द से सशक्त होगा

हमारा युवा- चरित्र, चिंतन और चेतना से सशक्त होगा

हमारा देश- जनशक्ति, जनसमर्थन और जनभावना से सशक्त होगा

इस परिवर्तन के लिए, हालात बदलने के लिए, New India बनाने के लिए हम सभी को, करोड़ों निस्वार्थ कर्मयोगियों को, भारत सेवाश्रम संघ जैसी अनेकोनेक संस्थाओं को मिलकर काम करना होगा। इसी आह्वान के साथ मैं अपनी बात समाप्त करता हूं।

एक बार फिर भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सभी सदस्यों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं।

बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद !!!

                देवियो और सज्‍जनों,

 दिल्‍ली और शिलांग के बीच लगभग 2000 किलोमीटर की दूरी है। लेकिन तकनीक ने इस दूरी को मिटा दिया है। पिछले वर्ष मई के महीने में ही मैं शिलाँग आया था, आज जब video conference के माध्‍यम से आप सभी से बात करने का अवसर मिला है, आपके आशीर्वाद पाने का अवसर मिला है तो अनेक विगत समृतियां ताजा होना बहुत स्‍वाभाविक है। गुजरात में मुझे भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सदस्‍य स्‍वर्गीय स्‍वामी अक्षयानंद जी महाराज के साथ बहुत निकट वात्‍सल्‍य का अवसर मिला, काम करने का मौका मिला था। मंच पर उपस्थित स्‍वामी अम्बरीशानंद जी, उनके सभी बाल काले थे; तब से जानता हूं। कई वर्षों तक उनके एक मित्र भाव से उनके साथ काम करता रहा। स्‍वामी गणेशानंद जी, कई वर्ष हो गए मिलना नहीं हुआ है लेकिन उनको भी भली भांति मेरा, उनके साथ भी निकट संपर्क रहा। आचार्य श्रीमत स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी महाराज, जिन्‍होंने भारत सेवा संघ की स्‍थापना की। इस वर्ष सेवा यात्रा के 100 वर्ष पूरे हो रहे हैं। सेवा और श्रम को भारत के निर्माण के लिए साथ-साथ लेकर चलने वाले संघ के सभी सदस्‍यों को मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं हैं।

 किसी भी संस्‍था के लिए ये बहुत ही गौरव का विषय है कि उसकी सेवा का विस्‍तार 100 वर्ष पूरे कर रहा हो। और विशेषकर उत्‍तर-पूर्व के राज्‍यों में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने जन-कल्‍याणकारी कार्य बहुत ही प्रशंसनीय रहे हैं। बाढ़ हो या सूखा, या फिर भूकंप; भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सदस्‍य पूरी तन्‍मयता से, सेवा भाव से, पीढि़तों को राहत पहुंचाते नजर आते हैं। संकट के समय जब इंसान को मदद की सबसे ज्‍यादा आवश्‍यकता होती है तो स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी के शिष्‍य सब कुछ भूल करके सिर्फ और सिर्फ मानव-सेवा में जुट जाते हैं। पीडि़त मनुष्‍य की सेवा तो हमारे शास्‍त्रों में तीर्थाटन के रूप में मानी जाती है। कहा गया है :-

 एकत: क्रतव: सर्वे सहस्त्र वरदक्षिणा अन्यतो रोग-भीतानाम् प्राणिनाम् प्राण रक्षणम्

 यानी एक ओर विधिपूर्वक सब को अच्‍छी दक्षिणा दे करके किया गया यज्ञ कर्म और दूसरी तरफ दुखी और रोग से पीडि़त मनुष्‍य की सेवा करना, ये दोनों कर्म उतने ही पुण्‍यप्रद हैं। यानी यज्ञ करना और दुखियारों की सेवा करना, दोनों की पवित्रता एक बराबर है; ये हमारे शास्‍त्रों ने हमें सिखाया है।

 साथियो,

 स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने अपनी आध्‍यात्मिक यात्रा के चरम पर पहुंचने पर भी, और ये कहा था- ये समय महा-मिलन, महा-जागरण, महा-मुक्ति और महा-समान न्‍याय का है। आज जो हम social justice की बात कर रहे हैं, स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने उस समय अपने कार्यकाल में social justice के लिए आवाज उठाई थी। इसी के बाद उन्‍होंने भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की नींव रखी थी।

 1917 में स्‍थापना के बाद जिस सेवाभाव के साथ इस संस्‍था ने काम शुरू किया था, और उसे बड़ौदा के उस समय के महाराजा, महाराजा  सयाजीराव गायकवाड़ भी बहुत ही प्रभावित हुए थे। महाराजा  सयाजीराव गायकवाड़ स्‍वयं जिस अथक परिश्रम से लोगों के उत्‍थान के लिए कार्य  करते थे, वो जग-जाहिर है। लोक-कल्‍याण के कार्यों की चलती-फिरती संस्‍था की तरह वो थे, इ‍सलिए श्रीमंत स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी के देशभर में भेज सेवा-दूतों को उन्‍होंने जमीनी स्‍तर पर कार्य करते देखा तो महाराजा उनकी प्रशंसा किए बिना नहीं रह सके।

 जनसंघ के संस्‍थापक, हम सबके प्रेरणा-पुरुष, श्रद्धेय श्‍यामाप्रसाद मुखर्जी तो स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी को अपने गुरू की तरह मानते थे। डॉक्‍टर मुखर्जी के विचारों में स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी के विचारों की झलक भी हम देख सकते हैं। राष्‍ट्र निर्माण के जिस vision के साथ स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने अपने शिष्‍यों को अध्‍यात्‍म और सेवा से जोड़ा, वो अतुलनीय है। जब 1923 में बंगाल में सूखा पड़ा और तब तो भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की उम्र सिर्फ छह साल थी1 जब 1946 में नोआखली में दंगे हुए, जब 1950 में जलपाईगुड़ी में बहुत बाढ़ आई, जब 1956 में कच्‍छ के अंदर अंजार में पहला भूकंप आया था, जब 1977 में आन्‍ध्र प्रदेश में भीषण चक्रवात आया था, जब 1984 में भोपाल में गैस-त्रासदी हुई; तो भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के लोगों ने पीडि़तों के बीच रहकर उनकी सेवा; वो आज भी लोग याद करते हैं।

 हमें ध्‍यान रखना होगा कि ये वो समय था जब देश में disaster management को ले करके न इतनी एजेंसियां बनी थी, न इतनी चर्चा थी, न इतना कोई awareness था। संकट आता था तो वहीं स्‍थानीय लोग अपनी बुद्धि, शक्ति के अनुसार कुछ न कुछ अपना काम कर लेते थे। प्राकृतिक आपदा हो, या इंसान के आपसीं संघर्ष से पैदा हुए संकट, हर मुश्किल घड़ी में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने उससे निपटने में महत्‍वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई।

मुझे लगता है कि आप लोग जहां बैठे हैं वहां बिजली चली गई लगता है। अंधेरा नजर आ रहा है मुझे यहां से। लेकिन मुझे तो देख पा रहे हो ना आप लोग? मेरी बात की सुनाई दे रही है? चलिए मुझे आपकी आवाज तो सुनाई दी।

 बीते कुछ वर्षों की बात करें तो जब 2001 में गुजरात में भूकंप आया, 2004 में सुनामी आई, 2013 में उत्‍तराखंड में त्रासदी आई, 2015 में तमिलनाडु में बाढ़ आई, आप कोई भी ऐसी दुर्घटना देख लीजिए; भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की तरफ से जो भी उनकी शक्ति है, भक्तिपूर्वक सेवा करने में वो कभी पीछे नहीं रहे हैं।

 भाइयों और बहनों, स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी कहा करते थे बिना आदर्श के जीवन मृत्‍यु के समान है। अपने जीवन में उच्‍च आदर्श स्‍थापित करके ही कोई भी व्‍यक्ति मानवता की सच्‍ची सेवा कर सकता है। भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सभी सदस्‍यों ने उनकी इन बातों को अपने जीवन में उतारा है।

 आज स्‍वाम प्रणबानंद जी जहां भी कहीं होंगे, मानवता के लिए आपके प्रयासों को देखकर बहुत ही प्रसन्‍न होते होंगे। देश ही नहीं, विदेश में भी प्राकृतिक आपदा आने पर भी भारत सेवाश्रम के सदस्‍य लोगों को राहत देने के लिए पहुंच जाते हैं। इसके लिए आप सभी का‍ जितना अभिनंदन किया जाये उतना कम है।

 हमारे शास्‍त्रों में भी कहा गया है-

 आत्मार्थम् जीव लोके अस्मिन् को न जीवति मानवः।

परम परोपकार आर्थम यो जीवति स जीवति॥

 यानी संसार में अपने लिए कौन मनुष्‍य नहीं जीता है, परंतु जिसका जीवन परोपकार के लिए है, उसका ही जीवन सच्‍चे अर्थ में जीवन है। इसलिए प‍रोपकार के अनेक प्रयासों से सुशोभित भारत सेवाश्रम संघ 100 वर्ष पूरे होने पर अनेक-अनेक बधाई के पात्र हैं।

 साथियों,

 बीते कुछ दशकों में देश में एक मिथक बनाया गया कि अध्‍यात्‍म और सेवा के रास्‍ते अलग-अलग हैं। कुछ लोगों द्वारा ये बताने की कोशिश की गई कि जो अध्‍यात्‍म की राह पर है वो सेवा के रास्‍ते से अलग है। आपने इस मिथक को सि‍र्फ गलत साबित कर दिया, लेकिन अध्‍यात्‍म और भारतीय मूल्‍यों पर आधारित सेवा को एक साथ आगे बढ़ाया। आज देशभर में भारत सेवाश्रम संघ की सौ से ज्‍यादा शाखाएं और 500 से ज्‍यादा इकाइयां, स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य सेवा, शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में, नौजवानों को ट्रेनिंग देने के कार्य में जुटी हुई हैं और बहुत बड़ी सेवा कर रही हैं।

 भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ने साधना और समाज-सेवा के संयुक्‍त उपक्रम के तौर पर लोकसेवा का एक मॉडल विकसित किया है। दुनिया के कई देशों में ये मॉडल सफलतापूर्वक चल भी रहा है। संयुक्‍त राष्‍ट्र तक ने भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के कल्‍याणकारी कार्यों की प्रशंसा की है। स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी महाराज पिछली शताब्‍दी में देश की आध्‍यात्मिक चेतना की रक्षा करने वाले, उसे स्‍वतंत्रता आंदोलन से जोड़ने वाले, कुछेक महान अवतारों में से एक थे। स्‍वामी विवेकानंद जी, महर्षि अरविंद, ऐसे अनगिनत उन्‍हीं लोगों की तरह प्रणबानंद जी महाराज का नाम भी पिछली शताब्‍दी के उन महान संतों में लिया जाता है। और स्‍वामीजी कहा करते थे मनुष्‍य को अपने एक हाथ में भक्ति और एक हाथ में शक्ति रखनी चाहिए। उनका मानना था, कि बिना शक्ति के कोई मनुष्‍य अपनी रक्षा नहीं कर सकता, और बिना भक्ति के उसके खुद के ही भक्षक बन जाने का खतरा होता है।

 समाज के विकास के लिए शक्ति और भक्ति को साथ लेकर जन-शक्ति को एकजुट करने का काम, जन-चेतना को जागृत करने का काम, उन्‍होंने अपनी बाल्‍यावस्‍था से ही शुरू कर दिया था। निर्वाण की अवस्‍था से बहुत पहले जब वो स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद नहीं हुए थे; सिर्फ बि‍नोद के नाम से जाने जाते थे। अपने गांव के घर-घर जाकर चावल और सब्जियां जमा करते थे, और फिर उन्‍हें गरीबों में बांट देते थे। जब उन्‍होंने देखा कि गांव तक पहुंचने के लिए सड़क नहीं है, तो सभी को प्रेरित करके, जन‍शक्ति को जगा करके उन्‍होंने गांव तक पहुंचने के सड़क निर्माण का भी काम करवाया था। जातपात, छुआछूत के जहर ने कैसे समाज को विभक्‍त करके रखा है, इसका एहसास उन्‍हें बहुत पहले ही हो गया था। इसलिए सभी को बराबरी का मंत्र सिखाते हुए वो गांव के हर व्‍यक्ति के साथ बिठाकर ईश्‍वर की पूजा किया करते थे। 19वीं सदी के आखिरी में और 20वीं सदी के प्रारंभ में बंगाल जिस तरह की राजनीतिक गतिविधियों का केंद्र बना हुआ था, उस दौरान राष्‍ट्रीय चेतना जगाने के स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी के प्रयास और ज्‍यादा बढ़ गए थे। बंगाल में ही स्‍थापित अनुशीलन समिति के क्रांतिकारियों को वो खुला समर्थन देते थे। अंग्रेजों के खिलाफ लड़ते हुए वो एक बार जेल भी गए। अपने कार्यों से उन्‍होंने साबित किया कि साधना के लिए सिर्फ गुफाओं में रहना आवश्‍यक नहीं, बल्कि जन-जागरण और जन-चेतना जागृत करके भी साधना की जा सकती है, ईश्‍वर को प्राप्‍त किया जा सकता है।

 भाइयो और बहनों,

 आज से 100 वर्ष पहले देश जिस मनोस्थिति से गुजर रहा था, गुलामी की बेडि़यों से, अपनी कमजोरियों से मुक्ति पाना चाहता था। उसमें देश अलग-अलग भू-भागों पर जनशक्ति को संगठित करने के प्रयास अनवरत चल रहे थे। 1917 का ही वो वर्ष था, जब महात्‍मा गांधी ने चम्‍पारण में सत्‍याग्रह आंदोलन का बीजारोपण किया। हम सभी के लिए सुखद संयोग है कि इस वर्ष देश चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह के 100 वर्ष का भी उत्‍सव मना रहा है। सत्‍याग्रह आंदोलन के साथ-साथ ही महात्‍मा गांधी ने लोगों को स्‍वच्‍छता के प्रति जागरूक भी किया था। आपकी जानकारी में होगा कि पिछले महीने चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह की तरह ही देश में स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह का अभियान की शुरूआत की गई है। आजादी के लिए सत्‍याग्रह, तो भारत के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य के लिए स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह, यानी स्‍वच्‍छता के प्रति आग्रह।

 आज इस अवसर पर मैं स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह को भी आपकी साधना का, सेवा का अभिन्‍न अंग बनाने का आग्रह करना चाहता हूं। इसकी एक वजह भी है; आपने देखा होगा कि अभी तीन-चार दिन पहले ही इस साल के स्‍वच्‍छ सर्वेक्षण में शहरों की रैंकिंग घोषित की गई है। उत्‍तर-पूर्वी राज्‍यों के 12 शहरों का भी सर्वे किया गया था, लेकिन स्थिति बहुत अच्‍छी नहीं है, सिर्फ गंगटोक ऐसा शहर है जो 50वें नंबर पर आया है। चार शहरों की रैकिंग 100 से 200 के बीच है, और बाकी 7 शहर 200 और 300 के दायरे में आ गए हैं। शिलॉंग जहां आप बैठे हुए हैं, वो भी Two hundred and seventy six नंबर पर है। ये स्थिति हमारे लिए, राज्‍य सरकारों के लिए, भारत सेवाश्रम संघ जैसी संस्‍थाओं के लिए; मैं समझता हूं कि हम सब के लिए एक बहुत बड़ी चुनौती है। स्‍थानीय एजेंसियां अपना काम कर रही हैं, लेकिन इनके साथ-साथ प्रत्‍येक व्‍यक्ति को ये एहसास कराया जाना बहुत आवश्‍यक है कि वो अपने-आप में स्‍वच्‍छता मिशन का एक सिपाही है। हर व्‍यक्ति ने अपने प्रयास से ही स्‍वच्‍छ भारत, स्‍वच्‍छ उत्‍तर-पूर्व के लिए, उस लक्ष्‍य को हम हासिल कर सकते हैं।

 भाइयो और बहनों,

 स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी महाराज कहते थे देश के हालात को बदलने के लिए लाखों नि:स्‍वार्थ कर्मयोगियों की आवश्‍यकता है। यही नि:स्‍वार्थ कर्मयोगी देश के प्रत्‍येक नागरिक का मनोभाव बदलेंगे, और उस बदले हुए मनोभाव में एक नये राष्‍ट्र का निर्माण होके रहेगा। स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी, ऐसी महान आत्‍माओं की प्रेरणा से देश में आप जैसे करोड़ों नि:स्‍वार्थ कर्मयोगी हैं। बस हम सभी मिल करके अपनी ऊर्जा, स्‍वच्‍छाग्रह के इस आंदोलन को सफल बनाने में लगा देनी है। मुझे बताया गया है कि जब स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान शुरू हुआ था, तब आप लोगों ने उत्‍तर-पूर्व के पांच रेलवे स्‍टेशनों का चयन किया था कि उन स्‍टेशनों में सफाई की जिम्‍मेदारी उठाएंगे; वहां हर पखवाड़े स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान चलाया। अब आपके प्रयासों को और ज्‍यादा बढ़ाए जाने की जरूरत है। 

 आपको आश्‍चर्य होता होगा, मोदी जी हमें काम बता रहे हैं, अब मैं आपको इसलिए बता रहा हूं कि आप लोग करते हैं, और बताने का मन भी तो उन्‍हीं को होता है, जो करने की आदत रखता है। तो मुझे भी मोह हो जाता है कि मैं भी आपको कुछ कह दूं। इस वर्ष जब आप सभी अपनी संस्‍था के घटन के 100 वर्ष मना रहे हैं तो इस महत्‍वपूर्ण वर्ष को क्‍या पूरी तरह स्‍वच्‍छता पर केन्द्रित कर सकते हैं? क्‍या आपकी संस्‍था जिन इलाकों में काम कर रही है, वहां पर पर्यावरण की रक्षा के लिए, पूरे इलाके को प्‍लास्टिक-फ्री बनाने के लिए, और स्‍वच्‍छता के ऐसे और कामों को भी कर सकती है क्‍या? क्‍या जल संरक्षण और जल प्रबंधन के फायदों के लिए लोगों को जागरूक कर सकती है क्‍या? क्‍या अपने लक्ष्‍यों को, संस्‍था के कुछ कार्यों को आप वर्ष Twenty twenty two, 2022, उसके साथ जोड़ सकते हैं क्‍या? 2022, भारत अपनी स्‍वतंत्रता के 75वें वर्ष में प्रवेश कर रहा है। इसमें अभी पांच वर्ष का समय है, और इस समय का उपयोग कर हर व्‍यक्ति, हर संस्‍था को अपने आसपास व्‍याप्‍त बुराइयों को खत्‍म करके, पीछे छोड़कर; आगे बढ़ने का प्रयास करना चाहिए, संकल्‍प लेना चाहिए, चल पड़़ना चाहिए।

 साथियो आपको ज्ञात होगा कि 1924 में स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी ने देशभर में स्थित अनेक तीर्थस्‍थलों का पुनरुद्धार करवाया था। तीर्थशंकर नाम से आपने एक कार्यक्रम शुरू करके उस समय हमारे तीर्थस्‍थलों से जुड़ी जो कमजोरियां थीं, उसको दूर करने का उन्‍होंने भरसक प्रयास किया था। आज हमारे तीर्थस्‍थलों की एक बड़ी कमजोरी अस्‍वच्‍छता है। क्‍या भारत सेवाश्रम संघ, प्रणबानंद जी ने जिस काम को शुरू किया था, वो तीर्थशंकर कार्यक्रम को पुन: एक बार शुरू करके, स्‍वच्‍छता से जोड़ते हुए, नए सिरे से उसको और अधिक प्राणवान बना करके आगे बढ़ा सकता है क्‍या? आपदा प्रबंधन के अपने अनुभवों को भारत सेवाश्रम संघ कैसे ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा लोगों तक पहुंचा सकता है, उस बारे में भी सोचा जाना चाहिए। हर वर्ष देश में हजारों जिंदगियां प्राकृतिक आपदा की वजह से संकट में आती हैं। प्राकृतिक आपदाओं के समय कैसे कम से कम नुकसान हो, इसी को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए पिछले वर्ष देश में पहली बार National disaster management plan बनाया गया है। सरकार बड़े पैमाने पर लोगों को जागरूक कर रही है, लोगों को Mock exercise के जरिए भी  disaster management के तरीकों के बारे में बताया जा रहा है।

सा‍थियो, आपके उत्‍तर-पूर्व के राज्‍यों में सक्रियता और संगठन शक्ति का disaster management में बहुत उपयोग हो सकता है। आपकी संस्‍था आपदा के बाद और आपदा से पहले, दोनों ही स्थितियों से निपटने के लिए लोगों को तैयार कर सकती है।

 इसी तरह जैसे स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी देशभर में प्रवचन दल भेज करके अध्‍यात्‍म और सेवा का संदेश देश-विदेश तक पहुंचाया, वैसे ही आपकी संस्‍था उत्‍तर-पूर्व के कोने-कोने में जा करके, आदिवासी इलाकों में जाकर, खेल से जुड़ी प्रतिभाओं की तलाश में प्रभावी भूमिका निभा सकती है। इन इलाकों में पहले से आपके दर्जनों स्‍कूल चल रहे हैं। आपके बनाए Hostel में सैंक़ड़ों आदिवासी बच्‍चे पढ़ रहे हैं। इसलिए ये काम आपके लिए मुश्किल नहीं है। आप जमीन पर काम करने वाले लोग हैं। लोगों के बीच में काम करने वाले लोग हैं। आपकी पारखी दृष्टि खेल प्रतिभाओं को सामने लाने में मदद कर सकती है।

 स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी कहते थे कि देश की युवा शक्ति जागरूक नहीं हुई तो सारे प्रयास विफल हो जाएंगे। अब एक बार फिर अवसर आया है। सुदूर उत्‍तर-पूर्व में छिपी इस युवा शक्ति को, खेल की प्रतिभाओं को, मुख्‍यधारा में लाने का, इसमें आपकी संस्‍था की बड़ी भूमिका हो सकती है। बस मेरा आग्रह है कि आप अपनी इस सेवा-साधना के लिए जो भी लक्ष्‍य तय करें वो measurable हो। यानी जिसे आंकड़ों में तय किया जा सके, नापा जा सके। स्‍वच्‍छता के‍ लिए आप उत्‍तर-पूर्व के दस शहरों तक पहुंचे या एक हजार गांवों तक पहुंचे, ये निर्णय आप करें। Disaster management के लिए 100 कैम्‍प लगाए या 1000 कैम्‍प लगाएं, इसका निर्णय आप करें। लेकिन मेरा फिर आग्रह है जो भी तय करें, उसको नापा जा सकना चाहिए, हिसाब-किताब निकलना चाहिए, measurable होना चाहिए।

 2022 तक, भारत सेवाश्रम संघ ये कहने की स्थिति में हो कि हमने सिर्फ अभियान ही नहीं बल्कि 50 हजार या एक लाख लोगों को इससे जोड़ा है। जैसे स्‍वामी प्रणबानंद जी कहा करते थे, हमेशा एक डायरी maintain करनी चाहिए, वैसे ही आप भी संस्‍था की एक डायरी बना सकते हैं, जिनमें लक्ष्‍य भी लिखें जाएं और तय अंतराल पर ये भी लिखा जाए कि उस लक्ष्‍य को कितना प्राप्‍त किया। आपका ये प्रयास, आपका ये श्रम देश के निर्माण के लिए New India, इस सपने को पूरा करने के लिए बहुत ही महत्‍वपूर्ण है।

 श्रम को तो हमारे यहां सबसे बड़ा दान माना गया है। और हमारे यहां हर स्थिति में दान देने की प्रेरणा दी जाती है।

 श्रद्धया देयम्, अ-श्रद्धया देयम्, श्रिया देयम्, ह्रया देयम्, भिया देयम्, सम्विदा देयम्

 हमारे यहां तो कहते हैं व्यक्ति को चाहिए कि वो श्रद्धा से दान दे, और यदि श्रद्धा न हो तो भी बिना श्रद्धा को दान देना चाहिए। धन में व़ृद्धि हो तो दान देना चाहिए और यदि धन न बढ़ रहा हो तो फिर लोकलाज से दान देना चाहिए; भय से देना चाहिए अथवा प्रेम से देना चाहिए। कहने का तात्‍पर्य ये है कि हर परिस्थिति में मनुष्‍य को दान देना चाहिए।

 साथियों, उत्‍तर-पूर्व को लेकर मेरा जोर इसलिए है, क्‍योंकि स्‍वतंत्रता के बाद इतने वर्षों में देश के इस क्षेत्र को संतुलित विकास नहीं हुआ है। अब केंद्र सरकार पिछले तीन वर्षों से अपने सम्‍पूर्ण संसाधनों से उत्‍तर-पूर्व के संतुलित विकास का प्रयास कर रही है। पूरे इलाके में connectivity बढ़ाने पर भी जोर दिया जा रहा है। 40 हजार करोड़ के निवेश से उत्‍तर-पूर्व में Road Infrastructure तैयार किया जा रहा है। रेलवे से जुड़े 19 बड़े Project शुरू किस गए हैं। बिजली की व्‍यवस्‍था सुधारी जा रही है।

 पूरे इलाके को पर्यटन के लिहाज से, Tourism की दृष्टि से मजबूत किया जा रहा है। उत्‍तर-पूर्व के छोटे हवाई अड्डों का भी आधुनिकीकरण किया जा रहा है। आपके इस शिलॉंग Airport  में भी Runway की लम्‍बाई बढ़ाने की मंजूरी दे दी गई है। बहुत जल्‍द ही उत्‍तर-पूर्व को उड़ान योजना से भी जोडा जाएगा। ये सारे प्रयास North-East को South-East Asia का gateway बनाने में मदद करने वाले हैं।  South-East Asia का ये खूबसूरत gateway अगर अस्‍वच्‍छ होगा, अस्‍वस्‍थ होगा, अशिक्षित होगा, असंतुलित होगा तो देश विकास के gateway को पार करने में पिछड़ जाएगा। साधनों और संसाधनों से भरपूर हमारे देश में कोई ऐसी वजह नहीं जो हम पिछड़े रहें, गरीब रहें। ''सबका साथ, सबका विकास'' मंत्र के साथ हमें सभी को सशक्‍त करते हुए आगे बढ़ना है। हमारा समाज समन्‍वय, सहयोग और सौहार्द से सशक्‍त होगा। हमारा युवा चरित्र, चिन्‍तन और चेतना से सशक्‍त होगा। हमारा देश जनशक्ति, जनसमर्थन और जनभावना से सशक्‍त होगा। इस परिवर्तन के लिए, हालात बदलने के लिए, New India बनाने के लिए हम सभी को, करोड़ों-करोड़ों न‍िस्‍वार्थ कर्मयोग‍ियों का भारत सेवाश्रम संघ जैसी अनेकानेक संस्‍थाओं को मिल करके काम करना होगा।

 इसी आह्वान के साथ मैं अपनी बात समाप्‍त करता हूं, और एक बार फिर भारत सेवाश्रम संघ के सभी सदस्‍यों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। देवस्‍त विराजमान परमानंद जी महाराज के चरणों में भी वंदन करता हूं, और आप सभी को अनेक-अनेक शुभ कामनाओं के साथ बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद देता हूं।

****

Ladies and Gentleman

 

Delhi and Shillong are nearly 2000 km apart. Technique has however erased this distance. I came to Shillong in May last year itself. Today in having a dialogue with you through video conference, it becomes obvious to have a recall of old memories and also an opportunity of receiving blessings from you all. In Gujarat I got a chance to have affection from and to work closely with Bharat Sewashram Sangh member late Swami Akshayanand ji Maharaj. I know Swami Ambrishanand ji who is  now sitting on the dais since the time he was with black hairs. And I worked with him like a friend. I have not seen Swami Ganeshanand ji for many years but had close acquaintance with him. It was Acharya Shrimat Swami Pranabanand ji Maharaj who established Bharat Sewa Sangh. Sewa Yatra is completing 100 years this year. Many-many greetings from me to Sangh members for taking the service along with labour for Bharat Nirman.

 It’s a matter of laurel and pride for any institution at the threshold of completing 100 years of his services. Bharat Sewa Sangh has  more specifically done highly  commendable public welfare works in North-Eastern States . Be it flood or drought or an earth quake, the members of the Bharat Sewa Sangh are seen providing relief to affected persons with full integrity. In critical conditions when a person need most caring the disciples of Swami Pranabanand ji forget everything except service to human being. Serving the affected ones is termed as pilgrimage in our scriptures. As is the saying:

 

एकत: क्रतव: सर्वे सहस्त्र वरदक्षिणा अन्यतो रोग-भीतानाम् प्राणिनाम् प्राण रक्षणम्

 

Means a well paid systematic copybook style yagna karma on one side and service of aggravated and sick person on the other have same sanctity. Our scriptures have taught us that performing a yagna and service to the affected ones are equally pious.

 Friend, Swami Pranabanandji, during the attainment of prime slot of his spiritual journey had observed that, this is the time of great conjugation, great-awakening, great salvation and great equal justice. Whatever about the social justice we are talking now was highlighted by Swami Pranabanand ji during his time period.  Only after that he founded this Bharat Sewashram Sangha.

 The urge to serve was the motive behind establishing this institution in 1917 which deeply impressed the then ruler of Baroda Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaikwad. And the zeal with which Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaikwad used to perform for benevolence and uplift of people is well known. He was just like a mobile establishment of public welfare so the Maharaja could not resist himself from praising Swami Pranabanandji’s foot soldiers when he saw their working on the ground level.

Our source of inspiration, the founder of Jansangh, honourable   Shyamaprasad Mukherjee revered Swami Pranabanandji as his teacher. We can sense a glimpse of Swami Pranabanadji’s views in the thoughts of Dr. Mukherjee. The way Swami Pranabanandji linked the vision of National Building with spirituality and service of his disciples is beyond any comparison.  Bharat Sewa Sangh was only six year old during the 1923 drought of Bengal. Again  the yeoman  services rendered by  Bharat Sewashram Sangh  during Noakhali riots of 1946; devastating flood of Jalpai Gudi in 1950; first earth quake of 1956 at Anjar in Kutch; massive cyclone of 1977 in Andhra Pradesh and 1984 gas tragedy at Bhopal, all are in memory of people there.

 We must reconcile that it was the time when there were neither much agencies for disaster management nor there was any awareness or talk of such situations. People locally managed things as per their skill and wisdom.  So be there any natural calamity or a manmade strife, Bharat Sewashram Sangh played a crucial role in such difficult situations.

It seems there is no power supply at the place of your seating's.  From here I am seeing that area in dark. Are you able to see and hear me?  Though I am getting your voices.

 If we talk about recent past, Gujarat earth quake of 2001, Tsunami in 2004, the tragedy of Uttarakhand in 2013 or flood of 2015 in Tamil Nadu, we see that Bharat Sewashram Sangh never lagged behind in rendering their whole hearted  and dedicated services.

Brothers and sisters, Swami Pranabanandaji used to say that life without an ideal is equal to death. True service to humanity is possible only after setting high morale in one's life. All the members of Bharat Sewashram Sangh have actualised this vision in their lives.

 

Today, wherever the soul of Swami Pranabanandji will be, he might feel  contained and happy at your efforts for humanity. The members of Bharat Sewashram Sangh reach at the places of Natural calamities well in time not only in the country but also in foreign lands. In this regard any kind of felicitation will be lesser for you.

 

आत्मार्थम् जीव लोके अस्मिन् को न जीवति मानवः।

परम परोपकार आर्थम यो जीवति स जीवति॥

 

It means, every person in this world lives for himself, But the true life is for them who dwells for the welfare of others. Hence anointed by innumerable laurels of others welfare the Bharat Sewashram Sangh well deserves for congratulations on the completion of 100 years of foundation.

Friends, in  the bygone decades a hype was created that means of spiritualism and services are different. Some entities tried to spell out that those treading the spirituality path are away from the path of services. You have proved that this hype is flawed, rather you have furthered a service based on spirituality and Indian ethos all along in one line. Today more than 100 branches of Bharat Sewashram Sangh along with its 500+ health units are busy in imparting in the area of health services education and doing a yeoman service.

Bharat Sewashram Sangh has developed a model of public service which is based upon a joint venture of penance and social-services. This is running successfully in a number of countries. United Nations too has prised the works of Bharat Sewashram Sangh.  Swami Pranabanndji was one of some divine souls who worked for the safety of spiritual awakening of country and then linked it with the freedom movement in the bygone century. Like Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvindo his name is taken as one of the great saints of last century. He used to say that a man should keep devotion in one hand and power on the other. He was convinced that without power one cannot safeguard himself and without devotion threat of becoming a predators for himself always persists in waiting.

Armed with devotion and power he started uniting  and enlightening the  people for the development of society in his very childhood. Many years before attaining salvation  and  becoming  Swami Pranabanand he was only “Vinod” who was busy in collecting rice and vegetables from door-to-door just to redistribute them among the needy and the poor. Once noticing no road connectivity for his village he motivated the villagers for constructing a road to reach easily.

In a very early stage he had sensed the divisions in society because of the poison of caste system and untouchability. So he started worship of God by assembling  all the people of village at one place. Bengal was a central hub of specific political activities during the last days of 19th century as well as in the beginning of 20th century and at this juncture the efforts for national awakening by Swami Pranabanandji were also on the ascending note. He gave open support to the revolutionaries of Anusheelan Samiti, set up in Bengal. Fighting against the Britishers, once he was arrested and sent to jail. Through his acts he proved that it is not essential to remain in caves for penance, rather one can reach to God  by way of awakening and enlightening the masses.

Brothers and sisters, exactly hundred years ago our country was dwelling in a mental state to get  rid of slavery and its own fault lines and to this end continuous efforts were on to group peoples  different parts of country.  1917 was the year in which Mahatma Gandhi seeded Satyagrah movement in Champaran. It’s a healthy co-incidence that country is celebrating centenary of Champaran movement.

In addition to Satyagrah Movement Gandhi ji awakened masses about cleanliness. You may be knowing that last month like Champaran Movement a new movement called Swachchagrah had been launched in the country. Swachchagrah means urge towards cleanliness. Today on this occasion I request you to make it also an integral  part of your activities. This is due to one reason.  You would have gone through the ranking of cities announced in this year's cleanliness survey. 12 cities of North-East states were also surveyed but their status is not very good. Only Gangtok city has got 50th ranking. Four cities are ranked in between 100 to 200th place while the remaining seven are in the range of 200-300. Shillong, where you are sitting now is ranked as 276th . This situation is a challenge for us, the state government and institutions like Bharat Sewashram Sangh. Local agencies are on their job though every one should feel that he himself is a foot soldier for Cleanliness Mission. The objective of Clean India; Clean North-East can be attained only through individual efforts

Brothers and sisters, Swami Pranabanandji Maharaj used to say that country needs millions of selfless workers. These selfless working saints will change the mind set of country which in turn lead to nation building.  So like you crores of selfless workers are spread across the country.  We just have to engage our power jointly so as to make this Swachchagrah Movement a sure success.

I have been told that at the outset of sawachha Bharat campaign you did chose five Railway Stations of North-East for taking onus of cleanliness and every fortnight a cleanliness drive was carried out there. Now your efforts need to be extended.

 You may feel surprise that Modi is assigning job to us. I am telling you because you people always do like that, and obviously the works are assigned to those, who are in habit of accomplishing them. So, I also like to suggest you something. At an occasion when you are celebrating the centenary of your organisation, can it be possible to devote all your efforts to cleanliness drive. For the protection of environment, could it be possible for your institution to make the area, wherever you are working now, plastic free? Can your institution concentrate on other cleanliness related works? Can it work for making masses aware about water conservation and its benefits? Could your institution connect some of its targets with the year 2022, when India will be celebrating 75th year of its independence. Still five years left in it and I think, every person and every institution should utilise this time to left behind the evils of their surroundings and resolute to step forward.

 Friends you would be aware that in 1924 Swami Prnabanandji had rejuvenated many shrines spread in the country. By launching a programme Theerthshankar he tried to do away the shortcomings rampant in the shrines.  Today unhygienic environment is the biggest flaw at our shrines.  Can Bharat Sewsshram Sangh re-launch Teerthshankar programme by linking it with cleanliness.

Similarly how the Bharat Sewashram Sangh is able to share its experiences and expertise in disaster management as much as possible with other persons? This requires a thoughtful provocation. Every year thousands of live face the threat on account of natural calamities. In order to keep damage and loss at minimum last year a National Disaster Management Plan has been chalked out. Government is keeping the people well informed in this regard and they are being updated through mock drill exercises.

 Friends, the alertness and quick response of your institution could be of immense use in NE States. Your institution is capable of keeping people ready both in the events, i.e. before the disaster and after the disaster.

 The way by Swami Pranabanandji used to send his preachers in India and abroad for the spread of the message of spirituality and service, in the similar style your institution can follow him in the tribal pockets of far flung corners of North-East in searching the talented sports persons. Your dozens of schools are already working in these areas and many tribal children are hostel inmates there so it will not be a difficult task for you.

 You people are ground workers among the masses. Your aesthetic vision is capable of bringing up sports talent in the forefront. Swami Pranabanandji used to say that all efforts will become futile if the youth power isn’t awakened.

Once again the opportunity has arrived for upbringing and unveiling the sports talent of North-East Youth power.  Your institution can have a big pie in it. My only request to you in this matter is that your targets for service solitude should be measurable means they could be quantitatively fixed. It is up to you that you will reach to 10 cities or in 1000 cities. You have to fix whether to set up 100 camps or 1000 camps for disaster management. My only urge is that it should be measurable. By 2022 Bharat Sewashram Sangh must be in a position to say that we not only campaigned, rather we linked 50 thousand or one lakh persons with this movement. Pranabanandji always insisted on maintaining a diary so you should also  keep a diary for institution and place targets there in such a manner that could be cross checked time to time regularly and later in it the amount of achievements should also be entered.  Your efforts and hard work is very important for nation building and accomplishing the dream of NEW INDIA.  

Labour (hard work) is revered as greatest donation in our society and we are inspired and motivated for donating in every situation.

 

 श्रद्धया देयम्, अ-श्रद्धया देयम्, श्रिया देयम्, ह्रया देयम्, भिया देयम्, सम्विदा देयम्

Means a person must donate  with devotion  and also donate even if there is no devotion.  Donate when your coffers are on rise and donate for societal respect even if no increase in your assets. Donate with fear or with love. As a sum donate in every situation.

 My specific thrust for North-East is just because of the unbalanced development of this reason even in the post independence era. Now for the last three years the Central Government is trying for the proper as well as balanced development of this reason using its all resources. Emphasis is also being given on connectivity enhancement. Road Infrastructure is being set up in North-East region with an investment of 40 thousand crore rupees. 19 big railways related projects have been launched. The area is also being strengthened, keeping in mind the tourism potentials. The small air ports of North-East are also being modernized. The lengthening of Shilling airport runway has also been approved.  In a very short time North-East will also be linked with “UDAAN” project. All these efforts will help in making North-East the Gateway to South-East Asia. If the Gateway of South-East Asia continues to remain unhygienic, sick, illiterate and unbalanced, our country will lag behind in crossing the gateway of development. There is no reason for our country having all resources and means to remain poor and under developed. With the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas  we  have to move ahead by empowering all.

 Our society will be strengthened by coordination, association and harmony. Our youth will be empowered by morale, thinking and awakening. Our nation will be empowered by peoples power, public support and mass feeling. For bringing a  change and the scenario as well as to make NEW INDIA  we all, crores of selfless workers and numerous institutions like Bharat Sewashram Sangh will have to put in our efforts unitedly. With this call I stop here. I salute in the foots of the divine personality of Parmanandji Maharaja, present on the dais.   Once again many-many greetings to the members of Bharat Sewashram Sangh. Lots of thanks.

	Space diplomacy has touched new heights with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unique gift in the sky to South Asian neighbours.
	The gift of a communications satellite for use by neighbours at no cost has perhaps no precedent worldwide.
	The satellite, which weighs over 2 tonnes, has been fabricated in three years at a cost of over Rs. 230 crore.
	Its footprint that extends all over South Asia.
	The South Asia Satellite has 12 Ku band transponders which India's neighbours can utilise to increase communications.
	Each country will get access to at least one transponder through which they could beam their own programming.
	The satellite will facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support. It will provide critical communication links in times of disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis.
	Heads of Government from all the seven South Asian nations who are benefiting from the satellite, connected via video conference, in a unique celebration of the successful launch.

                Excellencies, 

I would like to thank each one of you for your words. 

Your thoughts echo the sentiment that is captured by today’s launch. 

The South Asia Satellite tells us that even the sky is not the limit when it comes to regional cooperation among like-minded countries. 

""सबका साथ सबका विकास"" can be the guiding light for action and cooperation in South Asia. 

And, a befitting way for us to achieve our shared priorities of economic prosperity for our people. 

And in this, you will find a strong and committed partner in India that truly believes in the strength of this choice and principle. 

Let me once again thank you all for joining me today to celebrate the launch of South Asia Satellite. 

And, also your strong and continuous support in making this vision a reality. 

In the end, I also wish all of us more such celebrations where we can rejoice in success of our common and collective efforts for regional growth and prosperity. 

Thank you. Thank you very much.

His Excellency Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal of Nepal, 
His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 

Namaskar! 

Excellencies, 

Today is a historic day for South Asia. A day without precedence. Two years ago, India made a promise. 

A promise to extend the advanced space technology for the cause of growth and prosperity of our brothers and sisters in South Asia. 

The successful launch of the South Asia Satellite marks the fulfilment of that. With this launch we have started a journey to build the most advanced frontier of our partnership. 

With its position high in the sky, this symbol of South Asian cooperation would meet the aspirations of economic progress of more than one-and-a-half billion people in our region. And, extend our close links into Outer Space. 

Excellencies 

I am immensely grateful to my fellow leaders from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka for joining me today to celebrate this launch. 

I also deeply appreciate the strong and valuable support extended by your governments, without which this project would not have been possible. Our coming together is a sign of our unshakeable resolve to place the needs of our peoples in the forefront. 

It shows that our collective choices for our citizens will bring us together for: cooperation, not conflict; development, not destruction; and prosperity not poverty. 

Excellencies 

This is first of its kind project in South Asia. And, through this, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and India will together achieve: 

effective communication; 
better governance 
better banking and 
better education in remote areas; 
more predictable weather forecasting and efficient resource mapping; 
linking people with top end medical services through tele-medicine and 
a quick response to natural disasters. 

Space technology will touch the lives of our people in the region. 

The satellite would provide services specific to individual countries as per their own needs and priorities, as also common services. 

In achieving this goal, I congratulate the space science fraternity of India, and in particular the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). 

The ISRO team has led from the front in developing the South Asia Satellite as per the regions' requirements, and flawlessly launching it. 

Excellencies 

As Goverments, our most important task is to secure growth, development and peace for our people and communities. 

And, I am convinced that when we join hands and mutually share the fruits of knowledge, technology and growth, we can speed up our development and prosperity. 
I thank you all for your presence. And, congratulate you once again in our shared success! 

Thank you; Thank you very much.

                Present here in large numbers, my dear brothers and sisters.

Today, I was fortunate to visit Kedarnath shrine and pay my obeisance to Lord Shiva, and I’m fortunate to come amongst you people and receive your blessings. I did not have any inkling, but Baba gave me a surprise. I was honoured in a special manner, ornamented with a lot of affection. I sincerely thank Swami Ji, the entire Patanjali family for this.

But, due to my upbringing, due to the people who taught me, who inculcated values in me I’m very well aware that whenever you have been honoured then it means a lot of things are expected of you; don’t back away; and fulfil those expectations. Therefore, in a way, Guru Ji has given me an exhaustive list of do’s and don’ts of what I ought to do, how I should live.

However, along with this honour, I also believe in the blessings of all you, I have full faith in the power of blessings of one twenty-five crore Indians. I don’t believe as much in my own capabilities as I believe in the power of the blessings of you people and my countrymen. And, therefore those blessings are a source of energy, values keep you within the bounds, and everyday one gets a new inspiration to lead a life committed to the nation.

Today, when I have come amongst you, then you people would also experience that one of your family members has come to you. And, I’ve not come here for the first time, I’ve been fortunate to visit you people again and again, was fortunate to visit you people as a family member. And, I was also fortunate to witness the growth of Swami Ramdevji, how he evolved over a period of time; I was fortunate to observe this thing from a close quarter .His determination and dedication to that determination is the keyto his success. And this herbhas not been discovered by Acharya Balkrishna Ji; Swami Ji himself has discovered this herb. The medicines and herbs discovered by Balkrishna ji help in keeping the body healthy, however, Swami Ramdev Ji’s prescription gives you the strength to overcome all the obstacles to move ahead.

I am fortunate to inaugurate the research centre today. If you look at the history of our country then one thing is absolutely clear that we were so visible, so successful, we had reached on top of the world; and when the world found that it was impossible for them to reach there, so they chose the path to destroy whatever achievements we had, to completely demolish those achievements. And the entire period of our slavery, our entire strength, our sages, ascetics, saints, teachers, farmers, scientists, everyone was devoted to protecting whatever achievements we had, the slavery of 1000-1200 years sapped that strength.

After independence, whatever was left should have been developed, rewarded, should have been modified as per the changing time and should have been ornamented in new and innovative ways and that should have been presented to the world by a free India; however, this was not done. There was an attempt to completely destroy those achievements during the period of slavery, however, even after independence, for a prolonged period, an attempt was made to consign these achievements into oblivion. We could fight with enemies when they tried to destroy our achievements, we could come out of that; however, at least three generations remained in the state of confusion, indecision when our own people attempted toput these achievements in oblivion.

Today, I can say with a lot of pride, with of a lot satisfaction that this is not the time to forget; but it’s the time to take pride in our achievements; and this is the time that makes the world aware about India’s glory and achievements. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that how India was at such an exalted place in the world. It was due to the sacrifices made by our ancestors for thousands of years in discovering and innovating new and newer things, gifting them to the mankind for its welfare, making modifications to adapt to the changing times. However, we failed to impress the world as we became indifferent towards innovation, towards research.

When India witnessed IT revolutions after several years then our children in the age group 18, 20, 22 impressed the world in the IT field; then the world attention was again drawn towards India. IT changed the world. Our youth in the age group of 18-20 impressed the world. We ourselves have witnessed the power of research and innovation. Today, entire world is very sensitive, very alert about Holistic Health Care. However, it’s not able to find a way.The world is desperate for peace, they have been attracted towards the great tradition of Yoga discovered by our sages and ascetics. Fed up with the outer world, they are trying to explore and experience the inner world.

In such a scenario, it’s our duty to inform the world about the easily available path of Yoga that is now equipped with modern research and analysis to demonstrate how Yoga can heal the body and mind, how it can enlighten the soul. I offer my respect to Baba Ramdev Ji for converting Yoga into a movement. He instilled the confidence in ordinary housewife that one doesn’t have to go to the caves of Himalaya to practice Yoga; it can be practiced next to your kitchen, on footpath, in fields, in gardens and also in the courtyard of a temple. 

This is a big change. And as a result of that every effort is made by every country in the world to associate maximum number of people with the event when International Yoga Day is celebrated on June 21.To all the people in the world that I get to meet, it’s my experience that they would discuss about our country, about development, about investment and political scenario, however, they would invariably ask me one or two questions about Yoga during the discussion. This curiosity is there.

To some degree, we ourselves harmed the strength of our Ayurveda. While modern medical science people thought that our Ayurveda’s prescriptions are not based on any research; Ayurveda people thought that modern medicines were not effective, they cure people but in reality people don’t become healthy. The entire time was wasted in this struggle that who is superior? It would have been better had we collectively used our entire knowledge, by combining our traditional methods with the latest techniques, then it would have been a great service to the mankind.

I’m happy that the project, the movement started by Baba Ramdev Ji through Patanjali Yog Vidapeeth is not confined only to glorifying the Ayurveda. Baba Ramdev has taken it upon himself that he would present Yoga to the world in the language of research and science understood by the world, as per the globally established system of medical science to motivate the world. In a way he is serving the country. He is on a scientific expedition to share whatever knowledge was earned in thousands of years by our sages and ascetics through hard work and sacrifices. Today, after having the seen the research centre established here I believe that it can rival any modern research centre, the centre that has been set up on the banks of mother Ganga. That is why I offer my deepest regards to Baba. Government of India formulated a health policy when Atal Government was in power. When we got power after a gap of several years, our government brought a health policy for the country. We have come up with the vision of Holistic Health Care. And today the world doesn’t want to be just healthy, it doesn’t want to stuck at a disease free state; people now want Wellness, therefore the solutions must be holistic. We must put emphasison Preventive Health Care, and cleanliness is the cheapest and the best way to have Preventive Health Care. Who does what in terms of cleanliness should be left to be decided in future. We should, 1.25 billion Indians should decide that they will not pollute. This doesn’t require a big commitment, no need to fill the jails or sacrificing your life, no need to sacrifice your life like a soldier on the border; just one small thing that ‘I will not pollute’.

Do you have any idea how many lives a doctor saves? You can save lives of more kids just by not polluting. Whatever reward you earn by donating to a poor person, your donation given in rupees become more valuable when you ensure a poor person’s health by not polluting. And I’m happy that the new generation of our country, our kids argue with their family members. If a senior citizen, old person throws out something, if a family is travelling in a car and water bottle is being thrown out, then the son, five year old grandson asks for stopping the car, he tells them, see, Modi Dada has prohibited this, please bring back that bottle; this atmosphere is being created. Even the young kids have become soldiers of my cleanliness mission. That is why we would be doing great service to our poor if we place more emphasis on the Preventive Health Care. 

Nobody pollutes, we ourselves pollute. And then we give sermons on the lack of cleanliness. And, if we Indians take a pledge that we will not pollute then there will be no hurdles in eradicating the diseases and bringing back health in the country.

This is the level of our indifference that we were familiar with this gigantic Himalaya, the herbs available on Himalaya, we were familiar with the story of Lord Ramchandra Ji and Lakshman Ji, familiar with the story of the hard work and industry by Hanuman Ji, we were familiar with all that, and we became so indifferent that those country of the world that were not aware about the medicinal herbs and plants got the patent of those herbs when they got to know about the big commercial value of these herbs. Some other country got the patent for turmeric, some other got the patent for Tamarind (Imli). This indifference, the habit of forgetting our strength, has harmed us badly. Today there is a huge market for herbal medicine, however, India lags behind in supplying those herbal medicines, we need to do much more.


Whatever research and innovation is being done at Patanjali Institute, it will help in supplementing the global structure for Holistic and Wellness Care, these medicines will become useful for them in future. Several years ago, government of India has constituted a commission, Hathi Commission, to promote Ayurveda, it was headed by someone called Jaisukhlal Hathi. That commission came up with a very interesting report. At the outset of the report, it is being mentioned that our Ayurveda could not become popular as its process was not as per the modern requirement.They would give you a bag full of herbs then they would ask you to boil, boil it in a certain quantity of water, you will get a residual potion, you take that potion in a spoon and then add this and that in that potion; and then you consume that potion.So an ordinary person thinks that why to spoil this and that, take a medicine instead, take a pill and it will work for me. And that is why, he had said in his report, it’s a very old report, that proper packaging of Ayurvedic medicines is the first requisite. If these Ayurvedic medicines are packaged like modern medicines then the people will turn towards Holistic Health Care.And, today we see that we don’t have to collect those herbs and plants that require boiling, all the things are available in ready-made form.

I believe that Acharaya Ji has dedicated himself in that direction. And I believe that the world’s attention will be drawn to the book dedicated by me to the public today. The attention of the people associated with the medical science will be drawn to the book.If this book opens a window to the immense power of the systems developed by nature for the welfare of mankind and if we understand that power then this book will provide a huge opportunity to move forward.

I’m confident that the hard work done by Balkrishna Ji, the dedication and the hard work done by Baba Ramdev in the mission modeand the glorious tradition of India, and the attempts to present it in a modern scientific way, all this can become a basis for India to carve out a place for itself in the world. A big part of the world is already practicing Yoga and it wants to associate itself with Ayurveda, we will work in that direction.

I, I’m fortunate to come amongst you, I was honoured, I bow down to Baba, I offer my deep regards and best wishes to all of you.

Thank you.

                विशाल संख्या में पधारे प्यारे भाईयो और बहनों, 

आज, ये मेरा सौभाग्‍य था कि केदारनाथ जा करके बाबा के दर्शन करने का मुझे सौभाग्‍य मिला, और वहां से आप सबके बीच आने का और आप सबके आशीर्वाद पाने का सौभाग्‍य मिला। मुझे पता नहीं था, बाबा ने surprise दे दिया। बड़ी भावुकता के साथ मुझे विशेष सम्‍मान से आभूषित किया, अलंकृत किया। मैं स्‍वामी जी का, इस पतंजलि पूरे परिवार का अंत:करणपूर्वक आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। 

लेकिन, जिन लोगों के बीच में मेरा लालन-पालन हुआ है, जिन लोगों ने मुझे संस्‍कारित किया है, मुझे शिक्षा-दीक्षा दी है, उससे मैं इस बात को भली-भांति समझता हूं कि जब आपको सम्‍मान मिलता है, तो उसका मतलब ये होता है कि आपसे ये, ये, ये प्रकार की अपेक्षाएं हैं, जरा भी आगे-पीछे मत हो; इसको पूरा करो। तो एक प्रकार से मेरे सामने मुझे क्‍या करना चाहिए, कैसे जीना चाहिए, इसका एक do's and don'ts का बड़ा दस्‍तावेज गुरूजी ने रख दिया है। 

लेकिन सम्‍मान के साथ-साथ आप सबके आशीर्वाद, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के आशीर्वाद की ताकत पर मेरा पूरा भरोसा है। मेरा अपने पर उतना भरोसा नहीं है, मुझ पर इतना भरोसा नहीं है, जितना की मुझे आपके और देशवासियों के आशीर्वाद की ताकत पर भरोसा है। और इसलिए वो आशीर्वाद ऊर्जा का स्रोत है, संस्‍कार उसकी मर्यादाओं में बांध करके रखते हैं, और राष्‍ट्र के लिए समर्पित जीवन जीने के लिए नित्‍य नई प्रेरणा मिलती रहती है। 

मैं आज जब आपके बीच में आया हूं, तो आप भी भली-भांति अनुभव करते होंगे कि आप ही के परिवार का कोई सदस्‍य आपके बीच में आया है। और मैं यहां पर पहली बार नहीं आया हूं, आप लोगों बीच बार-बार आने का मुझे सौभाग्‍य मिला है, एक परिवार के सदस्‍य के नाते आने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है। और ये भी मेरा सौभाग्‍य रहा है कि मैंने स्‍वामी रामदेव जी को, किस प्रकार से वो दुनिया के सामने उभर करके आते गए; बहुत निकट से मुझे देखने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है। उनका संकल्‍प और संकल्‍प के प्रति समर्पण, यही उनकी सफलता की सबसे बड़ी जड़ी-बूटी है। और ये जड़ी-बूटी बालकृष्‍ण आचार्य जी की खोजी हुई जड़ी-बूटी नहीं है; ये स्‍वामी जी ने खुद ने खोजी हुई जड़ी-बूटी है। बालकृष्‍ण जी की जड़ी-बूटी शरीर को स्‍वस्‍थ रखने के लिए काम आती हैं, लेकिन स्‍वामी रामदेव जी वाली जड़ी-बूटी हर संकटों को पार कर-करके नैया को आगे बढ़ाने की ताकत देने वाली होती है। 

आज मुझे Research Centre के उद्घाटन का सौभाग्‍य मिला। हमारे देश का, अगर भूतकाल की तरफ थोड़ी नजर करें; तो एक बात साफ ध्‍यान में आती है, हम इतने छाये हुए थे, इतने पहुंचे हुए थे, इतनी ऊंचाइयों को प्राप्‍त किए हुए थे, कि जब दुनिया ने इसे देखा तो उनके लिए तो वहां तक पहुंचना शायद संभव नहीं लगता था और इसलिए उन्‍होंने मार्ग अपनाया था, जो हमारा श्रेष्‍ठ है उसे ध्‍वस्‍त करने का, उसको नेस्‍तनाबूद करने का। और गुलामी का पूरा कालखंड, हमारी पूरी शक्ति, हमारे ऋषि, मुनि, संत, आचार्य, किसान, वैज्ञानिक, हर किसी को; जो श्रेष्‍ठ था उसको बचाए रखने के लिए 1000, 1200 साल के गुलामी कालखंड में उनकी शक्ति खत्‍म कर दी। 

आजादी के बाद जो बचा था उसे पनपाते, उसे पुरष्‍कत करते, समयानुकूल परिवर्तन करते, नए रंग-रूप के साथ सज्‍जा करते, और आजाद भारत की सांस के बीच उसे विश्‍व के सामने हम प्रस्‍तुत करते; लेकिन वो नहीं हुआ। गुलामी के कालखंड में नष्‍ट करने का प्रयास हुआ, आजादी का एक लम्‍बा कालखंड ऐसा गया जिसमें इन श्रेष्‍ठताओं को भुलाने का प्रयास हुआ। दुश्‍मनों ने नष्‍ट करने की कोशिश की, उससे तो हम लड़ पाये, निकल पाये, बचा पाये, लेकिन अपनों ने जब भुलाने का प्रयास किया तो हमारी तीन-तीन पीढि़यां दुविधा के कालखंड में जिंदगी गुजारती रहीं। 

मैं आज बड़े गर्व के साथ कहता हूं, बड़े संतोष के साथ कहता हूं कि अब भुलाने का वक्‍त नहीं है, जो श्रेष्‍ठ है उसका गौरव करने का वक्‍त है, और यही वक्‍त है जो विश्‍व में भारत की आन-बान-शान का परिचय करवाता है। लेकिन हम इस बात को न भूलें कि भारत दुनिया में इस ऊंचाई पर कैसे था। वो इसलिए था कि हजारों वर्ष पूर्व हमारे पूर्वजों ने लगातार innovation में अपनी जिंदगी खपाई थी। नई-नई खोज करना, नई-नई चीजों को प्राप्‍त करना, और मानव-जाति के कल्‍याण के लिए उसको प्रस्‍तुत करना समय, अनुकूल ढालते रहना। जब से innovation की, research की उदासीनता हमारे भीतर घर कर गई हम दुनिया के सामने प्रभाव पैदा करने में असमर्थ होने लगे। 

कई वर्षों के बाद जब IT Revaluation आया, जब हमारे देश के 18, 20, 22 साल के बच्‍चे mouse के साथ खेलते-खेलते दुनिया को अचरज करने लगे, तब फिर से दुनिया का ध्‍यान हमारी तरफ गया। IT ने दुनिया को प्रभावित किया। हमारे देश के 18, 20 साल की उम्र के नौजवानों ने विश्‍व को प्रभावित कर दिया। Research, Innovation, इसकी क्‍या ताकत होती है, हमने अपनी आंखों के सामने देखा है। आज पूरा विश्‍व Holistic Health Care, इसके विषय में बड़ा संवेदनशील है, सजग है। लेकिन रास्‍ता नहीं मिल रहा है। भारत के ऋषि-मुनियों की महान परम्‍परा, योग, उस पर विश्‍व का आकर्षण पैदा हुआ है, वे शांति की तलाश में हैं। वो बाहर की दुनिया से तंग आ करके भीतर की दुनिया को जानना, परखने के लिए प्रयास कर रहे हैं। 

ऐसे समय हम लोगों का कर्तव्‍य बन जाता है कि आधुनिक स्‍वरूप में Research & Analysis के साथ योग एक ऐसा विज्ञान है; तन और मन की तंदुरूस्‍ती के लिए, आत्‍मा की चेतना के लिए, ये शास्‍त्र कितना सहज उपलब्‍ध हो सकता है। मैं बाबा रामदेव जी को अभिनंदन करता हूं, उन्‍हें योग एक आंदोलन बना दिया। सामान्‍य मानवी में विश्‍वास पैदा कर दिया कि योग के लिए हिमालय की गुफाओं में जाने की जरूरत नहीं है, अपने घर में kitchen के बगल में बैठ करके भी योग कर सकते हो, फुटपाथ पर भी कर सकते हो, मैदान में भी कर सकते हो, बगीचे में भी कर सकते हो, मंदिर के परिसर में भी कर सकते हो। 

ये बहुत बड़ा बदलाव आया है। और आज उसका परिणाम है कि 21 जून को जब विश्‍व अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय योग दिवस मनाता है, दुनिया के हर देश में योग का उत्‍सव मनाया जाता है, अधिकतम लोग उसमें जुड़ें, उसके लिए प्रयास होता है। मुझे विश्‍व के जितने लोगों से मिलना होता है, मेरा अनुभव है कि देश की बात करेंगे, विकास की बात करेंगे, Investment की चर्चा करेंगे, राजनीतिक परिदृश्‍य की चर्चा करेंगे, लेकिन एक बात अवश्‍य करते हैं, मेरे साथ योग के संबंध में तो एक-दो सवाल जरूर पूछते हैं। ये जिज्ञासा पैदा हुई है। 

हमारे आयुर्वेद की ता‍कत, थोड़ा-बहुत तो हमने ही उसे नुकसान पहुंचा दिया। आधुनिक विज्ञाण का जो medical science है उनको लगा कि आपकी सारे बातें कोई शास्‍त्र आधारित नहीं हैं; आयुर्वेद वालों को लगा कि आपकी दवाइयों में दम नहीं है, अब आप लोगों को ठीक कर देते हो लेकिन ठीक होते नहीं हैं। तुम बड़े कि हम बड़े, इसी लड़ाई में सारा समय बीतता गया। अच्‍छा होता कि हमारी सभी ज्ञान, आधुनिक से आधुनिक ज्ञान भी, उसको भी हमारी इन परम्‍पराओं के साथ जोड़ करके आगे बढ़ाया होता तो शायद मानवता की बहुत बड़ी सेवा हुई होती। 

मुझे खुशी है पतंजलि योग विद्यापीठ के माध्‍यम से बाबा रामदेव जी ने जो अभियान चलाया, आंदोलन चलाया है, उसमें आयुर्वेद का महिमा-मंडन, वहां अपने-आपको सीमित नहीं रखा है। दुनिया जो भाषा में समझती है, research के जिन आधारों पर समझती है, medical science में प्रस्‍थापित व्‍यवस्‍थाओ के तहत समझती है; बाबा रामदेव ने बीड़ा उठाया है, उसी भाषा में भारत के आयुर्वेद को वो ले करके आएंगे और दुनिया को प्रेरित करेंगे। एक प्रकार से ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सेवा कर रहे हैं। हजारों साल से हमारे ऋषियों-मुनियों ने तपस्‍या की है, जो प्राप्‍त किया है वो दुनिया को बांटने के लिए निकले हैं, वैज्ञानिक अधिष्‍ठान पर निकले हुए हैं, और मुझे विश्‍वास है और आज मैंने जो Research Centre देखा, कोई भी आधुनिक Research Centre देखिए; बिल्‍कुल उसकी बराबरी में खड़ा हुआ है, मां गंगा के किनारे पर ये काम। 

और इसलिए मैं बाबा को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत अभिनंदन करता हूं। भारत सरकार, जब अटल जी की सरकार थी देश में, तब हमारे देश में एक Health Policy आई थी। इतने सालों के बाद जब हमारी सरकार बनी, तो‍ फिर से हम देश के लिए एक Health Policy ले करके आए हैं। Holistic Health Care का view ले करके आए हैं। और अब दुनिया सिर्फ Healthy रहना चाहती है ऐसा नहीं है, बीमारी न हो वहां तक अटकना नहीं चाहती है; अब लोगों को Wellness चाहिए, और इसलिए solution भी holistic देने पड़ेंगे। Preventive Health Care पर बल देना पड़ेगा, और Preventive Health Care का उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम रास्‍ता जो है, और सस्‍ते से सस्‍ता रास्‍ता है, वो है स्‍वच्‍छता। और स्‍वच्‍छता में कौन क्‍या करता है, वो बाद पे छोड़े हम। हम तय करें, सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी तय करें‍ कि मैं गंदगी नहीं करूंगा। कोई बड़ा संकल्‍प लेने की जरूरत नहीं, इसमें जेल जाने की जरूरत नहीं है, फांसी पर लटकने की जरूरत नहीं है, देश के लिए सीमा पर जा करके जवानों की तरह मरने-मिटने की जरूरत नहीं है; छोटा सा काम- मैं गंदगी नहीं करूंगा। 

आपको कल्‍पना है एक डॉक्‍टर जितनी जिंदगी बचा लेता है, उससे ज्‍यादा बच्‍चों की जिंदगी आप गंदगी न करके बचा सकते हैं। आप एक गरीब को दान-पुण्‍य दे करके जितना पुण्‍य कमाते हो, गंदगी न करके एक गरीब जब स्‍वस्‍थ रहता है, तो आपका दान रुपयों में देते हैं, उससे भी ज्‍यादा मूल्‍यवान हो जाता है। और मुझे खुशी है कि देश की जो नई पीढ़ी है, आने वाली पीढ़ी; छोटे-छोटे बालक, हर घर में वो झगड़ा करते हैं। अगर परिवार के वृद्ध व्‍यक्ति ने, बुजुर्ग ने कोई एक अगर छोटी सी चीज फेंक दी, कार में जा रहे हैं अगर पानी का bottle बाहर फेंक दिया तो बेटा कार रुकवाता है, छोटा पोता- पांच साल का, कार रुकवाता है, ठहरो, मोदी दादा ने मना किया है ये bottle वापिस ले आओ; ये माहौल बन रहा है। छोटे-छोटे बालक भी मेरे इस स्‍वच्‍छता आंदोलन के सिपाही बन गए हैं। और इसलिए Preventive Health Care, इसको हम जितना बल देंगे, हम हमारे देश के गरीबों की सबसे ज्‍यादा सेवा करेंगे। 

गंदगी कोई नहीं करता है, गंदगी हम करते हैं। और हमीं फिर गंदगी पर भाषण देते हैं। अगर एक बार हम देशवासी गंदगी न करने का फैसला कर लें, इस देश से बीमारी को निकालने में, तदुरूस्‍ती को लाने के लिए हमें कोई सफलता पाने में रुकावटें नहीं आएंगी। 

हमारी उदासीनता इतनी है कि हम इतना बड़ा हिमालय, हिमालय की जड़ी-बूटी, भगवान रामचंद्र जी और लक्ष्‍मण जी की घटना से परिचित, हनुमान जी जड़ी-बूटी के लिए क्‍या-क्‍या नहीं करते थे, वो सारी बातें परिचित, और हम इतने सहज हो गए थे कि दुनिया के देश, जिनको जड़ी-बूटी क्‍या होती है, ये मालूम नहीं था; लेकिन जब उनको पता कि इसका बड़ा commercial value है, दुनिया के और देशों ने patent करवा दिया। हल्‍दी का patent भी कोई और देश करवा देता है, इमली का patent भी कोई और देश करवा देता है। हमारी ये उदासीनता, अपनी शक्ति को भुला देने की आदतें, इसने हमारा बहुत नुकसान किया है। 

आज विश्‍व में Herbal Medicine, उसका एक बहुत बड़ा मार्केट खड़ा हुआ है। लेकिन जितनी मात्रा में दुनिया में इस Herbal Medicine को पहुंचाने में भारत को जो ताकत दिखानी चाहिए, अभी बहुत कुछ करने की बाकी है। 

इस पतंजलि संस्‍थान के द्वारा ये जो Research और Innovation हो रहे हैं, ये दुनिया के लोगों को Holistic और Wellness के लिए जो structure है, उनको ये दवाइयां आने वाले दिनों में काम आएंगी। हमारे देश में बहुत वर्षों पहले भारत सरकार ने आयुर्वेद का प्रचार कैसे हो, उसके लिए एक हाथी कमीशन बिठाया था, जयसुखलाल हाथी करके, उनका एक कमीशन बिठाया था। उस कमीशन ने जो रिपोर्ट दी थी, वो रिपोर्ट बड़ी interesting थी। उस रिपोर्ट के प्रारंभ में लिखा है कि हमारे आयुर्वेद इसलिए लोगों तक नहीं पहुंचता है क्‍योंकि उसकी जो पद्धति है, वो आज के युग के अनुकूल नहीं है। वो इतनी सारी थैला-भर जड़ी-बूटी देंगे और फिर कहेंगे इसको उबालना, इतने पानी में उबालना, फिर इतना रस रहेगा, एक चम्‍मच में लेना, फिर इसमें फलाना जोड़ना, ढिकना जोड़ना; और फिर लेना। तो जो सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति होता है उसको लगता है कि भई ये कौन कूड़ा-कचरा करेगा, उसके बजाय चलो भाई medicine ले लें, दवाई की गोली खा लें, अपनी गाड़ी चल जाएगी। और इसलिए उन्‍होंने कहा था कि सबसे पहली आवश्‍यकता है, बहुत साल पहले का report है ये। सबसे पहली आवश्‍यकता है आयुर्वेदी दवाओं का packaging. अगर उसका packaging, modern दवाइयों की तरह कर देंगे, तो लोग ये Holistic Health Care की तरफ मुड़ जाएंगे। और आज हम देख रहे हैं कि हमें वो उबालने वाली जड़ी-बूटियां कहीं लेने के लिए जानी नहीं पड़ती है, हर चीज ready-made मिलती है। 

मैं समझता हूं कि आचार्य जी ने अपने-आपको इसमें खपाया हुआ है। और आज जिस किताब का लोकापर्ण करने का मुझे अवसर मिला, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि दुनिया का इस किताब पर ध्‍यान जाएगा। Medical Science से जुड़े हुए लोगों का ध्‍यान जाएगा। प्रकृतिदत्‍त व्‍यवस्‍था कितनी सामर्थ्‍यवान है, उस सामर्थ्‍य को अगर हम समझते हैं तो जीवन कितना उज्‍ज्‍वल हो सकता है, ये अगर व्‍यक्ति को एक खिड़की खोल करके दे देता है, आगे बढ़ने के लिए बहुत बड़ा अवसर दे देता है। 

मुझे विश्‍वास है कि बालकृष्‍ण जी की ये साधना, बाबा रामदेव का mission mode में स‍मर्पित ये काम और भारत की महान उज्‍ज्‍वल परम्‍परा, उसको आधुनिक रूप-रंग के साथ, वैज्ञानिक अधिष्‍ठान के साथ आगे बढ़ाने का जो प्रयास है, वो भारत के लिए विश्‍व में अपनी एक जगह बनाने का आधार बन सकता है। दुनिया का बहुत बड़ा वर्ग है जो योग से जुड़ा है, आयुर्वेद से भी जुड़ना चाहता है, हम उस दिशा में प्रयास करेंगे। 

मैं फिर एक बार आप सबके बीच आने का मुझे सौभाग्‍य मिला, विशेष रूप से मुझे सम्‍मानित किया, मैं सिर झुका करके बाबा को प्रणाम करता हूं, आप सबका अभिनंदन करता हूं, और मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। धन्‍यवाद।

                41 Officer Trainees of the 2016 Batch of the Indian Foreign Service called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today. 

Sharing his thoughts, Prime Minister stressed on the need for the Foreign Service officers to be extremely well informed, and think in a global perspective. He urged the officer trainees to keep in touch with their batchmates from other services, in course of their career, so that they could always keep abreast of developments at home. 

The Prime Minister said, that by and large, the world believes that India has a bright future, and is comfortable with India’s rising stature.

                I am very happy to release a stamp on the occasion of the one thousandth birth anniversary of the great social reformer and Saint Shri Ramanujacharya. I am privileged to have been given this opportunity. 

The central message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s life was inclusive society, religion and philosophy. Saint Shri Ramanujacharya believed that whatever is, and whatever will be, is but an expression of God. He saw the manifestation of God in Human beings, and Human beings in God. He saw all devotees of God as equal. 

When caste distinction and hierarchy had been recognized as integral to society and religion and every one had accepted her place as high and low in the hierarchy, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya rebelled against it - In his personal life and religious teachings. 

 Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was neither limited to his lectures nor he remained a new  path finder rather he lived up to his words too. Treading on the hymn- मनसा वाचा कर्मणा he made his life a sermon. The thought of his heart was in his words and the same was evident in his deeds also. One specific aspect of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was that in order to stop things getting aggravated  he always tried to settle the disputes and  solve the controversies. For the understanding of God, the middle path of “विशिष्टाद्वैत” was a separate  link between the अद्वैतवाद और द्वैतवाद .

 Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was opposed to every such ritual that segmented the society and was  divisive.  He used his full energy in breaking and changing such system.

 You all know, how he was asked not to make public that  mantra of salvation and liberation and how in defiance he called an assembly where he pronounced that mantra before everyone, the persons belonging to every caste and level.  He said, a mantra that is capable of ending the hardships should not be restricted to a single entity, rather every one should know it.  Such vast and helping was the heart of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.

 This is precisely why Swami Vivekananda spoke of the heart of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya — the large heart that cried for the downtrodden at a time when being downtrodden was recognized and accepted as part of one’s karma. Saint Shri Ramanujacharya broke the settled prejudice of his times. His thinking was much ahead of his era. 

In more than one sense, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was a millennial sage — who foresaw a thousand years before, the hidden and un-spelt-out aspirations of the downtrodden. He realized the need to include the socially excluded, outcaste and the divyangs to make not only religion, but society itself, wholesome and complete. 

 He emerged just like God for the poor and down trodden, exploited and deprived ones and dalits.

At one time the entire administration in the Shrirangam Temple in Tiruchirapalli was controlled by a specific caste. He included persons from different castes in the Temple administration. A number of responsibilities were given to women also. He made the temple a place of people welfare and public services. He converted the temple into such institution where poor people were given clothing’s, food and  shelter. His reformative models are still  seen working  as “रामानुज-कुट” in many temples.

You will find many such examples in his life. While challenging caste-system he made such a person his mentor to whom the society of then  was considered not fit to become a teacher. He went to tribal communities and enabled them to become awakened and worked for the improvement of their social status.

 Thus people from all religious sects and communities got inspirations from the presence  and words  of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya. The statue of Muslim princes Bibi Nachiyar  in worshiping posture in front of God at the temple in Melkot is a glaring proof of it. Only a handful persons in our country know that it was only Saint Shri Ramanujacharya who got affixed the statue of Bibi Nachiyar,  the daughter of Delhi Sultan  1000 years ago in that temple.

 You just can imagine that what a  magnificent message was given by Saint Shri Ramanujacharya for the  social bonhomie and intermixing of society through this act.  Even now tributes are paid at the statue of Bibi Nachiar.  So like the statue of Bibi Nachiyar the message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya is still relevant.

 The life and message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya has  also strengthened and fortified the liberal and multi  faceted  tolerant aspect  of Indian society. Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedekar  on 03 June 1927 had written an editorial  on him in his magazine “ Bahishkrut Bharat”. Reading of this 90 year old article instil our hearts  with  a stream of very composing waves.

Baba Saheb wrote: “ It was indeed Saint Shri Ramanujacharya who had contributed and worked for bringing  and implementing equality and parity in the Hindu Religion. He made Kanchipurna,  a non-Brahmin as his Guru. He expressed his anguish when his wife tried to purify house after the Guru had taken his meal at their residence.

Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was highly  embarrassed to see his  own residence getting purified after the visit of a Dalit Guru. He also got angry over this as the malady he was trying his best  to eradicate could not be done away from his own place. After this incident Saint took Sanyas and then devoted rest of his life for the cause of social welfare. I will say again, he not only preached instead lived up his teachings through action.”

Baba Saheb has also narrated in his editorial that how Saint Shri Ramanujacharya used to empower the women in the mindset of society prevailing in those days.

He writes: “ Having discourse  with a Dalit woman in Tiruvallee he (Saint Shri Ramanujacharya) said to the lady that you knows more than me. After it he initiated that woman and  also established her statue in the temple. He made one untouchable person Dhanurdas his disciple. After taking a bath in the river daily he used to come back home with the help of this disciple.

This was a unique amalgamation of soberness and revolt.  A person whose house is purified after the entry of a Dalit Guru and that person finds his escort in a dalit to go temple after bathing in river. A period when dalit women were prohibited for a free speech and in the same time, he after accepting defeat in a debate from a dalit women, also gets erected the statue   of that women in temple.

That is why Babasaheb was highly impressed from  Saint Shri Ramanujacharya. Persons reading Babasaheb  will come across  the massive  impact  of the life and thinking’s of Saint Ramanujacharya on Babasaheb.

I think there will be very few persons whose life had impressions on different time frames of one millennium. The inspiration and motivation of the teachings of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya gave birth  to a number of social reforms and movements during these 1000 years.  His simple message also framed the Bhakti Movement.

The Warkari cult in Maharashtra, Vallabh cult of Gujrat and Rajasthan, Chaitanya cult of Central India and Bengal and Shankar Deo in Assam spread his message to public at large.

Even the premier Gujarati poet  Narsi Mehta got  inspired  from Saint Shri Ramanujacharya and said: वैष्णव जनतो तेने कहिए, जे पीर पराई जाणे रे !!! so to have a  sense of experiencing the pain of a poor is just due to Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.

The sayings of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya has enabled  the millions of people of this country to behold the social responsibility and tread for social cohesion and bonhomie. He has taught us that  the very thought of religion as  submersion  in fanaticism and rituals  is the way of cowards, ignorant  and superstitious persons. Hence every that person who takes stand against caste system, disparity and violence in turn becomes Guru Nanak and Kabeer.

Its our culture to modify  and renovate those old things which are obsolete and doesn’t  qualify the time scale.  So in our country there came such great souls who worked for  social reforms and for that  they put their personal prestige at stake, consumed poison and took risk. They worked for the eradication of centuries old systematic faults.  Their quest was for social reforms, for saving the conscience of India  and its awakening.

It is the penance  and pious stream of eternal  social awakening  by  sages  like Saint Shri Ramanujacharya that  for ever our reverence stood firm  on our glorious past and our conduct, customs and rituals were transformed according to time. Our thinking remained beyond time limits which resulted in the progressive march of our society since ages. And that is the eternity by  which our culture is still nascent despite being ancient.  And only due to the nectar churning of these great souls we can proudly proclaim that:  “कुछ बात है कि हस्ती मिटती नहींहमारी, सदियों रहा है दुश्मन दौरे-जमां हमारा”. The world map has witnesses sea changes, many big empires are non- existent but our Bharat, our Hindustan is  still marching ahead with the mantra of सबका साथ-सबकाविकास.

Today I am happy that  on the millennia  birth  anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya many institutions are jointly conveying his  teachings to each and every household.  I hope these messages have been meticulously clubbed with the  present status of our nation.

You all are aware that Saint Shri Ramanujacharya had also linked fulfilling the needs of the poor with social responsibility. For instance, he got an artificial lake made, spread over 200 acres in Thondanur near Melkot. This lake continues to exist as a living example of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s work for the welfare of the people. Even today it serves over 70 villages, fulfilling their drinking water and irrigation needs. 

 Today when everywhere is the concern for water then this lake made one thousand years ago is an answer to the necessity of water conservation. An uncounted number of generations have been blessed by this lake and they survived due to it. This lake is a proof of the fact that what ever we plan for water conservation for now turns beneficial to masses for centuries. Hence the cleaning of rivers and lakes, digging of lakhs of tanks is a part of the preparation for the present as well as the future.

 While referring to this lake I will appeal to you all  that while spreading the message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya you must also energize  and motivate the masses for water conservation now on.

 I would also like to make an appeal to the leaders of the various institutions gathered here. As India enters its 75th year of Independence in 2022, we are working on the weaknesses and constraints that hold us back. You too, must set yourself specific targets which are tangible and measurable. 
 

You can decide as whether to reach 10 thousand villages or to reach in 50 thousand dwellings.

 I further appeal you all in addition to the national religion awakening words of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya more and more people be activated for human well being, women welfare and poor empowerment in addition to present challenges.

I conclude at this point and ones again express my gratitude for giving me an opportunity to release the commemorative postal stamp on Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.

 Thank you all.

I am very happy to release a stamp on the occasion of the one thousandth birth anniversary of the great social reformer and Saint Shri Ramanujacharya. I am privileged to have been given this opportunity. 

The central message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s life was inclusive society, religion and philosophy. Saint Shri Ramanujacharya believed that whatever is, and whatever will be, is but an expression of God. He saw the manifestation of God in Human beings, and Human beings in God. He saw all devotees of God as equal. 

When caste distinction and hierarchy had been recognized as integral to society and religion and every one had accepted her place as high and low in the hierarchy, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya rebelled against it - In his personal life and religious teachings. 

संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने सिर्फ उपदेश नहीं दिए, सिर्फ नई राह नहीं दिखाई, बल्कि अपनी जिंदगी में उन्होंने अपने वचनों को जीकर भी दिखाया। हमारे शास्त्रों में जो लिखा है- मनसा वाचा कर्मणा, इस सूत्र पर चलते हुए उन्होंने अपनी जिंदगी को ही अपना उपदेश बना दिया। जो उनके मन में था, वही वचन में था और वही कर्म में भी दिखा। संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य में एक विशेषता थी कि जब भी विवाद होता था, तो वो स्थिति को और बिगड़ने से रोकने और समस्या को सुलझाने का प्रयास करते थे। ईश्वर को समझने के लिए अद्वैतवाद और द्वैतवाद से अलग, बीच का एक मार्ग “विशिष्टाद्वैत” भी इसी की कड़ी था। 

हर वो परंपरा, जो समाज में भेद पैदा करती हो, उसे बांटती हो, संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य उसके खिलाफ थे। वो उस व्यवस्था को तोड़ने के लिए, उसे बदलने के लिए अपनी पूरी शक्ति से प्रयास करते थे। 

आपको ज्ञात होगा कि किस तरह मुक्ति और मोक्ष के जिस मंत्र को उन्हें सार्वजनिक करने से मना किया गया था, वो उन्होंने एक सभा बुलाकर, हर वर्ग, हर स्तर के लोगों के सामने उच्चारित कर दिया था। उन्होंने कहा था कि जिस मंत्र से परेशानियों से मुक्ति मिलती है, वो किसी एक के पास क्यों रहे, उसका पता हर गरीब को लगना चाहिए। संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य का हृदय इतना विशाल, इतना परोपकारी था। 

This is precisely why Swami Vivekananda spoke of the heart of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya — the large heart that cried for the downtrodden at a time when being downtrodden was recognized and accepted as part of one’s karma. Saint Shri Ramanujacharya broke the settled prejudice of his times. His thinking was much ahead of his era. 

In more than one sense, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya was a millennial sage — who foresaw a thousand years before, the hidden and un-spelt-out aspirations of the downtrodden. He realized the need to include the socially excluded, outcaste and the divyangs to make not only religion, but society itself, wholesome and complete. 

गरीबों के लिए, शोषितों के लिए, वंचितों के लिए, दलितों के लिए वो साक्षात भगवान बनकर आए। एक समय था तिरुचिरापल्ली में श्रीरंगम मंदिर का पूरा प्रशासन एक विशेष जाति के ही पास था। इसलिए उन्होंने मंदिर का पूरा administrative system ही बदल दिया था। उन्होंने अलग-अलग जातियों के लोगों को मंदिर के administration में शामिल किया। महिलाओं को भी कई जिम्मेदारी सौंपी गई। मंदिर को उन्होंने नागरिक कल्याण और जनसेवा का केंद्र बनाया। उन्होंने मंदिर को एक ऐसे institution में बदल दिया जहां गरीबों को भोजन, दवाइयां, कपड़े और रहने के लिए जगह दी जाती थी। उनके सुधारवादी आदर्श आज भी कई मंदिरों में “रामानुज-कुट” के तौर पर नजर आते हैं। 

ऐसे कितने ही उदाहरण आपको उनकी जिंदगी में मिलेंगे। caste- system को चुनौती देते हुए उन्होंने अपना गुरु भी ऐसे व्यक्ति को बनाया जिसे जाति की वजह से तब का समाज गुरु बनने योग्य नहीं मानता था। उन्होंने आदिवासियों तक पहुंच कर उन्हें जागरूक किया, उनकी सामाजिक जिंदगी में सुधार के लिए काम किया। 

इसलिए हर धर्म के लोगों ने, हर वर्ग के लोगों ने संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य की उपस्थिति और संदेशों से प्रेरणा पाई। मेलकोट के मंदिर में भगवान की आराधना करती मुस्लिम राजकुमारी बीबी नचियार की मूर्ति इसकी गवाह है। देश के बहुत कम लोगों को पता होगा कि आज से हजार वर्ष पूर्व दिल्ली के सुल्तान की बेटी बीबी नचियार की मूर्ति संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने ही मंदिर में स्थापित कराई थी। 

आप अंदाजा लगा सकते हैं कि उस समय सामाजिक समरसता और सद्भाव का कितना बड़ा संदेश संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने अपने इस कार्य के माध्यम से दिया था। आज भी बीबी नचियार की मूर्ति पर श्रद्धा सुमन अर्पित किए जाते हैं। बीबी नचियार की मूर्ति की तरह ही संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य का संदेश आज भी उतना ही प्रासंगिक है। 

संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के जीवन और शिक्षा से भारतीय समाज का उदार, बहुलतावादी और सहिष्णु स्वरूप और मजबूत हुआ। बाबा साहेब भीम राव अंबेडकर ने भी उनके बारे में अपनी मैगजीन बहिष्कृत भारत में 3 जून, 1927 को एक एडिटोरियल लिखा था। 90 वर्ष पहले लिखे इस एडिटोरियल को पढ़ने पर संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के प्रेरणामयी जीवन की कितनी ही बातें, मन-मंदिर को छू जाती हैं। 

बाबा साहेब ने लिखा था- 

“हिंदू धर्म में समता की दिशा में यदि किसी ने महत्वपूर्ण कार्य किए, और उन्हें लागू करने का प्रयास किया, तो वो संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने ही किया। उन्होंने कांचीपूर्ण नाम के एक गैर ब्राह्मण को अपना गुरु बनाया। जब गुरु को भोजन कराने के बाद उनकी पत्नी ने घर को शुद्ध किया तो संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने इसका विरोध किया”। 

एक दलित गुरु के घर में आने के बाद अपने ही घर की शुद्धि होते देख संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य बहुत दुःखी भी हुए और उन्हें बहुत गुस्सा भी आया था। जिस कुरीति को मिटाने के लिए वो अथक परिश्रम कर रहे थे, वो उनके घर से ही नहीं दूर हो सकी थी। इसके बाद ही उन्होंने संन्यास ले लिया और फिर अपना पूरा जीवन समाज हित में लगा दिया। मैं फिर कहूंगा। उन्होंने सिर्फ उपदेश नहीं दिया बल्कि अपने कार्यों से उन उपदेशों को जीकर भी दिखाया। 

उस दौर में समाज की जिस तरह की सोच थी, उसमें संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य महिलाओं को कैसे सशक्त करते थे, इस बारे में भी बाबा साहेब ने अपने editorial में बताया है। 

उन्होंने लिखा है- 

तिरुवल्ली में एक दलित महिला के साथ एक शास्त्रार्थ के बाद उन्होंने उस महिला से कहा कि आप मुझसे कहीं ज्यादा ज्ञानी हैं। इसके बाद संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य ने उस महिला को दीक्षा दी और उसकी मूर्ति बनाकर मंदिर में भी स्थापित कराई। उन्होंने धनुर्दास नाम के एक अस्पृश्य को अपना शिष्य बनाया। इसी शिष्य की मदद से वो नदी में स्नान करने के बाद वापस आते थे”। 

विनम्रता और विद्रोही प्रवृति का ये एक अद्भुत समागम था। जिस व्यक्ति के घर में दलित गुरू के प्रवेश के बाद उसे शुद्ध किया गया हो, वो व्यक्ति नदी के स्नान के बाद एक दलित का ही सहारा लेकर मंदिर तक जाता था। जिस दौर में दलित महिलाओं को खुलकर बोलने की भी स्वतंत्रता ना हो, उस दौर में उन्होंने एक दलित महिला से शास्त्रार्थ में हारने पर मंदिर में उसकी मूर्ति भी लगवाई। 

बाबा साहेब इसलिए संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य से बहुत प्रभावित थे। जो लोग बाबा साहेब को पढ़ते रहे हैं, वो पाएंगे कि उनके विचारों और जिंदगी पर संत रामानुजाचार्य का कितना बड़ा प्रभाव था। 

मुझे लगता है कि ऐसे कम ही व्यक्ति होंगे जिनके जीवन की प्रेरणा का विस्तार एक हजार वर्ष तक ऐसे अलग-अलग कालखंडों में हुआ हो। संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के विचारों से ही प्रभावित होकर एक हजार वर्ष के इस लंबे दौर में कई सामाजिक आंदोलनों ने जन्म लिया। उनके सरल संदेशों ने ही भक्ति आंदोलन का स्वरूप तय किया। 

महाराष्ट्र में वारकरी संप्रदाय, राजस्थान और गुजरात में वल्लभ संप्रदाय, मध्य भारत और बंगाल में चैतन्य संप्रदाय और असम में शंकर देव ने उनके विचारों को जन-जन तक पहुंचाया। 

संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के वचनों से ही प्रभावित होकर गुजराती आदिकवि और संत नरसी मेहता ने कहा था- वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिए, जे पीर पराई जाणे रे !!! गरीब का दर्द समझने का ये भाव संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य की ही देन है। 

इन एक हजार वर्षों में संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के संदेशों ने देश के लाखों-करोड़ों लोगों को सामाजिक समरसता, सामाजिक सद्भाव और सामाजिक जिम्मेदारियों का ऐहसास कराया है। उन्होंने हमें समझाया है कि कट्टरता और कर्मकांड में डूबे रहने को ही धर्म मानना कायरों का, अज्ञानियों का, अंध-विश्वासियों का, तर्कहीनों का रास्ता है। इसलिए हर वो व्यक्ति जो जातिभेद, विषमता और हिंसा के विरुद्ध खड़ा होता है वो गुरु नानक हो जाता है, कबीर हो जाता है। 

जो समय की कसौटी पर खरा नहीं उतरता, वो कितना भी प्राचीन क्यों ना हो, उसमें सुधार करना ही हमारी संस्कृति है। इसलिए समय-समय पर हमारे देश में ऐसी महान आत्माएं सामने आईं जिन्होंने अपनी व्यक्तिगत प्रतिष्ठा को दांव पर लगाकर, विष पीकर, हर तरह का रिस्क उठाकर, समाज को सुधारने के लिए काम किया। जिन्होंने सैकड़ों वर्षों से चली आ रही व्यवस्था की बुराइयों को खत्म करने का प्रयास किया। जिन्होंने समाज में परिवर्तन के लिए, भारत की चेतना को बचाने के लिए, उसे जगाने के लिए काम किया। 

संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य जैसे ऋषियों का तप है, इनके द्वारा शुरू किए और अविरल चलते सामाजिक जागरण के पुण्य प्रवाह का प्रताप है कि – 

हमारी श्रृद्धा हमेशा हमारे गौरवशाली इतिहास पर अडिग रही हमारा आचरण, रीति-रिवाज, परम्पराएं समयानुकूल बनते गए हमारी सोच हमेशा समय के परे रही 

इसी कारण हमारा समाज युगयुग से सतत उर्ध्वगामी रहा। यही वो अमरतत्व है जिससे हमारी संस्कृति चिरपुरातन होते हुए भी नित्यनूतन बनी रही। इन्हीं पुण्य आत्माओं के अमृत मंथन की वजह से हम गर्व से कहते हैं- 

“कुछ बात है कि हस्ती मिटती नहीं हमारी, सदियों रहा है दुश्मन दौरे-जमां हमारा” दुनिया का नक्शा बदल गया, बड़े-बड़े देश खत्म हो गए, लेकिन हमारा भारत, हमारा हिंदुस्तान, सबका साथ-सबका विकास के भारत मंत्र के साथ आगे बढ़ रहा है। 

आज मुझे खुशी है कि संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के जन्म के सहस्राब्दी वर्ष में कई संस्थाएं मिलकर उनकी शिक्षा और संदेशों को घर-घर तक पहुंचा रही है। मुझे उम्मीद है कि इन शिक्षाओं और संदेशों को देश के वर्तमान से भी जोड़ा जा रहा होगा। 

You all are aware that Saint Shri Ramanujacharya had also linked fulfilling the needs of the poor with social responsibility. For instance, he got an artificial lake made, spread over 200 acres in Thondanur near Melkot. This lake continues to exist as a living example of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s work for the welfare of the people. Even today it serves over 70 villages, fulfilling their drinking water and irrigation needs. 

आज जब हर तरफ पानी को लेकर इतनी चिंता है, तब एक हजार वर्ष पूर्व बनाई गई ये झील इस बात का जवाब है कि जल संरक्षण क्यों आवश्यक है। एक हजार वर्ष में ना जाने कितनी पीढ़ियों को उस झील से आशीर्वाद मिला है, जीवन मिला है। ये झील इस बात का भी सबूत है कि जल संरक्षण को लेकर हम आज जो भी तैयारी करते हैं, उसका फायदा आने वाले सैकड़ों वर्षों तक लोगों को होता है। इसलिए आज नदियों की सफाई, झीलों की सफाई, लाखों तालाब खुदवाना, वर्तमान के साथ ही भविष्य की तैयारी का भी हिस्सा है। 

इस झील की चर्चा करते हुए मैं आप सभी से ये अपील करूंगा कि संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के कार्यों को लोगों तक पहुंचाते समय, जल संरक्षण को लेकर आज क्या कुछ किया जा सकता है, उस बारे में भी लोगों को सक्रिय करें। 

I would also like to make an appeal to the leaders of the various institutions gathered here. As India enters its 75th year of Independence in 2022, we are working on the weaknesses and constraints that hold us back. You too, must set yourself specific targets which are tangible and measurable. 

आप तय कर सकते हैं की दस हजार गांवों तक जाएंगे, या 50 हजार गांवों तक जाएंगे। 

मेरी अपील है कि संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य के राष्ट्रधर्म की चेतना जगाने वाले वचनों के साथ-साथ वर्तमान चुनौतियों को ध्यान में रखते हुए मानव कल्याण, नारी कल्याण, गरीब कल्याण के बारे में भी लोगों को और सक्रिय किया जाए। 

इन्हीं शब्दों के साथ मैं अपनी बात खत्म करता हूं। मैं एक बार फिर आप सभी का आभार व्यक्त करता हूं कि आपने मुझे संत श्री रामानुजाचार्य पर स्मारक डाक टिकट जारी करने का अवसर दिया। 

आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद !!!

Your Excellency President Erdogan Distinguished delegates, 

Members of the media, 

It is a pleasure for me to extend a warm welcome to President Erdogan and his delegation to India. 

Excellency, 

I will always cherish the memory of my visit to Turkey for the G-20 Summit in November 2015. Your visit gives us an opportunity to reciprocate the warmth and good-will that I enjoyed during my visit to your beautiful country. 

Friends, 

The people of India and Turkey have nurtured deep and historical links. Ties of culture and language connect our societies for hundreds of years. 

While Rumi found his home in Turkey, his legacy continues to enrich the Sufi traditions of India as well. 

Friends, In our comprehnsive discussions today, President Erdogan and I took stock of full range of our relations, particularly our political, economic and cultural engagement. We also shared perspectives on developments in our region. 

Friends, 

India and Turkey are two large economies. President and I are clear that the strength of our economies presents an enormous opportunity to expand and deepen commercial linkages between our countries. I also feel that at the level of the two governments, we need to approach the entire landscape of business opportunities in a strategic and long-term manner. Our bilateral trade turnover of around 6 billion dollars does not do full justice to convergences in our economies. Clearly, the business and industry on both sides can do much more. 

I am happy that a high level business delegation is accompanying President Erdogan Both of us addressed them, and the captains of the Indian industry this morning. 

I am sure that Turkish businesses would be quick to tap the diverse and unique opportunities inherent in rapidly growing India. I also believe that India’s infrastructure requirements, and I listed some of them this morning at the business Summit, and our vision of developing Smart Cities match well with the Turkish capacities. 

We would like to encourage stronger partnership of Turkish companies with our flagship programmes and projects, either on their own or in collaboration with the Indian companies. 

I have no doubt that the Agreements signed today and the substance of our conversation will further strengthen institutional cooperation between our two countries. 

Friends, 

We live in times where our societies face new threats and challenges every day. The context and contours of some of the existing and emerging security challenges globally is our common concern. 

In particular, the constantly evolving threat from terrorism is our shared worry. I held an extensive conversation with the President on this subject. We agreed that no intent or goal no reason or rationale can validate terrorism. 

The nations of the world, therefore, need to work as one to disrupt the terrorist networks and their financing and put a stop to cross border movement of terrorists. They also need to stand and act against those that conceive and create, support and sustain, shelter and spread these instruments and ideologies of violence. 

President and I agreed to work together to strengthen our cooperation, both bi-laterally and multi-laterally, to effectively counter this menace. 

Friends, 

We also discussed the need for comprehnsive UN reforms including the Security Council expansion to make the body more representative accountable and effective. Both of us recognize the need for the UN Security Council to reflect the world of the twenty first century and not of the century gone by. 


Excellency, 

Let me welcome you once again in India. I thank you for very productive discussions. Our decisions today will certainly drive the India-Turkey partnership to a higher level. I wish you a fruitful stay in India. 

Thank You. 

Thank you very much.

                Your Excellency President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of the Republic of Turkey, 

Distinguished Ministers, 

Members of the Turkish delegation, 

Friends from the Indian business community, 

Ladies and Gentlemen! 

I am delighted to have this opportunity to interact with the leading businessmen in today’s Forum. I extend a warm welcome to President Erdogan and all our Turkish friends present here. It is a pleasure to see a large number of business delegates accompanying President Erdogan. I am also very happy to see the participation of many Indian business leaders. 

Friends, 

India and Turkey enjoy great historic and cultural connect. We also share a common outlook on the present economic order in the world. 

Now, economic cooperation is becoming an important pillar of every bilateral relation. India and Turkey enjoy good economic ties. The growth in our bilateral trade over the years has been impressive. I understand that bilateral trade has increased significantly since President Ergodan last visited India. It has gone up from US Dollar 2.8 billion in 2008 to 6.4 billion in 2016. While this is encouraging, the level of present economic and commercial relations is not enough against the real potential. 

Friends! 

India and Turkey are among twenty largest economies in the world. More importantly, both economies have shown remarkable stability even in volatile global economic conditions. Our economies are based on strong fundamentals and for this reason, we are optimistic about our economic prospects. 

There is immense goodwill for each other between the people of the two countries. As we strive to build stronger political ties, the time has come to also make more aggressive effort to deepen the economic relations. We have a long history of doing business with each other. We have to build on this rich heritage. 

There is huge potential and opportunity to enhance the bilateral engagement. This is possible through trade and FDI inflows, technology tie-up, and cooperation on various projects. In this context, we have seen some increase in participation of Turkish companies in India. This has come through investment in blue chip Indian companies and FDI route in the last few years. However, such cooperation could go upto small and medium enterprises. Today’s knowledge-based global economy is continuously opening new areas. We must factor this in our economic and commercial interactions. 

You can see that the governments of both sides are committed to provide a business-friendly environment. However, it is the business leaders such as you who have to turn the national goal into reality for mutual benefit of the two nations. 

Friends! 

The Indian political system is known for its vibrant, open and participative democracy. Stability in political and administrative processes, and rule of law are the hallmark of our system. And these are important considerations for any serious long-term economic engagement. 

My government came to power in this very month three years back. Since then, we have launched several initiatives to reform the economy and administrative processes. We have also launched several flagship programmes like Make in India, Start up India and Digital India. The result of these is already visible in the recovery of Indian economy. Today, Indian economy is the fastest growing major economy in the world. In addition to maintaining this pace, our focus is also to remove the inefficiencies from the system. We are in the process of building a New India. Therefore, our focus is on making it easier to work; particularly to do business. This includes reforming the policies, processes and procedures. It also includes creating conditions and facilitating domestic and foreign investment. 

We have achieved lot of success and recognition on this front. Our Global ranking has gone up on many parameters. However, this is an ongoing effort. Therefore, it has to continue. It is basically a shift in attitude and approach. The objective is to make India a better place to enable people realize their potential. This is required in particular to provide employment and self-employment opportunities for our youth. The recent GST Legislation is another such initiative of my Government. This was an old demand to create a uniform and efficient business atmosphere in the country. 

I know that Turkish construction companies have successfully undertaken many construction and infrastructure projects in other countries. Our infrastructure requirements are enormous, including core as well as social and industrial infrastructure. We are keen to build it strong and build it fast. Turkish companies can easily participate in this task. Just to give you some examples: 

We have planned to build 50 million houses by 2022. For this purpose, we have repeatedly refined our FDI Policy in construction sector; 

We are planning metro rail projects in fifty cities and high speed trains in various National corridors; 

We have targeted 175 Giga Watt of renewable energy in next few years; 

In addition to generation of electricity, the issues of transmission, storage and distribution are equally important for us; 

We are modernizing our Railways and upgrading our Highways. In the last three years, we have made maximum allocation for these two sectors; 

We are putting up new ports and modernizing the old ones through an ambitious plan called Sagarmala; 

Similar focus is on upgrading the existing Airports and putting up regional airports to enhance connectivity to the places of economic and tourist importance. 

The Turkish tourism sector is globally renowned. The number of Indian tourists going to Turkey has increased in the last few years. Turkey has also become a popular destination for shooting of Indian films and for television industry. While we should definitely encourage two-way tourism, the industry should explore wider possibilities in this area. One example could be to reach out to our Regional Film Industry which is equally vibrant. 

We are aware that India and Turkey are both energy deficient and our energy needs are ever increasing. Hydrocarbon sector is therefore a common area of interest for both countries. The same would also be relevant for solar and wind energy. 

Therefore, the energy sector becomes an important pillar of our bilateral relations. Mining and food processing are other areas with great promise. We can also pool together our strengths in the textile and auto sectors. Turkey has a strong manufacturing sector and India is a low cost manufacturing hub. Besides the cost aspect, we have a large pool of skilled and semi-skilled work force and strong R&D capabilities. 

I am pleased to note that the mechanism of India-Turkey Joint Committee on Economic & Technical Cooperation is working well. In its next meeting, the Committee could undertake a review of the measures to be taken for promoting two-way trade and investment. 

Similarly, I would also urge the Chambers of Commerce & Industry of both sides to engage with each other pro-actively. Our processes should work closely both at the government and B-2-B level. 

I would like to thank President Erdogan , members of the delegation and members of Indo-Turkish business chambers for attending today’s forum. This is really an excellent opportunity for bringing together the Indian and Turkish business community. 

Friends! 

Let us work together for enhancing the level of our economic activities for welfare of our people. From the Indian side, I welcome you with open arms. 

I can say with confidence that India was never a more promising destination than it is today. 

To make it even better, I assure you of my personal care and co-operation. 

Thank You!

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a policy for providing preference to 'Make in India' in government procurements. The new policy will give a substantial boost to domestic manufacturing and service provision, thereby creating employment. It will also stimulate the flow of capital and technology into domestic manufacturing and services. It will also provide a further thrust towards manufacture of parts, components, sub-components etc. of these items, in line with the vision of 'Make in India'. 

The new policy is the reflection of the Government of India to encourage ‘Make in India’ and promote manufacturing and production of goods and services in India with a view to enhancing income and employment. Procurement by the Government is substantial in amount and can contribute towards this policy objective. Local content can be increased through partnerships, cooperation with local companies, establishing production units in India or Joint Ventures (JV) with Indian suppliers, increasing the participation of local employees in services and by training them. 

Details:

The policy will be implemented through an Order pursuant to Rule 153(iii) of the General Financial Rules, 2017 to provide purchase preference (linked with local content) in Government procurements. Under the policy, preference in Government procurement will be given to local suppliers. Local suppliers are those whose goods or services meet prescribed minimum thresholds (ordinarily 50%) for local content. Local content is essentially domestic value addition. 

In procurement of goods for Rs. 50 lakhs and less, and where the Nodal Ministry determines that there is sufficient local capacity and local competition, only local suppliers will be eligible. 

For procurements valued at more than Rs. 50 lakhs (or where there is insufficient local capacity/ competition) if the lowest bid is not from a non-local supplier, the lowest-cost local supplier who is within a margin of 20% of the lowest bid, will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid. If the procurement is of a type that the order can be divided and given to more than one supplier, the non-local supplier who is the lowest bidder will get half of the order and the local supplier will get the other half if it agrees to match the price of the lowest bid. If the procurement cannot be divided, then the lowest cost local supplier will be given the order if it agrees to match the lowest bid. 

Small purchases of less than Rs.5 lakhs are exempted. The order also covers autonomous bodies, government companies/ entities under the government’s control. 

The policy also requires that specifications in tenders must not be restrictive e.g. should not require proof of supply in other countries or proof of exports in respect of previous experience. They must not result in unreasonable exclusion of local suppliers who would otherwise be eligible, beyond what is essential for ensuring quality or creditworthiness of the supplier. 

The policy lays down a procedure for verification of local content relying primarily on self-certification. There will be penal consequences for false declarations. In some cases, verification by statutory / cost auditors etc. will be required. 

A Standing Committee in Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion will oversee the implementation of this order and issues arising therefrom, and make recommendations to Nodal Ministries and procuring entities. 

The policy has been developed keeping in view the core principles of procurement including competitiveness and adhering to sound procurement practices and execution of orders. The policy would continue to maintain the balance between promoting 'Make in India' and ensuring timely, value-for-money products for the procuring entities.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Noida - Greater Noida Metro Rail Project covering a length of 29.707 k.m.   Total completion cost of the project is Rs.5,503 crore.

 

Metro rail connection between NOIDA and Greater NOIDA will result into people being assured about their mobility and thus more people will like to move to these satellite towns of Delhi, thus decongesting Delhi. As a result, more residential and commercial complexes will develop in this region. With metro rail in place, there will be less vehicular traffic on roads leading to less congestion, less time and cost of journey, less consumption of fossil fuel and less environmental pollution.  People of Noida-Greater Noida, which has a population of approx. 7.50 Lakhs and people of surrounding areas will be benefitted with this metro link. 

 

Project will be implemented by Noida Metro Rail Corporation Limited, which will be a 50:50 jointly owned company of Govt. of India and Govt. of Uttar Pradesh.  The existing Noida Metro Rail Corporation Limited (NMRCL) which is a State owned Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be converted into a joint SPV of Government of India (Gol) and Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP), for implementation of the project.

 

The project would generate significant direct and indirect employment of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workforce.    Substantial indirect employment will also be generated during construction and operation phases.

 

The project is scheduled to be completed by April, 2018 as per the Detailed Project Report (DPR).   About 70% progress of civil work and 40% of overall financial progress of the project have been achieved.

 

Project will be covered under the legal framework of Central Metro Acts, Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 and the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, as amended from time to time.

 

 

Background:

 

The Noida city, located in Gautam Buddha Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh State, was created under the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act. It possesses all modern amenities and is considered to be one of the most modern suburbs of Delhi in the National Capital Region (NCR). The population of Noida and Greater Noida as per 2011 Census of India is about 7,50,000 and is projected to grow to 19,00,000 by the year 2021. People from Delhi and surrounding area are preferring NOIDA for settlement. Noida has a potential of about 10,000 industrial units and presently about 7,500 are developed and functional. Noida provides employment to over 2,00,000 in the region with these industrial units. Noida mainly has road linkages with Delhi and the adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana State. Noida does not have a railway station and the nearest railway station is Hazarat Nizamuddin, which is at a distance of about 15 km. The nearest airport Delhi is at about 30 km from Noida.

 

Greater Noida, also envisaged as a satellite town to control the migration to Delhi, is planned to have a population of 12,00,000 and employment potential of 4,50,000 by 2021. While settlements have started coming up in Greater Noida, it is still in the developing stage and needs greater connectivity with Noida and Delhi. Considering the relatively lower costs of housing at Greater Noida, people prefer staying in Greater Noida and commute to Noida / Delhi for employment. Greater Noida also mainly depends on road linkages for intra city traffic and connection with Noida and Delhi. Greater Noida does not have a railway station and the nearest railway station is Boraki, which is at 3 km from the proposed terminal metro station at Greater Noida. The nearest airport is Delhi at about 45 km from Greater Noida. The population is expected to grow exponentially in Noida -Greater Noida region in the coming years.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to Raising of Bonds of Rs. 2360 crores for Renewable Energy.

 

The Bonds will be raised by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) through the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) during the 2017-18. These funds will be used by MNRE in the approved programmes/schemes for solar park, green energy corridor, generation-based incentives for wind projects, CPSU and defence solar projects, viability gap funding for solar projects, roof-top solar, off-grid/grid-distributed and decentralized renewable power, investment in corporations and autonomous bodies etc. Such timely investment would boost infrastructure in renewable sector and facilitate achievement of ambitious targets for the renewable energy sector.  The resources raised would be used for developing additional capacity in renewable energy sector which would result in generation of additional employment.

 

Background

 

            The Government had declared additional finance mobilization of Rs. 31,300 crore bonds through NHAI, PFC, REC, IREDA and IWAI in the budget for FYT 2016-17. As a part of this, the Government had allocated Rs. 4000 crores to IREDA to raise “GOI fully serviced taxable Bonds” on behalf of the MNRE during the FY 2016-17. Out of this allocation, IREDA had raised Rs. 1640 crores as per the requirement of MNRE. The MNRE subsequently approached the Cabinet,   to approve raising  of the balance Rs. 2360 crores in the year 2016-17.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Germany and India regarding cooperation in the sector of alternative medicine. 

The signing of the JDl will enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the areas of traditional/alternative medicine. Initiation of collaborative research, training and scientific capacity building in the field of alternative medicine under the JDI between the two countries would contribute to the enhanced employment opportunities in the AYUSH sector. 

There are no additional financial implications involved. The financial resources necessary to conduct research, training courses, conferences / meetings will be met from the existing allocated budget and existing plan schemes of Ministry of AYUSH. 

Background:

India is blessed with well-developed systems of traditional medicine which hold tremendous potential in the global health scenario. Germany has considerable interest in Traditional Systems of Medicine. The Ministry of AYUSH as a part of its mandate to propagate Indian systems of Medicine globally has taken effective steps by entering into MoU with China, Malaysia, Trinidad & Tobago Hungary, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mauritius, Mongolia and Myanmar. 

The Ministry has taken many initiatives for promotion of Ayurveda in Germany with the recommendation and cooperation of the Indian Embassy in Berlin. One of the major initiatives is the collaborative research Project between the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and Charite University, Berlin on Osteoarthritis of the knee. The results of the trial are encouraging and the clinical trial demonstrates significant improvement in patients. The study has been completed successfully and is under publication. 

A delegation led by Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, Hon'ble Minister of State, (Independent Charge). Ministry of AYUSH had visited Germany from 15-19 October 2016 to participate in the 2nd European World Ayurveda Congress (EWAC) and have interactions with the authorities in Germany. The Congress was supported by the Ministry of AYUSH. During the visit a bilateral meeting was held between Hon'ble MoS(IC), AYUSH with the Parliamentary State Secretary Ms. Ingrid Fischbach during which both sides had unanimously agreed to begin the process of drafting and negotiating a JDl in the field of AYUSH and Natural medicine. It is expected that the JDI would give a boost to India-Germany ties and enhance cooperation between the two countries.

Impact:

The establishment of new AIIMS will serve the dual purpose of providing super speciality health care to the population while also help create a large pool of doctors and other health workers in this region that can be available for primary and secondary level institutions / facilities being created under National Health Mission (NHM). 

Background:

Under this scheme, AIIMS have been established in Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Raipur, Jodhpur, Rishikesh and Patna while work of AIIMS Rae Bareli is in progress. Also, three AIIMS in Nagpur (Maharashtra), Kalyani (West Bengal) and Mangalagiri in Guntur (Andhra Pradesh) have been sanctioned in 2015 and two AIIMS have been sanctioned at Bathinda and Gorakhpur in 2016.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded its approval today to a proposal jointly mooted by the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) for amendment of Central Road Fund Act, 2000 to allocate 2.5 per cent of the proceeds of Central Road Fund (CRF) for development and maintenance of National Waterways (NWs) and a reduction in the share provided for development of National Highways. The Cabinet has also directed that while implementing viable National Waterways projects, all such components that can be done on PPP basis, should be explored accordingly and government funding may be used only if private investment is not forthcoming for any component

 

  The Central Road Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2017 would be moved by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways in the ensuing Monsoon Session, 2017 of the Parliament.

 

Impact

 

An allocation of 2.5 per cent of CRF proceeds would provide approximately Rs.2000 crore per annum for the development and maintenance of NWs at existing rates of duties funding the CRF. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has estimated that approximately Rs. 25,000 crores would be required for development of identified projects on NWs till 2022-23. In this regard, works for construction of multi modal terminals, new navigation lock, River Information System, development of fairway etc., have already commenced under the Jal Marg Vikas Project being implemented on NW-1 (River Ganga). IWAI also has planned to undertake work on the development of 24 NWs during the next three years.

 

 It is estimated that 1.8 lakh persons would be provided employment in the Inland Waterways Transport (IWT) sector in the next five years. New employment opportunities are expected to be generated for operation and management of fairway, terminals, aids to navigation, barges, training, etc. Further, development of additional 106 NWs will create additional job opportunities. 

 

Background

 

The Government has been emphasizing the importance of developing Inland Water Transport Sector for the national economy. The National Waterways Act, 2016 for developing and maintaining the existing five NWs and new 106 NWs has been passed by Parliament and is now enforced. The arrangement approved by the Cabinet; would make available adequate and sustainable source of funding for NWs through institutional means of CRF. This is one more step towards promotion of Inland Water Transport sector as a cost effective, logistically efficient and environment friendly sector which would contribute in diverting traffic from the over congested roads and railways and offer an incentive and provide certainty for private companies to invest in the sector. It is estimated that a standard 2000 DWT vessel has the potential to transport 125 Truck Loads and almost one complete train rake (40 rail wagons) load on existing road and rail infrastructure.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the phasing out of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). The proposal entails abolishing the FIPB and allowing administrative Ministries/Departments to process applications for FDI requiring government approval.

 

Henceforth, the work relating to processing of applications for FDI and approval of the Government thereon under the extant FDI Policy and FEMA, shall now be handled by the concerned Ministries/Departments in consultation with the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion(DIPP), Ministry of Commerce, which will also issue the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for processing of applications and decision of the Government under the extant FDI policy.

 

In addition, Foreign Investors will find India more attractive destination and this will result in more inflow of FDI. The move will provide ease of doing business and will help in promoting the principle of Maximum Governance and Minimum Government.

 

Background

 

            The proposal for abolition of FIPB was approved by the Cabinet in its meeting on 24-05-2017. Presently, applications are considered by FIPB in Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance comprising of various Secretaries of Government of India for making recommendation on FDI applications. After the Cabinet decision, it would be handled independently by Administrative Ministries as per Sector.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The Convention is an outcome of the OECD / G20 BEPS Project to tackle base erosion and profit shifting through tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. 

The Final BEPS Project identified 15 actions to address BEPS in a comprehensive manner. Implementation of the Final BEPS Package requires changes to more than 3000 bilateral tax treaties which will be burdensome and time consuming. In view of the same, the Convention was conceived as a Multilateral instrument which would swiftly modify all covered bilateral tax treaties (Covered Tax Agreements / CTA) to implement BEPS measures. For this purpose, formation of an Ad-hoc Group for the development of such multilateral instrument was endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in February 2015. 

Background: 

India was part of the Ad Hoc Group of more than 100 countries and jurisdictions from G20, OECD, BEPS associates and other interested countries, which worked on an equal footing on the finalization of the text of the Multilateral Convention, starting May 2015. The text of the Convention and the accompanying Explanatory Statement was adopted by the Ad hoc Group on 24 November 2016. 

The Convention implements two minimum standards relating to prevention of treaty abuse and dispute resolution through Mutual Agreement Procedure. The Convention will not function in the same way as an Amending Protocol to a single existing treaty, which would directly amend the text of the Covered Tax Agreements. Instead, it will be applied alongside existing tax treaties, modifying their application in order to implement the BEPS measures. The Convention ensures consistency and certainty in the implementation of the BEPS Project in a multilateral context. The Convention also provides flexibility to exclude a specific tax treaty and to opt out of provisions or parts of provisions through making of reservations. 

The Convention has been opened for signature as on 31st December 2016 and a first joint signing ceremony is scheduled to be held in Paris on 7th June, 2017. Signature is the first step in the process of expressing consent to be bound by the Convention, which will become binding only upon ratification. A list of Covered Tax Agreements as well as a list of reservations and options chosen by a country are required to be made at the time of signature or when depositing the instrument of ratification. 

Cabinet approval has been sought for the signing of the Convention by India. It is also proposed to make a provisional list of Covered Tax Agreements and a provisional list of reservations at the time of signature in June, 2017. Final lists for both will be submitted by India at the time of submission of instrument of ratification. 

Signing of the Multilateral Convention will enable the application of BEPS outcomes through modification of existing tax treaties of India in a swift manner. It is also in India's interest to ensure that all its treaty partners adopt the BEPS anti-abuse outcomes. Signing of the Convention will enable curbing of revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Australia on Cooperation in Combating International Terrorism and Transnational Organized Crime. 

The proposed MoU would strengthen the relationship between India and Australia for building peace and stability in the region through exchange of information, expertise, experience and capacity building. 

The MoU is an effective framework to deal with all issues requiring interaction and cooperation in the areas identified. 

The mutual cooperation would facilitate the institutional interactions between the two countries. The MoU, once in force, would help in curbing combating International Terrorism and Transnational Organized Crime.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Faculty Exchange Agreement signed between the National Defence College, New Delhi and National Defence College, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 

The objective of the Agreement is to institutionalize regular exchange programs and establish sustainable mechanisms between the two National Defence Colleges with an aim to enhancing mutual cooperation in the field of national security, development and strategic studies. 

Given the geographical and cultural closeness between the two countries, there are many common challenges like countering terrorism that needs joint action. Hence, there is a need for better coordination and cooperation among the armed forces. The exchange of faculty members of the premier institutes will help to bring symmetry in the capacities of the armed forces and contribute to countering and managing common threats and challenges much better. 

The Agreement establishes the framework for enhanced cooperation in the field of military education concerning strategic and operational studies.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for amendment in Section 2 and Section 3 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 (PPE Act, 1971), by inserting definition of 'residential accommodation occupation' in a new clause in section 2 of the Act and inserting provisions relating to eviction from 'residential accommodation occupation' in a new sub-section 3B below sub-section 3A of Section 3 of the Act. 

The Amendment will enable the Estate officer to apply summary proceedings for evicting unauthorised occupants from residential accommodations allotted for a fixed tenure or for a period he/she holds office on the basis of an order of allotment on licence basis, as non-vacation of such residences leads to unavailability of houses to new incumbents. 

Thus, now, the Estate Officer can make such inquiry as he deems expedient in the circumstances of the case and thus do not have to follow the elaborate procedures prescribed as per sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Act. Estate Officers can even make an order for the eviction of such persons forthwith following the procedure proposed in the new section. If such persons refuse or fail to comply with the said order of eviction, Estate Officer may evict them from premises and take possession thereof and may, for that purpose, use such force as may be necessary. 

The amendment will thus facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from government residences. 

As a consequence to these amendments, Government of India can now ensure that the unauthorised occupants are evicted from government residence in a speedy and smooth manner and the vacated accommodations are made available to eligible Govt. employees thus reducing the waiting period. 

The amendments will facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from government residence, as non-vacation in time leads to unavailability of houses to new incumbents and will increase the availability of the residential accommodation benefitting the waitlisted persons. 

The beneficiaries include the employees of the Central Government offices who are eligible for General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) and waiting for the maturity of their turn. 

Background: 

The Government of India has to evict unauthorized occupants from Government accommodations under the provisions of PPE Act, 1971. However, the eviction proceedings take unusually long time, thereby reducing the availability of govt. accommodations to new incumbents.

                In a significant decision to fast-track India’s domestic nuclear power programme, and give a push to country’s nuclear industry, the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for construction of 10 units of India’s indigenous Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR).  The total installed capacity of the Plants will be 7000 MW. The 10 PHWR project will result in a significant augmentation of nuclear power generation capacity. 

India has current installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW from 22 operational plants. Another 6700 MWs of nuclear power is expected to come onstream by 2021-22 through projects presently under construction.
As the government marks three years of its nation and people centric governnace, in a first of its kind project for India’s nuclear power sector, the ten new units will come up in fleet mode as a fully homegrown initiative. It would be one of the flagship “Make in India” projects in this sector.

With likely manufacturing orders of close to 70,000 crores to the domestic industry, the project will help transform Indian nuclear industry by linking our goal of a strong nuclear power sector with our indigenous industrial capacities in high-end technologies.

This Project will bring about substantial economies of scale and maximise cost and time efficiencies by adopting fleet mode for execution. It is expected to generate more than 33,400 jobs in direct and indirect employment. With manufacturing orders to domestic industry, it will be a major step towards strengthening India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing powerhouse.

The ten reactors will be part of India’s latest design of 700 MW PHWR fleet with state-of-art technology meeting the highest standards of safety.

The approval also marks a statement of strong belief in the capability of India’s scientific community to build our technological capacities. The design and development of this project is a testament to the rapid advances achieved by India’s nuclear scientific community and industry. It underscores the mastery our nuclear scientists have attained over all aspects of indigenous PHWR technology. India’s record of building and operating PHWR reactors over the last nearly forty years is globally acclaimed. 

The Cabinet’s decision reflects the Government’s commitment to prioritise the use of clean power in India’s energy mix, as part of low-carbon growth strategy and to ensure long-term base load requirement for the nation’s industrialization.

It also supports India’s commitment to sustainable development, energy self-sufficiency and bolsters global efforts to combat climate change.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the introduction of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites Remains (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the Parliament.

To make way for certain constructions limited strictly to public works and projects essential to public within the prohibited area, the following amendments have been approved: 

i) Insertion of a new definition of “public works” in section 2 of the Act. 

ii) Amendment to section 20A of the Act so as to allow any Department or Office of the Central Government to carry out public works in the prohibited area after obtaining permission from the Central Government. 

iii) Insertion of a new clause (ea) to section 20-I of the principal Act

Background:

The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites Remains Act, 1958 (as amended in the year 2010) prohibits grant of any permission for new construction within the prohibited area of a centrally protected monument/ site. 

Prohibition of new construction within prohibited area is adversely impacting various public works and developmental projects of the Central Government. 

The amendment will pave way for certain constructions limited strictly to public works and projects essential to public within the prohibited area and benefit the public at large.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to Pan-India implementation of Maternity Benefit Program which now has been extended to all districts of the country w.e.f. 01.01.2017. The Prime Minister in his address to the nation on 31.12.2016 had announced Pan-India implementation of Maternity Benefit Program.

The Maternity Benefit Program will provide compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the women can take adequate rest before and after delivery and not be deprived of proper nutrition. 

The total cost of the proposal for the period from 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2020 including Central and State Government share isRs.12,661crore. Government of India’s share during the period 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2020 comes to around Rs. 7932 crore.

 

Objective of the Scheme

i)        To provide partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child.

 

ii)      The cash incentives provided would lead to improved health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mother (PW&LM) to reduce the effects of under-nutrition namely stunting, wasting and other related problems.

 

Target Group

All eligible Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM), excluding the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are in regular employment with the Central Government or State Government or Public Sector Undertakings or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being. It has been decided to give the benefit of Rs.5000/- to PW&LM in three installment for the birth of the first live child by MWCD and the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under existing programmes after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman will get ₹ 6000/-.

 

Conditions and installments

Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are eligible will receive a cash benefit of Rs.5,000/- in three installment at the following stages as specified in the table given below:

 


	
		
			
			Cash Transfer
			
			
			Conditions
			
			
			Amount

			(in ₹)
			
		
		
			
			First installment
			
			
			·   Early Registration of Pregnancy.
			
			
			1,000/-
			
		
		
			
			Second installment
			
			
			·   Received at least one antenatal Check-up (after 6 months of pregnancy)
			
			
			2,000/-
			
		
		
			
			Third installment
			
			
			·   Child birth is registered.

			·   Child has received first cycle of BCG, OPV, DPT and Hepatitis-B or its equivalent/substitute.
			
			
			    2,000/-
			
		
	


 

The eligible beneficiaries would continue to receive the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under existing programmes after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman will get ₹ 6000/-.

 

Mode of cash transfer to the Beneficiaries 

The conditional cash transfer scheme would be in DBT mode.

Background:

The Government of India is committed to ensure that every woman gets adequate support and health care during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and every newborn is immunized on time which is the foundation for better health of the mother and the newborn. Normally, the first pregnancy of a woman exposes her to new kinds of challenges and stress factors. Hence, the scheme intends to provide support to the mother for safe delivery and immunization of her first living child. The improved health care seeking behaviour of the PW&LM would lead to better health status for the mother and the child.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Third Line of Credit (LoC) of US $ 4.5 billion to Bangladesh for implementation of developmental projects. 

The MoU was signed during the visit of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh to India in April 2017. 

The MoU provides for deepening the strategic partnership, development of infrastructure in Bangladesh, improving connectivity between India and Bangladesh, thus enhancing accessibility to our North Eastern Region, as well as creating new business opportunities for Indian companies in Bangladesh. 

The concessional financing system to Bangladesh would strengthen bilateral relations and development cooperation between India and Bangladesh. 

The MoU specifies a list of projects which will be undertaken under the concessional financing system. This provides an opportunity to ensure that projects of India’s interest are undertaken under this LoC. 

Some of the projects will ensure better and faster connectivity to the North Eastern region of India with the mainland as well as to the outside world. They will also ensure India’s security and will open up business for Indian companies.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington and Defence Services Command and Staff College, Mirpur, Dhaka for Cooperation concerning Military Education in the Field of Strategic and Operational Studies. 

The MoU will enable establishment of a framework for enhanced cooperation in the field of military education concerning strategic and operational studies and promotion of closer and long-term cooperation between the two countries. 

Given the geographical and cultural closeness between the two countries, there are many common challenges like countering terrorism that needs joint action. Hence, there is a need for better coordination and cooperation among the armed forces. The joint training and exercises will help to bring symmetry in capacities of the armed forces and contribute to countering and managing common threats and challenges much better. The MoU enhances public accountability by way of exchange of information and technology between India and Bangladesh.

Focus on enhancing domestic consumption, high quality steel production and making the sector globally competitive 
 



The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for National Steel Policy (NSP) 2017.

 

The new Steel Policy enshrines the long term vision of the Government to give impetus to the steel sector.  It seeks to enhance domestic steel consumption and ensure high quality steel production and create a technologically advanced and globally competitive steel industry.

 

Key features of the NSP 2017:

 

1.      Create self-sufficiency in steel production by providing policy support & guidance to private manufacturers, MSME steel producers, CPSEs

2.      Encourage adequate capacity additions,

3.      Development of globally competitive steel manufacturing capabilities,

4.      Cost-efficient production

5.      Domestic availability of iron ore, coking coal & natural gas,

6.      Facilitating foreign investment                  

7.      Asset acquisitions of raw materials &

8.      Enhancing the domestic steel demand.

 

The policy projects crude steel capacity of 300 million tonnes (MT), production of 255 MT and a robust finished steel per capita consumption of 158 Kgs by 2030 - 31, as against the current consumption of 61 Kgs. The policy also envisages to domestically meet the entire demand of high grade automotive steel, electrical steel, special steels and alloys for strategic applications and increase domestic availability of washed coking coal so as to reduce import dependence on coking coal from about 85% to around 65% by 2030-31.

Some highlights of New Steel Policy

 

Ø  The Indian steel sector has grown rapidly over the past few years and presently it is the third largest steel producer globally, contributing to about 2% of the country's GDP.  India has also crossed 100 MT mark for production for sale in 2016-17.

 

Ø  The New Steel Policy, 2017 aspires to achieve 300MT of steel-making capacity by 2030. This would translate into additional investment of Rs. 10 lakh Crore by 2030-31.

 

Ø  The Policy seeks to increase consumption of steel and major segments are infrastructure, automobiles and housing. New Steel Policy seeks to increase per capita steel consumption to the level of 160 Kgs by 2030 from existing level of around 60 Kg.

 

Ø  Potential of MSME steel sector has been recognised. Policy stipulates that adoption of energy efficient technologies in the MSME steel sector will be encouraged to improve the overall productivity & reduce energy intensity.

 

Ø  Steel Ministry will facilitate R&D in the sector through the establishment of Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI). The initiative is aimed to spearhead R&D of national importance in iron & steel sector utilizing tripartite synergy amongst industry, national R&D laboratories and academic institutes.

 

Ø  Ministry through policy measures will ensure availability of raw materials like Iron ore, Coking coal and non-coking coal, Natural gas etc.  at competitive rates.

 

Ø  With the roll out of the National Steel Policy-2017, it is envisaged that the industry will be steered in creating an environment for promoting domestic steel and thereby ensuring a scenario where production meets the anticipated pace of growth in consumption, through a technologically advanced and globally competitive steel industry. This will be facilitated by Ministry of Steel, in coordination with relevant Ministries, as may be required.

 

 

Background:

 

Steel is one of the most important products in the modern world and forms the backbone to any industrial economy. India being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and steel finding its extensive application right from construction, infrastructure, power, aerospace and industrial machinery to consumer products, the sector is of strategic importance to the country. The Indian steel sector has grown exponentially over the past few years to be the third largest producer of steel globally, contributing to about 2% of the country's GDP and employing about 5 lakh people directly and about 20 lakh people indirectly.

 

Untapped potential with a strong policy support becomes the ideal platform for growth. Owing to the strategic importance of the sector along with the need to have a robust and restructured policy in present scenario, the new NSP, 2017 became imminent. Though, National Steel Policy 2005 (NSP 2005) sought to indicate ways and means of consolidating the gains flowing out of the then economic order and charted out a road map for sustained and efficient growth of the Indian steel industry, it required adaptation in view of the recent developments unfolding in India and also worldwide, both on the demand and supply sides of the steel market.

The benefit of the proposed modifications will be available with effect from 1st January, 2016, i.e., the date of implementation of 7th CPC recommendations. With the increase approved by the Cabinet, the annual pension bill alone of the Central Government is likely to be Rs.1,76,071 crore.  Some of the important decisions of the Cabinet are mentioned below:

 

1.        Revision of pension of pre – 2016 pensioners and family pensioners

The Cabinet approved modifications in the recommendations of the 7th CPC relating to the method of revision of pension of pre-2016 pensioners and family pensioners based on suggestions made by the Committee chaired by Secretary (Pensions) constituted with the approval of the Cabinet.  The modified formulation of pension revision approved by the Cabinet will entail an additional benefit to the pensioners and an additional expenditure of approximately Rs.5031 crore for 2016-17 over and above the expenditure already incurred in revision of pension as per the second formulation based on fitment factor.  It will benefit over 55 lakh pre-2016 civil and defence pensioners and family pensioners.

 

While approving the implementation of the 7th CPC recommendations on 29th June, 2016, the Cabinet had approved the changed method of pension revision recommended by the 7th CPC for pre-2016 pensioners, comprising of two alternative formulations, subject to the feasibility of the first formulation which was to be examined by the Committee.

 

In terms of the Cabinet decision, pensions of pre-2016 pensioners were revised as per the second formulation multiplying existing pension by a fitment factor of 2.57, though the pensioners were to be given the option of choosing the more beneficial of the two formulations as per the 7th CPC recommendations.

 

In order to provide the more beneficial option to the pensioners, Cabinet has accepted the recommendations of the Committee, which has suggested revision of pension based on information contained in the Pension Payment Order (PPO) issued to every pensioner.  The revised procedure of fixation of notional pay is more scientific, rational and implementable in all the cases.  The Committee reached its findings based on an analysis of hundreds of live pension cases.  The modified formulation will be beneficial to more pensioners than the first formulation recommended by the 7th CPC, which was not found to be feasible to implement on account of non-availability of records in a large number of cases and was also found to be prone to several anomalies. 

 

2.         Disability Pension for Defence Pensioners

 

The Cabinet also approved the retention of percentage-based regime of disability pension implemented post 6th CPC, which the 7th CPC had recommended to be replaced by a slab-based system.

           

The issue of disability pension was referred to the National Anomaly Committee by the Ministry of Defence on account of the representation received from the Defence Forces to retain the slab-based system, as it would have resulted in reduction in the amount of disability pension for existing pensioners and a reduction in the amount of disability pension for future retirees when compared to percentage-based disability pension. 

 

The decision which will benefit existing and future Defence pensioners would entail an additional expenditure of approximately Rs. 130 crore per annum.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its ‘In Principle’ approval to transfer the property of Hotel Janpath, New Delhi to Ministry of Urban Development. 

Hotel Janpath is located in a prime central location of the city. The property can be considered for construction of Government offices and similar purposes which would save government funds spent in hiring of government offices. 

Details of implementation of the project, land usages, etc. would be taken subsequently by a Committee of Secretaries to be constituted under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary. 

The building of Hotel Janpath has to undergo major rehabilitation work since the building structure of Hotel Janpath has been found to be unserviceable, in distressed condition and deficit in the context of seismic requirements, according to the inspection report of IIT Roorkee. 

Background: 

The Government of India has initiated the process of disinvestment of hotels / properties of the India Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (ITDC). The decision on disinvestment-has been made, keeping in view that running and managing hotels on professional lines is not the work of the Government or its entities. 

As part of the disinvestment policy, it has been decided to lease/sub-lease the hotels / properties jointly with the concerned States or return the properties to the States, after fair valuation. The States would then, have the option to upgrade and operate the Motels by involving the private sector or to utilize the properties as per their requirements. States have exercised their options accordingly, in each case going forward with, the option best suited to their needs. 

In the first stage of the disinvestment process, it was decided to disinvest three hotels, viz. Hotel Lake View Ashok, Bhopal, Hotel Brahmaputra Ashok, Guwahati and Hotel Bharatpur Ashok. Hotel Janpath, New Delhi is next in the list.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for fixing the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane at Rs. 255/- per quintal (qt) for sugar season 2017-18 linked to a basic recovery rate of 9.5% subject to a premium of Rs. 2.68 per qtl for every 0.1% point increase in recovery above that level. The approved FRP reflects an increase of 10.87% over the FRP of sugar season 2016-17. The FRP so approved shall be applicable for purchase of sugarcane from the farmers in the sugar season 2017-18 by the sugar mills. The move is a reflection of the Government’s pro-farmer initiatives, keeping in mind the interest of sugarcane farmers and importance of the sugar industry. 

Details

The sugar industry is an important agro-based industry that impacts the livelihood of about 50 million sugarcane farmers and around 5 lakh workers directly employed in sugar mills, apart from those employed in various ancillary activities including farm labour and transporters. This decision has been taken to provide appropriate price to the farmers for their cane. 

FRP of sugarcane has been determined on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and after consultation with State Governments and other stake-holders. Recommended FRP has been arrived at by taking into account various factors such as cost of production, overall demand-supply situation, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade prices of primary by-products, and likely impact of FRP on general price level and resource use efficiency. 

During the last 3 years, in order to support the sugarcane farmers and to ensure that their dues are paid by the sugar mills, the Government of India introduced schemes such as SEFASU; Soft Loan, Incentive for Raw Sugar Export and Production Subsidy. Through these interventions, the funds made available to the mills were utilized for payment of the cane price arrears of the farmers. Direct credit into the farmers’ bank accounts of their dues was also mandated. 

As a consequence, clearance of cane price arrears of farmers reached 99.33% for 2014-15 sugar season and 98.5% for 2015-16 sugar season. Cane price arrears for the current sugar season 2016-17 is the lowest as compared to last five years of the corresponding period. 

In order to address the current sugar season’s shortfall in production and any possible adverse price sentiment, the Government has allowed import of only 5 lakh MT of raw sugar at zero duty. However, to protect the Indian farmers, import quantity has been restricted along with zonal restrictions so as to make it available only in actually deficient areas and safeguard the interest of cane farmers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the development of four laning of Porbandar-Dwarka Section of NH-8E in Gujarat.

The cost is estimated to be Rs.1958.88 crore including cost of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities. The total length of the road to be developed is approximately 118 kms.

This work will be done under the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) Phase IV on Hybrid Annuity Mode.

The project will help in expediting the improvement of infrastructure in Gujarat and in reducing the time and cost of travel for traffic, particularly heavy traffic, plying between Porbandar-Dwarka section. The development of this stretch will also help in uplifting the socio-economic condition of this region in the State.

It would also increase employment potential for local labourers for project activities. It has been estimated that a total number of 4,076 mandays are required for construction of one kilometre of highway. As such, employment potential of 4,80,000 (approx.) mandays will be generated locally during the construction period of this stretch.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Phephana-Indara and Mau-Shahganj (excluding Indara-Mau) totaling 150 km approximately in Uttar Pradesh.

The respective length of the Phephana-Indara and Mau-Shahganj lines will be 50.53 km and 99.75 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1028.95 crore with expected completion cost of Rs.1190.98 crore. The project is likely to be completed in next five years.

The doubling of these lines will remove the pressure over the congested North Central Railway route by providing an alternative route. Also, more number of goods/passenger trains could be run after doubling. It will lead to economic prosperity and development of the areas.

Background:

The areas served by this route are densely populated and there has been persistent unfulfilled demand of additional trains for the local and metropolitans cities. Shahganj-Mau-Phephna provides an important link between Amritsar-Moradabad-Lucknow-Mughalsarai-Patna section and Gorakhpur-Chhapra-Hajipur-Guwahati section. Thus doubling of this section will provide much needed relief toVaranasi-Mughalsarai and Makama-Barauni section which are highly congested.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of electrified third line between Manmad-Jalgaon in Maharashtra.

The total length of the Manmad-Jalgaon line will be 160 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1035.16 crore with expected completion cost of Rs.1198.92 crore. The project is likely to be completed in next five years.

Construction of third line will greatly ease the ever increasing passenger and freight traffic on Manmad-Jalgaon route thereby increasing the revenue of Railways. Jalgaon and Nashik districts of Maharashtra will be covered by this route.

Background:

Manmad-Jalgaon section caters to the traffic of Delhi-Mumbai and Kolkata-Mumbai corridors. Two double line tracks from Wardha and Itarsi, respectively, converge at Bhusawal. Work of 3rd and 4th line in Jalgaon-Bhusawal section is already under progress. Operations on the section have already reached to saturation. The third line between Manmad-Jalgaon section is imperative and inescapable.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic
Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the
signing of Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) with the Letter of Assurance (LoA)
holders. Allocation of linkages for power sector shall be based on auction of
linkages or through Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) based on competitive bidding
of tariffs except for the State and the Central Power Generating companies and
the exceptions provided in Tariff Policy, 2016. Coal drawal will be permitted
against valid Long Term PPAs and to be concluded Medium Term PPAs. 

 

The approved framework ensures that
all projects with linkages are supplied coal as per their entitlement. This
will ensure the rights of coal supplies for FSA holders and signing of FSA with
LoA holders.

 

Allocation of linkages in future
will be transparent and bidding based, barring some exceptions as per Tariff
Policy. Future allocation/grant of linkages will be based on auction and/or
tariff based bidding.  It attempts to make optimal allocation of the vital
natural resource across the power units.

 

            The salient features
of the SHAKTI are as follows:

 

                          
i.           
TPPs having LoA shall be eligible to
sign FSA after ensuring that the plants are commissioned, respective milestones
met, all specified conditions of the LoA fulfilled within specified timeframe
and where nothing adverse is detected against the LoA holders and the TPPs are
commissioned before 31.03.22.

                        
ii.           
TPPs, part of 78000 MW, that could not
be commissioned by 31.03.15 shall now be eligible for coal drawal if the plants
are commissioned before 31.03.22.

                      
iii.           
Actual coal supplies to all TPPs shall
be to the extent of long term PPAs or medium term PPAs to be concluded in
future.

                      
iv.           
Future coal linkages shall be granted as
per the following provisions:

 

a)      To
Central and State Gencos, on recommendations of Ministry of Power (MoP).

b)      Coal
linkages shall be granted on auction basis for Independent Power producers
(IPPs) with PPA based on domestic coal. The IPPs participating in auction will
bid for discount on the existing tariff. The discount on tariff would be
adjusted from the gross amount of bill at the time of billing.

c)      The
future coal linkages for supply of coal to IPPs without PPA shall be on the
basis of auction where bidding for linkage shall be done over the Notified
Price of Coal Company. The LoA shall be issued to the successful bidders and
FSA signed after meeting the terms of LoA.

d)     Linkages
shall be earmarked to the States where any linkage quantity unutilized for two
years shall lapse. States may indicate the earmarked linkages to the
DISCOMs/SDAs, who may:

 

·        
Undertake tariff based competitive
bidding on long-term and medium-term PPAs and allot these linkages to the
successful bidder; or

·        
Assign these linkages to capacities that
are covered under exceptions and proviso clauses of para 5.2 of the Tariff
Policy dated 28.01.16.

e)      Power
requirement of group of States can be aggregated and procurement of power on
tariff based bidding shall be made by a designated agency. Coal linkages shall
be earmarked for such agency.

f)       Linkages,
for full normative quantity, shall be granted for setting up Ultra Mega Power
Projects (UMPP).

g)      Coal
linkages, for IPPs having PPA based on imported coal, shall be made available
through a transparent bidding process. 

 

 

 

Policy directions will be issued by
the Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Power and will be implemented by CIL (Coal
India Ltd.) / SCCL (Singareni Collieries Company Ltd.) and different power
entities of the State and Central Government.

 

Background:

 

The coal supply to the TPPs has
been made as per the provisions of the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP),
2007. Till 2010, CIL had issued LoA for approximately 1,08,000 MW capacity and
no new LoAs were issued thereafter due to the prevailing scarcity scenario. The
CCEA decision of 21.06.13 directed CIL to sign FSA with TPPs of about 78,000 MW
capacity. The coal availability scenario has, now, emerged from scarcity to
adequacy. In this adequate coal availability scenario, the present policy
proposes a fading away of the old linkage allocation policy and emergence of a
new linkage allocation policy based on transparent and objective criteria for
the optimal utilisation of the natural resources.

 

Coal linkage to the power sector is
governed by provisions of the NCDP, 2007. Under the NCDP, a system of issuance
of LoA was introduced wherein requests for Linkage/LoA are forwarded to MoP for
its recommendations. These recommendations are placed before the Standing
Linkage Committee (SLCLT) which authorizes issue of LoA.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved a restructuring plan for Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. (HOCL), a loss making and sick Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals. The company, having units at Rasayani (Maharashtra) and Kochi (Kerala), has been making continuous cash losses since 2011-12 resulting in acute shortage of working capital. Most of its plants have remained shut down during the last few years. It could not pay regular salary and statutory dues to the employees since February, 2015.

 

Restructuring:

 The restructuring plan involves closing down the operations of all the non-viable plants at Rasayani unit of HOCL except Di-Nitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4) plant which is to be transferred to ISRO on 'as is where is' basis, with about 20 acres of land and employees associated with the plant. The N2O4 plant is of strategic importance as it is the only indigenous source of N2O4 which is used as liquid rocket propellant by ISRO in the space launch vehicles.

 

Financial implications:

 Financial implications of the plan is Rs. 1008.67 crore (cash) which is to be met partly from sale of 442 acres HOCL land at Rasayani to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (Rs.618.80 crore) and the balance (Rs.365.26 crore) through bridge loan from the Govt. The funds will be used to liquidate the various liabilities of the company, including payment of outstanding salary and statutory dues of employees and repayment of Govt. guaranteed bonds of Rs.250 crore due for redemption in Aug.-Sept. 2017. The bridge loan amount, along with other Govt. liabilities of the company, is proposed to be repaid to the Govt. from the disposal of remaining unencumbered land and other assets of Rasayani unit.

 

Impact:

 Implementation of the restructuring plan will enable HOCL to close down the operations of non - viable plants at Rasayani unit while transferring the strategically important N2O4 plant to ISRO to ensure continuity of manufacture and supply of N2O4 for ISRO's space programme. Interest and welfare of employees will be addressed by payment of all their outstanding salary dues. Disposal of land assets, initially through sale of 442 acres to BPCL and subsequently of the remaining unencumbered land, will unlock the land assets for being redeployed for economically productive investments and thereby creating new employment generation opportunities.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for re-structuring the schemes of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) under new Central Sector Scheme – SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) for the period 2016-20 coterminous with the 14th Finance Commission cycle.

 

SAMPADA with an allocation of Rs. 6,000 crore is expected to leverage investment of Rs. 31,400 crore, handling of 334 lakh MT agro-produce valuing Rs. 1,04,125 crore, benefit 20 lakh farmers and generate 5,30,500 direct/ indirect employment in the country by the year 2019-20.

 

The objective of SAMPADA is to supplement agriculture, modernize processing and decrease agri-waste.

 

SAMPADA is an umbrella scheme incorporating ongoing schemes of the Ministry like Mega Food Parks, Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, etc. and also new schemes like Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages, Creation / Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities.

 

The SAMPADA is a comprehensive package to give a renewed thrust to the food processing sector in the country. It includes new schemes of Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages and Creation / Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities aim at development of modern infrastructure to encourage entrepreneurs to set up food processing units based on cluster approach, provide effective and seamless backward and forward integration for processed food industry by plugging gaps in supply chain and creation of processing and preservation capacities and modernization/ expansion of existing food processing units.

 

The implementation of SAMPADA will result in creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. It will not only provide a big boost to the growth of food processing sector in the country but also help in providing better prices to farmers and is a big step towards doubling of farmers’ income. It will create huge employment opportunities especially in the rural areas. It will also help in reducing wastage of agricultural produce, increasing the processing level, availability of safe and convenient processed foods at affordable price to consumers and enhancing the export of the processed foods. 

 

Background:

 

Food Processing Sector has emerged as an important segment of the Indian economy in terms of its contribution to GDP, employment and investment. During 2015-16, the sector constituted as much as 9.1 and 8.6 per cent of GVA in Manufacturing and Agriculture sector respectively.

 

The manifesto of NDA Government stresses upon incentivizing the setting up of food processing industry for providing better income for the farmers and creating jobs.

 

Various measures have been taken by the government to give a boost to the food processing sector. With these measures food processing sector has grown at 7 per cent. In order to arrest post-harvest losses of horticulture & non-horticulture produce, the Ministry has accorded approval to 42 Mega Food Parks and 236 Integrated Cold Chains for creation of modern infrastructure for the food processing along the value chain from the farm to the market. Out of 42 Mega Food Parks, 8 are operational. Of this, 6 Mega Food Parks have been made operational during the last 3 years. Another 4 Mega Food Parks are targeted for operationalization in next three months. Similarly, out of 236 Cold Chains, 101 Cold Chains have been sanctioned recently in March, 2017. 100 Cold Chains have become operational. Of which, 63 Cold Chains have been made operational during last 3 years.

 

Government has taken various other measures to boost food processing sector as follows:

 

(a)      To provide impetus to investment in food processing and retail sector, govt. has allowed 100% FDI in trading including through e-commerce, in respect of food products manufactured and / or produced in India. This will benefit farmers immensely and will create back – end infrastructure and significant employment opportunities.

(b)      The govt. has also set up a Special Fund of Rs. 2000 crore in NABARD to make available affordable credit at concessional rate of interest to designated food parks and agro processing units in the designated food parks.

(c)      Food and agro–based processing units and cold chain infrastructure have been brought under the ambit of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) to provide additional credit for food processing activities and infrastructure thereby, boosting food processing, reducing wastage, create employment and increasing farmers’ income.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the initiation of the process of disinvestment of hotels/properties of the India Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (ITDC). The decision on disinvestment has been made, keeping in view that running and managing hotels on professional lines is not the work of the Government or its entities. Further, there has been considerable development in the hospitality sector in the country in past years, with world class hotels and all leading international chains of hotels present in the country and providing services and facilities of highest standards. 

As part of the disinvestment policy, it has been decided to lease/sub-lease the hotels / properties jointly with the concerned States or return the properties to the States, after fair valuation. The States would then have the option to upgrade and operate the Hotels by involving the private sector or to utilize the properties as per their requirements. States have exercised their options accordingly, in each case going forward with the option best suited to their needs, in line with the overarching principle that it is not the business of Government to run or manage hotels. 

In the first stage of the disinvestment process, three hotels listed below have been taken up for disinvestment: 

(i) Hotel Lake View Ashok, Bhopal

(ii) Hotel Brahmaputra Ashok, Guwahati

(iii) Hotel Bharatpur Ashok, Bharatpur. 

In all three cases, the hotels / properties are being given back to the concerned States. In the case of Bhopal and Guwahati, ITDC is divesting its share of 51% in the Joint Venture Company formed for operation of the hotels whereas in the case of Bharatpur, the unit which was only managed by ITDC is being returned to the State Government.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Germany and India regarding cooperation in the sector of alternative medicine. 

The signing of the JDl will enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the areas of traditional/alternative medicine. Initiation of collaborative research, training and scientific capacity building in the field of alternative medicine under the JDI between the two countries would contribute to the enhanced employment opportunities in the AYUSH sector. 

There are no additional financial implications involved. The financial resources necessary to conduct research, training courses, conferences / meetings will be met from the existing allocated budget and existing plan schemes of Ministry of AYUSH. 

Background:

India is blessed with well-developed systems of traditional medicine which hold tremendous potential in the global health scenario. Germany has considerable interest in Traditional Systems of Medicine. The Ministry of AYUSH as a part of its mandate to propagate Indian systems of Medicine globally has taken effective steps by entering into MoU with China, Malaysia, Trinidad & Tobago Hungary, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mauritius, Mongolia and Myanmar. 

The Ministry has taken many initiatives for promotion of Ayurveda in Germany with the recommendation and cooperation of the Indian Embassy in Berlin. One of the major initiatives is the collaborative research Project between the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and Charite University, Berlin on Osteoarthritis of the knee. The results of the trial are encouraging and the clinical trial demonstrates significant improvement in patients. The study has been completed successfully and is under publication. 

A delegation led by Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, Hon'ble Minister of State, (Independent Charge). Ministry of AYUSH had visited Germany from 15-19 October 2016 to participate in the 2nd European World Ayurveda Congress (EWAC) and have interactions with the authorities in Germany. The Congress was supported by the Ministry of AYUSH. During the visit a bilateral meeting was held between Hon'ble MoS(IC), AYUSH with the Parliamentary State Secretary Ms. Ingrid Fischbach during which both sides had unanimously agreed to begin the process of drafting and negotiating a JDl in the field of AYUSH and Natural medicine. It is expected that the JDI would give a boost to India-Germany ties and enhance cooperation between the two countries.

The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) has organized a three-day National Workshop on e-Granthalya 4.0 for Automation and Networking of Government Libraries in New Delhi from 2nd-4th May, 2017. With the objective to train library professionals on e-Granthalya 4.0, the latest version of the library management software developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC), the workshop comprises of theoretical and hands-on training sessions on its admin, cataloging, circulation and serial modules.  

 

Inaugurating the workshop, Prof. Vd. K.S. Dhiman, Director General I/C, CCRUM said that we are living in a world where not everyone is able to spare time to visit physical libraries and networking of libraries in such a condition can be very helpful in conducting research and academic activities efficiently. He further said that e-libraries could also be a tool for transmission from physical books to e-books that can preserve our environment apart from saving a lot of money spent on procurement of physical books. He urged the participants to get used to the e-Granthalaya software and adopt it for automation and networking of libraries at their respective institutions in order to ease the dissemination of knowledge.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Ram Kumar Matoria, Technical Director, NIC said that the Government of India provides the free of cost facility of adopting e-Granthalya software and uploading the data on NIC cloud to the government libraries to facilitate their automation and networking. He urged that like CCRUM other institutes of AYUSH should also come forward and adopt this facility extended by the NIC.

 

Earlier in his welcome address, Shri R.U. Choudhury, Assistant Director (CCRUM) said that the CCRUM has already adopted e-Granthalaya software making the catalogues of its eight libraries attached with its various institutes freely accessible to all globally. He further said that since the NIC has launched 4.0 version of the software with various new features, there was a need to organize such a workshop in order to make the library professionals used to it.

 

The workshop has 43 participants from different institutions including research councils of AYUSH, Banaras Hindu University and University of Kashmir.

Dr Jitendra Singh shared with Mr Peter Egardt the details regarding the various on-going and perspective programmes to be taken up jointly by Indian Space Research Programme (ISRO) and Swedish National Space Board (SNSB).

Referring to three decades of space technology collaboration between the two countries, Dr Jitendra Singh told Mr Peter Egardt that during the last three years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India’s space programme has received a special impetus which is now being acknowledged even by the countries like USA and Russia which were amongst the earliest to venture into space missions. He disclosed that pictures received from the “Mangalyaan” are now being obtained by even NASA, whereas the South-Asian satellite launched recently is offering vital inputs to all the countries in the region. He also informed that under the current Government, India’s space programme has been made applicable to a wide range of infrastructural development projects including building of roads and bridges as well as mapping of soil etc. in the agriculture sector.

Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the Swedish Government’s initiative in having sent a high-level delegation of Swedish National Space Board (SNSB) to ISRO in January last year with the motive of exploring new areas of innovation through launch services, cross utilization of ground stations, satellite navigation, atmospheric research and future exploration missions. As a follow up to this visit, he recalled that in May last year, Chairman ISRO Shri A. S. Kiran Kumar had written to Swedish Ambassador in India for proposals for some of the common areas of interest including green propulsion technologies and GNSS remote sensing.

Mr Peter Egardt appreciated the warm response and enthusiastic interest shown by Dr Jitendra Singh to make the space programme much more wider based with universal applications. He also extended to Dr Jitendra Singh an invitation to visit Sweden and spare some time to interact with scientists at Swedish Space Centre (SSC).

                In a significant decision to fast-track India’s domestic nuclear power programme, and give a push to country’s nuclear industry, the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for construction of 10 units of India’s indigenous Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR).  The total installed capacity of the Plants will be 7000 MW. The 10 PHWR project will result in a significant augmentation of nuclear power generation capacity. 

India has current installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW from 22 operational plants. Another 6700 MWs of nuclear power is expected to come onstream by 2021-22 through projects presently under construction.
As the government marks three years of its nation and people centric governnace, in a first of its kind project for India’s nuclear power sector, the ten new units will come up in fleet mode as a fully homegrown initiative. It would be one of the flagship “Make in India” projects in this sector.

With likely manufacturing orders of close to 70,000 crores to the domestic industry, the project will help transform Indian nuclear industry by linking our goal of a strong nuclear power sector with our indigenous industrial capacities in high-end technologies.

This Project will bring about substantial economies of scale and maximise cost and time efficiencies by adopting fleet mode for execution. It is expected to generate more than 33,400 jobs in direct and indirect employment. With manufacturing orders to domestic industry, it will be a major step towards strengthening India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing powerhouse.

The ten reactors will be part of India’s latest design of 700 MW PHWR fleet with state-of-art technology meeting the highest standards of safety.

The approval also marks a statement of strong belief in the capability of India’s scientific community to build our technological capacities. The design and development of this project is a testament to the rapid advances achieved by India’s nuclear scientific community and industry. It underscores the mastery our nuclear scientists have attained over all aspects of indigenous PHWR technology. India’s record of building and operating PHWR reactors over the last nearly forty years is globally acclaimed. 

The Cabinet’s decision reflects the Government’s commitment to prioritise the use of clean power in India’s energy mix, as part of low-carbon growth strategy and to ensure long-term base load requirement for the nation’s industrialization.

It also supports India’s commitment to sustainable development, energy self-sufficiency and bolsters global efforts to combat climate change.

                India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F09) successfully launched the 2230 kg South |Asia Satellite (GSAT-9) into its planned Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) today (May 05, 2017). Today’s launch of GSLV was its eleventh and took place from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR (SDSC SHAR), Sriharikota, the spaceport of India. This is the fourth consecutive success achieved by GSLV carrying indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage. In its oval shaped GTO, the South Asia Satellite is now orbiting the Earth with a perigee (nearest point to Earth) of 169 km and an apogee (farthest point to Earth) of 36,105 km with an orbital inclination of 20.65 deg with respect to the equator. 

Few seconds before the launch countdown reached zero, the four liquid propellant strap-on motors of GSLV-F09, each carrying 42 tons of liquid propellants, were ignited. At count zero and after confirming the normal performance of all the four strap-on motors, the 139 ton solid propellant first stage core motor was ignited and GSLV lifted off at 16:57 IST. The major phases of the flight occurred as scheduled. About seventeen minutes after lift-off, South Asia Satellite was successfully placed in GTO. 

. Soon after separation from GSLV, the two solar arrays of the satellite were automatically deployed in quick succession and the Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka assumed control of the satellite. 

South Asia Satellite is a communication satellite built by ISRO to provide a variety of communication services over the South Asian region. For this, it is equipped with Ku-band transponders. 

Following the successful launch, the Honorable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi addressed along with the South Asian leaders. He congratulated ISRO and remarked that today was a historic day for South Asia and a day without precedence. The Prime Minister recalled that two years ago India made a promise to extend the advanced space technology for the cause of growth and prosperity of the people of South Asia and felt that the successful launch of South Asia Satellite today marks a fulfillment of that. 

In the coming days, the satellite orbit will be raised from its present GTO to the final circular Geostationary Orbit (GSO) by firing the satellite's Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) in stages. The South Asia Satellite will be commissioned into service after the completion of orbit raising operations and the satellite’s positioning in its designated slot in the GSO following in-orbit testing of its payloads.

1.  The Election Commission of India is globally acknowledged as a ''Gold Standard'' in conduct of free and fair elections with integrity in India. It has set ever-higher standards of efficient, smooth and professional conduct of Elections and has been at the forefront of embracing, adopting and implementing the latest technological advancements in improving and fine-tuning the election processes and systems.

2.  The Commission has taken the pioneering initiative of introducing Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) for recording, storing and counting of votes across the length and breadth of this country in a transparent, credible and secure manner, duly backed by appropriate legal support.

3.  Over the last twenty years, the Commission has successfully conducted 107 State Legislative Assembly elections and 03 Lok Sabha elections using EVMs. Since September 2013, Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines have also been used in various State Assembly and Parliamentary constituencies for enhanced transparency and credibility in the voting process.

4.  The introduction of EVMs in 90’s was a positive electoral reform by the Commission. Some doubts have been raised on the functioning of the EVMs from time to time and from some quarters.

5.  After the announcement of the results of the five State Assembly Elections (UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur), in March 2017, again certain doubts have been raised on the functioning of EVMs. Some complaints and suggestions were received by Commission after declaration of results of five State Assembly elections. The Commission duly examined these complaints and asked for evidence and credible material information supporting the claims, but so far no evidence has been provided by complainants to ECI.

6.  A group of thirteen political parties met the Commission on 10th April, 2017 and expressed certain reservations about the use of EVMs. Some political parties also raised queries about incidents relating to VVPATs used on 31/3/17 during demonstration (NOT in actual poll) at Bhind (M.P) and Dholpur (Rajasthan) Bye-elections held in the first week of April, 2017.

7.  To understand the concerns of political parties, Commission convened an all-party meeting on 12th May. A press statement was also issued by ECI the same day to the following effects.

(i)            The Commission stated before political parties that all future elections will be mandatorily held with VVPATs. The Commission firmly believes that use of VVPAT machines along with the EVMs in all polling stations, in all future elections, will bring utmost transparency and credibility in the EVM-based voting system. This will enable each voter to see for himself in VVPAT whether his or her vote has gone to the right candidate.  After press of button on BU, name and symbol the concerned candidate will appear on the screen of VVPAT machine and paper slip bearing name and symbol will be dropped in a sealed box connected with VVPAT. These slips will serve as audit trial of the vote cast by voter on EVM. Audit trail will enhance confidence and trust of voters. Use of VVPATs with EVMs must conclusively put to rest all misinformed doubts and misgivings regarding EVMs. It will also be a matter of pride that India will become the first country to deploy 100% VVPATs or paper trail in the world, an element that was missing in many countries including Netherland, Germany and Ireland.

Funds for procuring the required VVPATs for 100% deployment have already been sanctioned and production is to begin in August, 2017 and will be completed by September, 2018.

(ii)        It was also stated that the Commission has also taken into account suggestions made by various political parties regarding counting of VVPAT slips. The Commission will count VVPAT slips up to a definite percentage, which will be determined by the Commission. The ECI will shortly evolve an appropriate framework in this regard.

(iii)      The Commission will hold a challenge and offer opportunity to political parties to demonstrate that EVMs used in the recently concluded Assembly elections were tampered or that EVMs can be tampered even under the laid down technical and administrative safeguards of ECI.

(iv)      Commission also urged all parties to ensure their continuous and qualitative participation in all crucial steps during elections such as First Level Checking (FLC), randomisation of EVMs/VVPATs/polling personnel, EVM preparation and candidate setting, mock poll, EVM sealing and storage. The Commission also invited more suggestions from political parties on how to further increase their participation, so that absolute transparency is maintained at all times.

(v)        Commission, further, urged political parties that improving integrity of election process is a shared responsibility of all the stake holders. We solicited their suggestions to fill up gaps, if any, during election and non election period. The Commission made it clear that ECI want total transparency and have nothing to hide from people and other stakeholders. Commission will always receive suggestions from its stakeholders for improvement of its processes.

(vi)      The Commission also emphasised that Commission is committed and it  maintains equidistance from all parties and groups. The Commission further emphasised that ECI has no favourites. Further, this equidistance by ECI has enhanced India’s reputation in the eyes of the global community.

8.  The Commission has already issued detailed Press releases on Credibility of Electronic Voting Machines on 16th March, 2017, on alleged VVPAT incident during mock EVM demonstration on 31st March 2017 (and not in actual poll as alleged) at Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) on 07th April, 2017 and also regarding EVMs in Dholpur (Rajasthan) on 11thApril, 2017. In Bhind, a wrong notion was created that for any key pressed on the Ballot Unit, only one symbol was printed by VVPAT. Commission’s thorough enquiry clearly established that during the EVM demo held on 31.03.2017 in DEOs office the 4 buttons were pressed during the demo and not the actual poll and every time the correct corresponding symbol was printed. A Status Paper on EVMs has also been circulated to all stakeholders on 12th May, 2017elaborating various aspects about EVMs and VVPATs for information and awareness. (All these documents are available on ECI website).

9.  Certain complaints of alleged tampering of EVMs during the recently held Municipal elections in Maharashtra and elsewhere also generated wrong perception about EVMs of ECI. It was noted that confusion exists in the minds of many about the jurisdiction of ECI. We would like to clarify once again on this occasion that ECI is not responsible for the conduct of local body elections by the State Govts in the country and consequently about various protocols and procedures adopted by the concerned State Election Commissions. Election to local bodies, both urban and rural, are conducted by separate constitutional authorities State Election Commissions constituted by the State Govts. under Article 243 of the Constitution. Moreover, a particular complaint of some candidate receiving zero vote in Mumbai Municipal elections has been found to be totally false by SEC Maharashtra.

10.   The Commission is confident and has firm conviction about the integrity, non-tamperability and credibility of the EVMs. The basis of confidence of the Commission flows from a wide range of technical and administrative protocols and procedural safeguards that protects our EVMs and VVPATs against any sort of tampering during manufacture, transportation, storage, polling and counting process. Still, the Commission is open to receiving from all stakeholders’ suggestions on how to further improve the integrity and credibility of our EVMs and VVPATs. The Commission will not allow even a shade of doubt about EVM operations.

11.   The Commission would like to address some of the important issues that have been raised from time to time in past two months:

A.ECI- EVMs are not hackable as these, are stand alone machines and not connected to the internet and /or any other network at any point of time during polling. Hence, there is no chance of hacking.

The ECI-EVMs do not have any frequency receiver or data decoder for wireless and hence cannot receive any coded signal by wireless. Hence, no tampering can be carried out through external hardware Wireless, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth device. Moreover, machines are always in the custody of ECI and its election authorities.

B. Manipulation at manufacturing stage is ruled out as there is very stringent security protocol regarding the security of software. Further, the Machines have been manufactured in different years starting from 1989. After manufacturing, EVMs are sent by ECI to State and district within a State. The manufacturers are in no position to know several years ahead which candidate will be contesting from a particular constituency and what will be the sequence of the candidates on the BU and, therefore, cannot manipulate EVMs in a predetermined manner at manufacturing stage.

C.Results cannot be altered by activating a Trojan Horse through a sequence of key presses because

1.  Trojan Horse cannot be inserted into the software code of ECI EVM burnt into the Microcontroller Chip since the chip is one time Programmable only.

2.  The stringent security measures by ECI make it impossible to access the EVMs which is an essential prerequisite for attempting to change the Micro-controller for inserting a Trojan Horse.

3.  Control Unit activates Ballot Unit for only one key press at a time. Any additional key pressed on the Ballot Unit is not sensed by the Control Unit making it impossible to send signals by pressing a sequence of keys or secret codes.

Once a ballot key is pressed in CU, the CU enables BU for registering the vote and waits for the key pressing in the BU. During this period, all keys in the CU become inactive till the entire sequence of casting of that vote is complete. Once any of the keys (candidates vote button) is pressed by a voter in BU, the BU transmits the key information to CU in dynamically encrypted form.  The CU gets the data and acknowledges it by glowing the corresponding red LED lamps in BU.  After the enabling of ballot in CU, only the ‘first key press’ is sensed and accepted by CU.  After this, even if a voter keeps on pressing the other buttons, that is of no use as there will not be any communication between CU and BU of those subsequent key presses, nor will BU register any key press.  To put it in other words, there can be only one valid key press (the first key press) for every ballot enabled using CU.  Once a valid key press (voting process) is complete, until another ballot enabling key press is made there will not be any activity between the CU and the BU.  Hence, sending of any malicious signal, by way of so called ‘sequenced key presses’, is impossible in the Electronic Voting Machines being used in the country.

D.ECI-EVMs cannot be Physically Tampered with nor their components be changed without anyone noticing. It is clarified that replacement of micro controller/chip and the motherboard in earlier generations of machines like M1 and M2 is ruled out due to robust administrative and technical safeguards. Further, the new M3 EVM produced after 2013 have additional features like Tamper Detection and Self Diagnostics. The tamper detection feature makes an EVM inoperative the moment anyone tries to open the machine. The Self diagnostic feature checks the EVM fully every time it is switched on. Any change in its hardware or software will be detected.  Rs. 1900 Crore have already been sanctioned to the manufacturers for production of 13.95 Lakh BU and 9.30 Lakh CU of M3 generation. Also, 16.15 Lakh VVPATs are also under production and Rs. 3173 Crore have been sanctioned for the same.

E. The latest technological features make ECI-EVMs tamper proof. The ECI-EVMs use some of the most sophisticated technological features like one time programmable (OTP) microcontrollers, dynamic coding of key codes, date and time stamping of each and every key press, advanced encryption technology and EVM-tracking software to handle EVM logistics, among others to make the machine 100% tamper proof. In addition to these, new model M3 EVMs also have tamper detection and self-diagnostics as added features.OTP software implies that the programme in the EVM cannot be altered, re-written or re-read by anyone under safe custody of ECI. This makes EVM tamper proof. If anyone makes an unauthorized attempt, the machine will become in-operative.

 

F.  Contrary to misinformation spread and alleged by some, ECI does not use any EVMs produced abroad.  EVMs are produced indigenously by two PSU manufacturers viz. Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bengaluru and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad. The Software Program Code is written in-house by these two companies and not outsourced and approved by TEC of ECI and subjected to strict security procedures at factory level to maintain the highest levels of integrity.

 

The software programme is converted into machine codeby manufacturers and only then given to the chip manufacturer abroad. (We don’t have the adequate capability of producing semi-conductor microchips within the country). Every microchip has an identification number embedded into memory and the producers have their digital signatures on them. So, the question of their replacement does not arise at all because microchips brought back to manufacturers are subjected to functional tests with regard to the software. Any attempt to replace microchip is detectable and can make EVM in-operative. Thus, both changing existing program and introducing new one are detectable making EVM in-operative because EVMs are tamper detect. Also the technological advancement now permits fusing of the software on the chip at BEL and ECIL itself and hence, in M3 the software is fused on the chip inside BEL and ECIL.

 

G.          There are no possibilities of manipulation in EVM during transportation or at the place of storage.At the district headquarters, EVMs are kept in a double-lock system under appropriate security. Their safety is periodically checked. The election authorities do not open the strong room, and they only regularly check whether it’s fully protected and whether the lock is in proper condition or not. No Unauthorized person can get access to the EVMs at any point of time. During the non-election period, annual physical verification of all EVMs is done by DEOs and report sent to ECI. Further, strong rooms are always opened in the presence of representative of political parties.

H.          There are different levels of checks and balances ensuring tamper proofing of ECI-EVMs which are as follows:

•        First Level Checking: Authorized BEL/ECIL engineers certify originality of components after technical and physical examination of each EVM, which is undertaken in the presence of representatives of political parties. Defective EVMs are sent back to the factory. The FLC Hall is sanitized, entry is restricted and no camera, mobile phone or spy pen is allowed inside.  The Mock Poll is conducted on EACH EVM by election officials in the presence of representatives of political parties.The Mock poll of at least 1000 votes is conducted on 5% EVMs selected randomly by representatives of political parties and the result shown to them. The entire process is video graphed.

•       Candidate Setting: Yet another significant safeguard is the process of candidate setting, which is done after the finalization of contesting candidates. A ballot paper is inserted in the Ballot Unit, which is then sealed with Pink Paper Seal. BU is sealed at this stage. Where VVPATs are used, candidates’ symbols are loaded in each VVPAT at this stage.  Once again, every EVM is subjected to mock poll and 5% EVMs are randomly picked up for 1000 mock poll.

•       Randomization: EVMs are randomized twice while being allocated to an Assembly and then to a polling booth ruling out any fixed allocation. As you can appreciate, till first randomization no-one knows the sequence of names on the ballot paper till the finalization of list of contesting candidates, the names of contesting candidates are placed alphabetically on the ballot paper first for National and State Parties, followed by other Registered Parties, followed by independents and NOTA. Thus the Serial no. of any political party, candidate on the BU would be variable from constituency to constituency. It is therefore clear that serial no. of any political party candidate is not fixed or pre-determined in all the constituencies of the state. Hence, till candidate setting, none, not even RO or DEO or CEO or the Commission could know which button on which BU will be assigned to which candidate.

•       Mock Poll of at least 50 votes at the polling station is also conducted in front of polling agents of candidates on the poll day, before poll begins.

•       After Poll, EVMs are sealed and polling agents put their signature on the seal. Polling agents can travel up to strong room during transportation of polled EVMs from the polling station to the EVM Strong room.

•       Strong Rooms: Candidates or their representatives can put their own seals on the strong rooms, where polled EVMs are stored after the poll and also camp in front of the strong room.  These strong rooms are guarded 24x7 in multilayers, with CCTV facilities.

•       Counting Centres: The polled EVMs are brought to the Counting Centres under security and in presence of candidates and Unique IDs of the seals, signature of polling agents on CU are shown to representatives of candidates before the start of counting.

12.Looking at the above series of fool-proof checks and balances that are undertaken by the ECI to make EVMs tamper proof, it is evident that neitherthe machines can be tampered-withnor they can leave the ECI-EVM system. Further, neither defective machines nor Non-ECI-EVM can get re-inducted/inducted into the polling process at any point of time. Non ECI-EVMs will get detected by the above process due to mismatch of BU & CU.

13. Some people argue that why have Developed Nations like the US              and the European Union not adopted EVMs and some have even             discontinued?

ECI EVMs are far superior to any EVMs worldwide. EVM, used in the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany were privately manufactured and had no independent certification system unlike a very robust verification and certification system through independent TEC or an ECI approved third party in case of ECI EVMs. Also, voting data in these NEDAP EVMs in the Netherlands was transferred using CDs, unlike our EVMs where it is stored internally and never transferred. Also these countries lacked full end to end administrative and security safeguards as well as legal framework. Finally their EVMs also lacked auditability.

A point is raised from time to time that several foreign countries have discontinued the use of voting machines and why India is using EVMs.

With the rapid advances in technology over the years, Election Management Bodies, professionals, experts, and activists (particularly Green Activists) have mooted the idea of using paperless electronic voting methods in different parts of the world in order to overcome the disadvantages of manual marking of paper ballots. The marriage between technology and election management goes back to at least 1892, when the first ‘lever voting machine’ was used in New York, after using the paper ballot for a long time. In the 1960s, punch-card machines were introduced in the USA, and the first EVM was introduced there in 1975. Electronic Voting has moved quite ahead since then.

 

Types of Electronic Voting:

The process of electronic voting can be of three types:

(i)      Direct Recording Machines placed at designated polling station,

(ii)     Internet Voting

•        Remote Online Voting

•        At Designated Polling Stations

(iii)    Optical Scanners

•        Stand-alone

•        Networked for centralized counting of results

EVMs used in India fall under the first type of stand-alone direct recording machines with no possibility of any kind of network connectivity where voters cast their votes at an assigned polling station on the day of election under strict administrative security ensured by the ECI.

 

Even though ECI EVMs are also direct recording machines ECI EVMs are completely different from any of the EVMs used internationally either for direct recording or for internet voting or for optical scanning. This is clearly highlighted in the comparative analysis of ECI EVMs with the DRMs used in countries like Germany, Netherland, Ireland, and USA as follows:

The Netherlands

Electronic Voting was used in The Netherlands in between 1990-2007. The voting machines were manufactured by a private Dutch-company called NEDAP (Nederlandse Apparaten Fabriek NV). In 2006, the government ordered an independent testing of the voting machines. Two independent commissions, The Voting Machines Decision-making Commission and the Election Process Advisory Commission (EPAC) were also established on December 19, 2006 and January 18, 2007, respectively, to review the security and reliability features of NEDAP machines.

Following the observations of the two Commissions, the use of NEDAP machines and electronic voting was discontinued in 2007 on the following grounds:

•        The Ministry of Interior and Kingdom Relations (MOIKR) of The Netherlands lacked adequate technical knowledge vis-à-vis the NEDAP machines, leading officials to depend on external actors for the conduct of elections.

•        Technology vendors became part of the decision making process and the ministry was not in a position to exercise effective oversight.

•        The Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek, TNO) certified and tested these machines following “outdated standards” which were not immune to modern IT and security threats.

•        Moreover, the certification and testing reports were not made public depriving independent experts to verify the analysis.

•        The legal framework, particularly the necessary security requirements, wasinadequate to deal with the specificities of the electronic voting process. (For a comprehensive report on electronic voting in The Netherlands, see link: https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/5_Netherlands.pdf)

Germany:

In Germany, the e-voting machines manufactured by NEDAP were used in between 2005 – 2009 before it came under criticism and finally discontinued. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany) ordered the discontinuation of the use of NEDAP machines in 2009 because of the below-mentioned reasons:

•        The use of Nedap electronic voting machines violated the principle of the public nature of elections (Article 38 in conjunction with Article 20.1 and 20.2 of the Basic Law) that requires that all essential steps in the elections are subject to public examinability unless other constitutional interests justify an exception.

•        It also observed that “it must be possible for the citizen to check the essential steps in the election act and in the ascertainment of the results reliably and without special expert knowledge”.

(See   the     judgment     in       the     following    link:

Ireland:

NEDAP machines were used in Ireland in between 2002 – 2004. The use of these machines was questioned following which two independent commissions were set up. The two Commissions on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System, concluded the NEDAP machines could not be used in elections in Ireland on the following grounds:

•        Inadequate technological safeguards

•        Insecure transfer of data by the use of CDs

•        Absence of a comprehensive independent end-to-end testing, verification and certification by a single accredited body

•        Inconsistencies in physical security of machines across constituencies

•        Absence of a clear policy guideline via-a-vis storage, transport, set-up, use and disposal of voting equipment; and

•        Absence of comprehensive electronic register to record the identity, location and movement of the electronic voting devices.

United States of America:

In 2000, after the dispute on the voting method in the USA presidential elections, the voting method was reviewed (Esteve, Goldsmith, & Turner, 2012: 185). Accordingly, Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems (like the widely used AccuVote TS developed by Premier Election Solutions, commonly called Diebold) were introduced. DRE Systems uses “one of three basic interfaces (pushbutton, touchscreen or dial)”through which “voters record their votes directly into computer memory. The voter’s choices are stored in DREs via a memory cartridge, diskette or smart card…Some DREs can be equipped with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) printers...” Currently, in the USA, the Direct Recording Machines are used in 27 states, among which paper audit trails are used in 15 states. The other voting methods include: Optical Scan Paper Ballot Systems, Ballot Marking Devices, and the Punch Card Ballot.

(See link: https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/voting-equipment/)

Other countries:

In Brazil, the machines used in elections are called ‘electronic ballot boxes’ which are stand-alone direct electronic recording systems. In Venezuela, SATIS (Smartmatic Auditable Election Systems) voting machines are used which were fully implemented across the nation in 2004. (Esteve, Goldsmith, & Turner, 2012: 185)

India:

Indian EVMs are truly unique compared to the e-voting machines used in other parts of the world for the following reasons:

•        ECI-EVMs are stand-alone non-networked machines

•        The ECI-EVMs are manufactured in two PSUs namely ECIL and BEL, unlike machines used in other countries, which were manufactured entirely by private entities. Hence there is no chance of involvement of vested interest of private players or technology vendors in decision making or production of the ECI-EVMs.

•        ECI-EVMs have been time and again successfully verified and certified by an independent Technical Experts Committee after an end-to-end testing process. STQC under Ministry of Information and Technology, an accredited third party entity, conducts standardization and certification of ECI EVMs produced by manufacturers, unlike the machines used in Netherlands,

•        In ECI EVMs data is stored internally and not transferrable by any device, unlike other countries where voting data recorded in the DRM is transferred by means of CD, etc.

•        Commission has evolved full end to end security protocol and administrative safeguards for the use, storage, transportation and tracking of ECI EVMs, unlike in other countries where NEDAP machines were used.

•        Unlike MOIKR of Netherlands, the Commission is fully backed by a Technical Expert Committee comprising of eminent professors.

•        Every EVM has a unique number attached to it, which is recorded in the Election Commission’s database through EVM Tracking Software. This number of the EVM can always be cross-checked against the database.

•        The software used in these EVMs is One Time Programmable (OTP), which can’t be re-written after manufacture.

•        The ECI-EVMs are always under strict, uniform, high profile administrative and physical security as per legal framework across the country.

•        Section 61 A of the Representation of the Peoples Act 1951 allows the use of EVMs by ECI. The different High Courts across the country have also upheld the use of EVMs time and again in various judgments and the Karnataka High Court in 2004 declared ECI-EVMs as “national pride” because of its transparency and robustness.

•        Following the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the ECI has introduced the technology of VVPAT in order to ensure public verifiability. The Commission is committed to implement VVPATs nation-wide by 2019. Thus there will be 100% voter verifiability and auditability of every vote cast as opposed to lack of such facility in the NEDAP machines, which was struck down by the German Supreme Court as un-Constitutional, whereas Indian Supreme Court has upheld the validity of use of EVM for conducting elections in the country.

•        Thus any comparison of ECI-EVMs with machines used elsewhere is misplaced.

The Commission has always worked in an open and transparent manner and always welcome questions, doubts and constructive and decent criticism of our processes so that we can further strengthen electoral processes.

During political party meeting on 12 May 2017, Commission had promised to organise an open challenge to give an opportunity to political parties to demonstrate that EVMs used in five States were tampered or EVMs even under technical and administrative safeguards can be tampered. Accordingly, ECI now proposed to open a challenge on 3rdJune 2017 onwards to all political parties.

Frame-work of the challenge:

Election Commission of India invites the nominees of National and State Recognized political parties who contested and claimed that the EVM machines held under the ownership of Election Commission of India and used in the recently held General Assembly Elections of five states namely Punjab, Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh in Feb-Mar 2017 were tampered or that these could be tampered even under technical  and administrative safeguards of ECI, to demonstrate their claims at the ECI Headquarters within the framework of the extant administrative and security protocols prescribed by the Commission.

Salient features of the EVM Challenge of the Commission are as follows:

Challenge Statement I:

That the EVMs used in the General Elections to five States-2017 were tampered to favour a particular candidate/political party by altering the results stored in the EVMs after the polls. The claimants will hence have to alter the results in the Control Units used during these polls in exactly the same scenario as the EVMs remain within the technical and administrative safeguards of ECI after the poll, i.e. during the storage in strong rooms or during counting, through

a.   using press of combination of keys on CU or BU or BOTH, or

b.  Bycommunication to CU or BU or Both via external wireless/Bluetooth/mobile phone etc.

Challenge Statement II

That the EVMs used in the General Elections to the five States-2017 were tampered before or during the poll day. The claimants will hence have to alter the results in the EVMs used during these polls in exactly the same scenario as the EVMs remain within the technical and administrative safeguards of ECI before the poll, i.e. during the storage in strong rooms or during the poll, through

c.   using press of combination of keys of CU or BU or Both, or

d.  by communication to CU or BU or Both via external wireless/Bluetooth/mobile phone etc.

Common Procedure for Challenge I and Challenge II

1.  The EVM Challenge is open for participation from the National and State Recognized Political Parties only which participated in the five States' Assemblies Elections viz. Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.

 

2.  Each National and State Recognized Party intending to participate may nominate a maximum of 3 persons only to participate in the EVM Challenge. Each Party shall intimate the names of maximum 3 authorized persons, if any, who wish to accompany the chosen EVMs from the Warehouses to the Commission at New Delhi during transportation at their own cost.

 

3.  The Political Parties willing to participate in the EVM Challenge must mandatorily confirm their interest to ECI by 5.00 pm on 26th May, 2017 through the email (evmchallenge@eci.gov.in), wherein the details of the Nominated members must be furnished as per the prescribed Performa. Only those Political Parties, which respond by 5.00 pm on 26th May, 2017 to the ECI, shall be allowed to participate in the EVM Challenge. The response of the political parties shall mandatorily be made on the official letter-head of the party duly signed by the President or General Secretary of the political party concerned, which shall be scanned and emailed to the email id mentioned above.

 

4.  Further, if the Nominees of any Political Party, to whom a Challenge date-time Slot has been allotted, fail to report at the designated time and venue without prior intimation or approval, shall forfeit their right to participation in the EVM Challenge.

 

 

5.  Each Political Party will be allowed to choose a maximum of 4 EVMs of their choice from any 4 polling stations out of the Five poll-gone States. Examples; Maximum of 4 EVMs only form 4 polling stations can be chosen, either from one AC or from multiple ACs in a State or from any of the five States. It is clarified that any EVMs involved in EP (Election Petition) or those under any sealing by the orders of a competent Court, shall not be part of this EVM Challenge. If a Political Party does not wish to specify a particular EVM but wants ECI to provide any EVM of Commission’s choice, then the same should be intimated by 26th May, 2017.

 

6.  The choice of the EVMs shall be emailed (evmchallenge@eci.gov.in) in the prescribed proforma by 5.00 pm on 26th May, 2017.

 

7.  The chosen EVM machines, including Control Units (CU), Ballot Units (BU) (one or more as deployed) and VVPAT (wherever deployed) shall be brought to the ECI at New Delhi, on as-is-where basis, in compliance of the extent of established protocol of ECI regarding opening of EVM strong-rooms/warehouse and EVM transportation.

 

8.  The representatives of the Political Parties at State Level are at liberty to witness the opening of EVM Strong-rooms at the District/AC level where the EVMs are presently stored, inspect the machines for the various seals (as in protocol) and accompany the machines during their transportation to ECI in sealed trunks, if they so desire.

 

9.  As these EVMs were used in the recently held elections and were stored post-counting, the EVMs would still have the candidate setting and the result of the said election.

 

10.            The results of the machines as recorded during the counting in the previous elections shall be available in paper form also, having details like total votes polled and votes casted for each candidates etc.

 

11.            A Challenge Slot of 4 Hours shall be allotted to each participating Political Party, wherein their registered nominees shall be given access to one of their chosen EVMs (CU+BU + VVPAT if deployed) for the purpose of PROVING the Challenge Statement 1 and 2.  In case the first chosen EVM is in-operative as a result of transportation, then the second of the chosen EVM shall be allowed to be used for the challenge and so on. However, if a Political Party desires to avail of more time, the request shall be made in writing to the Commission, which shall decide the issue on merits and demands of reasonability.

 

12.            The nominees may before proceeding for challenge if they want, check the result of previous election already stored in CU and verify that these are same as given by ECI in item 10 above as per ECI protocol of declaring results from CU. This step is optional and will be recorded if they opt for it in writing. The result of re-count also will be recorded.

 

13.            The Nominees of the participating Political Parties shall be allowed the following methods on the Challenge EVMs to prove the challenge:

a.   Pressing any sequence of buttons on the CU or BU or Both.

b.  The use of any external wireless/Bluetooth/Mobile Phone device/Transmitter.

 

14.            All Key Presses made by the Challenger shall be declared prior to the actual execution of key presses and these will manually be recorded by the ECI Counter Staff for keeping a “written record of exact process of conduct” of the “challenge proving” poll. In case the challenger wishes to use mobile or blue tooth during poll, he should inform the Election officials and this should also be recorded. This is especially relevant, in case the Challenger wishes to conduct any mock poll or full poll by either use of key presses or mobile phone / blue-tooth during his tamper attempt to prove the Challenge Statements.

15.            All Key Presses shall be made in clear and unhindered view of the ECI Counter Staff and the recording Cameras and made with a Specially Designed Presser, so as to avoid any confusion or ambiguity in the key presses made by the Challenger using his fingers.

 

16.            EVMs can be opened and only visually inspected during Challenge-II as this is allowed during First Level Check (FLC). However, EVMs cannot be opened during Challenge- I as EVMs are always kept sealed after the Poll till counting in actual poll scenario.

 

17.            During the Challenge period, with regard to any written representation or any dispute or interpretation issues, the decision of the ECI Officer In-charge shall be final.

 

18.             The EVM challenge shall be organised from 03.06.2017 onwards at Nirvachan Sadan, Ashoka Road, New Delhi.

 

 

Challenge Conclusion:

1.  The Challenger under Challenge I shall be deemed to have ''FAILED'' if:

a.   The EVM becomes non-functional after the tamper attempt made by the Challenger. (Reason: ECI EVMs are designed to go into error mode if any unwarranted technical operations are conducted rather than recording any wrong results).

b.  The EVM is functional and results displayed on the CU after conduct of challenge attempt are the same as ECI declared results stored on the chosen CU (prior to the pressing of CLEAR Button).

c.   If the Challenger violates any of the guidelines prescribed for the EVM Challenge.

d.  The challenger withdraws from current challenge.

2.  The Challenger under Challenge II shall be deemed to have ''FAILED'' if:

a.   The EVM becomes non-functional after the tamper attempt made by the Challenger. (Reason: ECI EVMs are designed to go into error mode if any unwarranted technical operations are conducted rather than recording any wrong results).

b.  The EVM remains functional and after erasing the earlier stored result, a mock poll or full poll is conducted by the Challenger along with his challenge attempt and manually recorded votes(by ECI staff) are the same as that stored on the chosen CU after the said mock/full poll.

c.   If the Challenger violates any of the guidelines prescribed for the EVM Challenge.

d.  The challenger withdraws from current challenge.

10. Certain naysayers have demanded that ECI should either permit them to take the EVMs with them for tampering or allow changing of internal circuit etc. of the EVM. This is like saying that they should be permitted to manufacture a new machine and introduce their new EVMs in our system. Further, it is common knowledge that changing the ‘ internal circuit’of any electronic device is like changing the whole device itself, after which it is no longer the same device. As any person with common sense will be able to appreciate, a non-ECI EVM or an EVM with a different ‘internal circuit’ is simply a different machineor look alike of ECI EVM  hence can never be guaranteed by ECI to give correct results. Such a scenario is completely ruled out within our administrative safeguards and that’s why it is not proposed in the Challenge.

11. The Commission is thankful to all the citizens, voters, political parties and all stakeholders for their unwavering faith in the Commission for more than 67 years.  The Commission would further like to thank all political parties for showing their continuous trust and confidence in the Election Commission of India as expressed during interventions of political parties on 12th May in the All Party Meeting. The Commission would like to reassure the people of the country that the Commission would leave no stone unturned in preserving the purity, integrity and credibility of the Elections and reinforcing the faith and trust of the people in the electoral democracy of our country. I wish to reassure that citizens of the country that the Commission will never ever allow the faith of the people in the integrity of the election process to be shaken. The Commission desire all citizens and stakeholders to remain aware ,vigilant and alert  about our electoral processes so that conduct of free and fair election by Commission is further strengthened.

The Election Commission held a meeting with all recognised National and State Political parties today at Constitution Club, New Delhi to discuss the following issues:

(i)                 EVMs and VVPATs.

(ii)               Making Bribery in Elections a Cognizable Offence.

(iii)              Disqualification on Framing of Charges for the Offence of Bribery in Elections

(iv)              Suggestions on VVPAT Recount Rules.

07 National Parties and 35 State Parties attended the meeting.

 

In his inaugural address, Chief Election Commissioner Dr. Nasim Zaidi, underlined the contribution of all political parties and stated that systemic improvements and progressive measures aimed at improving the electoral processes and systems have been evolved by the Commission in cooperation with all political parties.

CEC referred the queries raised by some political parties about the incidents of alleged EVM manipulation at Bhind and Dholpur during the recently concluded Bye-elections, and reiterated that baseless perceptions were generated about these incidents and there was no case of biased vote results.

Commission highlighted the wide range of technical, administrative protocol and procedural safeguards that fortify the EVMs and VVPATs against any sort of manipulation or tampering. He said that Commission is open to hear suggestions on how to further improve integrity and credibility of EVMs.

CEC also informed the political representatives that the Commission will hold a challenge and offer opportunity to political parties to demonstrate that EVMs used in the recently concluded Assemblies elections were tampered OR that EVMs can be tampered even under the laid down Technical & Administrative Safeguards. 

 

CEC stated that the Commission will ensure 100% coverage of VVPATs in all future election to the Parliament and State Assembly Elections. That VVPATs slips of a percentage of EVMs to be determined by ECI will be counted. ECI will soon evolve a framework in this regard. To make the election process more transparent, the Commission has made proposal for electoral reforms on misuse of money power and bribery during elections. The Commission has also made proposal for amendments in the Income Tax Act and in the RP Act, 1951, for enhancing transparency in the funding of political parties.

Dr. Nasim Zaidi urged the political parties to ensure their continuous and qualitative participation at all crucial preparatory steps for elections like FLC, Randomization of EVM/VVPAT/Polling personnel, EVM Preparation/candidate setting, Mock Poll, EVM Sealing etc. CEC also stressed that continuous involvement is the shared responsibility of all the stakeholders including the political parties.

CEC conveyed neutral stand and equidistance of ECI from all political parties as it has no favourite which has enhanced India’s reputation in the eyes of Global Community.

A detailed presentation on EVM was presented by Shri. Sudeep Jain, Director General of ECI explaining therein its secured design feature, development process, stakeholders’ participation at various levels, and administrative processes making the EVMs secure.

 Representatives of the political parties presented their views & suggestions on each of the agenda items.

Commission assured the political parties that their concerns & apprehensions regarding EVMs have been taken note of and would be duly considered & addressed through forthcoming challenge and further necessary actions. In respect of other Electoral Reforms, their views/suggestions would be examined and further action would be initiated appropriately.

Every vote counts. And so does every voter. Serving every elector flawlessly is the commitment of Election Commission of India that it has lived up to time and again.  The Commission has added another feather to its cap with the launch of National Contact Centre with a toll-free No. 1800111950. Now any citizen from any part of the country can call on the toll-free in English or Hindi with any query or complaint at any time of the day. Callers can enquire on subjects such as elections, voting dates, EPIC, electoral roll, online registration etc.  and lodge a complaint by simply dialing in to the toll free no. Not only this, executives also make outbound calls for educating the electors and spreading voter awareness.

 

The National Contact Centre is operated on a National Grievance Redressal System Software. This software is a single window platform to manage complaints and feedback received through calls, emails, sms and website access in an integrated and time-bound manner. Callers may connect with the executives to register a complaint and know about its status of receipt and disposal as well as to give suggestions and feedback at every step of the way.

 

The Contact Centre is Commission’s step forward towards bringing about electoral reforms where citizens and officials are empowered to monitor and report any anomaly or violation of ECI instructions in the field before, during or post elections.

 

Each state and UT will also soon setup and operationalize dedicated State Contact Centre (SCC) and District Contact Centre (DCC) to ensure seamless flow of information across the contact centers for handling issues/ query from citizens. National Contact Centre will build IT protocols to ensure that any call landing at NCC are properly redirected to the respective State Contact Centre.

It is expected that on operationalization of Integrated Contact Centre, ECI will be able to provide multilingual support to all the citizens across the nation in a decentralized and integrated manner. 

 

ICT 2025 Vision Document

ICT 2025 is about setting up core IT infrastructure and process to consolidate multitude of election process and functions.

 

The ICT 2025 Vision Document heralds the beginning of what we call as Digitalization instead of just Digitization. Digitalization is the key strategy in ICT 2025. It is the strategy of adopting recent technologies and consolidating existing technologies in IT to make the most of the digital resources available in the Election ecosystem.

 

Launch of ICT 2025 Vision Document by the Hon’ble Commission

 

The ICT 2025 Projects which capitalise on Digitalization, will capture both Electoral Process and the conduct of elections. There are four major components of the ICT 2025.

 

1.     Integrated Software application

2.     GIS, Analytic and Integrated Contact Centre

3.     IT infrastructure including data center, IT security, disaster recovery

4.     Knowledge Management, Capacity building and social media engagement

 

Further Election Commission has launched ‘Annual Report 2017’ & ‘Electoral Statistics Pocket book 2017’ &  ‘IT in Elections Booklet’.

The Election Commission, through media, has learnt about a so called demonstration of tampering of ‘look-alike’ EVM. In this context it should be understood that it is possible for anyone to make any electronic gadget which ‘looks-like’  ECI EVM and demonstrate any Magic or Tampering. Very simply put, any 'look-alike'' machine is just a different gadget, which is manifestly designed and made to function in a ‘tampered’ manner and has no relevance, incidence or bearing on the Commission's EVMs. It is commonsense that gadgets other than ECI EVMs can be programmed to perform in a pre-determined way, but it simply cannot be implied that ECI EVMs will behave in the same manner because the ECI EVMs are Technically Secured and function under an elaborate Administrative and Security Protocol.  Such so called demonstration on extraneous and duplicate gadgets which are not owned by the ECI cannot be exploited to influence our Intelligent Citizens & Electorate to assail or vilify the EVMs used by the Commission in its electoral process.

Election Commission of India (ECI) has scheduled an All Political Parties meeting on 12th May 2017 for EVM Issues and other Electoral Reforms. The Status Paper on ECI EVMs is available on ECI’s website (http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/current/StatusPaperonEVM_09052017.pdf) which gives details of Safety and Security Measures taken by ECI to make ECI EVMs non-tamperable.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister inaugurates Litchi Processing Plant, Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the main objective of the Central Government is focused on research to develop new varieties and techniques of litchi farming to increase its production and to share information with the Extension Division. Shri Singh said this at the inauguration and co-training of Litchi processing plant here.

Union Minister said that Bihar is the top litchi producing State in the country. In Bihar, about 300 thousand metric tonnes of litchi is being produced from 32 thousand hectares of area. Bihar's contribution in the production of litchi is about 40 percent. Considering the importance of litchi, National Research Centre on Litchi was established on June 6, 2001.

Shri Singh said that the contribution of Muzaffarpur district in litchi’s production is impressive, but there is a need to increase the productivity of litchi, which is currently 8.0 tonne. For this, all the government institutions, cooperatives and farmers will have to come forward. Union Agriculture Minister said that it is a matter of immense pride that scientists at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and National Research Centre on Litchi have succeeded in treating litchi and preserving it for 60 days at low temperature. One of its processing plants has also been developed. Shri Singh said that this technique will be useful for the litchi producers and businessmen. Shri Singh also said that to make this technique effective, litchi producers will have to produce superior quality fruits for which National Research Centre on Litchi has developed several techniques. The National Research Centre on Litchi is providing about 35-40 thousand plants every year to various institutions/states in the country. Union Agriculture Minister said that the National Research Centre on Litchi is working closely with other institutions of ICAR and agricultural universities of the state and the development centres of the Central and State Governments like National Horticulture Board, APEDA, National Horticulture Mission etc.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that our scientists are working day and night to develop advanced varieties and agricultural activities and that State Governments, KVKs and other institutions should take it to the masses. Through its limited resources, the centre has implemented ICAR’s Farmers First project in East Champaran district. As many as 1,000 families from 8 villages (Mehsi Block-Uzhilpur, Bakri Najir, Damodarpur Village, Chakia Block- Khairwa, Ramgarha, Jishnupura, Ojha Tola- Vaishah and Chintanpur-Malahi Tola village) are reaping the benefits of several new techniques. And the unique initiative by the council allows farmers to test advanced technology themselves. And now there is a need to create awareness about it. Through ‘Mera Gaon- Mera Gaurav’ program, scientists have been successful in taking new techniques to some villages. The Centre has initiated Health Card scheme through which orchards are being examined and farmers are being sensitised. Not just Bihar, litchi fruit farming can be successfully done in other parts of the country too. Therefore, there is a need to promote research in these areas too.

On this occasion, Shri Singh congratulated all the scientists and officers and hoped that this plant will help litchi farmers, producers and traders of Bihar and the entire nation in increasing their income.

                Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh today said that the Government of India has undertaken several new initiatives in the field of animal husbandry in Gujarat. Under Rashtriya Gokul Mission, on the lines of Gokul Gram ‘Gir, Cow Sanctuary’ has been approved. This will be established in Dharampur, Porbandar under Livestock insurance coverage. Earlier only two milk animals were included , now 5 milk animals and 50 small animals are included. This scheme has been implemented in all the districts of the state, whereas earlier only 15 districts were included. During the year 2014-16, about 26,000 animals have been insured in the state. To fulfil the shortage of veterinarians, a veterinary college has been established in Junagadh. The Agriculture Minister was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of polytechnic at Kamdhenu University, Sabarkantha. 

The Agriculture Minister said that it is a matter of immense pride that our country is number one in milk production in the world. In the year 2015-16, the growth rate of milk production has been 6.28 per cent due to which total production has reached 156 million tonnes. And now, per person milk availability is 337 gram on an average, while on the world level it is 229 gram. It is worth mentioning that in comparison to the years 2011-14, the growth in milk production during the years 2014-17 has been 16.9 per cent. 

He said that the standard of living of urban and rural families is rising, therefore, the demand for the animal protein is increasing. So, it is necessary that we constantly make effort to increase the production of our livestock, poultry and fish so that the country's citizens are well-nourished and healthy. That is why it is the responsibility of veterinarians to contribute in keeping the nation healthy by increasing availability of animal protein. 

He said that the Government is committed to double farmers' income by 2022 and veterinaries play a significant role in fulfilling the Government’s resolution to double the farmers’ income. A healthy animal will result in greater production which will automatically enhance the farmer’s income and the country will proceed on the path of economic prosperity. 

Agriculture Minister said that India is world’s highest livestock owner at about 512.05 million out of which 199.1 million are bovines, 105.3 million buffaloes, 71.6 million sheep and 140.5 million goats. In the case of goats, India is at the second position in the world and it is approximately 25 % of the livestock. India is second largest poultry market in the world and it includes the production of 63 billion eggs and 649 million poultry meat. India's marine and fish industry are growing at around 7 percent compound annual growth rate. Overall, India’s livestock sector is growing fast and emerging as a major contributor in the global market. 

The Agriculture Minister said that the Government of India is ensuring the quality of education in universities is of international standards. In this direction, ICAR’s Fifth Deans Committee Report has been approved. Schemes like ‘Student’ and ‘Arya’ have been started with scholarships. Students’ scholarship amount has been increased. 

In the end, the Minister said that to see our nation prosper and agriculture sector and farmers flourish, we need to work together. When the agriculture will grow, the farmer will be happy and the country will move forward.

                Establishment of this institute is an important initiative in providing higher level education and research along with increasing agricultural production and productivity 
 



Prime Minister has taken the resolution that by 2022, the income of farmers to be doubled and we are determined to achieve the same: Radha Mohan Singh

 

              

               The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the Foundation Stone of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Gogamukh in Assam.Addressing a large public meeting on the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the State Government in Assam and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, for the work done by them in the State.  

The Prime Minister said the foundation stone of IARI laid today, had the potential to impact the entire region in a positive way in the future. He said agriculture needs to be developed in line with the requirements of the 21st century. He added that farmers must benefit from the changing technology.  

He stressed on the need of modern agriculture and technological interventions, keeping in mind the specific needs of the region.The Prime Minister spoke of his vision of doubling farmers' incomes by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. 

 

               Speaking on the occasion, the Agriculture Minister said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji has pledged to double the farmers’ income by 2022 and we are committed to fulfil his resolve. In continuation, visualising the potential of north eastern states in improving the production of agriculture and allied sectors and farmers knowledge enhancement, impart appropriate agriculture information, the top level of agricultural research and education in the country, a new branch of Indian agricultural Institute is being established in Assam. In these states of north-east we see special glimpses of diversity and due to the agroclimatic condition cultivation of not only different types of crops but diverse types of spices are being successfully carried out. Now we need to accelerate this further and in achieving this goal, establishment of the agricultural institute will be a decisive step. I would like to say that establishment of this institute will be an important initiative in enhancing agricultural production and productivity together with the high standard of education and research and in times to come it will definitely improve the living standard of farmers of north eastern states of the country.

 

Shri Singh said that to bring in another round of green revolution in the north-eastern parts of the country, the Prime Minister is laying the foundation stone of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Assam, literally a replica of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi.

The key achievements of IARI and Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare are as follows:

·         The journey of IARI started in PUSA, Darbhangha (Samastipur) district of North Bihar in 1905.  At that time it was called the Agricultural Research Institute.

·          Afterwards it was renamed as Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research in 1911 and as Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1919.

·          The institute was transferred to Delhi on 29 July 1936.

·         After Independence it was re-christened as Indian Agricultural Research Institute and it was given the status of Deemed University in 1958.

·         This institute is the harbinger of the Green revolution. The new technologies and high yielding varieties developed at this institute and their demonstrations at farmers’ farm led to the Green Revolution.   

·         There is a web of higher education institutes like IIts, IIMs etc., in the country. On the similar pattern our government has planned to establish agricultural research institutes like IARI, New Delhi, to promote higher agricultural education.

·         In this series one IARI was established in Jharkhand and now another is being established in Assam.

·         How serious is our Government about agriculture is obvious from the fact that the agricultural budget allocation in last four years (2014-15 to 2017-18) was of Rs 164,415 crore, which was during UPA government (2010-11 to 2013-14) only Rs 104,337 crore, an increase of approximately 57.58% in under our Prime minister.

·         The country is reaping the benefits of this now, and I feel happy to announce that in the year 2016-17 there has been a new record in the food grain production, and this is highest ever since independence.

·         Milk production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 465.5 MM tonnes, which is 16.9% more than that of 398 MM tonnes in 2011-2014.

·         Similarly fish production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 327.74 lakh tonnes, which is 20.1% more than that of 272.88 lakh tonnes in 2011-2014.

·          The egg production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 248.72 billion, which is 17.92% more than that of 210.93 billion in 2011-2014.

·         Similarly honey production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 263,930 M tonnes, which is 20.54% more than that of 218,950 M tonnes in 2011-2014.

Shri Singh mentioned several farmer friendly schemes and programmes initiated by the present government, which include soil health card for improvement in the soil nutrition health, and traditional agriculture development scheme for improvement of organic farming. Apart from that farmers are benefiting from the organic value chain development mission with an investment of Rs. 400 crore for north-east,

·         development of national  agriculture market or e-NAM by connecting 585 anaj mandis  of the country through e-platform,

·         Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme) to safeguard the farmers from the destruction caused by natural calamities, Prime Minister Crop Irrigation Scheme etc. 

Union Agriculture Minister concluded by thanking the Prime Minister and said that under his guidance we are able to fulfil the dream of establishing Indian Agricultural Research Institute in the north eastern region of the country.

Foodgrain production during the year 2016-17 has broken all the previous records: Shri Singh

 

The annual growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors have been 4.4 percent this year: Union Agriculture Minister

 

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed media on completion of three years of the Modi government

 

 

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said the initiatives taken under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for the welfare of farmers and the agriculture sector have started showing positive and encouraging results. The commitment of the Modi government towards the welfare of the farmers is resulting in qualitative improvement in the lives of farmers. Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Ministry of Agriculture is working to double farmers’ income by 2022, a goal set by the Prime Minister. Shri Singh was speaking at a press conference in National Media Centre on the completion of three years of the Modi government.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said in the last three years, the Modi government has created new and transparent working style for the growth of the nation. Under the guidance of the Prime Minister, the implementation of the farmers’ welfare scheme was turned into a mission by the government. From the perspective of good governance, innovative and reformist approach, our government laid the foundation of future-oriented India. 

Shri Singh said the Modi Government has succeeded in creating awareness among the farmers about initiatives taken for the development of the agriculture sector. In three years, continuous and robust efforts have been made to bring qualitative changes in lives of farmers and rural areas. 

Union Agriculture Minister said during UPA government, the expenditure made by the Ministry used to be less than the budgetary allocation. For instance, during the year 2011-12 budgetary allocation was Rs.24, 526 crores and the amount spent was just Rs.23, 290 crores. Similarly, in the year 2012-13 budgetary allocation was Rs.28, 284 crores and the amount spent was Rs.24, 630 crores. In the year 2013-14, the budgetary allocation was Rs.30, 224 crore and the amount spent was Rs.25, 896.

On the other hand, under Modi government, the Ministry is spending more than the budgetary allocation for the welfare of the farmers. For instance, in the year 2016-17, the budgetary allocation was Rs. 45,035 crores, but it was increased to Rs. 57,503 crores in the revised budget.  

Keeping the welfare of the agriculture sector and farmers in mind, Modi government is increasing the budget every year For example, the total budget for the welfare of the agriculture sector during the UPA government’s four years - 2010-11 to 2013-14 - was Rs.1,04,337 crores, while the present government has allocated Rs.1,64,415 crore during the period of 2014-15 to 2017-18, which is 57.58 percent more.

Shri Singh said that in the initial two years of the last three years, the government provided security and confidence to farmers during two consecutive years of monsoon shortfall. Apart from focusing on the distribution of Soil Health Card, extension of irrigation facilities, low-cost organic farming, national agricultural market, horticulture development, Agroforestry, bee keeping, dairy, fish and egg production, it also focused on agricultural education, research and extension. More investment has been made to strengthen cooperatives. In the last three year, several initiatives were taken to make the country self-reliant in pulses and oilseeds. The farmers were provided unprecedented security through Prime Minister's Fasal Bima Yojana, which has the lowest premium and covers various risks. The government has given priority to the interests of farmers by providing the District-wise contingency action plans and increasing the relief funds for the farmers affected by drought and hailstorm.

In the three years of the Modi government, the initiatives taken for the welfare of farmers and the agriculture sector through the successful implementation of the schemes have started showing positive results. The achievement of the Modi Government in the agriculture sector is as follows:

Ø  Foodgrain production of the year 2016-17 has broken all previous records. This year, the growth rate in agriculture and allied sector has been approximately 4.4 %.

Ø  According to 3rd advance estimate for 2016-17, the total foodgrain production is estimated to be 273.38 million tonnes which is 8.67 % higher than that of the year 2015-16. 

Ø  It is also worth mentioning that this production is also 6.37% higher than the average production of last 5 years. 

Ø  For pulses, the production during 2016-17 is expected to be 22.40 million tonnes which will be a record production till date and is higher than that of the year 2015-16 by 37%. 

Ø  As on 16.05.2017, 725 lakh soil health cards have been distributed to the farmers.  Testing of samples and printing of cards are under process. Remaining farmers would be provided cards in the next three months. 

Ø  During the year 2011-14, cumulative area under organic farming has increased from 7.23 lakh hectare to 20 lakh hectares during the year 2014-17.

Ø  So far, 417 regulated market from 13 states have joined the scheme.

Uttarakhand can Develop Tourism, Transport, Handloom, Fruits and Vegetables Farming, Cultivation of Medicinal Plants, Flower Farming Through Cooperatives

 

Workforce Engaged in Cooperative Sector can Play an Important Role in Creating Awareness about Cooperatives Among the Rural Population

 

Modern Cooperatives have Achieved a Comprehensive Shape During 112-Year Journey

 

Cooperative Movement in India is One of the Biggest Cooperative Movements in the World; There are 8 Lakh Cooperative Societies in India

 

       Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh inaugurated the Inter-state Cooperative Investment Summit & Exhibitionin Dehradun, Uttarakhand today. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that women rub shoulders with other family members and work hard to provide a better life to their families. These women can strengthen their economic status through cooperatives in the small industry sector such as forestry, vegetable and fruit farming and solar energy.

       Talking about the role of cooperatives in the development of Uttarakhand, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that he was happy to learn that the State’s cooperative department has selected cooperative entrepreneurship as a medium to boost entrepreneurship in the state and organised the exhibition.   He also said that cooperatives are not new to our country and that the cooperative movement had first started in a village in Gujarat and the movement led to the enactment of Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904.

       Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that it is important to implement Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in Uttarakhand through cooperative societies and help affected farmers because the state’s agriculture sector is totally dependent upon monsoon.  The Minister pointed out that the Government has taken concrete steps for the revival of cooperative societies to transform them into a dynamic, democratic organisation, so that they can face the challenges of a competitive global economy.   He further said that considering the importance of cooperative societies in improving rural economy, the Government is committed to boosting cooperative societies through various programmes.   Shri Singh also congratulated the representatives of cooperative societies representing various States for their appreciable contribution in the cooperative sector and said that he hoped to continue the trend of such programmes being organised in other parts of the country.

       Modern cooperatives have attained a comprehensive shape during the 112-year journey. Indian cooperative movement is one of the biggest cooperative movements in the world. There are 8 lakh cooperative societies in India, which includes the cooperative organisation at the village and national levels. The membership of cooperative societies in the country is more than 274 million and it includes 95% villages and 71% rural families.

       The participation of Uttarakhand in cooperative societies is appreciable. There are 4, 381 societies in the state, which are associated with various professions. As many as 759 packs are operational and their membership is 12 lakh and it is also appreciable that hundred percent villages are covered under these packs.

       Uttarakhand can develop tourism, transport, handloom, fruits and vegetable farming, cultivation of medicinal plants, flower farming etc. through cooperatives. There is a huge market for these commodities not only in India, but abroad as well.

The proposal for implementation of Price Support Scheme (PSS) for procurement of Toor during the current Kharif season 2016-17 was received from Government of Maharashtra. As per their proposal, it was mentioned that expected production of Toor in Maharashtra will be 12.56 lakhs MT and they have requested for procurement of 2 lakhs quintal during 1st November, 2016 – 29th January, 2017. 

This proposal was transferred to Department of Consumer Affairs to create a buffer stock of pulses by making procurement directly from the farmers at MSP plus bonus under Price Stabilization Fund (PSF). This procurement continued till 22nd April, 2017 and around 4 lakhs MT of Toor was procured which is 31.95% of total expected production. Due to continuous arrival, State Government had decided to procure the Toor from the farmers who have been registered or token has been issued till 22nd April, 2017 at various procurement centres from their own resources. 

On 5th May, 2017, request for implementation of PSS was again received from Government of Maharashtra. In the fresh proposal they had requested for procurement of 20 lakhs quintal (2 lakhs MT) of Toor upto 31st May, 2017. They have also informed that as per their third estimate the expected production in the State will be 20.35 lakhs MT. The Notification for harvesting period of Kharif Toor was revised from September to March and extended upto 31st May, 2017. 

Considering the proposal, this Department has approved the procurement of one lakh MT of Toor under PSS upto 31st May, 2017 with the condition that the procurement already made as per State Government Notification dated 27.4.2017 shall not be reimbursed or adjusted from the procurement made under PSS and State Government will make necessary arrangements for godown space and other resources for smooth PSS operation in the State.

Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri radha Mohan Singh, has written a letter to the all Chief Ministers of the States/UTs today for the review of the state of preparedness in managing any weather related contingency if any in advance so that the possible adverse impact of sub-par rainfall on the farmers can be mitigated. Shri Singh in his letter mentioned that India Meteorological Department (IMD) projected a likely rainfall of 96% (+ 5%) of the Long Period Average during Kharif 2017 in its first stage forecast for the South-West Monsoon. An updated forecast will be issued by IMD in June, 2017 with details of temporal (monthly) and regional distribution of monsoon rainfall.

 

Shri Singh further written that 2016-17 was a very satisfactory year for the agriculture sector as a whole.  The State Governments and farmers were able to take the best advantage of a normal monsoon to create record-breaking performance in the production of cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Yet, the normal rainfall ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­notwithstanding, agricultural operations faced disruption in some States during 2016-17 on account of drought caused by aberrant weather conditions. It would, therefore, be helpful if a review of the state of preparedness in managing any weather related contingency is carried out in advance so that the possible adverse impact of sub-par rainfall, if at all, on the farmers can be mitigated.

 

Shri Singh also reminded the Chief Ministers that Hon’ble Prime Minister had discussed drought mitigation/management measures in meetings with Chief Ministers of States affected by drought during 2015-16. Shri Singh expressed his confidence that the administration would have made arrangements to operationalise their drought mitigation strategies, in the event of failure of the monsoon rainfall.  In this context, Shri Singh suggested to consider carrying out a review which, inter alia, may include the following:

(i)         State of preparedness in districts in line with the District Agricultural Contingency Plans (availability of e.g. abiotic stress resilient seeds varieties etc.) 

 

(ii)        Progress in the implementation of schemes under District Irrigation Plans of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. 

(iii)       Status of progress of water conservation/recharge/harvesting related works under MGNREGS  and water-shed management.

 

(iv)       Establishment and activation of Drought Management Centre at the State Headquarter and arrangements for the monitoring of drought.

 

(v)        Progress in the restoration of irrigation infrastructure e.g, desiltaion of canals, repair/energization of tube-wells and replacement/repair of faulty pumps; repair of transformers/power lines.

 

(vi)       Progress in the repair of handpumps/drinking water projects.

 

Union Agriculture Minister further informed that the Central Government has permitted States and UTs to earmark 25% of funds under centrally sponsored schemes as flexi-funds which, inter-alia, could be used for mitigation of natural calamities. In addition, expanding the coverage of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will enable farmers to minimise risks associated with loss of production in the event of a disaster.

 

Shri Singh hoped that all necessary and advance steps are being taken by the State Governments in the interest of the farmers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved a restructuring plan for Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. (HOCL), a loss making and sick Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals. The company, having units at Rasayani (Maharashtra) and Kochi (Kerala), has been making continuous cash losses since 2011-12 resulting in acute shortage of working capital. Most of its plants have remained shut down during the last few years. It could not pay regular salary and statutory dues to the employees since February, 2015.

 

Restructuring:

The restructuring plan involves closing down the operations of all the non-viable plants at Rasayani unit of HOCL except Di-Nitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4) plant which is to be transferred to ISRO on 'as is where is' basis, with about 20 acres of land and employees associated with the plant. The N2O4 plant is of strategic importance as it is the only indigenous source of N2O4 which is used as liquid rocket propellant by ISRO in the space launch vehicles.

 

Financial implications:

 Financial implications of the plan is Rs. 1008.67 crore (cash) which is to be met partly from sale of 442 acres HOCL land at Rasayani to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (Rs.618.80 crore) and the balance (Rs.365.26 crore) through bridge loan from the Govt. The funds will be used to liquidate the various liabilities of the company, including payment of outstanding salary and statutory dues of employees and repayment of Govt. guaranteed bonds of Rs.250 crore due for redemption in Aug.-Sept. 2017. The bridge loan amount, along with other Govt. liabilities of the company, is proposed to be repaid to the Govt. from the disposal of remaining unencumbered land and other assets of Rasayani unit.

 

Impact:

Implementation of the restructuring plan will enable HOCL to close down the operations of non - viable plants at Rasayani unit while transferring the strategically important N2O4 plant to ISRO to ensure continuity of manufacture and supply of N2O4 for ISRO's space programme. Interest and welfare of employees will be addressed by payment of all their outstanding salary dues. Disposal of land assets, initially through sale of 442 acres to BPCL and subsequently of the remaining unencumbered land, will unlock the land assets for being redeployed for economically productive investments and thereby creating new employment generation opportunities.

                Addressing the media on the achievements under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) here today, Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananthkumar said that the scheme is creating a Silent Revolution in achieving Health Security by providing Affordable, Quality Medicines for All. Today India is the World’s Pharmacy and our Pharma sector is growing at a pace of 20-21% and India is exporting quality generic medicines to 215 countries the Minister added.

 

Shri Ananthkumar said that following the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of making providing Affordable, Quality Medicines for All, the Government has made Health Security for all citizens its priority and this aim can only be achieved through the Janaushadhi pariyojana. Through this scheme, the Government is planning to take affordable medicines to each block of the country in near future, he added.

 

Shri Kumar informed that as on date, 1320 PMBJP Kendras (PMBJKs) are functioning in the country in the 30 States/UTs, covering 426 districts, as compared to only 80 opened between 2008 and 2014. The turnover in the beginning of the scheme was around Rs. 3 crores, which would increase to around Rs. 60 crores by end of this year, he informed.

 

Further, the Minister said that MoUs for opening PMBJKs have been signed by Union Government with 19 State Governments and other Organisations/NGOs. A total of 32,225 applications have been received out of which in-principle approval has been given to 30,300 applications. which is a proof of the huge opportunity that this scheme provides for unemployed youth to get self-employed, Shri Kumar added.

 

Talking about the actual reduction in medicine prices, Shri Kumar said that in these PMBJKs, the Government procured generic medicines are sold which are 50% - 90% less as compared to the branded medicines in open market, for e.g. the price of Amlodipine 5 mg 10 Tablets is Rs. 3.25 as compared to market average price of Rs. 20.00 for branded version. Further, the product basket of PMBJP contains more than 600 medicines and 154 surgicals and consumables in all therapeutic categories viz. Anti-infectives, Anti-diabetics, Cardiovasculars, Anti-cancers, Gastro-intestinal medicines, etc.

 

Most importantly, allaying the concerns about quality, the Minister said that each batch of drug supplied to PMBJKs is tested for impeccable quality assurance at NABL (National Accreditation Board Laboratories) accredited laboratories and is compliant with WHO GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) benchmarks. Out of total 10,000 pharmaceuticals companies in India, 1400 are WHO GMP compliant and drugs under the PMBJP are procured only from these 1400 companies, Shri Kumar said.

 

Answering to a question on prescription of generic medicines by doctors, the Minister informed that due to sustained efforts of the Ministry, the Medical Council of India (MCI) has recently issued a directive to all medical colleges, hospitals, doctors across the country and made it mandatory to prominently mention Generic Names of drugs along with Brand Names in their prescriptions, in pursuance of which strict disciplinary action may be taken against the violators. All medical practitioners have been directed by the Government to strictly comply with its directions. Further, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has also issued advisory to all State Drug Controllers that all branded drugs, imported or domestically manufactured, should mandatorily contain generic names mentioned in bold letters while packaging, Shri Kumar added.

 

It was also informed that in order to encourage doctors to prescribe generic medicines, the MCI had amended the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 on 08th October 2016 advising the use of generic name of drugs in doctor’s prescription.

 

Informing about the Government’s efforts towards future expansion of PMBJKs in the country, Shri Kumar said that the Ministry of Railways has come on board to open Janaushadhi kendras in over 1000 railway stations across the country in collaboration with Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers. Further, the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers has also written to all State Governments to open PMBJKs in District headquarters, Tehsil/Block level, bus stands etc. to increase the reach of affordable medicines to the poor and underprivileged citizens of the country, Shri Kumar added.

 

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri J.P. Prakash, Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Shri Rajneesh Tingal, JS, Pharma and Shri Biplab Chatterjee, CEO, Bureau of Pharma PSUs in India (BPPI), the implementing agency for PMBJP, under Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers.

                The civil aviation industry in India has emerged as one of the fastest growing industries in the country during the last three years. With a 19 percent growth in domestic passenger traffic from about 6.1 crore in 2014 to 10 crore in 2016-17,  India is now the third largest aviation market in the world, with the promise to grow even further. What is most impressive about this growth is its inclusive nature defined by the Regional Connectivity Scheme –UDAN, that has made air travel  possible for even the common man in remote areas.   According to Shri P Ashok Gajapathy Raju, Union Minister for Civil Aviation, his Ministry has worked towards reshaping aviation ecosystem for affordable and convenient flying for everyone by bringing in the National Civil Aviation Policy 2016.  The Minister was briefing the media in New Delhi today,  about the achievements of the Civil Aviation Ministry during the last three years. The MoS for Civil Aviation  Shri Jayant Sinha was also present on the occasion. 

 

Shri Raju said that average or median airfares fell by 18 percent during 2016-17, making flying more affordable for the common man. Scheduled domestic flight movements also rose from 7 lakh in 2014 to 8.2 lakh in 2016, an 8.2 percent CAGR growth. As against 395 aircrafts in the fleet of Indian carriers, there are 496 aircrafts in operation today, and another 654 are under purchase. Route Dispersal Guidelines have been rationalized, multiple provisions have been made for MRO service providers and a slew of initiatives like the AirSewa portal, enhanced compensation for cancellation and boarding denial have been taken for improving passenger convenience

The Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN has been by far the most path-breaking achievement of the Ministry. 31 currently served, 12 under-served and 27 unserved airports are now connecting 128 RCS routes across the country. 50 airports are being revived and 13 lakh new UDAN seats are being added annually under the first round of UDAN for a Viability Gap Funding of Rs 205 crore.

Shri Raju also talked about the other achievements of the Ministry like promoting Ease of Doing Business by allowing 100 % FDI in domestic scheduled air transport, Open Skies Service Agreements offers to 49 countries and 5 SAARC nations etc, developing a robust security architecture by complying with ICAO requirements, Anti Hijacking Act etc, promoting innovative technology like  GAGAN, India’s first navigation based system to improve accuracy of air navigation services and focusing on  skill development in the aviation sector.  About skill development the Minister  informed that the first Executive Aviation Course was launched by India’s first Aviation University in February 2017. 800 ATCs were recruited by AAI in the last 2 years and more than 400 are planned to be recruited in 2017. The Minister said that Aerospace and Aviation Skill Sector Council has been  formed to monitor growth of skill development.

Also speaking on the occasion MoS Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha said that the civil aviation sector in India has undergone a complete transformation in the last three years with India emerging as the world’s third largest aviation market. As against 70-75 airports in the country in all these years, we now have more than 100 airports with the implementation of UDAN.  We hope to have 200 plus airports in the next 10-15 years. He informed that the capacity of existing major airports is also being increased rapidly, while Greenfield airports are coming up at several places in the country like Goa , Navi Mumbai and other places. Shri Sinha informed that Air India has also performed extremely well during the last three years.

The Minister for Civil Aviation Shri Ashok Gajapathi Raju and MoS Shri Jayant Singh briefed media today with regard to handling of  unruly passengers.  They informed that   the Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) on “Handling of unruly/disruptive passengers”  is being revised to enhance the safety and security  of passengers, crew as well as airlines.  During  the press conference the Secretary for Civil Aviation Shri R.N. Choubey gave details of the draft CAR. 

Main features of  the proposed CAR are as follows:

a)       Three levels of unruly behaviors defined viz. Level 1 – disruptive behavior, Level 2 – physically abusive behavior and Level 3 – Life- threatening behavior.

 

b)      The Airlines will maintain a database of such passengers which will form a National  No-fly List of unruly/disruptive passengers.  Individuals identified by MHA as national security threats will also form part of the National No-Fly List.  Such names will be forwarded to the individuals by the airlines indicating the reasons for inclusion of their names in the National NO-Fly List.

 

 

c)      For passengers indicated in the National No-Fly List, airlines will have option to bar the unruly passenger from taking flights to/form/within India for a period ranging from 03 months to a maximum of two years depending upon level of unruly behavior.  For every subsequent offence, the person will be banned for twice the period of previous ban.

 

d)     Provides for two tiers of complaint handling mechanism in such cases, viz. initial inquiry at airlines level by an internal committee headed by a retired Distict & Sessions Judge and an appeal at Govt. headed by Retired Judge of a High Court of India

 

The Secretary informed that other Airlines as well as International Airlines were free to take cognizance of No Fly List and extend ban to the concerned individual or group of individuals.  However individuals in  No Fly List  identified by security agencies would have no right to appeal.

 

The Secretary informed  the media that after placing the draft on public domain and getting responses and suggestions, the Ministry is confident that the matter would be finalized by the end of June, 2017.

 

            The draft CAR is available on the following link:

While delivering the key note address at the India Integrated Transport & Logistics Summit 2017, the Minister for Civil Aviation, Shri Ashok Gajapathi Raju said that the country has seen significant growth in domestic air traffic and infrastructure development. He said that his Ministry is taking steps to make air transport affordable to the common man through the Regional Connectivity Scheme. He also said that air cargo which is likely to grow 9% in a next few years and hence logistic parks will help that growth. 

Speaking at the plenary session of the Summit, the Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation, Shri R.N. Choubey informed that air cargo globally and domestically constituted just 1% in terms of volume, but almost 25% in terms of value as air cargo was mostly valuable, perishable and time sensitive. He said that a Common Framework would be created in a years time for air cargo so that freight operators, airlines, security as well addressees come within one system. This will bring efficiency in handling air cargo. The Secretary also informed that Common User Cargo Terminals would be created at 17 airports. He also said that the free period for air cargo had been brought down from 72 to 48 hours to ensure faster movement out of terminals. He said that Civil Aviation would be a great beneficiary of all the steps taken to improve transport and logistics in the country and therefore had great expectations from the Summit.

Rajmahal Opencast Project of Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, has set a target of 17 Million Tonne (MT) coal production during 2017-18 at its optimum capacity. Rajmahal OCP produced 14.43 MTs of coal during 2016-17. 

With the issue of shifting Bhadotola village being solved in stages with the help of Jharkhand State Government, Rajmahal OCP is fully geared up to supply coal to Kahalgaon and Farakka Plants of NTPC throughout the year. At present 25,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes daily production will continue till June 2017 end. From July 2017 onwards further 7 MTs of coal will be made available at Dahernangi patch. 

Further, more than 20 MTs additional coal will be made available from Bhadotola which will help Rajmahal OCP to produce 17 MTs during the current fiscal with continued law and order support from Jharkhand Government in shifting Bhadotola village. 

At present, the demand of Farakka and Kahalgaon is met by supplying 25,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes coal from Rajmahal MGR and remaining from Raniganj Coalfield of ECL through rail which continues during monsoon period also. There will be no dearth of coal at Rajmahal OCP to supply Kahalgaon and Farakka Power Stations of NTPC.

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal launched the Saral Eindhan Vitaran Application (SEVA), developed in-house by Coal India Limited (CIL) for power sector consumers, here today. SEVA is a part of ‘Digital India’initiative, which is aimed at increasing the Consumer Connect as well as the Transparency and Accountability in Coal dispatch.

 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Goyal said that this app, along with other such apps of various Ministries of Government of India, are in line with Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of “Easy, Effective, Economical and Transparent Governance.” Shri Goyal further informed that for the benefit of all the citizens, the links for all mobile apps regarding Ministries of Power, Coal, NRE and Mines would be sent to the respective mobile number from which a missed call on the designated toll free number 1800 200 300 4 is given.

 

The Minister added that this Government believes in suo motu dissemination of information of larger public interest and ‘m-governance’ would be the key to achieve this goal. These people-centric mobile apps would make the citizen empowered and hold the Government accountable for its decisions through increased transparency.

 

Talking about the SEVA app, the Minister said that there is a general perception that an app related to Coal dispatch would not be of importance for the common man. Contrary to this view, Shri Goyal said, by using this app the common man would be able to hold the Government accountable for the coal linkage allocations and would be able to check any pilferage or inefficiencies in coal consumption for power generation. This would, in turn, lead to rationalization of coal linkages and finally reduction in the power prices in the country. In near future , non-power sector mines would also be added in this App, the Minister added.

 

Earlier in the event, it was informed that the SEVA Dashboard provides summary of quantity of coal dispatched along with grades for the given day, month, and the latest yearly updates as well. It also provides information on rake movement including latest status of indents of rake, allotment and loading. This would help consumers making advance logistics planning. Further, the app has a dedicated backend team to monitor the status of specific grievances from consumers and take action on the feedback received on the app. While much of the information on the SEVA Dashboard is available in open access, consumer specific data would be password protected.

 

The consumer friendly mobile app helps in tracking of coal dispatch to 118 Power Plants through Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) of around 500 MT besides, dispatch through Special Forward E-Auction and Bridge Linkage from more than 200 dispatch points spread over eight states of the country. Daily quantity involved is to the tune of 1.25 Million Tonnes involving the daily movement of around 195 coal trains besides dispatch through other captive modes of transport like MGR, road, belt, ropeways etc.

 

Other dignitaries present during the event were Shri Susheel Kumar, Secretary Coal, Shri Suresh Kumar, Additional Secretary Coal, Shri Sutirtha Bhattacharya, Chairman CIL and other senior officers of the Ministry and the PSUs under it.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the signing of Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) with the Letter of Assurance (LoA) holders. Allocation of linkages for power sector shall be based on auction of linkages or through Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) based on competitive bidding of tariffs except for the State and the Central Power Generating companies and the exceptions provided in Tariff Policy, 2016. Coal drawal will be permitted against valid Long Term PPAs and to be concluded Medium Term PPAs.

 

The approved framework ensures that all projects with linkages are supplied coal as per their entitlement. This will ensure the rights of coal supplies for FSA holders and signing of FSA with LoA holders.

 

Allocation of linkages in future will be transparent and bidding based, barring some exceptions as per Tariff Policy. Future allocation/grant of linkages will be based on auction and/or tariff based bidding.  It attempts to make optimal allocation of the vital natural resource across the power units.

 

            The salient features of the SHAKTI are as follows:

 

  i.            TPPs having LoA shall be eligible to sign FSA after ensuring that the plants are commissioned, respective milestones met, all specified conditions of the LoA fulfilled within specified timeframe and where nothing adverse is detected against the LoA holders and the TPPs are commissioned before 31.03.22.

 ii.            TPPs, part of 78000 MW, that could not be commissioned by 31.03.15 shall now be eligible for coal drawal if the plants are commissioned before 31.03.22.

iii.            Actual coal supplies to all TPPs shall be to the extent of long term PPAs or medium term PPAs to be concluded in future.

iv.            Future coal linkages shall be granted as per the following provisions:

 

a)      To Central and State Gencos, on recommendations of Ministry of Power (MoP).

b)      Coal linkages shall be granted on auction basis for Independent Power producers (IPPs) with PPA based on domestic coal. The IPPs participating in auction will bid for discount on the existing tariff. The discount on tariff would be adjusted from the gross amount of bill at the time of billing.

c)      The future coal linkages for supply of coal to IPPs without PPA shall be on the basis of auction where bidding for linkage shall be done over the Notified Price of Coal Company. The LoA shall be issued to the successful bidders and FSA signed after meeting the terms of LoA.

d)     Linkages shall be earmarked to the States where any linkage quantity unutilized for two years shall lapse. States may indicate the earmarked linkages to the DISCOMs/SDAs, who may:

 

·         Undertake tariff based competitive bidding on long-term and medium-term PPAs and allot these linkages to the successful bidder; or

·         Assign these linkages to capacities that are covered under exceptions and proviso clauses of para 5.2 of the Tariff Policy dated 28.01.16.

e)      Power requirement of group of States can be aggregated and procurement of power on tariff based bidding shall be made by a designated agency. Coal linkages shall be earmarked for such agency.

f)       Linkages, for full normative quantity, shall be granted for setting up Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPP).

g)      Coal linkages, for IPPs having PPA based on imported coal, shall be made available through a transparent bidding process.

 Policy directions will be issued by the Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Power and will be implemented by CIL (Coal India Ltd.) / SCCL (Singareni Collieries Company Ltd.) and different power entities of the State and Central Government.

 

Background:

 The coal supply to the TPPs has been made as per the provisions of the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP), 2007. Till 2010, CIL had issued LoA for approximately 1,08,000 MW capacity and no new LoAs were issued thereafter due to the prevailing scarcity scenario. The CCEA decision of 21.06.13 directed CIL to sign FSA with TPPs of about 78,000 MW capacity. The coal availability scenario has, now, emerged from scarcity to adequacy. In this adequate coal availability scenario, the present policy proposes a fading away of the old linkage allocation policy and emergence of a new linkage allocation policy based on transparent and objective criteria for the optimal utilisation of the natural resources.

 

Coal linkage to the power sector is governed by provisions of the NCDP, 2007. Under the NCDP, a system of issuance of LoA was introduced wherein requests for Linkage/LoA are forwarded to MoP for its recommendations. These recommendations are placed before the Standing Linkage Committee (SLCLT) which authorizes issue of LoA.

                In accordance with the Government of India’s policy to introduce online Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) for Group ‘A’ services, Smt. Rita Teotia,Commerce Secretary launched the SPARROW-ITS (Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Online Window) today, to enable the Indian Trade Service (ITS) officers to fill their APAR online for the year 2016-17 onwards.  The event was attended by Sh. Ajay Bhalla, DGFT and othet senior officers of DGFT.

 

The APARs would be generated and transmitted online to the concerned officers for filling up of the self appraisal.  The officer can then submit the self appraisal online through Digitally Signed Signature (DSC) or through E-sign.  The subsequent processes of reporting and reviewing would also be done online by the Reporting and Reviewing Officer by using DSC or E-sign.  The timelines have been drawn up for each stage of the process.  The entire process of filling up of APAR would have to be completed by 31st December and no remarks can be added after that date.

 

The very idea of switch over from manual to online system is to ensure ready access of APAR dossier by the authorized users, preventing loss of APARs in transition, address the issues of ante-dating, remarks recorded by the Reporting Authorities without dates, etc.  Above all, it brings in transparency into the APAR management system.  This would, in turn, ensure that the APAR dossiers arereadily available for promotions at various levels which used to get delayed for want of updated APARs. This is another step towards Digital India in the government, where various administrative processes are being moved to IT platform leading to transparency and ease of administration. The 150 officers of ITSwould, thus, get benefited by timely promotions and all other benefits dependent upon the evaluation of their APARs.

On 25 May 2017, the Minister was the keynote speaker at the Industry Day of Morocco in Casablanca, organised by the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade and Digital Economy of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco. She visited the Centre for Excellence in Information Technology in Casablanca, a collaboration of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), India and Institut National des Postes et Télécommunications (INPT), Morocco. She called on Dr Saad Eddine El Othmani, Head of Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and had bilateral discussions with Mr. Abdelkader Amara, Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, and Mr. Mohamed Boussaid, Minister of Economy and Finance. On 26 May 2017, she met with Mr. Moulay Hafid El Alamy, Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade and Digital Economy. In all the interactions, the key element of excellent political relations that underpinned the economic context of the bilateral relations, was highlighted.

On 26 May 2017, the 5th India Morocco JCM was convened in Rabat during which a Memorandum of Understanding was signed for Cooperation on Broadcasting between Prasar Bharati, India and Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision (SNRT), Morocco. The MoU was signed by Dr Kheya Bhattacharya, Ambassador of India on behalf of Prasar Bharati and Mr Fayçal Laraichi, Chief Executive Officer of SNRT.

The visit of Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Commerce and Industry, Government of India to Morocco and the proceedings of the 5th India Morocco JCM have intensified the strong bilateral relations between India and Morocco, and provided an impetus for closer cooperation between the two countries in the political, commercial, cultural, and trade sectors.

                Startup India was launched by the Government of India on 16th January, 2016 to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and Startups in the country to drive economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.

 

In order to promote entrepreneurship in the country, the Government of India has amended the definition of a Startup. The following significant changes have been made to the definition of Startups –

 

a)   Age of Startup increased: Taking into account the long gestation period by Startups to establish, an entity shall be considered as a Startup up to seven years from the date of its incorporation/ registration (from earlier 5 years). However, in the case of Startups in the Biotechnology sector, the period shall be up to ten years from the date of incorporation/ registration.

 

b)   No Letter of Recommendation required: No letter of recommendation from an incubator/industry association shall be required for either recognition or tax benefits

c)   Potential of Job and Wealth Creation: The scope of definition has been broadened to include scalability of business model with potential of employment generation or wealth creation.

 

As a constant endeavour to facilitate the Startup ecosystem, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has been holding extensive consultations with stakeholders. The above changes are an effort to ensure ease of starting up new businesses to promote the Startup ecosystem and build a nation of job creators instead of job seekers.

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman led the Indian delegation to the 3rd RCEP Inter-sessional Ministerial Meeting on 21-22 May 2017 in Hanoi in which Trade Ministers of 15 other RCEP countries participated. Trade Minister and Industry Minister of Philippines Mr Ramon Lopez, was the Chair of the Meeting as Philippines is currently holding the Presidency of ASEAN this year and Minister of Industry and Trade of Vietnam, Mr Tran Tuan Anh, as the host extended a warm welcome to the delegates. 

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is a mega regional free trade agreement being negotiated amongst 16 countries, comprising 10 ASEAN countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) plus six ASEAN FTA partners, namely Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. So far 4 Ministerial Meetings, 3 Inter-sessional Ministerial Meetings and 18 Rounds of the Trade Negotiating Committee at the technical level have been held. 

At the working dinner on 21st May the Minister’s exchanged views on global economic developments, particularly in the area of trade, and stressed the need for the RCEP fraternity to remain guarded and united against recent protectionist trends and be supportive of inclusive trade policies for the greater good and prosperity of the people of the region. They recognized the importance of RCEP in this context. On day 2, 22nd May, Mr. Pak Iman Pambagyo, the Chair of the Trade Negotiating Committee Leads made a presentation on the state of play of RCEP negotiations and sought ministerial guidance on pending issues for taking forward the negotiations. 

The Ministers’ took stock of the state of negotiations across the various negotiating groups and sub-working groups, particularly in the area of goods, services and investment. It was noted that while considerable progress had been made, several areas still required to be negotiated to finality. India and some other countries stressed the need to arrive at a comprehensive and balanced agreement across the three key pillars of goods, services and investment, that reconciled the need for high ambition and forward looking rules and procedures, with the sensitivities and level of development of various participating countries. It was appreciated that countries have varying profiles in terms of their strengths and aspirations, and sensitivities, which would vary across countries. The comfort with countries with whom a country already had FTAs was of an entirely different order, as compared to countries with whom there may be trade deficits and no such agreement. 

Conscious of this position, participating countries were attempting to move towards negotiating around the next round of offers and requests in goods to achieve the maximum ambition possible, while balancing sensitivities through suitable mechanisms like staging periods and line exceptions. 

In Services also countries are in the process of submitting their next round of offers to similarly negotiate a mutually beneficial outcome. CIM underlined the importance of Services for realizing the full potential of RCEP that recognized the varying areas of strength and comparative advantage of participating countries, and allowed countries to balance sacrifices and gains. She urged member countries to work towards liberalization across all modes of Services, including movement of professionals in Mode 4, in line with the RCEP Guiding Principles that seek to build on ASEAN +1 FTAs in a manner consistent with GATS principles. On Mode 4, Movement of Natural Persons (MNP) and RCEP Travel Card India strongly emphasized its position, and the importance of these areas in facilitating temporary movement of professionals to achieve the full potential of the forward and modern looking regional integration that was being envisaged. She stressed that temporary movement of professionals for activities like installation, trouble shooting, training, maintenance, investment management etc., not to be confused with immigration, was essential across the entire dimension of good and services trade, and investment. CIM pointed out that a selective approach to the detriment of Services would not be in the best interest of RCEP negotiations, and would be failing to acknowledge, promote and protect the strength and mutually beneficial nature of the current relationship, where Indian companies with limited expatriate presence had created over 100,000 local jobs in the RCEP countries, apart from cost saving and enhanced competitiveness. 

In Investments, the reservation lists submitted by all countries will be analyzed from their commercial meaningfulness. CIM maintained that India’s position that suitable arrangements in the area of Investor State Dispute Settlement were critical to finalization of the investment negotiations. 

RCEP Trade Ministers have urged TNCs to deliberate on these issues further at the next 19th Hyderabad Round scheduled to be held from 18-28 July 2017. India will be seeking a balanced outcome in RCEP with equivalent and balanced ambition across all Chapters and on the principle of Single of Undertaking.

    The Government in last three years has undertaken a number of reforms in different areas of economy. In this regard FDI policy reforms carried out by Government are nothing less than historic. The scale of reforms can be gauged from the fact that during this period, 21 sectors covering 87 areas of FDI policy have undergone reforms.This has resulted in increased FDI inflows which year after year is setting up new records. If the FDI inflows of US Dollar 55.6 billion for the year ending March, 2016 werean all-time high, the record was not meant to last long. The country registered FDI inflow of US Dollar 60.08 billion in the next financial year (2016-17), thereby scaling an even higher peak.

            Increased FDI inflows in the country are largely attributed to intense and bold policy reformsthe Government undertook to bring pragmatism in the FDI regime. The country has now become the topmost attractive destination for foreign investment. A new direction was given to FDI policy reforms in 2014 itself when conservative sectors like Rail Infrastructure and Defence were liberalized. This was accompanied byreforms in other sectors such as Medical Devices andConstruction Development. The momentum of positive business climate was further ignited with launch of Make in India initiative in September 2014. The country in the year ending March 2015 received FDI of US Dollar 45.15 billion as against US Dollar 36.05 billionin the preceding fiscal.

            Reform measures gained further momentum the following year. FDI policy on a number of sectors was liberalized. With a view to provide ease of doing business, licensed and non-sensitive activities were placed under automatic route and investment caps were raised. FDI policy provisions were radically overhauled across sectors such as Construction Development, Broadcasting, Retail Trading, Air Transport, Insurance and Pension among others. In addition, initiatives such as introduction of composite caps in the FDI policy and raising the FIPB approval limit were also undertaken to promote ease of doing business in the country. These initiatives resulted in the country receiving the then highest ever FDI inflow of US Dollar 55.6 billion.

            The measures towards FDI policy liberalization and reforms continued in the last year financial year. A paradigm shift was made in the FDI policy on retail and other financial services sector. For retail trading of food products, the Government permitted 100% FDI with unqualified condition that such food products have to be manufactured and/or produced in India. The measure promotes domestic industry, restricts imports, creates local jobs and results in conserving valuable foreign exchange. In the Financial services sector,Government promulgated that any financial sector activity which is regulated by any financial sector regulator will be eligible for 100% FDI under automatic route, and approval would be needed only for unregulated financial sector activities. During the last financial year, FDI policy reforms were also undertaken in other sectors such as Defence, Airport Infrastructure, Broadcasting, Animal Husbandry and Retail Trading. The path breaking reform measures undertaken during the last financial year have resulted in India surpassing the FDI received in 2015-16 and registering an inflow of US Dollar 60.08 billion during 2016-17, a new all time high.

            It has been the endeavor of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy. The intent all this while has been to make the FDI policy more investor friendly and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering the investment inflows into the country. The steps taken in this direction during the last three years have borne fruit as is evident from the ever increasing volumes of FDI inflows being received into the country.

                The existing Pragati Maidan Complex that so far used to organise National and International Exhibitions and facilitate holding of various other events, is set to get all new face with its upcoming redevelopment into a World class state-of-the-art Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC). At a joint Press Conference by Shri L. C. Goyal, CMD, India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) and Dr. Anoop Kumar Mittal, CMD, NBCC (India) Limited, held in New Delhi today, announced the launch of this sophisticated Project to be implemented by the latter at a cost of approx. Rs 2,500 Crore. Shri Goyal and Dr. Mittal on the occasion, released the layout and the design of IECC and an outline of comprehensive solutions to decongest traffic in and around Pragati Maidan. Once redeveloped, IECC will be a landmark spot in Delhi and a symbol of Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of ‘New India’, they informed. 

Conceived by NBCC in association with M/s ARCOP Associates Pvt. Ltd. and Aedas Pte. Ltd. of Singapore, the IECC shall be developed with latest architectural design alongwith basement parking facility of 4800 vehicles and comprehensive traffic decongestion interventions. The Convention Centre will be 32.4 mtr. tall landmark building on par with the best in the world. This structure will be on an elevated podium with unique slopping facade incorporating rich architectural heritage of Delhi. The Centre will have a capacity of 7000 pax in single format (Plenary Hall with fixed sitting of 3000 pax and Multi-Function Hall of 4000 pax) and amphitheatre with 3000pax. There will be altogether 30 Meeting Rooms of different sizes and capacity and the complete structure of the Centre will be built with a mix of red stone and Dholpur white stone and GFRC. The implementation of the whole project shall also have the provision for monetisation of land for a 500-Key Hotel. 

Exhibition segment of the Integrated Centre shall comprise 7 new modern Exhibition Halls along with pre-function area with exhibition space of one lakh sq. mtr. Each Exhibition Hall will have integrated F&B facility. There will also be exhibition open area (15 acres) with 4 open amphitheatres, (two of 900 pax each and two of 600 pax each) with two colourful fountain areas. The complex will also have covered walkways/canopies & skywalk connectivity with Pragati Maidan Metro Station. 

The basement parking for 4800 vehicles will have Entry and Exit points for smooth traffic flow. The provision of Traffic Interventions will take care of traffic decongestion interventions which shall be vital for better access to IECC and the benefit of general public. The facility will also connect Mathura Road/Purana Quila Road to Ring Road through a 6 lane divided tunnel cutting across Pragati Maidan and shall make Mathura Road signal free. 

Shri Goyal and Dr. Mittal also informed that the CCEA approved the IECC on 24 January, 2017 with the estimated cost of Rs. 2254 crore (excluding the cost on account of traffic interventions). Stating that all statutory approvals like layout plan and concept design by Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), National Monuments Authority (NMA), South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC); layout plan and building plans by Fire Services Department of Govt. of Delhi; traffic Interventions by Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) in DDA have been obtained, they informed that environmental clearance from Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) is in process and expected soon. 

During the proceedings, both the Stakeholders revealed the detailed timeline of the prestigious project saying that the vendors for both IECC project and Traffic Interventions would be in place by the end of June, 2017 and the construction work would start by July, 2017. The Convention Centre, they informed, would be completed by November- December, 2018 and the entire project by July- August, 2019. 

Summing up, Shri Goyal and Dr. Mittal reiterated that the entire initiative, first-of-its-kind, would go a long way in ensuring comprehensive traffic solutions to decongest traffic in and around Pragati Maidan providing huge relief to the general public. They also assured that the people of the capital city of Delhi and the Country at large would welcome and appreciate the initiative once completed and would indeed applaud this landmark reality that would usher in a new era for the Capital.

                India and Chile have entered into another milestone in their trade relations as an agreement on expansion of India-Chile PTA which was signed on 6th September, 2016 is finally being implemented on 16th May, 2017. The Union Cabinet had approved the expansion of PTA in April, 2016. 

The expanded PTA would immensely benefit both sides as a wide array of concessions has been offered by both sides on a number of tariff lines which will facilitate more two way trade. 

India and Chile had earlier signed a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) on March 8, 2006 which came into force with effect from August, 2007. The original PTA had a limited number of tariff lines wherein both sides had extended tariff concessions to each other. India’s offer list to Chile consisted of only 178 tariff lines whereas Chile’s offer list to India contained 296 tariff lines at 8-digit level. 

The expanded PTA has a wider coverage wherein Chile has offered concessions to India on 1798 tariff lines with Margin of Preference (MoP) ranging from 30%-100% and India has offered concessions to Chile on 1031 tariff lines at 8-digit level with MoP ranging from 10%-100%. These tariff lines were based on HS 2012 when the negotiations had been concluded. With the implementation of the HS 2017 Nomenclature with effect from 1st January, 2017, both sides have aligned their Annexes on India’s Schedule of Tariff Concessions, Chile’s Schedule of Tariff Concessions and the Schedule on Rules of Origin as per HS 2017 Nomenclature for issue of Notification. This would facilitate exporters of both sides to take the advantage of tariff concessions as per the expanded PTA immediately which covers around 96% of bilateral trade. 

Chile is the fourth largest trading partner of India in LAC region after Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. India’s bilateral trade has grown substantially to reach a level of US$ 3,646.45 million during 2014-15 as compared to US$ 2,655.35 million in 2011-12 as per the Department of Commerce statistics. However, during year 2015-16, bilateral trade declined by (-) 27.60% and stood at US$ 2,639.99 million with exports US$ 679.32 million and imports US$ 1,960.67 million. The decline in bilateral trade was due to extraneous reasons such as fall in prices of crude oil and international commodities. During the last few years, bilateral trade has been in favour of Chile because of import of high volume of copper ore which constitute more than 88% of the imports from Chile. 

India’s exports to Chile are diverse which consist of transport equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals, yarn of polyester fibres, tyres and tubes, manufacture of metals, articles of apparel, organic/inorganic and agro chemicals, textiles, readymade garments, plastic goods, leather products, engineering goods, imitation jewellery, sports goods and handicrafts. Major items of Import from Chile are copper ore and concentrates, iodine, copper anodes, copper cathodes, molybdenum ores & concentrates, lithium carbonates & oxide, metal scrap, inorganic chemicals, pulp & waste paper, fruits & nuts excluding cashews, fertilizers and machinery. 

Keeping in view that Chile is the founding member of the Pacific Alliance to which India is an Observer Member, implementing the expanded PTA could deepen its engagement with the emerging trade bloc.

                The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)have signed an agreement to establish Technology and Innovation Support Centers (TISC)


WIPO’s Technology and Innovation Support Centers (TISC) program provides innovators in developing countries with access to locally based, high quality technology information and related services, helping them to exploit their innovative potential and to create, protect, and manage their intellectual property (IP) rights.


Services offered by TISCs may include:
•    Access to online patent and non-patent (scientific and technical) resources and IP-related publications;
•    Assistance in searching and retrieving technology information;
•    Training in database search;
•    On-demand searches (novelty, state-of-the-art and infringement);
•    Monitoring technology and competitors;
•    Basic information on industrial property laws, management and strategy, and technology commercialization and marketing.


    The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) is designated as the National Focal point for the TISC national network. As the national focal point, CIPAM shall identify potential host institutions, assess their capacities and support them in joining the TISC project. CIPAM will also act as the main intermediary between WIPO and TISC host institutions and coordinateall the activities of the national TISC network.


    Over 500TISCs operate worldwide and establishing TISC in India will give the host institutions access to the Global network. In upcoming years CIPAM is planning to establish TISC’s in Universities, State Science Councils, R&D institutions etc. TISC will give an impetus to Knowledge sharing, sharing of best practices among the TISC’s, capacity building, generation and commercialization of IPs

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the revised Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) would be released early to synchronise the same with roll out of GST. The core focus of the revised FTP would be promoting exports from the SMEs and high employment potential sectors. Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman was chairing a meeting on the Mid-Term review of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 organised jointly by Department of Commerce and Research and Information System for the Developing Countries (RIS) . 

Commerce Secretary Ms Rita Teaotia, Chairman RIS Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and DGFT Shri Ajay Bhalla also participated in discussions. The event was attended by the trade policy experts from the industry, academia, Research and Government . 

Major suggestions discussed during the deliberations related to promoting Rupee Trade, facilitating not only exports but also imports and reducing cost of credit. Participant recommended harnessing the high foreign exchange earnings and large employment generation potential of services related to the Tourism, Education and Health sector. Such services fall under the WTO category of the Mode 2 Services, also called the ‘Consumption Abroad’ category. It was emphasised that promotion of mode2 in services sector shall contribute in domestic economic development and job creation. 

Concerns were also raised on issues relating to GST and its impact on export. Minister said that Department of Commerce has already taken up these issues with Department of Revenue, and assured that it will again take up theses issues With DoR for placing it before GST council to find a solution. 

Critical role of Logistics sector for export competitiveness was also discussed;, reducing the cost of credit in promoting exports, export basket diversification, strategy for promoting value added exports, agriculture exports and services exports were also deliberated. 

It may be noted that while announcing the five year FTP, 2015-2020 on 01.04.2015, Hon’ble Commerce & Industry Minister had announced that the policy would be reviewed on mid-term basis. The exercise has been initiated by Department of commerce in January 2017. DGFT has held  consultation with a cross section of stakeholders.- Exporters, Traders, Export promotion Councils, Commodity Boards, Various Ministries of the Central Govt., State Governments, foreign missions of India and Industry Bodies- in this regard.

National Productivity Council had submitted a proposal to Asian Productivity Organization (APO) for establishment of Centre of Excellence on IT for Industry 4.0(CoE: IT for I4.0). 

In this context, in the Governing Body Meeting of APO in Tehran on 10th April, 2017, one of the agenda items was to grant approval of the proposal submitted by NPC on “CoE on IT for I4.0”. As a part of recognition of IT capacity of India, NPC proposal has been approved by GB of APO. 

In this scenario, the Centre of Excellence (CoE) can be very effective in coordination with various stakeholders, collection of information, development of knowledge & dissemination of knowledge/information, facilitation in capacity building of industries, support start-ups etc. linking design to customer. The result is the “smart factory”, which is characterized by versatility, resource efficiency and ergonomic design as well as its direct integration with business partners. 

This will ensure a number of benefits such as; Creation of roadmap for implementation of Industry 4.0 especially for MSMEs, transfer of knowledge and expertise from other 19 Member countries, one stop destination on IT for Industry 4.0 for Indian industries especially for MSMEs, capacity building, support to start-ups, etc. The total cost component of CoE will be around Rs. 4.15 Crore for a period of five years. NPC’s share in the total cost will be around Rs.1.05 Crore and that of APO will be Rs. 3.10 Crore. 

As part of taking the agenda forward, NPC has signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), under Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), Govt. of India on 20th April 2017, to carry forward the demonstration activities of CoE with various technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, sensors etc. 

The approved CoE is proposed to be launched formally in the second week of June 2017. There will be participation from the various Industries, Industry Associations, and Experts. A detailed roadmap will be prepared to take forward the activities of CoE.

Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has said that India should take lead in making quality products available to world at an affordable price. Inaugurating the 4th National Standards Conclave organized by the Department of Commerce in association with CII, BIS, EIC, FSSAI, APEDA and NABCB she emphasized while standards as signifying quality are important but they also need to be affordable for manufacturers to comply and consumers to buy. She said Prime Minister’s ‘Zero Effect Zero Defect’ idea aims at exactly this. She cited The Mangalyan launch costing and worldclass quality is a prime example of quality with affordability. 

Commerce and Industry Minister appreciated that a ‘standards strategy document’ is going to be the possible outcome of this conclave however, she emphasised that long term strategy should not lose sight of immediate challenges. Smt. Sitharaman stated that any national strategy for standards should be able to factor in technology to disseminate any change in import requirements in foreign countries so that our exporters are well prepared to overcome those barriers. This dissemination has to be in regional languages. She said this has become critical as number of notifications in WTO have increased and many deal with standards . 

The Minister highlighted the issues confronting agriculture sector, where the nature of standards set in international bodies often militate against the Indian varieties. She stressed that International standards especially in food produce must value variety over homogeneity and India must participate actively in such Standards setting. When Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) controls are put on agro products, like mango or grapes unilaterally, they hurt our farmers. Similarly, the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) of certain pesticides or biocides are altered too quickly in the foreign markets and farmers are taken by surprise. So, efforts must be put to create quick information system for such farmers and exporters. She hoped that the proposed strategy would provide a guide or a kind of framework so that we avoid such crises at negotiation stage it self. 

The Minister also launched the India Standards Portal – a one stop portal for all information on Standards, Technical Regulations, conformity assessment & accreditation practices, and the related bodies in India and adivsed that portal should also help exporters to identify regulations in various countries abroad. 

In his address, Mr. R V Deshpande, Minister for Large and Medium Industries and Infrastructure Development, Government of Karnataka, highlighted the strategy adopted by his state to put in place a robust standards eco system. These include besides providing incentives to the industrial units adopting standards, insistience on procurement of products and services which conform to the standards, ensuring infrastructure is available in the state and focus on Research and Development. 

Ms. Rita Teaotia, Secretary, Department of Commerce highlighted the legislative reforms that have been happening as a result of series of national and regional Conclaves. She stated that since the last edition of the Conclave, the new BIS Act had been passed and the Consumer Protection Act is also proposed to include a new chapter on Product Liability. This would help strengthen the standards ecosystem in the country. She also noted that for the first time, standards in the services sector were getting attention. She suggested that there was a need to develop a National Strategy for Standards as well as Vision Document for the same. 

Ms. Alka Panda, Director General, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) highlighted the role that the BIS was playing in the development of standards in the country. Mr. Adil Zainulbhai, Chairman, Quality Council of India stated that there was a need to work with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to help improve their standards. He also spoke of the need to create a standards compliance system which was easy to comply with and emphasized that standards should be seen as an opportunity rather than as a threat. 

Mr. Rakesh Bharti Mittal, President Designate, and Mr. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of CII also spoke in the inaugral affirming Industries’ commitment to graduate to a high Standards regieme in the country. 

Mr. Sudhanshu Pandey, Joint Secretary, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry proposed the Vote of Thanks.

                The Union Minister for Communications Shri Manoj Sinha today made the formal announcement of India Mobile Congress 2017 (IMC 2017), country’s first & the biggest platform to bring together all stakeholders from the domain of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and take the Indian telecom industry at par with its international counterparts.

The three-day IMC will be held from 27th to 29th September 2017 at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi and will see participation of government bodies, Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), telecom equipment manufacturers, handset manufacturers and app providers.

While announcing the schedule of the event and releasing its logo, Shri Sinha said, “The India Mobile Congress will be the biggest event of the telecom industry and it will bring together all stakeholders from the industry and government on a common platform. It will be an exciting opportunity for all involved to explore and achieve new heights in the world of Information and Communication Technology. It is a proud moment for all of us and I am sure no stone will be left unturned to ensure the success of this mega event.”

IMC 2017 will bring together the global mobile industry, showcase exciting new products & innovation and share the India story, bringing the world to Delhi. The event is being organised by Department of Telecommunications along with Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and other stakeholders. Besides the stalwarts of the Indian telecom industry, the event will also see participation of various top notch international players who would be exploring avenues for investment in the country.

He further mentioned that the need for such a mega event was long felt and it will play a big role in taking the Indian telecom industry at the international arena and provide the right platform for development of ideas and new technology.

Speaking on the occasion, Additional Secretary, Telecom, Mr N Sivasailam said, “India Mobile Congress will be the marquee event of India. Over the years, various stakeholders will look forward to this event for launches or new releases of new technologies. Government of India along with Dept. of Telecommunication are supporting this as an annual event, just like the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. India has a huge market and apart from that, South-East Asia has immense potential.”

Terming it as a “mega event” of the Indian telecom industry, he added, “The annual show will showcase latest innovations in telecom sector not just from India but also from different parts of the world.”

India is on the cusp of a digital revolution and the telecom industry is gradually evolving from a pure voice market to a mix of voice and data services. The proliferation of data will enable the spread of financial services and improves access to education governance and health services. With the Government's favourable regulation policies and 4G services hitting the market, the Indian telecommunication sector is expected to witness a fast growth in the coming years.

The Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha today launched here Tarang Sanchar, a web portal for Information sharing on Mobile Towers and EMF Emission Compliances and said that it will go a long way in clearing the myths and misconceptions of public on mobile towers and emissions from them. He expressed the hope that the portal will empower common man to know at the convenience of a mouse click, about towers working in a particular locality and whether they are compliant to the EMF emission norms defined by the Government. 

Shri Sinha said that the portal will allow users to get a tower or base station checked for radiation emission, for a fee of Rs 4,000. He said that mobile phone today has become an essential requirement for all including the poor in the remotest corner of the country and no one will be allowed to spread misconception about the harmful radiation from the towers to impede the growth of the country. Shri Sinha reiterated that there are over 25,000 studies by WHO in the last 30 years on the subject and there is no proof that EMF radiation has any harmful effect on human health. Brushing aside growing concerns over the emanating electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiations from mobile towers, the Telecom Minister once again reminded that Indian norms had prescribed 10 times stricter limits for radiation emission in comparison to global standards. He said that more measures are being taken to penalise the erring entities. 

Shri Sinha said that to realize the Prime Minister’s vision of Digital India, it is necessary to have more and more mobile towers in every nook and corner of the country and the Ministry has already approved installation of towers over government buildings, 16 places in post offices and soon a decision will be taken to install the same in Cantonment Boards, which will not only help in spreading digital connectivity, but will also solve the problem of call drops significantly. Describing the launch of the portal a historic step, the Minister said that in future it will help in identifying the blind spots and added that it is also environment friendly as no paper work is required for this. He said that it has the complete collated technical details of over 14.5 lakh base stations (BTSs) spread across the country of all technologies (2G, 3G, 4G etc.) and of all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). 

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, DoT Shri P K Pujari said that the portal will make information available to all concerned and he underlined that the focus of the government in the last three years has been transparency, disclosures and citizen-centric measures, which are the hall marks of good governance. He said, though there is no scientific evidence of any health concerns from low power mobile BTSs, a need was felt to educate the citizens about EMF emissions from mobile towers and status of their compliances. Shri Pujari said that the portal has three elements of providing information, EMF compliance process and interface between different departments, besides ease of doing business. 

In his address, the Chairman, TRAI Shri R S Sharma said that the portal will be a mile stone for transparency, fair play, citizen empowerment and will finally lead to a knowledge economy. He said that digital empowerment in India is only possible when there is adequate digital infrastructure. Shri Sharma said that mobile phone in India today is not only a talking tool, but it has become an instrument for various transactions including cashless transaction and he lauded the collaborative effort between the government and the industry for this. 

Shri G K Upadhyaya, Member (Technology) said that the EMF Portal is designed to provide a public interface where an easy map-based search feature has been provided for viewing the mobile towers in vicinity of any locality. He said the that any person can request for EMF emission measurement at a location by paying a nominal fee of Rs 4000/- online. The tests will be conducted by the local Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) filed unit of DoT and the test report will be provided to the requestor. The portal also has ‘EMF Overview’ and ‘Learn’ Sections, which provide numerous articles, booklets and videos, to further educate the citizens about EMF and coverage of telecom services. Shri R K Misra Member (Services) in Telecom Commission in his thanks giving address said that in addition to Government to Citizen (G2C) services, portal also facilitates Government to Business (G2B) service delivery in a transparent and eco-friendly manner.

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution held a Press Conference today to brief about the initiatives and reforms done by the Ministry in last three years. Shri Paswan said that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution achieved significant mile stones since May 2014. A number of initiatives were taken to make foodgrain management more efficient and to ensure food security in the country. Shri Paswan said that interests of farmers and consumers are high on the agenda of the Government.

 

Major Reforms in Public Distribution System (PDS) for better Targeting, Transparency & Accountability

 

Automation of Fair Price Shops: Based on the pilots and learnings from the States/UTs, in November 2014 Department of Food & Public Distribution prescribed the guidelines and specifications for use of PoS at FPS. At present 2,04,162 FPSs (as on 15th May 2017) out of 5,26,377 have PoS.

 

Direct Benefit Transfer (Cash): “Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy Rules, 2015” were notified on August 21, 2015 under which food subsidy is directly credited to the account of the beneficiaries. At present Chandigarh, Puducherry and Dadra & Nagar Haveli (in few urban areas) are implementing this scheme.

 

Aadhaar Seeding in PDS: To weed out duplicate/in-eligible/bogus ration cards and to enable rightful targeting 77.56% i.e. about 17.99 crore ration cards (as on 15th May 2017) have been Aadhaar seeded. Under Section-7 of the Aadhaar Act 2016, the Department has notified the use of Aadhaar to receive subsidized foodgrains or Cash transfer on 8th February 2017.

 

Deletion of ration cards: As an outcome of digitization of Ration Cards/beneficiary records, de-duplication due to Aadhaar seeding, transfer/migration/deaths, change in economic status of beneficiaries and during the run-up to and implementation of NFSA a total of 2.33 crore ration cards have been deleted/cancelled. Based on this the Government has been able to achieve Rightful Targeting of Food Subsidies of about Rs 14,000 Crore per annum.

 

Digital/Cashless/Less-cash Payments in PDS: To promote the use of less-cash/digital payment mechanisms, the Department has issued detailed guidelines for use of AePS, UPI, USSD, Debit/Rupay Cards and e-Wallets on 7th December 2016. At present in 10 States/UTs a total of 50,117 FPSs are enabled for digital payments.

 

FCI Reforms

            Silos: Use of modern technology in storage

 

A road map for creation of 100 Lakh MT storage capacity in the form of Steel Silos by FCI and other agencies including State Governments on PPP mode for wheat and rice has been approved. Construction has been planned in 3 phases upto 2019-20.

 

As against a target of selection of Silo Operator for 36.25 LMT in 2016-17, operators have been identified for 37.50 LMT. As against target for achieving 5 LMT capacity of silos, 4.5 LMT has been completed and 0.5 LMT is due for completion shortly.

 

Depot Online System

To bring all operations of FCI Godowns online and to check leakages and automate operations at depot level, a “Depot Online” system was launched in 31 Depots on pilot basis across 27 States in March, 2016. Now, the Depot Online System has been rolled out in 510 depots of FCI.

 

Pension Scheme and Post Retirement Medical Scheme in Food Corporation of India (FCI)

 

There was long pending demand from employees of FCI for introduction of Pension Scheme and Post Retirement Medical Scheme. Both the schemes were approved by Government of India in August 2016 and will cover serving and retired employees of FCI. Pension Scheme has been implemented with effective from 01.12.2008 and Post Retirement Medical Scheme is effective from 01.04.2016.

 

             Supporting the Farmers

FCI has initiated special efforts for procurement in the Eastern States of India, where there were frequent complaints of distress sale of paddy and procurement system was ineffective. Accordingly, State-wise 5-year Action Plan has been drawn by FCI for Uttar Pradesh (with focus on Eastern U.P.), Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal & Assam, where concerns exist about distress sale of paddy (procurement is already robust in Chhattisgarh & Odisha).

 

Attempt is to increase procurement of rice in these States so as to reach out to all farmers in various paddy growing districts of these States. The procurement target from the eastern states by the end of KMS 2019-20  is 155.93 Lakh MT. Presently, the figure stands at 53.65 LMT for KMS 2014-15.

Accordingly, FCI opened 635 procurement centres (including 401 with private support) in KMS 2015-16 and 722 (including 459 with private support) in KMS 2016-17 (as on 28.03.2017) comparison to only 141 in previous Season.  Total 61841 and 20063 (as on 28.03.2017) procurement centres have been opened in KMS 2015-16 and KMS 2016-17 respectively.

Due to these efforts of FCI, State agencies and private players, the procurement of rice has been increased to 70.70 LMT in KMS 2015-16 and 63.99 LMT in the ongoing KMS 2016-17.

Liquidation of Sugarcane Arrears

       

Sustained surplus production over domestic consumption in the past 5 sugar seasons had led to subdued sugar prices, which had stressed the liquidity position of the industry throughout the country leading to build up of cane price arrears. Due to the above, the peak cane price arrears for 2014-15 sugar season at all India level reached Rs.21837 crore as on 15.4.2015. To mitigate the situation, Government has taken the following measures:

 

-       Extended financial assistance of Rs.4305 crore under soft loan scheme, which were directly credited to farmers account on behalf of sugar mills through banks. About 32 lakh farmers have been benefited. Interest subvention of Rs. 425 crore has been released under the scheme.

 

-       Facilitated supply of ethanol under EBP programme by fixing remunerative price and waiving off excise duty on supply of ethanol during sugar season 2015-16 (up to 10th August, 2016).

 

-       A comprehensive performance based production subsidy has been extended @ Rs.4.50 per quintal of cane crushed payable to farmers against their cane dues contingent on mills undertaking export and supplying of ethanol. Under the scheme, an amount of Rs 525 Cr has been released so far.

 

                        Due to these measures, 99.33% of cane dues payments of farmers for 2014-15 sugar season and 98.21% for 2015-16 sugar season have been cleared.

 

Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) has achieved historical success as supplies of ethanol during the ethanol season 2015-16 have reached record level of more than 110 crore litre which has never been achieved earlier. During 2014-15 and 2013-14 seasons supplies were 68 crore litre and 37 crore litre respectively

 

Abolition of Levy System

In previous years, rice used to be also procured under levy system from the rice millers/dealers at prices announced separately for each State. Levy on rice is imposed by the State Governments in exercise of powers conferred on them by the Central Government under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. As direct purchase of paddy from the Farmers through the purchase centres opened by the Government Agencies is more beneficial to the farmers, the Government of India abolished levy system w.e.f. 01.10.2015 i.e. in KMS 2015-16.

Stabilization of prices of Pulses

For the first time, a buffer stock of up to 20 lakh MT of pulses has been created through the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) scheme of the Department of Consumer Affairs with the objective of managing price volatility of pulses for consumers.  As on 15.05.2017, a buffer of around 20 lakh Tonne of pulses has been built comprising 16.27 lakh Tonne of pulses procured from farmers domestically and 3.79 lakh Tonne of imported pulses so as to extend remunerative prices to farmers. Significant procurement of 14.71 lakh MT of pulses were undertaken during Kharif Marketing Season 2016-17 benefitting lakhs of farmers. Such efforts for improving availability by much higher production of pulses led to moderation in their prices benefiting consumers at large.

Consumer Protection Initiatives

National Consumer Helpline

A new Integrated Grievances Redressal Mechanism portal (INGRAM) (http:/consumerhelpline.gov.in) was launched in August,2016 to disseminate information to consumers and for lodging grievances online with facility to track status on real-time basis. This portal is available in both Hindi and English.

The Portal provides for registering grievances online 24x7. Consumers can lodge complaints through two all India Toll-free numbers, 1XXX-XX-4000 and also through a short code 14404, with the help of call centre agents or registering complaints online by accessing the portal. The portal receives around 40,000 grievances per month.

In order to make the consumer helpline efficient and reduce the waiting time, the number of Consumer Helpline agents has been increased from 14 to 60 in 2016 and will be increased to 120 shortly by setting up zonal consumer helpline (ZCH).

To ensure speedy disposal of grievances, the helpline has partnered with around 240 companies including major e-commerce, product and services companies (as convergence partners) whereby complaints received are forwarded online to them and monitored by helpline.

 

      Grievances Against Misleading Advertisement (GAMA)

In order to address the grievances pertaining to misleading advertisements, in March 2015 a portal “Grievances Against Misleading Advertisement (GAMA) was launched. Consumers can register complaints against false/misleading advertisements on this portal.

The GAMA portal is operated by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) under an MoU signed between ASCI and the Department for processing these complaints and advising self-regulation. Till date, a total of 3220 complaints have been registered on the GAMA Portal. Of these, 1683 complaints have been resolved and 750 complaints rejected. Remaining complaints have been escalated to the concerned line Ministry.

 

Other Digital Initiatives

An Online Consumer Mediation Centre (OCMC) for e-commerce complaints was launched in December, 2016 and is in the process of being operationalized. A mobile app named “Smart Consumer” has also been launched in December, 2016. This app helps the consumer to scan the bar code printed on any packaged commodity and thereby know the details of the product, company etc. and also to register a complaint.

 

 

 

The Department has tied up with a Social Media Network “Local Circles” to provide an electronic platform for consumers to discuss consumer related issues to generate awareness, get feedback and enable policy interventions where required. A microsite (https://goo.gl/8Xcyhu) was launched in December, 2016 in collaboration with “Google India” to educate consumers on internet and digital safety. FAQs on Internet Safety, Safe Financial Transactions and e-commerce are available in the microsite.

 

 

       Direct Selling

       With the intention of facilitating `Ease of doing business’, guidelines for direct selling were issued after detailed deliberations by an Inter-Ministerial Committee.  The guidelines are in the form of an Advisory to State Governments and provide transparency, ease to consumers and establishing a grievance redressal mechanism for consumers.

      Bureau of Indian standards (BIS) Act, 2016

         A new Bureau of Indian standards (BIS) Act, 2016 was notified on 22nd March, 2016, establishing the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as the National Standards Body of India. The Act contains provisions for including goods, services and systems, besides articles and processes for the purpose of standardization. It has enabling provisions for the Government to bring under compulsory certification regime any article, process or service which it considers necessary from point of view of health, safety, environment, prevention of deceptive practices, security etc. Enabling provisions have also been made for making hallmarking of the precious metal articles mandatory. The new Act also allows multiple type of simplified conformity assessment schemes including Self Declaration of Conformity (SDOC) against any standard which will give simplified options to manufacturers to adhere to the standards and get certificate of conformity. It enables the Central Government to appoint any authority, in addition to the BIS, to verify the conformity of products and services to a standard and issue certificate of conformity. Further, there is provision for repair or recall, including product liability of the products bearing Standard Mark but not conforming to the relevant Indian Standard.

       

       Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules

        For ease of doing business, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, were amended to give relaxation to affix a label on imported packages. An exemption was made for any thread which is sold in coil to handloom weavers in the interest of small weavers. To safeguard the interest of readymade garment industry, an advisory was issued that loose garments are not covered under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules.

    

 

        In order to safeguard the interest of the consumers, harmonization of the provisions of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules and Essential Commodities Act was done enabling the Government to fix the Retail Sale Price for Essential Commodities so that such essential commodities are sold at the fixed retail price and quantity in packaged form.

       

 

National Building Code

 

 After an extensive and laborious exercise for 2 years involving around 1000 experts under 22 Expert Panels, the Bureau of Indian Standards brought out state-of-the-art new version of the Building Code, namely, National Building Code of India 2016. The NBC 2016, with its vast coverage on accessibility, low income housing, rural and hill area habitat planning, structural safety of buildings in regions prone to natural disasters like earthquake etc. can prove to be of great socio-economic relevance including for Accessible India Campaign of the Government of India.  The provisions on use of new/innovative materials and technologies and on prefabricated construction techniques can give fillip to speedier construction to meet the objectives of Housing for All by 2022 as envisaged by the Government of India.  The provisions on information and communication enabled buildings will facilitate implementation of the vision areas of Digital India Campaign.

                NAFED, a National Level Cooperative Marketing Federation of India, has set a record of procurement of Pulses and Oilseeds during the year 2016-17. NAFED has emerged as the leading agency of the Government of India for undertaking procurement of Pulses and Oilseeds in the country. During the financial year just ended, it has achieved procurement of more than 8.76 Lakh MTs of Pulses (Gram 0.20 Lakh MTs, Masoor 0.03 Lakh MTs, Moong 1.29 Lakh MTs, Urad 0.59 MTs and Toor 6.65 Lakh MTs) and more than 2.20 Lakh MTs of Groundnut, Copra and other oilseeds and benefitted the farming community at large by providing them remunerative price for their produce and helping the country in creating buffer stocks and stabilizing the prices of Pulses and Oilseeds.

NAFED has also started disposal of the buffer stocks. A substantial quantity would be supplied to Para-military forces and Defence Sector and also State Government as per their requirements under PDS and other such schemes.

NAFED has undertaken procurement of various commodities to the tune of Rs 5916.00 Crore approximately in this year and earned tentative profit of Rs. 106.00 Crore before interest which is the highest in the last decade and helped turn around financially. The Federation has strongly positioned itself as the “Pulse Arm” of the Government.

During the current year also, procurement of Rabi Oilseeds and Pulses such as Mustard seeds, Sunflower seed, Gram, Masoor etc. has started and NAFED has already procured 2.95 Lakh MTs upto 30th April, 2017.

The Financial Package for NAFED is also under active consideration of the Govt. of India and it is likely that a CCEA note would be placed in May, 2017 for approval of the Cabinet.

Professor Renato Nazinni of Kings College, UK, said that disruptive technologies in the ICT arena require distinct approach while analyzing from antitrust and regulatory perspective. He was delivering the 2nd lecture in Distinguished Expert Lecture Series at Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs today. He was speaking on “Competition Policy and Online Platforms: Challenges and Opportunities”, a topic of contemporary policy interest in India. 

In his lecture, he provided comparative perspectives of European Union and USA in dealing with high-tech markets. Illustrating with the help of “low switching cost” for consumers and “multi-homing” in online markets, he underscored that “competitive process and innovation both need to be protected”. Through ‘error cost analysis’, he demonstrated that in antitrust cases, chilling effects on investments is exerted if the false prosecution takes place. Similarly, consumers are worse off if false acquittal of a company is allowed. He further elaborated that in the nascent online markets in India, “platform and product design” are central to success. Referring to objectives of competition law, through various recent case laws, he emphasized that the global consensus is now emerging to protect consumers and overall economic welfare. 

Director General & CEO, IICA, Shri Sunil Arora, who presided over the academic gathering, said that “digitization has now become a norm in the country, but has to go far beyond.” He further stated that “digitization can be further boosted by improving the literacy standards”. Referring to the large consumer base in India, he underlined in his closing remarks that “this is the biggest strength today in the country”. He also cautioned that “markets are not perfect” and therefore “require careful policy anchoring to achieve larger public policy goals”.

An exhibition “Return of the Three Stone Sculptures from Australia to India” has begun in National Museum, Janpath, New Delhi.  It has been organised to mark the safe return of three stone sculptures (Seated Buddha; Worshippers of Buddha; & Goddess Pratyangira) from Australia to India. These sculptures were purchased by National Gallery of Australia from the Nancy Wiener, New York in 2007 and Art of the Past, New York, 2005.

 

Minister of State (I/C) for Culture and Tourism Dr. Mahesh Sharma inaugurated the exhibition yesterday. He attended a special event at National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in Canberra, Australia in which Senator Mitch Fifield formally handed over three ancient artefacts stolen and smuggled out of India and inadvertently acquired by National Gallery of Australia.

 

Earlier, during the visit of Australian Prime Minister to India in September, 2014, the Australian government had also returned sculpture of ‘Dancing Shiva’.

 

This exhibition is important as it celebrates the return of rare heritage sculptures that were stolen from the country.

I.     The statue of Worshippers of the Buddha : (Satavahana, Ist Century  BCE to 2nd Century CE, Andhra Pradesh, South India, Lime Stone, size: 96.5x106.7x12.7cm).  This architecture piece adorning a stupa (possibly drum slab) is made of limestone. The panel depicts the worship of some of the Buddhist symbol (possibly chakrastambha or Bodhi tree but it is not visible as the piece is damaged at the top) kept on a throne, below which the Buddha-pada are visible. The central objects are flanked by worshipper couples on either sides in standing posture. On both the sides, male worshippers are represented first followed by the female worshippers. The most probable offering objects held in their hands are vases with flower or garlands. This sculpture was unearthed in 1970s during the excavation of a Buddhist stupa at Chandavaram (District, Prakasham) in Andhra Pradesh.

 



 

II.  Seated Buddha with large halo : (Kushan, 2nd century CE, Maholi, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh Spotted Red sand stone, size: 129.5x101.5x30.5cm). This image represents the Buddha seated cross legged (Padmasana) wearing ekansika sanghati (drapery covering one shoulder and arrayed with additional pleats). The transparent effect of the cloth is apparent through the conspicuous  marking of the navel. The image indicates that the right hand was raised in the abhaya mudra (protection pose) and the left rests on the thigh. The large halo with a scalped border (hasti nakha) emerges just above the waist. He is shown with an urna, pralamba karna (elongated ear-lobes), ushnisha and with a filing contemplation on his face.

 



 

III. Standing Pratyangira : (Chola, 13th Century CE, Tamil Nadu, South India Grey coloured granite stone, size: 125.1x55.9x30.5cm). In order to carry out his supreme task of preservation, Lord Vishnu took incarnation in the form of Narasimha in which he is represented by a human body and a lion’s head, who destroyed the demon kind Hiranykashipu, the personification of evil. The deity represented here is a tantric deity who is the female aspect of God Narasimha also known as Narasimhi. She is invoked in the Sadhanamala also. She is standing in pralambapadita pose, the face of a roaring and furious lion while the body is of a female. Flames are coming out of her head. However, the attributes tridents (trisula) and drum (damaru) in her right hands suggest her to be Pratyangira, a form of Bhairavi as per Saivite cult. The image was under worship in Vriddhachalam temple near Chennai before its theft.

                “Swachh Bharat App” has been launched in National Museum under Ministry of Culture by the Minister of State (I/C) for Culture & Tourism Dr. Mahesh Sharma yesterday. The main focus of this “Swachh Bharat App” is to basically involve people actively to become part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Movement). 

At present, this App is available for Android Mobile phones which can be downloaded from Google Play Store. In this App the concept of Physical web is implemented. When you are in the monument or Museum it will deliver you the message about Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and ask you to report the garbage around you. All you need is to enable the Bluetooth of your mobile device. Even if you did not have the App installed then also you will be delivered the message by Google about the Swachh Bharat Abiyan and which will give you the link to install the App. Once you start the App it will ask to take photograph of the garbage and write the comment and just submit. It will be reported to the authority on the backend. 

The App will be monitored by the Ministry of Culture and will play an important role in cultivating the significance of cleanliness to the citizens.

Ministry of Culture commemorated the “Thrice blessed day of Buddha’s Birth, Enlightenment and Mahaparinirvana”, falling on the auspicious Full moon day of Vaisakha in the presence of Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resources Development, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (I/C) for Culture and Tourism and Shri Kiran Rijuju, Minister of State for Home Affairs at a function here today.

 

On this auspicious occasion of Buddha Jayanti Celebration 2017, Ministry of Culture felicitated Prof. S.R. Bhatt, an eminent scholar of Buddhism who has made immense contribution to the preservation and promotion of Buddhism. Mangalacharan in Theravada tradition and chanting of Monks of Mahayana tradition was performed. Prof. Geshe Ngawang Samten delivered Buddha Updesh and Renowned dancer Shovana Narayan performed on the theme ‘Shunyata’.

Addressing on the occasion, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the teachings of Bhagwan Buddha are very popular worldwide and the Ministry of Human Resources Development is working on inculcating the teachings of Bhagwan Buddha in the text books as his teachings are still very relevant. He opined that the aim of imparting education should not only be confined to gaining knowledge and getting skilled for employment but should focus on preparing an ideal person also. He emphasized on improving the curriculum framework of NCERT textbooks.

 

Dr. Mahesh Sharma, in his address said that Buddhism has left a great impact on social and cultural life of our country and Bhagwan Buddha’s entire events of life took place in India. His three baskets, known as Tripitaka, contain the ethical discipline, the methods of training of mind and the ground and modes of the cultivation of wisdom. Seven out of Eight religious places associated with Bhagwan Buddha are situated in India. He emphasized that the Government of India is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of monuments, holy shrines and places of Buddhism in India to provide better facilities to pilgrims and tourists.

 

Shri Kiran Rijuju, in his address said that the entire World looks at India as to what India is doing for Buddhism. He opined that India can again become Super Power if it continues to follow the path shown by Bhagwan Buddha. He said that the Ministry of Home Affairs has taken an important step in easing the norms of e-visa for foreign tourists.

 

The Buddha Jayanti falls on the Vaisakha Purnima, that is, on the full moon day of the month of Vaisakha according to the Indian lunar calendar. This is the most important occasion for Buddhists celebrating the Gautama Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and Mahaparinirvana on the same day. In the first meeting of “World Fellowship of Buddhist” held at Colombo, Sri Lanka in May 1950, it was decided to commemorate Vaisakha Purnima as the Buddha’s thrice blessed day.

India is the origin of many world religions including the Buddhism. Buddha’s entire events of like took place in India. The advent of the Buddha Sakyamuni in 6th century BCE brought a radical reformation in the culture of philosophy and spirituality in the India. His teaching of Karuna, compassion, and Maitri, loving kindness, give an equal perspective towards all sentient beings including human beings within which no classes are allowed. With the philosophy of dependent origination and practice of non-violence rooted in love and compassion, Buddhism made immense contribution to the culture of peace.

Buddhism being an important heritage of India’s ancient glorious legacy, Indian government took various initiatives for the promotion of Buddhism. In 1956, Government of India organized the 2500th anniversary of Buddha’s Mahaparinirvana as international mega event.

Nava Nalanda Mahavihara was established in 1951 in Nalanda, Bihar  to  revive the ancient seat of learning in Nalanda. In 1959, Central Institute of Buddisht Studies was established in Leh, Laddhak. In 1968, Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies was established for the promotion of Buddhist and Tibetan studies. Central Institute of Himalayan Culture Studies, Dahung, Arunachal Pradesh was established in 2003. Again in 2010 Nalanda University was established at Rajgir to recreate the Ancient centre of Wisdom. These institutions have been productive in bringing publications of Tripitaka and restorations and translations of the lost works of the great masters of Ancient Nalanda and other high learning centres.

On regular basis the Government of India organises major events like international conference Baudha Mahotsava and Vaisakhapurnima, the day of the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana. The recent international conference in March organised at Rajgir was landmark event which was attended by scholars from 35 countries deliberating on various issues under the umbrella “Buddhist Response to the Crises of 21st Century”. This was inaugurated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and concluded by the President of India. This is one of the series of major events organised by Ministry of Culture under the leadership of Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Ministr for Culture and Tourism to promote Buddhism.

With profound spiritual and academic foundation, Buddhism has left a great impact on social and cultural life of India in the past. As India has enshrined the drama wheel of Buddhism on the national flag, the nation is dedicated to disseminate the Buddha’s message of compassion and loving kindness to develop a peaceful society and to enlighten the humanity.

                A two-day international Seminar with the theme ‘Building India’s Future Navy: Technology Imperatives’, organised by FICCI began here today with the top brass of the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Integrated Defence Staff, Ministry of Defence, DRDO, industry leaders from India and abroad, academia and thinkers coming together on a common platform to exchange ideas on realising the indigenous development cycle for cutting edge technologies that would be vital to building India’s future navy towards meeting the Government’s vision of ‘Make in India’.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Seminar, Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff and Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee stated that the Indian Navy has taken giant strides in the field of indigenous ship design and construction to transition from a ‘Buyer’s’ Navy to a ‘Builder’s’ Navy. Despite the achievements in indigenous shipbuilding, the Navy continues to be dependent on external assistance for niche technologies. An important aspect in attaining 100% self-reliance in ship design and construction, therefore, is the indigenous development of high end technologies, their transition into shipborne equipment and systems, induction into Service and standardization. Self-reliance in defence production, which is a vital pre-requisite for achieving greater strategic autonomy, is no easy task and would require dedicated efforts by researchers, designers and manufacturers. 

The Naval Chief brought out that the Indian Navy has taken the first step in this direction by formally articulating its indigenisation plans and need for the development of state-of-the-art systems and equipment through various policy and vision documents. This, along with initiatives like ‘Make in India’, would go a long way in building sustainable models for development of platforms and equipment requiring niche technologies.

Admiral Lanba highlighted the three primary requirements that need to be met while inducting a technology or a product – affordability, timely delivery and performance. To these primary imperatives, the Navy Chief went on to add a fourth dimension – that of life cycle sustenance by providing seamless technical support and making the technology future proof. He stated that this aspect is most vital for building a navy of the future and the support of the industry therefore extends well beyond just supply to lifecycle product support.

On the occasion, Admiral Lanba released two publications pertaining to compilation of papers authored by Naval officers on future technologies and a knowledge paper authored by FICCI. The Navy Chief also launched a web portal on Defence and Aerospace, developed by FICCI.

 The Seminar is structured around dedicated sessions to deliberate on Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured (IDDM) - Projects for the Indian Industry; Modern Trends in Maritime Communications; Cyberspace Operations and Information Warfare; Shipborne Propulsion and Power Generation; Missiles, Underwater and Directed Energy Weapons; Opportunities for Coastal States; Surveillance and Detection Systems; Transformation in the Aviation Sector; Autonomous Vehicles; Disruptive Technologies; Warship Building in India and Building India’s Future Navy: Realizing the ‘Make in India’ Initiative.

Also speaking on the occasion, Ms. Naina Lal Kidwai, Past President, FICCI and Chairperson, Max Financial Services Ltd, said that the Seminar would provide a platform to the industry captains to understand and deliberate on the technology imperatives for a future ready naval force. She asked the industry to articulate their vision on how they could partner the Indian Navy and the other Defence Forces in achieving the stated goal of self-reliance through indigenisation.

                Minister of Defence, Finance & Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley gave away Raksha Mantri’s Awards for Excellence for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 in recognition of exemplary performance amongst Ordnance Factories and the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) in New Delhi today.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jaitley said that India has conventionally depended for its defence preparedness on DPSUs, which have done an excellent job. Now the emphasis has to be to utilise its entire potential as a country to expand rapidly in defence production. Emphasising on the need for defence preparedness, particularly on the strength of domestic manufacturing, and as India evolves the need for this cannot be more overemphasised. 
The Defence Minister further said the policies therefore, are also being liberalised to allow a fair competition between both the DPSUs and the private sector and that is why the recent policy, which the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has approved on the Strategic Partners, factors in both these contents.

 

Shri Jaitley noted that no country can indefinitely win wars and battles only on the strength of trying to buy imported equipment from outside and said, “I think history has provided us with an opportunity where now our emphasis has to be to improve on manufacturing and that is why the Prime Minister gave this great emphasis on the ‘Make in India’ brand and manufacturing abilities would be incomplete for a country like India unless we improve on our defence manufacturing. Defence manufacturing is also impacted by the security requirements of a country and security requirements are dictated by the kind of neighbourhood you have, and obviously in view of the peculiar situation from a geopolitical point of view where we are located, our preparedness is the best deterrent and which is certainly a guarantee for peace as far as our region is concerned.”

                Lieutenant General Sarath Chand, Vice Chief of Army Staff delivered the Key Note Address on the International UN Peacekeeper's Day which is celebrated world over on 29 May to honour the fallen peacekeepers and to pay tribute to those who served or are still serving in UN peacekeeping missions. The theme for the 2017 International Day of UN Peacekeepers is “Investing in Peace Around the World”.

Mr Yuri Afanasiev, United Nations Resident Coordinator in India read out the UN Secretary General's message. He mentioned that, last year 117 peacekeepers laid their life in peacekeeping missions which includes two from India. The two fallen peacekeepers from India were Rifleman Brijesh Thapa who served with the United Nations Organization Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and Sepoy Ravi Kumar who was deployed with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) this year. A two minutes silence was observed to pay homage to the fallen peacekeepers.

 India is the largest cumulative troop contributor, having provided almost 200,000 troops in nearly 50 of the 71 peacekeeping missions mandated over the past six decades, including 13 of the current 16 missions. Speaking on the occasion the Vice Chief applauded the Indian UN Peacekeeping Contingents for their dedication, conduct and competence. He also spoke on the changing dynamics in peacekeeping in the present UN missions and the way forward to overcome the challenges.

  The event saw participation by diplomatic community, officers from ministries, veteran peacekeepers, UN Country Teams, students from prominent universities and Indian Army contingents earmarked for UN deployment which was supported by UN Information Centre in India (UNIC).

 To mark the occasion, Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS) and Centre for United Nations Peacekeeping (CUNPK) along with United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office organised a joint seminar on   “21st Century Roadmap for Conflict Resolution by the United Nations”. The seminar focused on the nature and character of emerging conflicts of the 21st century and measures in preventing & dealing with such conflicts under universal norms of justice & fair play and its impact on various aspects of conflict resolution such as preventive diplomacy, peace-making, peacekeeping and peace building.

                Kargil Martyrs’ Day is observed all across the country to honour the martyrs who had laid down their lives in defence of our country. In keeping with the glorious traditions of the IAF, four air warriors of Air Force Sarsawa too had attained Martyrdom on 28 May 99 during Kargil Operations. On that day, one MI-17 Helicopter of the base took off for a mission with Squadron Leader Rajiv Pundir as pilot, Flight Lieutenant S Muhilan as co-pilot, Sergeant PVNR Prasad as Flight gunner and Sergeant RK Sahu as Flight Engineer. While carrying out a rocket attack on Tiger Hill in the Kargil Sector, the helicopter was shot down by the enemy and these air warriors made the supreme sacrifice in keeping with the highest traditions of service. Since then, 28th May is observed as Martyrs’ Day every year at this Station to honour these brave air warriors. This year, on 28 May the Air Officer Commanding and all air warriors of Air Force Station Sarsawa paid tribute to these brave air warriors by placing floral tributes at the War Memorial to commemorate the 18th anniversary of their supreme sacrifice. At the same time, four helicopters of the base took off for ‘Missing Man Formation’ in the sky, thereby, remembering the martyrs and showing gratitude towards them. Further, in the evening, a candle lighting ceremony was also organized where all families of the Station gathered and paid homage to the war heroes by lighting candles at the Station War Memorial.

                General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff is on a four days visit to Myanmar from 28 to 31 May 2017.

Myanmar is an important neighbour with whom we have historical ties and traditional bonds of friendship and cooperation based on mutual trust and understanding. During the visit General Rawat will also visit National Defence College, Nay Pyi Taw and Defence Services Academy, Pwin Oo Lwin. General Rawat is likely to address student officers of National Defence College which is a premier institution grooming the future senior leadership of Myanmar Defence Services. This visit is yet another milestone to reach out to our neighbourhood in the field of defence cooperation and build upon existing mutual cooperation and trust between the two nations.

The Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley today inaugurated the newly built Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) of the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) at Chitradurga in Karnataka. Addressing a gathering of eminent scientists and other defence personnel on the occasion, the Defence Minister said facilities such as the ATR will help in creating conditions for research, which will in turn develop the type of human resource in the country required in the field of aeronautical testing. 

Complimenting the vital role of the DRDO towards self-reliance and promoting ‘Make in India’ efforts, Shri Jaitley said the development of the test range will cater to the needs of DRDO for testing of indigenously developed aeronautical systems. He said the facility would also contribute to the development of the region in which Chitradurga is located. 

The ATR is the first of its kind range in the country exclusively meant to conduct flight-tests of indigenous unmanned and manned aircrafts, developed by the DRDO including the naval and trainer versions of the Light Combat Aircraft, the unmanned air vehicles- Rustom-I and Rustom-II (Tapas); the Airborne Early Warning & Control Systems (AEW&C), Air-to-Ground weapons, parachutes and aerostats, etc. This outdoor testing and evaluating facility has been set up by the Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), one of the premier laboratories of the DRDO. 

Spread across 4,029 acres, the 28 kilometre perimeter strategic test range envisages a two kilometre runway besides other tracking and control equipment where a rail link to the facility has also been planned. The State-of-the-Art Range Control Centre (RCC) houses the Air Traffic Display System with remote control of Radar operations, ATC RF Voice communication system, Ground Telemetry system, Mission Video Distribution and Display System and Range Operational Communication System. The Radar centre houses Primary Radar and Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR). About 200 acres of land outside the technical area is earmarked for a township with a shopping complex, school, hospital and transit facility. 

The landmark event was attended by Shri S. Thippeswamy, MLA Molakalmuru and Shri Janardhana Swamy former MP, Chitradurga , Dr S. Christopher Chairman DRDO along with a large number of officers of the DRDO and the Armed Forces, civil administration and other invitees.

                At an impressive Passing out Parade (POP) held at Indian Naval Academy (INA), Ezhimala here today, Saturday, 27 May 2017, 272 cadets of Indian Navy, 66 cadets of Indian Coast Guard and two International cadets – one each from Benin and Tanzania – passed out of the hallowed portals of INA on successful completion of their training.     

 

 The passing out cadets belonged to four different courses of Spring Term 2017, viz., 92nd Indian Naval Academy Course (BTech), 92nd Indian Naval Academy Course (MSc), 23rd Naval Orientation Course (Extended) and 24th Naval Orientation Course (Regular).  Also graduating and marching shoulder to shoulder with their male counterparts were 25 female cadets from the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard. 

 

The grand parade was reviewed by Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, WV, RWP & Bar, RSP, USP, VSV, NDC, PSC, MNI, Chief of the Sri Lankan Navy.  The presence of the Sri Lankan Naval Chief marks a new chapter in consolidating strong bilateral naval relations between India and Sri Lanka and to explore new avenues for naval cooperation. Naval cooperation between India and Sri Lanka has been traditionally strong, encompassing a wide range of issues, including operational interactions through bilateral exercises, training, port calls, hydrographic co-operation, capability building and capacity augmentation initiatives. Two Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessels (AOPVs) are presently in their final stages of construction for the Sri Lankan Navy at M/s Goa Shipyard Limited. Indian Naval Ship (INS) Darshak, a survey ship, also recently successfully completed a two-month survey deployment off Sri Lanka.

 

Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne, following the ceremonial review, awarded medals to nine meritorious cadets. In his address, he congratulated the passing out cadets and urged them to constantly challenge their physical and mental limits to be a successful naval officer. Vice Admiral AR Karve, AVSM, Flag Officer Commanding–in–Chief, Southern Naval Command, Vice Admiral SV Bhokare, AVSM, YSM, NM, Commandant, INA, Prof. Anil D Sahasrabudhe, Chairman, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi and other senior officers were present on the momentous occasion.  The Passing Out Parade was also witnessed by the proud parents and guardians of all successful cadets, as well as by a large number of local and outstation dignitaries, media personnel, cadets of Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), Dehradun and school children.

 

The ‘President’s Gold Medal’ for the Indian Naval Academy  B Tech course was awarded to Midshipman Akshay Sarveswaran. The ‘Chief of the Naval Staff Gold Medal’ for the Naval Orientation (Extended) Course was awarded to Sub Lieutenant Arpan Mondal. The ‘Chief of the Naval Staff Gold Medal’ for the Naval Orientation (Regular) Course was awarded to Assistant Commandant Ravinder S Ramola.

 The glittering ceremony culminated with the successful cadets forming up in two columns and marching with their gleaming swords, held in salute, past the Academy’s Saluting Dias known as the Quarterdeck, in Slow March, to the traditional notes of ‘Auld Lang Syne’, the poignant farewell tune played by all Armed Forces around the world when bidding adieu to colleagues and comrades. As they marched past the sacred quarterdeck, the passing out cadets were bid farewell by cadets of the junior term who manned the mast.

 


 On completion of the parade, the ‘Shipping of Stripes’ ceremony was conducted.  The proud parents and guardians of the Passing Out cadets shipped the Naval and Coast Guard epaulettes, popularly known as ‘Stripes’ on the shoulders of their wards, thus symbolising their transformation from ‘cadets’ into commissioned Naval and Coast Guard officers.  The Reviewing Officer and other dignitaries shipped the stripes of the medal winners and congratulated all the trainees for their successful completion of the rigorous training.  These officers will now proceed to various Naval and Coast Guard ships / establishments, to further consolidate their training in various fields.

In pursuance of India’s ‘Act East Policy’, Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri, Shivalik, Jyoti and Kamorta under the command of Rear Admiral Biswajit Dasgupta, YSM, VSM, the Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet are on an overseas deployment to the South East Asia and Southern Indian Ocean. Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri and Kamorta are on a port visit to Jakarta from May 26 to May 30, 2017 and to Surabaya from June 01 to June 05. 

The visit of the Indian Naval Ships seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Indonesia. The two countries share a rich history with deep civilisational links between the two countries. A number of bilateral agreements exist between the two countries in a various spheres. The Indonesian President Joko Widodo had visited Indian in December 2016 and called on his counterpart, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Hon'ble Indian President and Shri Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. During the visit, the leaders had directed their respective ministers to convene the Defence Ministers’ Dialogue and the Joint Defence Cooperation Committee (JDCC) Meetings to review and upgrade the ‘Agreement on Cooperative Activities in the Fields of Defence’ to a substantive bilateral Defence Cooperation Agreement. The ‘Statement on Maritime Cooperation’ issued during the visit was one of the highlights. 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, as part of the Indian Government’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue, and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas. 

Over the past few decades, India has made substantial advances in terms of designing and building warships indigenously and the visiting ships bear testimony to these capabilities. INS Sahyadri, and INS Shivalik both multi-role stealth frigates rare commanded by Captain Anil Jaggi and Captain R Vinod Kumar respectively while INS Kamorta, an Anti-Submarine Warfare Corvette is commanded by Commander Vipin Gupta. INS Jyoti, the fleet replenishment tanker is commanded by Captain S Shyam Sundar. 

During the stay in harbour, various activities such as official calls, formal reception on board ships, ships open to visitors, guided tours for Indian naval personnel and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations have been planned.

The wreckage of IAF Su-30 MKI jet that went missing with two pilots onboard has been found in the thick forest around 60 Kms from Tezpur, Assam where it lost radar contact with the base. The wreckage was located today and ground parties are standing by to be airlifted to the crash site as the area is totally inaccessible. Search for flight data recorder and missing crew will be perused by the ground parties after they reach the crash site. Search parties of Army are also attempting to reach the crash site by trekking cross country, however their progress is hampered due to inclement weather, thick vegetation and steep gradient of the terrain.

The Su-30 aircraft took off around 1030 h on 23 May 17 and had gone off the radar and lost radio contact around 1110 h when aircraft was around 60 Kms from Tezpur. The aircraft was on a routine training mission as part of a two aircraft formation.

The aircraft was declared overdue and Search and Rescue operations were launched to locate the aircraft and the pilots. Help from civil administration and military authorities was also sought to locate the aircraft. Aerial search was commenced based on the last known position of the Su-30 MKI. Incessant rain and dense clouds hampered the search operations in air and on the ground. Search parties of IAF and Army set out to the area where the aircraft was declared missing. A court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the accident.

                The NCC Girls Expedition to Mt Ladakhi (5345m) was flagged-off by Director General, National Cadets Corps (NCC) Lt Gen Vinod Vashisht from HQ DG NCC, New Delhi on 19 May 2017. 

The team is being led by Col Shamsher Singh and Wg Cdr Sendhil Kumar. The expedition will be going to Mt Ladakhi Peak (5345m) in general area Beas Kund ahead of Manali, Himchal Pradesh and will be training at Solang under guidance of ABVIMAS, Manali, Himachal Pradesh. The expedition contains twenty girls from various parts of the country.

Mt Ladakhi is a snow clad peak perched at an altitude of 5345m in the Pir Panjal ranges in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. The merger of Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges which enhances the beauty of the Beas Kund basin is in the near vicinity. Ladakhi Peak is technically a challenging peak which would require all the mountaineering skill and expertise for a successful attempt. Pre expedition preparation like use of mountaineering equipment and walking on snow and ice is a must for success of the expedition.

The expedition will help imbibe the qualities of courage, comradeship, discipline, leadership and a spirit of adventure amongst the NCC cadets.

The Government is working towards progressively reducing dependency on foreign manufacturers and developing the defence capabilities indigenously. This was informed by Minister of State for Defence Dr Subhash Bhamre while addressing a seminar, jointly organised by the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), here today. 

Dr Bhamre further said, “We have included a new procurement category called the Buy Indian – IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured) category in the DPP [Defence Procurement Procedure]. This would be the most preferred category for procurement and it is expected to promote indigenously designed products and bring significant investment in defence R&D.” 

Speaking of partnership with defence industry, Dr Bhamre informed that “The Government of India has been working on formulating a ‘Strategic Partnership’ model for creating capacity in the private industry on a long term basis.” The Government had constituted a task force with experts from various fields to recommend criteria and prescribe methodology for selection of Strategic Partners. The report submitted by the task force has been examined at length and Government shall be issuing the policy for selection of strategic partners shortly. 

Alleviating concerns of the industry, the Minister said, the exchange rate variation protection has been made applicable for the Indian private sector at par with public sector undertakings for all categories of capital acquisitions. The preferential treatment given to DPSUs in excise duty/custom duty has been discontinued, as per the revised policy; all Indian industries (public and private) are subject to the same kind of exercise and custom duty levies. This would ensure a level playing field between the private and public sector. Another step that the Government has taken is to remove the custom duty exemption on import of defence equipment to encourage ‘Make in India’. 

Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa, while giving keynote address, said, “The modernisation plan of the IAF is being pursued with an aim to give impetus to ‘Make in India’ and to beef up the defence manufacturing base. We in IAF are keen to see that ‘Make in India’ initiative gets converted to a reality.” 

Speaking about self-reliance the Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa said, a high degree of indigenisation has been achieved in the field of radars and all the radars planned for induction in future are from Indian firms. The IAF is completely self-reliant in the field of software applications and a number of projects are functioning successfully on software developed by Indian firms. 

The CII National Defence Committee member, Shri Pratyush Kumar also addressed the gathering. Senior officials of Ministry of Defence and the IAF were present at the seminar.

                The 3rd Defence – ITTA (Indian Technical Textile Association) Joint Seminar cum Exhibition was inaugurated by Smt Smriti Zubin Irani, Hon’ble Minister of Textiles, Govt of India, on 22 May at Manekshaw Centre, New Delhi. Gen Bipin Rawat, the Army Chief and senior officials from the Defence Services, MoD, MHA and Industry were present at the function.

 

The seminar is being conducted over 22 & 23 May and will include topics related to developments in personal and protective clothing as also building, medical and geo textiles. Items like Special Snow Socks, HAPO Chambers, Snow Goggles, Thermal Insoles and Ruck Sacks being used in Siachen Glacier and other super high altitude areas which were being imported till recently will now be manufactured in India of matching quality and at a much cheaper price.

 

The Hon’ble Minister of Textiles highlighted the need for exploiting the advanced R&D facilities for improving the existing inventory of the Army. While assuring all assistance from her Ministry, she reiterated the need for the industry to explore various business models and joint ventures. She said that there is a distinction between ‘supplying’ and ‘serving’ and the industry should strive to ‘serve our defence forces’. She also highlighted the scope of NTC (National Technical Cooperation) supplying their vast product range to the Army.

 

Gen Bipin Rawat reiterated that joint initiatives between the Textile Ministry, MoD and industry assume great significance given the fact that many of the principal items of Ordnance Equipment Factory (OEF) are going to be offered to the Trade on a permanent basis over the next 3 to 5 years. He highlighted that the Government is supporting the industry and the onus is on the Defence forces to take the advantage of the same.

 

Lt Gen RR Nimbhorkar, Master General of Ordnance (MGO) apprised the delegates of specific areas where improvements were needed. He urged the industry for early indigenisation of the three layered Special Suits, Sleeping Bags, Boot Mufti-Purpose and Modular Gloves that are being used in the super high altitude areas besides products improvement for Extreme Cold Clothing (ECC), Mattress Kapok, Face Mask, etc. The MGO reiterated that the industry has a lot of scope for participating in the Rs 3000 crore General Stores and Clothing requirements.

 

From the Industry side, Mr Pramod Khosla, Chairman ITTA and         Dr KS Sundararajan, Vice Chairman, ITTA assured the Army officials of constant support. Exhibitions stalls from various Business Houses dealing with technical textiles and Army’s present clothing and general stores inventory were laid for the delegates to see.

Breaking new ground, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Defence, Shri Arun Jaitley, today finalised the broad contours of a policy aimed at engaging the Indian private sector in the manufacture of high-tech defence equipment in India.  The policy is aimed at developing the defence industrial eco-system in the country through the involvement of both the major Indian corporates as well as the MSME sector.

 

The policy, which was developed through extensive stakeholder consultations with Indian industry, envisages the establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with qualified Indian industry majors through a transparent and competitive process wherein the Indian industry partners would tie up with global OEMs to seek technology transfers and manufacturing know-how to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains.  The policy will give a boost to the ‘Make in India’ policy in the Defence sector and set Indian industry on the path to acquiring cutting-edge capabilities which will contribute to the building of self-reliance in the vital sector of national security requirements.

 

The policy is expected to be implemented in a few selected segments to begin with, namely, fighter aircraft, submarines and armoured vehicles.  In future, additional segments may be added.  Appropriate institutional mechanisms will be set in place to implement the policy.

                INS Sharda is deployed for anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden since 06 Apr 17. On 16 May 17, at about 1645 hrs, the ship received a distress call from MV Lord Mountbatten (a Liberian registered ship), in position 230 nm South-West of Salalah (in the Gulf of Aden). The vessel had reported an incident of attempted piracy by two suspicious mother vessels alongwith 7-8 skiffs. Sharda, which was at that time 30 Nm East of the reported position, immediately responded to the distress call and proceeded at best speed to investigate the incident. 

On arriving in the area by about 1900 hrs, Sharda detected two dhows alongwith eight skiffs in vicinity, three of which fled the area at high speeds on sighting the warship. Indian Navy’s MARCOS, with support of the armed helicopter from the ship investigated the dhows and their skiffs by conducting board and search operations. The absence of any fishing gear onboard the two dhows/ remaining five skiffs indicated malicious intent and possible piracy-linked intentions. One high calibre AKM rifle alongwith one filled magazine (28 rounds) was found hidden onboard one of the dhows. The weapon and ammunition has been confiscated to prevent future illegal misuse.

                As part of the Indian Navy’s overseas deployment to the West Coast of Africa  and the Mediterranean Sea, three Indian warships, INS Mumbai, INS Trishul and INS Aditya, arrived at Jeddah today (16 May 17) for a three-day visit. The warships will engage extensively with the Saudi Arabian Navy during their stay in the country. Apart from professional interactions, sports and social engagements are also planned, which would go a long way in enhancing co-operation and understanding between these important navies of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

 

The visiting ships, headed by Rear Admiral RB Pandit, the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet (FOCWF), who is flying his flag on the guided missile destroyer INS Mumbai, are part of the Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command and are based at Mumbai. 

 

India and Saudi Arabia enjoy cordial and friendly relations, reflecting centuries old economic and socio-cultural ties. Bilateral trade between the countries has shown remarkable growth and has registered a three-fold increase in the last five years. The 1.8 million–strong Indian community in Saudi-Arabia is the largest expatriate community in the Kingdom and is the ‘most preferred community’ due to their expertise, sense of discipline, and law abiding nature. The Haj pilgrimage is another important component of the bilateral relations with over 1,65,000 Indians performing Haj every year.

 

Building upon the rich and longstanding relations that have existed between India and Saudi Arabia, both nations have developed warm relations in several spheres. The current visit seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries of the Indian Ocean and, in particular, to strengthen the existing bonds between India and Saudi Arabia. 

 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region, including piracy off the coast of Somalia. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with Hydrographic Survey, Search and Rescue and other such capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment into the Mediterranean will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate Inter Operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chief of the Naval Staff, is on an official tour to Singapore from 15 May 2017. The Admiral will be attending the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) 50 International Maritime Review (IMR), commemorating 50 years of the RSN which was formed on 05 May 1967, and International Maritime Defence Exhibition and Conference (IMDEX) 2017. Besides attending the IMR and IMDEX 17, the visit aims to consolidate existing Maritime Cooperation initiatives as well as explore new avenues.

Defence cooperation between India and Singapore is robust and is primarily focused towards Maritime Cooperation. India signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement in 2003, which was renewed in 2015.

Indian Navy and Singapore Navy are partners in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), a Maritime Cooperation construct, conceptualised and pioneered by Indian Navy in 2008. Singapore Navy has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Indian Navy to take this 21st century maritime construct forward. Both countries have been conducting the bilateral exercise ‘SIMBEX’ since 1994. The next edition of the exercise is scheduled to be conducted off Singapore from 18 to 24 May 2017.

Both navies also engage in Navy to Navy Staff Talks, which commenced in 2004. The 12thStaff Talks were conducted in March 2017 and the 13th Staff Talks are scheduled to be held in 2018.   

The Singapore Navy has participated in all the MILAN-series interactions organised at Port Blair by the Indian Navy. Warships of both countries regularly visit each other’s ports.

The last visit by the Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy was by Admiral RK Dhowan in 2015 and the Singaporean Naval Chief Rear Admiral Lai Chung Han last visited India in Feb 2016 for the IFR 16 at Visakhapatnam. Both countries also enjoy healthy training cooperation by means of trainee and instructor exchange programmes. 

India - Singapore share similar maritime challenges such as coastal security, large coastal shipping and fishing fleet, wherein both navies have opportunities to learn from each other’s experiences. In addition, ground exists for cooperation on a number of issues common to both navies.

 

During the visit, Admiral Sunil Lanba is scheduled to hold discussions with the Defence Minister of Singapore, the Chief of Defence Forces, Singapore and the Chief of Singaporean Navy, besides having bilateral talks with a number of Chiefs of other Navies attending the event at Singapore.

                In pursuance of India’s ‘Act East Policy’, Indian Naval Ships Shivalik and Jyoti are on an overseas deployment to the South East Asia and Southern Indian Ocean. The ships would be on a port visit to Kuantan from May 14 to May 19, 2017. 

The visit of the Indian Naval Ships seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Malaysia. The two countries share a rich history and a strategic relationship. A number of bilateral agreements exist between the two countries in a various spheres. 

During the stay in harbour, various activities such as official calls, formal reception on board ships, ships open to visitors, guided tours for Indian naval personnel and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations have been planned. In April this year, Prime Minister, Najib Razak visited India and called on the Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for bilateral talks and enhance the partnership between the two countries. In July last year, Admiral Tan Sri Ahmad Kamarulazaman, the Chief of Royal Malaysia Navy visited India to strengthen the bilateral ties between the two navies which have witnessed a steady rise in their cooperation. INS Kora, an indigenously built corvette had recently participated in LIMA-17. 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, as part of the Indian Government’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue, and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas. 

Over the past few decades, India has made substantial advances in terms of designing and building warships indigenously and the visiting ships bear testimony to these capabilities. INS Shivalik, a multi-role stealth frigate is commanded by Captain R Vinod Kumar while INS Jyoti, the fleet replenishment tanker is commanded by Captain S Shyam Sundar.

Tejas, the Light Combat Aircraft today successfully demonstrated an Air-to-Air Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile firing capability by releasing Derby Air-to-Air BVR missile in RADAR guided mode. The missile launch was performed in Lock ON after Launch mode for a BVR target in the look down mode and the target was destroyed. 

The objective of the test was to assess the Derby integration with aircraft systems on-board Tejas including the aircraft avionics, fire-control radar, launchers and Missile Weapon Delivery System and to verify its performance. 

The test was conducted on a Manoeuvrable Aerial Target at the Interim Test Range (ITR), Chandipur. The sensors at ITR also tracked the target and missile. 

A safe separation was followed by missile guidance towards RADAR acquired target. The flawless launch was demonstrated with all on-board systems performing satisfactorily and the missile scored a direct hit on the target with complete destruction of it. 

The test firing achieved all its planned objectives. The Derby firing is a major step towards clearing BVR capabilities on LCA aircraft for FOC.

In pursuance of India’s Act East policy, Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri, Shivalik, Jyoti and Kamorta are on an Overseas Deployment to the South East Asia and Southern Indian Ocean under the command of Rear Admiral Biswajit Dasgupta, YSM, VSM, the Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet. 

Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri and Kamorta are on a port visit to Singapore from May 12 to May 21, 2017 during which the ships will participate in the International Maritime Review and lMDEX-17. Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, the Chief of Naval Staff, Indian Navy would also be attending the events ashore. During the port visit, various calls by the visiting Fleet would be organised in addition to those scheduled as part of IMR and IMDEX-17. Thereafter the four Indian Naval Ships and an Indian Navy Long Range Maritime Patrol and Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft P-8l would exercise with the RSN and RSAF as part of SIMBEX-17. Held since 1994, this year would be the 24th edition of the annual maritime bilateral exercise between the two countries which aims to further cement the defence cooperation between the two countries. 

The two countries share a rich history and a strategic relationship. A number of bilateral agreements exist between the two countries in various spheres. The visit of the Indian Naval Ships seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain. Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, as part of the Indian Government’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue, and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas. 

Over the past few decades, India has made substantial advances in terms of designing and building warships indigenously and the visiting ships bear testimony to these capabilities. INS Sahyadri, a multi-role stealth frigate is commanded by Captain Anil Jaggi while INS Kamorta, an Anti-Submarine Warfare Corvette is commanded by Commander Vipin Gupta. Both ships are indigenously designed and built. During the stay in harbour, various activities such as official calls, formal reception on board ships, ships open to visitors, guided tours for Indian naval personnel and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations have been planned. The last visit by an Indian Naval Ship to Singapore was by INS Satpura in September 2016.

Minister of Defence, Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley, accompanied by senior MoD officials, held consultations with representatives of chambers of commerce and industry on the proposed Strategic Partnership model here today. 

The Ministry is working towards institutionalising a transparent, objective and functional mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ framework.

The proposed strategic partner model is intended to enhance competition, increase efficiencies, facilitate faster and more significant absorption of technology, create a tiered industrial ecosystem, ensure development of a wider skill base, trigger innovation and enable participation in global value chains as well as promote exports. This would gradually ensure greater self-reliance and dependability of supplies essential to meet national security objectives.

Industry representatives welcomed efforts of the Ministry to put in place such a framework and offered several positive and constructive suggestions. The Ministry has taken due note of these proposals, which would be considered while finalising the policy in this regard.

The 29th series of India–Indonesia CORPAT is scheduled from 09 – 25 May 17 with the opening ceremony being conducted from 09 -12 May 17 at Port Blair under the aegis of Andaman and Nicobar Command. The Indonesian Naval Ship KRI Sutedi Senoputra has arrived at Haddo Wharf, Port Blair to mark the commencement of the 29th series of IND–INDO CORPAT today. An Indonesian Maritime Patrol Aircraft also flew in with the Indonesian Naval delegation led by First Admiral Bambang Irwanto to INS Utkrosh, Port Blair. First Admiral Bambang Irwanto called on Maj Gen PS Sai, Chief of Staff, Andaman and Nicobar Command and the delegation also interacted with Commodore Ashutosh Ridhorkar, the Naval Component Commander. 

Apart from securing the trade sea route, the Coordinated Patrol also serves to enhance mutual understanding and inter–operability between the two navies. The CORPAT thus reflects the shared concerns between the two countries for a peaceful Indian Ocean for the benefit of international community. 

During the stay at Port Blair from 09 – 12 May 17, the visiting crew shall be engaged in interactions at various strata, including sports fixtures, ship visits, professional interactions and visits to places of historical and tourist interests. The closing ceremony of the CORPAT is scheduled at Belawan, Indonesia from 22 – 25 May 17. 

The close defence relations between India and Indonesia have been growing steadily with regular joint activities and exchanges of personnel between the Armed Forces of the two countries. Under the broad ambit of this strategic partnership, Indonesian Navy (TNI AL) and the Indian Navy have been carrying out coordinated patrolling twice a year since 2002 near the International Maritime Boundary Line to keep this part of the Indian Ocean region safe and secure for commercial shipping and international trade.

                As part of the Indian Navy’s overseas deployment (OSD) to the Mediterranean Sea and the West Coast of Africa, two Indian warships, INS Mumbai and INS Aditya, arrived at Alexandria on 05 May 17 for a three-day visit. The warships will engage extensively with the Egyptian Navy during their stay in harbour. Apart from professional interactions, a number of sports and social engagements are also planned, which would go a long way in enhancing co-operation and understanding between these two important and capable navies.

 

India and Egypt are two of the world’s most ancient civilizations with a rich history of close contact. Building upon the rich and longstanding relations that have existed between India and Egypt, both nations have developed warm relations in several spheres. Training co-operation between the two militaries exist at the highest levels. One such significant milestone in defence cooperation was the training of Egyptian pilots by Indian Air Force pilots and the joint venture to manufacture the famous Helwan 300 fighter jet. The setting up of the Indo-Egypt Joint Defence Committee (JDC) in 2006 was another significant step in strengthening the relations between the two nations. A number of such bilateral agreements for defence co-operation and cultural exchanges exist between the two nations, many of which were signed during the Presidential visit to India in 2013. Trade between India and Egypt remains vibrant with many Indian corporate houses having strong interests in Egypt.

 

With governments of both countries keen on sustaining strong diplomatic ties, the current visit seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries and, in particular, to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship between India and Egypt.

 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region, including piracy off the coast of Somalia. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with Hydrographic Survey, Search and Rescue and other such capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment into the Mediterranean will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate Inter Operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas.

 

Over the last few decades India has made substantial advances in terms of designing and building warships indigenously and the visiting ships bear testimony to these capabilities. INS Mumbai  and Aditya have been designed by the design bureau of the Indian Navy and constructed at Indian shipyards, namely, the Mazagon Dockyard Limited (in Mumbai), and, the Garden Reach Ship Builders and Engineers Limited (in Kolkata). The destroyer Mumbai is equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors.

 

 

The visiting ships are part of the Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command and are based in Mumbai. The Task Group is headed by Rear Admiral RB Pandit, the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet, who is flying his flag on the guided missile destroyer, INS Mumbai.

  South Western Command’s Corps ‘Strike One’ successfully carried out the firing of the advanced BRAHMOS Block III land attack cruise missile system in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands on the 3rd of May 2017 for the second consecutive day. The successive launches reinforce the formidable weapon’s precision strike capability. The long-range tactical weapon was successfully tested from the same location on the 2nd of May, 2017.

 

 

            These successful firings of the supersonic cruise missile were carried out in full operational land-to-land configurations from Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL) at its full-range. Meeting all flight parameters in a copybook manner while conducting high level and complex manoeuvers, the multi-role missile successfully hit the land-based target with desired precision, in both the trials demonstrating its accuracy of less than one metre.

 

 



            This is the fifth consecutive time when the Block-III version of BRAHMOS LACM has been successfully launched and hit the land-based target in “top-attack” mode, an incredible feat not achieved by any other weapon system of its genre. Indian Army, which became the first land force in the world to deploy the BRAHMOS in 2007, has raised several regiments of this formidable weapon. Jointly developed by India’s DRDO and Russia’s NPOM, the multi-platform, multi-mission BRAHMOS is capable of being launched from land, sea, sub-sea and air against surface and sea-based targets.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has proposed PPP (Public-Private Participation) model to supplement and extend healthcare services up to district level in the eight States of the North-Eastern Region (NER).

Dr Jitendra Singh was presiding over a Conclave of Health Ministers from all the eight North-Eastern States in Guwahati today. The meeting, among others, was also attended by representatives from the premier Adayar Cancer Institute, Chennai, Patanjali and Yog Sansthan Bengaluru.

Giving a resume of the last three years of health related initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of DoNER, Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that Dr Barooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati has been affiliated with the Tata Memorial Cancer Centre, Mumbai, since last year under the aegis of Department of Atomic Energy, as a result of which, the faculty and the supplementary teaching cum clinical services will get upgraded. From last year, he said, super-specialty MCh course in Cancer Surgery has already started and hopefully from this session, super-specialty DM Cancer Medicine will also start.

Dr Jitendra Singh acknowledged the collaboration from Adayar Cancer Institute, Chennai in imparting a 6-month training to one Physician and one Surgeon each from each of the eight North-Eastern States, so that they can go back and offer better healthcare in their respective States, considering the high prevalence of cancer in the region.

Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Ministry of DoNER, with the consensus of all the State Governments, will go forward in inviting the interested private healthcare partners from other parts of the country, so that depending upon their capacity and capability, they may be able to supplement the health services in the region. The impetus to healthcare services, he said, will be wholesome and holistic, thus also imbibing all the alternative systems of medicine and in this regard, the leading players like Patanjali could have a significant contribution to make.

Referring to a proposal from the Assam Government for setting up a modern Cancer Hospital with the collaboration of the Ministry of DoNER, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the officers in the DoNER Ministry are engaged in deliberations with the State Health Secretariat officers to work out its feasibility and viability.

In the field of tele-medicine also, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Ministry of DoNER will try to facilitate support and help from private sector so that the people living in the remotest areas of the difficult terrain are not deprived of the benefit of specialized medical consultation.

Referring to a suggestion which originated after discussion with the Government of Manipur, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the concept of having “Air Clinics” with helicopter-based outdoor facility has been mooted with both the Ministry of Health as well as the Ministry of Civil Aviation. If successful, he said, this could be a boon for a large section of population which has no access to health centre or medical clinician.

Dr Jitendra Singh also disclosed that considering the proactive approach of the DoNER Ministry and the high priority accorded to Northeast by the Central Government, a number of private corporate sector hospital chains are coming forward to venture in the Northeast. He said, he would seek the help of Ministry of Health and other related Ministries to consider these cases on the principle of mutual benefit.

The meeting was coordinated by Health Minister of Assam, Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma and the Health Ministers from the other States also offered their inputs. It was decided to carry forward this initiative through regular deliberations at the level of the officers of the Ministry of DoNER and those of the Health Departments of the different States as well as the representatives of private sector.

                The Chairman, North Eastern Council (NEC) and Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh chaired the 66th Plenary of North Eastern Council here today. 

During the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had attended the last plenary meeting at Shillong in May, 2016 and set in motion a new development agenda for the North Eastern Region. He said that, we are all committed to implement the Prime Minister’s vision for the North East. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted some of the major achievements of the NEC. He said, NEC has put maximum emphasis on the Transport and Communication Sector with the construction of 10,500 kms of roads including inter-state and roads of economic importance. He said that a new scheme named, North East Road Sector Development Scheme (NERSDS) has been launched to take up all strategically important but hitherto neglected roads/ bridges. Three (3) projects under the scheme (Doimukh-Harmuti; Tura-Mankachar & Wokha-Merapani,-Golaghat) for 85 kms has been already awarded to National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) for implementation at an estimated cost of Rs 213.97 crores, he added. Dr. Jitendra Singh said that 14 projects have been identified to be taken up under NERSDS during 2017-18. 

He said that, to promote air connectivity in the region, NEC has supported Airports Authority of India (AAI) for upgrdation of infrastructure in 12 operational airports. He said that the construction of Tezu airport in Arunachal Pradesh is supported by NEC and is likely to be operational within the current financial year. He said that NEC is also taking up the runway extension in the Umroi (Shillong) airport to enable bigger aircrafts to land and three (3) numbers of hangars at LGBI Airport in Guwahati has been completed under NEC funding. 

The Minister said that NEC has also contributed to the development of Power Sector. He said that during 2016-17, NEC has funded construction of 198 circuit km long transmission lines of 165 MVA capacity in the NER and eleven (11) power sector projects (Manipur-2; Meghalaya-1; Mizoram-1; Nagaland-2; Sikkim-4; Tripura-1) were completed and commissioned. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh said that, for promoting livelihoods, NEC has been a pioneer in implementing community resource management with a bottoms-up approach. He said that the North Eastern Regional Community Resource Management Projects (NERCORMP), is being implemented in 11 most difficult and remote hill districts of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya through participating planning. There is proposal for extending the projects into more districts in the region in the Phase-IV of the project, he added. 

The Minister said that NEC has supported another noteworthy initiative of construction of wayside amenities as part of Prime Minister Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) on approved Tourist circuit falling under NERCORMP projects area in Ukhrul, Chandel and Senapati districts of Manipur. 

Dr. Jitendra Singh said that, to promote tourism in NER, North East Tourism Development Council (NETDC) has been formed by the NEC with the initial subscription from the private sector. He said that NEC would continue to support creation of tourism infrastructure, especially in areas not being covered by Ministry of Tourism. 

The Minister said that, NEC has contributed immensely to the Agriculture Sector, Irrigation and Flood Control. He said that, NEC would be providing assistance to Aggregator Agencies for Agri-Horti Produce to help Farmers in the North East Region by extending finance to them as grants-in-aid. NEC is also supporting NERAMAC for obtaining Geographical Indication (GI) registration of various unique and indigenous horticulture products of the region, he added. 

Under the Health Sector, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that NEC is providing support for Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati, which is in the process of being taken over by the Department of Atomic Energy, through which this hospital would be developed on the model of Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, as a Premier Post Graduate level institute for cancer treatment in the country. 

Under Science & Technology Sector, he said that a special thrust has been given towards establishment of North Eastern Spatial Data Repository (NESDR) by the North East Space Application Centre (NESAC) for facilitating communication linkage, data cataloguing between Regional node of NESAC and State nodes of different State Remote Sensing and Application Centres (SRACs) of NER. He said that, for proper monitoring of all projects sponsored by North Eastern Council Secretariat, Geo-tagging and uploading of projects' images in the public domain has been proposed in collaboration with NESAC. 

The Minister said that, during the year 2016-17, NEC was allotted Rs. 800 crore at BE stage and at the RE stage it was enhanced to Rs. 968.79 crore plus Rs. 150 crore for NERSDS making a total of Rs. 1118.79 crore. Depending on the legitimate demand of the North Eastern States based on the Regional Plans approved by the Council, NEC would strive to allocate more liberal grant of resources in the coming years, he added. 

During the day, the members discussed the NEC budget for the current financial year, conversion of NEC schemes to Central Sector schemes, issues concerning tourism in the North East, promotion of textiles with special emphasis on handlooms, handicrafts and apparel, agricultural marketing, organic farming, horticulture and bamboo mission, food processing activities and documentation, preservation and promotion of medicinal plants in the NER.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, made a visit to the recently launched North East Organic Showroom-cum-Restaurant situated at Dilli Haat, INA, here today.

The Showroom-cum-Restaurant is managed by theNorth Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation Limited, NERAMAC Ltd., a CPSE under MDoNER in its flagship brand, “ONE” (Organic North East).  The initiative has also been supported by a mission for NER by both Ministry of DoNER and Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Govt. of India.

 Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh said, NERAMAC has always worked towards promoting Agri-Horticulture produce of North East Region. It has played a key role in socio-economic development of Farmers and small Agri-preneurs of NER by undertaking various activities in the region. People in other parts of the country are yet to be introduced to the rich and healthy organic produce of the North-Eastern Region and once this happens, they would spontaneously come looking for it. This will not only give a boost to trade and business, but also help in enhancing Farmer’s income of NER, he added.

 Dr. Jitendra Singh further said that in the absence of organised ‘Mandis’ in most parts of the North East, one of the priority activities of NERAMAC should be to act as a Lead Aggregator of agri-horti produce in NER, particularly when 80-82 per cent of the Agri-horti produce from the region happens to be organic in nature. NERAMAC is committed in giving market linkages to the farmers and Agri-peneurs  of NER, which has been the major obstacle in the socio- economic development of the farmers of region, he added.

 

The North East Organic Showroom-cum-Restaurant at Dilli Haat will showcase exotic and healthy products from all the eight states of North East Region, where people can purchase goods directly at the best price available. The concept of such showroom is to promote healthy food available from NER for increasing health conscious population of the country.

 Dr. Singh also said, “The showroom gives a great platform for Entrepreneurs, Agri-preneurs & Farmers of North East who can showcase and sell their organic produce. We are confident that organic food processors & farmers of North East will benefit from this outlet. With the new brand ONE (Organic North East), all the North Eastern farmers come under one common brand and this increases their bargaining power to a great extent to get premium rates. The outlet will not only help the Farmers and Food Processors of North East to increase their income but also promote the culture and traditions of North East and boost tourism.""

 The showroom-cum-restaurant at Dilli Haat is just the start. DoNER Ministry also supports that the project will expand in entire Delhi NCR and all other major metros like Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore on franchise basis.

The Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER) will make suitable arrangements for showcasing the Northeast organic products outside, in the rest of India. An initiative in this direction has already begun with the opening up, recently, of a Showroom-cum-Restaurant bearing a common brand name “ONE” (Organic North East) at Dilli Haat in New Delhi. This was stated by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh while chairing a meeting of NERAMAC (North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation) at Guwahati, Assam today. The Minister is in Assam to take part in the programmes commemorating the completion of three years of Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, the high priority accorded to the Northeast by the present government and Prime Minister Shei Narendra Modi is evident from the fact that the Prime Minister chose to observe the completion of three-years of government in this region. He said, it is under the present government that Sikkim was declared as the first “Organic State” of India and a roadmap for developing the entire region as an organic hub of India has been envisaged. 

Emphasizing on the importance of developing the agri-horticulture ecosystem of Northeast, Dr Jitendra Singh said, NERAMAC must take up the responsibility of carrying forward this mission and build a modern dynamic marketing apparatus for the purpose. He said, in the absence of organized “Mandis” in most parts of the North-Eastern region, one of the priority activities of NERAMAC should be to act as an aggregator of agri-horti produce in the region, particularly when 80-82% of the agri-horti produce from the region happens to be organic in nature. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, people in other parts of the country are yet to be introduced to the rich and exclusive organic produce of the North-Eastern region and once this happens, they would spontaneously come looking for it. This will not only give a boost to trade and business, but also create opportunities of livelihood, he said. 

Earlier, Managing Director of NERAMAC, Shri Pankaj Kumar Prasad made a brief presentation on the organization’s role to act as organic aggregators for Northeast. He said, the NERAMAC is confident to succeed in its plan to promote organic farming and its marketing through different linkages at different levels. Notwithstanding the constraints of poor connectivity and infrastructural drawbacks, the NERAMAC has succeeded in pushing forward its operations, he added.

                Japan has officially offered support for various ongoing as well as upcoming development and infrastructure projects in the North-Eastern region. 

The Ambassador of Japan to India, Mr Kenji Hiramatsu officially met the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh and conveyed his government’s inclination to invest in Northeast and also offer any other feasible support for new ventures. He said, the North-Eastern region of India has immense potential and with the kind of priority being given to the region by the Government of India and the Government of Japan looks forward to engage itself as a partner at different levels, both financially and otherwise. 

According to Mr Kenji, the preferred States which the Government of Japan looks forward to invest in Northeast are Assam, followed by Manipur and Nagaland. He said, besides the trade and entrepreneurship interest, the Government of Japan also has a historic emotional link with the region because it was in the area around Manipur and Nagaland that during the Second World War, around 30,000 Japanese soldiers had got killed while fighting jointly with the British Army against the allied forces. 

Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the offer made by the Government of Japan and said, while the Ministry of DoNER will look forward to engagement of Japanese resources in the making of roads and bridges in the North-Eastern region, the Japanese partnership could also be utilized in the recent initiative of developing inland waterways transport along River Brahmaputra down to Bay of Bengal as well as supplementing the Venture Fund announced by DoNER Ministry for ""Start-Ups"" in Northeast.

He said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given special attention to the north east due to which the NE region has begun to attract the attention of tourist operators, entrepreneurs and investors from all over the country. Dr Jitendra Singh was speaking at the Annual Tourism Awards, 2017 function of ""Holiday IQ"", an organization promoting tourism in the country. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that Northeast is a natural destination for tourists but could not receive its due attention because of the logistic issues like constraints of connectivity and accessibility. Over the last three years, however, he said, not only all these North eastern States are on the Rail map of India, but in the next two years, almost all the States will have a broad gauge rail track. In addition, he said, the first ever train to Bangladesh will also be flagged off from Tripura and the rail track from Agartala is already under construction with the Indian side of it being funded by the Ministry of DoNER. Similarly, he said, the Central Government has earmarked over Rs. 40,000 crore to spread a network of roads across all the eight States. As far as air connectivity is concerned, important places like Itanagar, Sikkim, Shillong did not have full-fledged airports and the Centre Government has moved on a fast track to accomplish this, he added, while the alternative mode of transport in the form of waterways has also been initiated. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government has also sanctioned a full-fledged Film Institute for Arunachal Pradesh which will facilitate the film units to come and do location shooting. 

In order to showcase all that the Northeast has to offer to the rest of the world, from natural scenery to food cuisine, the Ministry of DoNER has, in the last two years, started a process of holding Northeast Festivals across the country at different locations including Delhi and Chandigarh. For the first time, last year, a permanent Northeast Stall “Purbashree” was set up at Dilli Haat, which has proved highly successful and is attracting people from all walks of life and from all parts of the country. 

Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to the initiative taken to promote “Home Tourism” in such parts of the region where the hotel facilities were either insufficient or exorbitantly costly. He said that this experiment has proved so successful that it can be emulated even in other parts of India which are frequently visited by tourists. 

In the process of promoting tourism, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the benefits go beyond the realms of tourism. Elaborating further, he said, the frequent exchange of population and visits by different sections of society from across the country have enabled the rest of India to know Northeast better and has also helped in bridging the gap that hitherto existed between Northeast and the rest of the country.

                The Deputy Chief Minister of Manipur, Shri Y. Joykumar Singh, called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed some of the initiatives planned by the new government in the State which took over on March 15 this year. 

The Deputy Chief Minister was also accompanied by Law & Health Minister, Shri L. Jayantakumar and Youth and Sports Minister, Shri Letpao Haokip. 

Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed to Shri Joykumar Singh that the proposal for having Helicopter-based “Air Clinics” for Northeast will probably be initiated from the State of Manipur. He said that the Union Ministry of Aviation and Union Ministry of Health have been taken on board and certain logistics and other issues need to be sorted out. He also informed that he has had a detailed discussion with the management of Pawan Hans and other Helicopter service providers on the subject. 

The Air Clinic Helicopter Service, said Dr Jitendra Singh, will help in setting up makeshift OPDs of different specialties in remote and inaccessible areas by specialised doctors. The same chopper can also be used for transporting patient to the hospital during its return sortie. 

Shri Joykumar Singh handed over to Dr Jitendra Singh a proposal for support from the Ministry of DoNER for developing infrastructure for Advocates and other legal functionaries in the Court and related premises in Manipur. Dr Jitendra Singh said, he would get the proposal evaluated and try to assess what is the feasible support that can be offered in this regard. 

Dr Jitendra Singh also stressed upon expediting the process relating to land acquisition and transfer, for setting up Sports University in Manipur. He also shared with the visiting Ministers, the proposal to extend the cancer related healthcare facilities up to the district hospital level with the collaboration of Adyar Cancer Institute, Chennai. He said, a meeting of the Health Ministers of all the eight States of Northeast is scheduled to be held soon to determine the further course of action in this regard.

A delegation of Nepali community, represented by “Nepali Sanskriti Parishad” and led by its President Shri Ashok Chaurasia, called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and sought his intervention for redressal of some issues facing the community. 

The members of the delegation apprised Dr Jitendra Singh that in NCR Delhi itself, there is about 35 lakh pollution of Nepali community, whereas in whole of India, the population is over 2.25 crore, out of which around one crore are non-residents working in India. This, they said, is a huge number, considering the fact that the total population of Nepal is just about 3.5 crore which also includes several of the non-Nepali residents. 

The Nepali community, according to Shri Chaurasia, has always enthusiastically participated in mainstream activities. The members of delegation also submitted documents to the Minister relating to the broadcast of All India Radio news bulletin in Nepali language. 

Dr Jitendra Singh gave a patient hearing to the members of delegation and said that the nation is proud of the contribution made by the community in the social and cultural life of India. Describing it as a highly patriotic and brave community, he said, the members of the community have made a very valuable contribution to the Indian Army and Paramilitary Forces, and have served the nation in the most difficult times. The stories of their bravery, valour and patriotism are an example for others, he added. 

Dr Jitendra Singh assured Shri Chaurasia and others that he will take up the issues raised by them with the concerned departments. 

He said that he has also received a request to set up an educational institution by Nepali community in Sikkim with the funding from the Ministry of DONER.

The centre today launched an aggressive new campaign titled 'Darwaza Band' to promote toilet use and freedom from open defecation across the country's villages. The campaign produced by the MDWS under Swachh Bharat Mission was launched in the presence of iconic actor, Shri Amitabh Bachchan, Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shri Devendra Fadnavis, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, and other Centre and State dignitaries in Mumbai. The event was widely attended by officials from all the State Districts and selected Gram Panchayat Members.

The Union Minister and the State Chief Minister also reviewed the working of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) programme in Maharashtra ahead of the event. Champion functionaries from the State of Maharashtra were awarded during the event. An exhibition displaying various toilet technologies was also put up.

The 'Darwaza Band' campaign has been supported by the World Bank and is being rolled out countrywide immediately after the launch. It is designed to encourage behaviour change in men who have toilets but are not using them. A part of the campaign also features actor, Ms Anushka Sharma, who will be seen encouraging women to stand up for this issue in their villages and assume a leadership role.

Shri Narendra Tomar said that achievement of 64% ODF status is a tribute to the Prime Minister’s commitment. He also congratulated Maharashtra on its significant achievement of 80% ODF. He further said that all attempts are being made to make this into a true Jan Andolan. He said the goal for India should be to become a showcase country for cleanliness by 2019. He thanked Shri Amitabh Bachchan for his constant support.

Shri Devendra Fadnavis thanked MDWS for choosing Maharashtra to launch the Darwaza Band Campaign. He thanked Sri Bachchan for taking on the mandate of raising awareness about Swacchta and endorsing the new campaign. He emphasised that Maharashtra is committed to become ODF by March 2018. dSpeaking at the event Shri Bachchan gave a brief background to the development of the campaign and mentioned that the campaign talks about a safe space for people to defecate. He also congratulated the State Champions and assured the audience of his support to the cause of Swacchta. He assured the audience of his constant support of the Swachh Bharat Mission as and when needed.

Shri Bachchan has been a major supporter and ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Mission and is already associated with its ongoing campaigns.

Behaviour change has been the focus of Swachh Bharat Mission, which is being pursued through a countrywide comprehensive IEC(Information-Education-Communication) programme. Communication campaigns have been taken up both, at the central and State levels, for promoting sustained use of toilets and for sustaining the Open Defecation Free status achieved.

Shri Iyer announced that the number of people defecating in the open has reduced from 55 crores in May 2014 to 35 crores in May 2017. He highlighted that the program is not just a toilet construction program but focuses on behaviour change promoting sustainable usage, at both community and village levels. In his presentation Shri Iyer showcased visual examples of some behaviour change communication being done at the grassroots.

Introducing the campaign, he said that it focuses on the need to shift people’s paradigm from ‘open’ to ‘closed’ especially for men.

The Amitabh Bachchan series of ads encourages behaviour change in men who have toilets but are not using them. The Anushka Sharma series of ads is a clarion call for women who are more affected by this problem to stand up for this issue in their village and influence a positive change. These have been developed by Lowe Lintas, Mumbai under a World Bank Project.

                Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India is all set to launch ‘Deep Ocean Mission’ by January 2018. This will improve India’s position in ocean research field. Shri M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences announced today. Secretary was speaking through video conference in the workshop arranged by National Institute of Oceanography, Dona Paula. Shri M S Nagar, Member Standing Committee, Ministry of Earth Science, Dr VSN Murthy, Director, National Institute of Oceanography were also present at the inauguration of the workshop on ‘Three decades of India acquiring Pioneer Investor Status- Achievements and way forward’. India achieved a lot in the field of ocean research; still it is long way to go, said Secretary M Rajeevan on this occasion. 

The program on Poly metallic nodules was initiated at CSIR-NIO with the collection of the first nodule sample from Arabian Sea on board the first Research Vessel Gaveshani on 26 January 1981. India was the first country in the world to have been given the Pioneer Area for exploration of deep-sea mineral viz. Polymetallic nodules in the Central Indian Ocean Basin in 1987. This was based on the extensive surveys carried out by the scientists of CSIR-NIO, on several research ships leading to the allocation of an area of 150,000 sq km to the country with exclusive rights under the UN Law of the sea. 

Subsequently, Environment Impact Assessment studies for nodule mining by CSIR-NIO, development of metal extraction process by CSIR-National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur and CSIR- Institute for Minerals and Metals Technology, Bhubaneswar and development of mining technology by National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, have been taken up under the national program on Polymetallic nodules funded by Ministry of Earth Sciences. 

Based on the resource evaluation, India has now retained an area of 75,000 sq km with an estimated resource of about 100 million tons of strategic metals such Copper,Nickel, Cobalt besides Manganese and Iron. A First Generation Mine-site (FGM) with an area of 18,000 sq km has been identified. Latest technologies for extraction of metals from the minerals have also been developed under the programme. Detailed environmental data has been collected for compliance with International Seabed Authorities requirements. Besides identifying the mineral resource and developing technologies for mining and extraction, the programme has also resulted in high impact research as well as manpower development.

                Union Human Resource Development Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar today launched an Anti-Ragging Mobile App introduced by the University Grants Commission (UGC) here in New Delhi. Speaking on this occasion Shri Javadekar said this mobile app will help students register complaints to counter the menace of ragging.

The Minister said earlier one had to visit the website for registering a complaint of ragging and our record shows that timely action was taken which in turn had resulted in the decrease of such instances. But still this ill has to be eliminated completely, he said.

Shri Javadekar said as per his knowledge in campuses majority of senior students actually help guide their juniors and properly mentor them, but in few cases ragging happens which needs to be completely eliminated from campuses. He said “physical or mental torture of a new student is ragging which we won’t allow, this is unacceptable and therefore this app will become a handy tool to any student who goes through such experience.”

The Minister said this app will work on android system on which students can log in and register their complaints immediately. Accordingly all concerned will be informed immediately and action will start immediately.

He said it is a good step for protection and will give a feeling of security to students. The Minister categorically cautioned that those who are involved in ragging will not be tolerated and they will not be allowed to continue their education in that institution. At the same time they will meet severe penalty and punishment as per the law. However the Minister expressed hope that good senior students will act as mentors for their juniors.

The committee expressed that the ministry should increase the original Hindi correspondence in the Regions 'A' 'B' and 'C' in official use of Hindi. The Committee also emphasized that to increase the use of Hindi, simple and popular words should be used instead of difficult Hindi words. Valuable suggestions were received from honorable members of the Committee. The Chair directed to conduct the next meeting within six months.

                Minister of Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar today asserted that the advancement of the date of the presentation of the Union Budget this year and the passing of the Finance Bill before the commencement of the Financial Year on April 1, has facilitated speedy release of Budgetary funds to the states.

“This landmark decision of the Modi Government has resulted in release of funds to the States in the first month of the new financial year itself. Earlier the Finance Bill used to get passed only in May and the release of funds used to start only by June by which time monsoon sets in,” Mr Javadekar said in a statement here.

As a sequel to these important reforms, I am happy to inform that the Ministry of Human Resource Development has released as much as Rs 12621.45 crore to States as on April 30, 2017 as against a meager Rs 2726.39 crore released in the last financial year during the same period.

Elaborating further, the Minister said Rs 8,829.05 crore have been released by the Department of School Education and Literacy, while Rs 3,792.40 crore by the Department of Higher Education.

“There has been a remarkable improvement in the release of funds this year,” the Minister said.

In respect of the Department of School Education & Literacy, the actual releases made were Rs 2648.21 crore above the MEP limit. In respect of the Department of Higher Education, this was Rs 292.76 crore over the MEP limit. As compared to the corresponding period last year, both these releases are substantially higher.

The major portion of the releases made in respect of Department of School Education was for schemes like SSA, RMSA, Mid Day Meal, Adult Education and Skill Development and institutions like KVS, NVS, NCERT, CTSA.

In the case of Higher Education it was for supporting autonomous institutions like IITs, IIMs, NITs, IISERs, Central Universities, etc. Releases for the Centrally Sponsored Scheme viz. RUSA/’Improvement of salary scale of college and university teachers’ of Department of Higher Education is expected to be made in the coming month as per budgeted targets.

A collage of photo portraits and book on Paramveer Chakra recipients was also released and presented to Vice-Chancellors of universities.

 

Highlighting the importance of the occasion Shri Javadekar expressed his gratitude towards the most difficult service rendered by our armed forces. He said we feel secure just because of the continuous vigil and alertness of our forces busy in securing our borders. The Minister said these are our real post independence heroes while the freedom fighters who laid their lives and faced atrocities for the cause of freedom are the natural heroes since the days of Satyagraha which culminated in the revolution for getting independence from the foreign rule.

 



 

Shri Javadekar said through this campaign a wall of valour will be built in colleges and universities across the country and this will be built on contributory   funding by students and teachers on voluntary basis. He said this wall will be 15X20 feet in size and will depict the portraits of all the 21 Paramveer Chakra recipients. The Minister expressed the hope that this will help revive and re-energize the patriotic fervour in our young minds.

 

The Minister said organising of such events help in changing atmosphere in our colleges and universities. It is just to revive the patriotic feeling in our youth. He said we are not interested to teach lessons of patriotism to anyone   as it is innate in every individual. But its continuous revival is a dire need.  Shri Javadekar said we do not want to force it.

 



 

The event was attended by several vice-chancellor of universities, scholars, ex-servicemen and school children. Paramveer chakra recipient Shri Sanjay Kumar and Shri Yogendra Singh Yadav who  also shared their war memories and experiences with the audience and instilled patriotic feelings in the young ones.

 

The function was also addressed by Dr. Subhash Ramrao Bhamre MoS Defence and Shri Tarun Vijay, the convener of the event.

A workshop on “CSCs as GST Suvidha Provider” to train the top performing VLEs and the State level representatives of CSC SPV for enabling implementation of GST scheme especially in rural India through CSC was organized here today. Common Services Centers are proposed to act as a GST Suvidha Provider. CSCs have been identified to facilitate the roll out of GST especially in rural India. CSCs will help merchants’ registration, filing returns and support them in fulfilling various requirements under GST. They will mobilize, conduct training and create advocacy of GST implementation across the country. 

The Union Minister for Electronics & IT and Law Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad inaugurated the event, appreciated the efforts of the enterprising VLEs in providing key services to the grassroots. He Said the Village Level Entrepreneurs are Rapid Action Force for Digital India and hoped they will truly be the harbingers of digital revolution in India and enable us to create digitally and financially inclusive society. India does not want to miss the digital revolution and, in fact, aims to become the leader of the revolution and CSCs will lead us in this endeavor. 

He said VLEs are important component of Government’s strategy to provide all services at village level and the day is not far off when even private entrepreneurs would approach CSCs for reaching the unreached customers. Talking about employment potential of the initiative he said at present 2,50,000 CSCs are employing nearly 10 lac persons. The number is likely to touch 25 lac mark in the near future as more services from both private and public sectors are put in their basket. 

The Hon’ Minister said, “GST means one nation, one tax. He said that GST Suvidha Provider service that is being rolled out today is a big opportunity for VLEs.” He hoped that the VLEs would rise to the occasion and help the government in reaching out to the merchants. 

He said, “CSC is a big army in this country. In Prime Minister housing scheme, Government has received 4.5 lakh applications for housing through CSC. I have suggested to Smt. Sushma Swaraj, Hon’ble Minister of External Affairs that CSCs should do the work of verification of e-Sanad certificates. Apart from this, CSCs will help to provide legal services to the poor.” He added, “I always say that companies should use the vast network of CSCs. In the Digital era, the role of CSCs is tremendous. Today, 2 crore people have downloaded BHIM App. CSCs should make it popular in their community. In the digital economy, the demand of CSCs’ services will become tremendous. Every VLEs should train one woman from tribal and backward communities.” 

Hon’ble Minister also inaugurated the Bharat Bill Payment Operating Unit service through CSCs. Bharat Bill Payment Operating Unit is an authorized operational unit working as per the standards set by BBPS. BBPOUs will onboard billers, aggregators and payment gateways to handle bill payments through different delivery channels. 

The Hon’ Minister was addressing around 100 VLEs and 70 CSC representatives from across India. The workshop organised at the India Habitat Centre has also brought together Government Officials, Private Players, Civil Society Organizations, and GST experts. 

While welcoming the participants to the workshop Shri Dinesh Tyagi, CEO, CSC SPV said, “GST is a revolutionary reform in this country. The role of GST Service Provider is to mobilse merchants, advocacy, capacity building and solving the problems through CSCs. GST is a challenging task. This work is on the shoulders of our VLEs. GST is very important as well as a great business for our VLEs. It will also enhance the credibility of VLEs in their community.” 

On the occasion, a book on GST was also launched by the Hon’ Minister and other dignitaries. 

The event was also attended by Sh. Sanjeev Mittal, Joint Secretary-MeitY, Krishnan Dharamarajan, ED- CDFI, Navneet Khurana, Dy Commissioner – GST and Col. Pankaj from GSTN among others.

The Digital India foot print is expanding day by day. It has been the consistent focus of Shri Narendra Modi Government, to improve Digital Governance as it is critical for faster delivery and effective monitoring of services.

 

The transformation happening under the overall Digital India initiative is creating huge opportunities for involvement of industry/private sector, mainly providers of IT/IT enabled systems and services. However, various concerns have been raised from time to time by the industry relating to their engagements (and contracts) with government funded projects. These issues include terms of payments, acceptance criteria, service level agreement and change management etc.

 

It is the consistent representation of NASSCOM, as also the major System Integrators like TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, IBM etc, for the need of a model RFP to guide all the organizations across governments, so that all variations, vagaries and uncertainties may be avoided. Based on intensive deliberations with the industry and other stakeholders, this model RFP has been formulated.

 

The major features of Model RFP provides for,

1.      Level playing field, to all stakeholders by defining appropriate pre-qualification and technical evaluation criterion.

2.      Aligning legal terms and conditions with the requirements of the IT Industry

·         Template for scope of work and service level agreements

·         Change request mechanisms

·         Dispute resolution

·         Standard contractual terms & conditions

·         Standardization of Intellectual property rights

·         Capping the liability, penalty and liquidated damages

3.      Making payment terms, objective and easier, for industry and Government Department

·         Guidance on simplifying payment related conditions

·         Incorporating the Exchange rate variations

4.      Converging Government schemes like Make in India / Preference for Domestically Manufactured Electronic Goods (PMA), provisions for Start-ups and MSMEs

5.      Leveraging latest technologies like cloud, mobiles, etc.

6.      Aligned with the General Financial Rule 2017

7.      Adherence to the latest standards\

                It is asserted that the employment potential and prospects in the IT and related sectors are robust and promising. Some of the reports to the contrary in the media space are highly exaggerated and unfounded.

Indian IT sector employment prospects, both in the near and long-term are expected to be broadly positive and encouraging for the future. India IT companies currently serve two thirds of the fortune 500 companies and have created 40 lakhs direct jobs in India

To present an objective and realistic potential of the employment scenario, the Ministry apart from its own feedback, has taken note of projections by NASSCOM, the principal Industry body, as well as of other well-known independent organizations and consultants working in this field.

NASSCOM has confirmed that the industry continues to be a net hirer and reports that:
•    2.5-3 million new jobs will be created by 2025.
•    In FY 2017, the industry added 1,70,000 new jobs. NASSCOM has already publicly contradicted reports of large scale layoff
•    IT industry added 600,000 in last three years and today, boasts of a total employee base of 3.9 million.

TeamLease analysis for 2017-18 reports that IT sector hiring sentiments is positive and is up by 4% in October 2016 to March 2017, compared to the previous six-month period.

The TeamLease analyses also indicates that e-commerce and technology startup sector hiring sentiments has increased by 2%, with projected 14.94% job growth. (This is despite recent challenges in these sectors.)

Recruitment and staffing firm Randstad projects (in December 2016), a cumulative growth rate of 9% in the IT / ITeS job market.

The Indian technology startup sector will offer strong and growing employment prospects to Indian IT professionals. According to NASSCOM, in 2016, Indian technology startups employed 95,000 to 100,000 IT professionals, across more than 4,750 startups (including ecommerce and hyperlocals).

India’s domestic IT market offers strong prospects for industry growth (consequently employment), even if global markets were to face challenges.

•    India’s total software product market grew at 9.5% in FY2017 to reach USD 7 billion. (Exports grew 7.8% to reach USD 2.3 billion.) In comparison, the domestic market grew much faster, at 10.4%, reaching USD 4.8 billion.
•    India’s overall domestic IT/BPM sector is expected to grow at 8.5% from USD 35 billion in 2016 to an anticipated USD 37 billion in 2017.

Other shining sectors of employment in the overall of IT Industry under Digital India, include, the following:
•    CSC has generated 10lakhs local level employment by way of village level entrepreneurs.
•    Total employment in IT/ITES Industry employees is 4 millions as direct employment and 1.3 Crores as indirect employment.
•    State-owned Software Technology Park of India (STPI) has generated 50% of the employment generated by the Indian IT/ITES industry. It is to be noted that out of 56 STPI centres, 48 are located in tier-ii and tier-iii location, benefitting the qualified youth of such locations.
•    To further promote the job creation, MeitY has come up with India BPO promotion scheme with an aim to provide employment to 1.45 lakh persons, mostly in the small towns. More than 48 thousand BPO seats in 2017-18 year. It is a matter of assurance that BPO through tendering has been finalized and is in its process of being set up in towns like Imphal, Guwahati, Siliguri, Patna, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Gazipur, Unnao, Amravati etc
•    To encourage Northeastern part of India, MeitY has a separate Northeast BPO promotion scheme with 5000 seats and having employment potential of 15000 persons. This would go a long way to help the employment scene in northeast region of India.
•    In Mobile phone manufacturing, 72 new mobile manufacturing units started only in last 30 months. It has created 1 lakh direct and 3 lakh indirect jobs in India. All major brands like Apple, Samsung etc. in the ICT sector are manufacturing or ready to manufacture in India.

The emerging and promising digital economy in the country is going create a very powerful potential for job creations.

The Govt is encouraging greater stress on cyber security and this will lead to greater focus on innovation, research and thus significant potential for job creation.

P. Chaudhary, Hon’ble MoS. Electronics & IT, Law & Justice among others. In his keynote address, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, “There is no aspect of human life which is untouched by advances in Information Technology and Electronics. NIELIT has endeavored to lead by example and is empowering youth through Skill Development and Capacity Building initiatives. In addition to Digital Literacy the demands for skilling in basic Cyber Security concepts has also increased manifold, and NIELIT is equitably poised to address this challenge.  For effective implementation of skill development programmes including Government of India’s initiatives at PAN India level, he further said that NIELIT should strive to ensure that it has presence through at least one own Centre in each state.”

“We are working towards transforming India into a digitally empowered nation, and imparting digital literacy to the last miles of rural India holds the key here. The Common Services Centres (CSCs) have so far done a great job in this direction; our target is to provide training on digital literacy to 6 crore citizens, which will be certified by NIELIT. I appeal NIELIT as well as all concerned functionaries to take this project on a mission mode and contribute to the larger goal as envisaged by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. We would like to see all government services, both at central and state level, to be digitally available to the every citizen of this country.” added Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Shri P.P. Chaudhary, Hon’ble Union MoS for Electronics & IT, Law & Justice congratulated NIELIT for institutionalizing the newly constructed NIELIT Bhawan and said, “The Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) has also been delegated with the responsibility of promotion of Digital Transactions including Digital Payments. In this regard, there is a need for concerted efforts by all stakeholders for promotion of digital payments to move towards a less cash economy and NIELIT together with other organizations is also contributing towards this vision.”

With the addition of a new campus NIELIT has added another feather in its cap. Incidentally, NIELIT has PAN India presence through 36 own Centres and about 9000 training partners.

In his address Shri Sanjiv Mittal, Joint Secretary, MeitY said, “NIELIT has developed expertise in development of quality course curriculum and many of these courses have also been aligned with the National Skills Qualifications Framework for greater employability and industry acceptance”.

Dr. Ashwini Kumar Sharma, Director General, NIELIT tracing the journey of construction of NIELIT Bhawan, which has been taken up with renewed vigor only recently, said, “To follow green practices NIELIT Bhawan has been equipped with Solar Panels on rooftop in support of New & Renewable Energy mission of the Government.

It is noteworthy that the foundation stone was laid in May 2015 and as such the construction of NIELIT Bhawan has been completed within a very short span of less than 2 years.

During inauguration, e-Contents of NIELIT Courses were also launched. Through e-Content NIELIT aims to widen its reach especially in those areas where there is shortage of training facilities. In continuation to the efforts made by NIELIT to facilitate stakeholders through its repertoire of Online facilities, an Online Accreditation Portal was also launched which would considerably reduce time and paper documentations for grant of accreditation to private training institutes under a time-tested PPP model. Besides, a new concept has also been introduced by NIELIT, whereby candidates shall now be awarded e-Certificate on completion of a single module. As NIELITs non-formal courses are targeted towards those candidates who are unable to join the main-stream university education system, issuance of module wise e-Certificates would further widen the scope for employment. 

NIELIT is working in unison with its network of training partners in taking forward ‘Digital India’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, towards development of an empowered society. The NIELIT Bhawan inaugurated today is another key link in the growing footsteps of NIELIT all over India. NIELIT in the last 5 years has registered a healthy growth in all spheres with revenue registering a jump of about 175%. NIELIT annually skills more than 7 lakh candidates and has institutionalized many new initiatives such as SMART Virtual Classroom for training in Electronic mode. NIELIT has launched 70 Apps for Android based Smart Phones on various topics of CCC (Course on Computer Concepts) course in 11 languages and 51 Skill Oriented courses of NIELIT have been aligned with NSQF at different levels. NIELIT has also established Model Career Centres under the National Career Service Scheme of Government of India which organizes Job Fairs to promote employability among youth. Recently, it has also established a Study Centre at Baramulla, J&K jointly with Indian Army to mainstream local youth in the region through skill development programmes. At NIELIT, internal capacities are being augmented through training of Master Trainers in niche areas such as Mobile Application Development, Cloud Computing, IoT, e-Waste, Cyber Security, Mobile Handset Design, etc. in synergy with industry leaders like Amazon, Google, Intel, Microsoft, etc. for skilling and empowerment of youth especially in rural India. Besides, NIELIT in collaboration with CAIT has been organising workshops and DigiDhan camps to onboard self organised small/ medium businesses/ traders on Digital Payment initiatives across India.

                Some representations have been received today regarding certain provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Market) Rules, 2017. 

The basic purpose of the Rule is to ensure welfare of the animals in the cattle market and ensure adequate facilities for housing, feeding, feed storage area, water supply, water troughs, ramps, enclosures for sick animals, veterinary care and proper drainage etc. To facilitate this, two Committees have been constituted, namely the District Animal Market Monitoring Committee for registration of animal market and Animal Market Committee at the local authority level for management of the markets. 

The prime focus of the regulation is to protect the animals from cruelty and not to regulate the existing trade in cattle for slaughter houses. It is envisaged that welfare of cattle dealt in the market will be ensured and that only healthy animals are traded for agriculture purposes for the benefits of the farmers. The livestock markets are intended to become hubs for trade for animal for agriculture through this process and animal for slaughter will have to be bought from the farmers at the farms. The notified rules will remove the scope of illegal sale and smuggling of the cattle which is a major concern. The specific provisions apply only to animals which are bought and sold in the notified live stock markets and animals that are seized as case properties. These rules do not cover other areas. 

It may be recalled that in the case before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in W.P. (Civil) No. 881 of 2014 filed by Gauri Maulekhi versus Union of India and others, the Apex Court passed an order dated 13th July, 2015 to frame guidelines to prevent animals from the being smuggled out of India for the Gadhimai Festival held in Nepal where large scale animals sacrifices took place. The Supreme Court had constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of DG, Sahastra Seema Bal (SSB) and some suggestions were made by them, including measures to curb trans-boundary smuggling of cattle. The Supreme Court also inter alia directed that rules with regard to Livestock Market and Case Property animals also be notified. On 12th July, 2016 the Hon’ble Supreme Court by the way of a final order directed this Ministry to frame rules under Section 38 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 1960. 

The Animal Welfare Board of India prepared the draft rules incorporating all the suggestions made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court for the above mentioned case. 

The Draft Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 was notified on 16th January, 2017 inviting objections and suggestions from all persons likely to be affected by it within 30 days. 13 representations were received regarding the aforesaid rules. They were duly examined and incorporated, wherever found suitable. The rules were finally notified on 23rd May, 2017. 

The representations received will be duly examined in the Ministry.

In a first, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, along with the UN Environment OzonAction’s Compliance Assistance Programme, organized an “Ozone2Climate” Technology Roadshow, post Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, on the sidelines of the South Asia National Ozone Officers Annual Network Meeting – 2017 in Agra today.  The Roadshow was inaugurated by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha. The Technology Roadshow was organized for the first time as part of the annual network meeting for Ozone Officers of South Asia.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jha said, the “Ozone2Climate Technology Roadshow”, had 13 exhibitors that promoted ozone and climate-friendly alternative technologies to HCFCs and HFCs in the refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) sector. The Technology Roadshow showcased current refrigeration and air conditioning equipment designed to be more energy efficient, hence with a double benefit of saving money for consumers, and with a much lower impact on the environment. Over 200 refrigerant technicians, ozone officers, business representatives and government officials attended the Roadshow.

Head of the United Nations Environment’s OzonAction, Dr. Shamila Nair-Bedouelle, highlighted UNEP’s Compliance Assistance Programme (CAP) which provides significant support to Article 5 countries with meeting and sustaining their obligations under the Protocol. “The national ozone officers’ network meetings are a flagship of the CAP and offer a forum for exchange of experience and knowledge transfer among national ozone officers,” she said. Organising O2C Technology Roadshow, along with the network meeting represents an innovative approach by the South Asia network to bring the state-of-the-art technology to the policy makers, she said.

Along with the Technology Roadshow, UN Environment is also organising the annual network meeting for South Asia Ozone Officers from May 23 to 26, 2017. The meeting focused on current policy and technology updates on ozone and climate friendly alternatives to HCFCs and HFCs specifically post-Kigali amendment, linking the HCFC phase out to future HFC phase down, the implications of Kigali amendment for the network countries and challenges and opportunities from a policy and technology perspective. 

Delegates from 20 countries and industry visited the 2017 exhibition and this was the first time the Ozone2Climate Technology Roadshow was organised as a part of the annual network meeting globally. The National Ozone Officers (NOOs) from 13 South Asia network countries visited the Technology Roadshow and gained information on state-of-the-art HCFC/HFC alternative technologies.

Biodiversity and Sustainable Tourism is the theme

International Day for Biodiversity celebrated every year on May 22 and International Day for Biodiversity 2017 is being celebrated in Goa today.  In his message on the occasion, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said:

 “Biodiversity, the variety of all life on earth, is vital to social and economic development, and is indeed fundamental to our survival. Protecting biodiversity and halting its loss is therefore an essential investment for our collective well-being.

Biodiversity plays an important role in various economic sectors, including tourism. There are intrinsic linkages between tourism and biodiversity. While on one hand, tourism has the potential to contribute positively to biodiversity, on the other, the stress imposed by tourism activities may accelerate and aggravate its depletion. It is therefore in the interest of all stakeholders to ensure that tourism activities are ecologically sustainable.

As a mega diverse country, receiving an increasing share of international tourism, biodiversity may well be one of our most competitive advantages for tourism considered to be one of the fastest growing industry.

Today, on the occasion of the International Day for Biological Diversity, the theme for which is ‘Biodiversity and Sustainable Tourism’, let us all pledge to be mindful and conscious in reducing our biodiversity footprint, including when we travel as a tourist.

The national level event is being celebrated today in Goa, the ultimate tourist destination, which unfortunately I am not able to attend. The Ministry has undertaken several activities towards spreading the message of sustainable tourism, including an exhibition organised in the Ministry through National Museum of Natural History (NMNH).”

                Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister for Science and Technology and Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, assumed charge at the IP Bhavan here today, following the sudden and untimely demise of former Minister of State (Independent Charge) Shri Anil Madhav Dave, last Thursday.  He commenced his visit to the office by first planting a sapling in the memory of Late Shri Anil Madhav Dave in the premises of IP Bhavan. He felt humbled at taking over charge of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and recalled the contribution of Late Shri Dave as a great champion of river conservation and environment.  He pointed out that Shri Dave’s love for children was evident in his belief to restore our environment for our children.  “Dave ji did a great deal of work to protect our rivers, forests, ecosystem with the passion and the dedication of a true environmentalist”, he said. Dr. Harsh Vardhan recalled the words of Shri Anil Madhav Dave, who used to say, ‘If I can, so can we’. The Minister emphasised that the Ministry will always keep in mind the last wish of Late Shri Dave of environmental protection by planting, protecting and nurturing trees and of cleaning rivers and ponds.

 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan reviewed the key areas of concern and priority with the Secretary and other senior officers of the Ministry.  The progress of work in the last 3 years of this government and the key initiatives taken were discussed. He acknowledged that there are many immediate and complex issues of environment, forest and climate change, which will need collective and concerted efforts. He emphasised the mission of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, for integrating environmental concerns into development policies and programmes and balancing the two for India’s sustained growth and progress. For this, it was important for the Ministry to quickly adopt the latest technologies, re-engineer clearance processes and develop policy initiatives to further enhance transparency, accountability and timely delivery.

 

The Minister focussed on policies and programmes for climate change adaptation andmitigation; biodiversity protection; pollution prevention and cleaner production; promoting circular economy for waste management through the concept of 4Rs (Reduce, Recover, Reuse And Recycle); eco-tourism; afforestation on degraded lands and disbursal of CAMPA funds to the states. In particular, he emphasised that “Pollution, both of air and water, is a matter of concern for the whole country, in general, and especially Delhi and NCR, and needs to be addressed on priority by the Ministry.”  He also underlined that Climate Change and the commitments of India in the Paris agreement are another important challenge.  He exhorted all the officers to continue to strive hard and meet these and other similar challenges in the coming years.  He added that lot of good work has been done, which must be shared with the people.  “Involvement of the people is crucial, and for protection and conservation of environment people’s participation has to be increased”, Dr Harsh Vardhan added.  

 

Earlier, Dr Harsh Vardhan took a round of the building, which is a benchmark in sustainable urban built habitat.  The building is a net zero energy consumption building, as it generates all the power necessary on an annual basis.  He expressed happiness at the clean environment, the open office concept and the overall ambience of the building.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Punjab National Bank (PNB) yesterday signed a $100 million loan — to be guaranteed by the Government of India — that will finance large solar rooftop systems on industrial and commercial buildings throughout India. The PNB will use the ADB funds to make further loans to various developers and end users to install rooftop solar systems. 

 

This is the first tranche loan of the $500 million multi tranche finance facility Solar Rooftop Investment Program (SRIP) approved by ADB in 2016. The financing includes $330 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources and $170 million from the multi donor Clean Technology Fund (CTF) administered by ADB.  The first tranche loan of $100 million would be financed entirely from the CTF. 

 

“With a sharp drop in the price of solar panels, India has a huge potential to expand its use of solar rooftop technologies,” said Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, ADB Country Director in India who signed the loan on behalf of ADB. “The program will contribute to the government’s plans to increase solar power generation capacity, and also help India meet the carbon emission reduction target in line with its commitment at the recent global climate change agreement.” India’s solar rooftop market is expanding fast with an estimated total capacity potential of 124GW. 

 

“The project is aligned with the goal set by Government of India to increase the country’s solar rooftop capacity by 40 GW by 2022, and would also contribute to Government's efforts to promote solar energy solutions as affordable and sustainable energy sources,” said Mr. Raj Kumar, Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed the Guarantee Agreement for Government of India. The loan agreement was signed by Mr. H.K. Parikh, General Manager on behalf of PNB.

 

The entire Solar Rooftop Investment Program will cost $1 billion, inclusive of ADB $500 million funding, and the projects financed under the program will install solar rooftop system of around 1 GW capacity. This will contribute to the climate change goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 11 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the typical 25-year lifetime of rooftop solar systems.

Telecommunication services presently attract Service Tax of 14% along with Swachh Bharat Cess (SBC) of 0.5% and Krishi Kalyan Cess (KKC) of 0.5%. While Service Tax is a pure value added tax, the above mentioned cesses are not. This is the reason that while no ITC (Input Tax Credit) of SBC is available, the ITC of KKC is allowed to be set-off only against KKC. Therefore, both the cesses are turn-over tax. 

As against the above, the Telecommunication Services will attract GST of 18% in the GST regime, which is a pure Value Added Tax because full ITC of Inputs and Input Services used in the course or furtherance of business by the telecommunication service providers would be available. 

Moreover, presently Telecom Service providers are neither eligible for credit of VAT paid on goods nor of Special Additional Duty (SAD) paid on imported goods/equipments. However, under GST, Telecom Service Providers would avail credit of IGST paid on domestically procured goods as also imported goods. As per some estimates, this additional Input Tax Credit would be as much as 2% of the turnover of the telecom industry. Further, ITC of Service Tax paid on assignment of spectrum by the Government in 2016 is presently allowed to be availed of by the telecommunication companies over a period of 3 years. In the GST regime, the entire credit can be taken in the same year. Resultantly, the balance two-third credit of the previous year would be admissible in the Current Financial Year itself. All of these would reduce the telecom companies’ liability to pay GST through cash to about 87% of what they paid in the last fiscal. 

Thus, the telecom companies are required to re-work their costing and credits availability and re-jig their prices and ensure that the increased availability of credit is passed on to the customers by lowering their costs.

                Proposed GST Tax rates would be much lesser than the prevailing incidence of taxes in case of Sugar, Tea and Coffee (other than instant coffee) and Milk Powder. Details in this regard are as follows:

 

1.         Sugar: Sugar attracts specific central excise duty of Rs.71 per quintal plus Sugar Cess of Rs.124 per quintal, which translates to ad valorem rate of more than 6%. Including incidence on account of account of CST, octroi, and entry tax etc., the present total tax incidence would work out to more than 8%. As against this, the proposed GST rate on sugar is only 5% i.e. 3% less than present incidence of taxes.

 

2.         Tea and coffee (other than instant coffee): Tea and coffee attract Nil central excise duty and VAT rate of 5%. Considering embedded taxes in production of tea and coffee and the incidence on account of CST, octroi and entry tax etc., the present total tax incidence works out to more than 7%. As against this, the proposed GST rate for tea and coffee (other than instant coffee) is only 5%.

 

3.         Milk powder: Milk powder attracts Nil central excise duty and 5% VAT. Considering embedded taxes in production of milk powder and the incidence on account of CST, octroi, and entry tax etc., the present total tax incidence works out to more than 7%. As against this, the proposed GST rate on milk powder is only 5%.

                Taxes on entertainments and amusements (covered by the erstwhile entry 62 of State List of the Constitution) have been subsumed under Goods and Services Tax (GST) except to the extent of taxes on entertainments and amusements levied by a Panchayat or a Municipality.

The rate of GST approved by GST Council on services by way of admission to entertainment events or cinematography films in cinema theatres is 28%. However, the entertainment tax rates in respect of exhibition of cinematography films in theaters/cinema halls, currently levied by States are as high as 100% in some of the States.

The rate of entertainment tax on cable TV and Direct-To-Home (DTH) levied by States is in the range of 10%-30% in many States. Apart from this, Service tax is also leviable at the rate of 15%. As against this, the rate of GST approved by GST Council on these services is 18%.

The rate of GST approved by GST Council on access to circus, theatre, Indian classical dance including folk dance and drama is 18% ad valorem. Further, the GST Council has approved an exemption upto a consideration for admission of Rs 250 per person. These services currently attract entertainment tax levied by the States.

Thus, entertainment services shall suffer a lower tax incidence under GST. In addition to the benefit of lower headline rates of GST, the service providers shall be eligible for full input tax credits (ITC) of GST paid in respect of inputs and input services. Presently, such service providers are not eligible to avail of input credits in respect of VAT paid on domestically procured capital goods & inputs or of Special Additional Duty (SAD) paid on imported capital goods and inputs. Thus, while GST is a value added tax, entertainment tax, presently levied by the States is like a turnover tax.

                The roll out of Goods and Services (GST) Tax will bring benefits to the consumers due to reduced tax rates on various commodities such as packaged cement, medicaments, smart phones, and medical devices, etc.

 Packaged cement attracts central excise duty of 12.5% + Rs.125 PMT and standard VAT rate of 14.5%. At these rates, the present total tax incidence works out to more than 29%. If we include tax incidence on account of CST, octroi, entry tax, etc., the present total tax incidence would work out to more than 31%. As against this, the proposed GST rate for cement is 28%.

 There will be lesser tax burden in case of Medicaments, including Ayurvedic, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathic or Bio-chemic systemsalso. Medicaments, in general, attract 6% central excise duty and 5% VAT. Further, CST, octroi, entry  tax, etc. are also applicable in general. At these rates, the present total tax incidence works out to more than 13%. As against this, the proposed GST rate on medicines, including ayurvedic medicines, is 12%.

             Smart phone attracts 2% central excise duty [1% excise duty + 1% NCCD]. VAT rates vary from State to State from 5% to 15%. Weighted average VAT rate on smart phones works out to about 12%. Thus, the present total tax incidence on smart phones works out to more than 13.5%. As against this, the proposed GST rate for smart phones is 12%.

 Similarly, medical devices, including surgical instruments, in general attract 6% central excise duty and 5% VAT. Along with CST, octroi, entry tax, etc., the present total tax incidence on them works out to more than 13%. As against this, the proposed rate under GST is 12%.

Puja samagri including havan samagri will be under the Nil category. However, exact formulation for the same is yet to be finalized.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into two Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APA) on 04th May, 2017 and 11th May, 2017 respectively, with Indian taxpayers. One of the Agreements also has “Rollback” provision. 

The two APAs signed pertain to chip design/development of embedded software and Information technology (software development) sectors of the economy. The number of APAs signed in the current financial year now is four. The CBDT expects more APAs to be signed in the near future. The progress of the APA Scheme strengthens the Government’s commitment to foster a non-adversarial tax regime. 

The APA Scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and determining the arm’s length price of international transactions in advance for the maximum of five future years. Further, the taxpayer has the option to roll-back the APA for four preceding years, as a result of which, total nine years of tax certainty is provided. Since its inception, the APA scheme has attracted tremendous interest among Multi National Enterprises (MNEs).

                Since Apr-Jun (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Office (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, is bringing out a quarterly report on debt management on regular basis. The current report pertains to the quarter Jan-March 2017 (Q4 FY 17).

 

During Q4 of FY17, the Government issued dated securities worth Rs. 80,000 crore to complete its borrowings of Rs. 582,000 crore (RE) for FY 17. Gross and net market borrowings requirements of the Government for FY17 were revised lower to Rs 5,82,000 crore and Rs.  4,06,708 crore, which were lower by 0.52 per cent and 8.34, respectively, than Rs. 5,85,000 crore and Rs. 4,40,625 crore in FY16. Auctions of both, Government dated securities and Treasury Bills during Q4 of FY17 were held smoothly.

 

In view of comfortable cash position of the Government, Rs. 30,982.787 crore was utilised to buy-back the securities from the market and borrowing from the market were also reduced by Rs. 18,000 crore during the quarter. The weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average yield (WAY) of the issuance made during Q4 FY17 was 15.01 years and 6.75 per cent respectively. The liquidity in the economy was in surplus, due to demonetization, during the quarter. The cash position of the Government during Q4 of FY17 was comfortable and remained in surplus mode.

 

The Public Debt (excluding liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Central Government provisionally decreased by 1.9 per cent in Q4 of FY 17 on Q-o-Q basis. Internal debt constituted 92.6 per cent of Public Debt as at end-March 2017 while marketable securities accounted for 83.2 per cent of Public Debt.  About 25.0 per cent of outstanding stock has a residual maturity of up to 5 years at end – March 2017, which implies that over the next five years, on an average, around 5.0 per cent of outstanding stock needs to be repaid every year. Thus, rollover risk in the debt portfolio continues to be low. The implementation of budgeted buy back/ switches during the quarter resulted in reduction of roll over risk.

 

G-sec yields were low across the curve at start of the quarter, post the Government’s decision on November 8, 2016 to demonetize high denomination value notes which led to surge in bank deposits and the bullish market sentiment, particularly for short end bonds. The bullish market sentiment and low yield was however restrained as RBI in its bi-monthly policy review during early February changed the monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral leading to hardening of interest rates in the market. Also on Feb 15, 2017, US Fed indicated that it may hike the rates soon as the economy was growing at a healthy pace which along with the presidential elections in USA also had a negative impact [due to protectionist view of the new Government] leading to hardening of the yields. As such during the quarter, the yields were at elevated levels from Mid-February onwards.

The trading volume of Government securities on an outright basis during Q4 FY 17 decreased by 39.32 per cent over the previous quarter.

                The key initiatives of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance taken in the past 3 years have led to Improvement in India’s Macroeconomic Stability.

 Today, India is one of the bright spots among the major countries in the subdued global economic context. India recorded a growth of 7.9 per cent in 2015-16, as compared to 7.2 per cent in 2014-15 and 6.5 per cent in 2013-14. Predictions by expert agencies suggest that India’s growth rate is set to improve further in 2017-18.

 

In terms of the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) prepared by World Economic Forum for 138 countries, India ranked 39 in 2016-17, as compared to India’s rank in GCI of 60 (among 148 countries) in 2013-14.

 During the last three years, Indian economy has made an improvement in macro-economic stability on the strength of the following indicators, Table 1.

INFLATION

 

The present Government took charge in May 2014 in the backdrop of persistently high inflation, particularly the food inflation. Astute food management and price monitoring by the Government in the last three years helped control the stubbornly persistent inflation. CPI inflation remained under control for the third successive financial year. The average CPI (combined) inflation declined from 9.5 per cent in 2013-14 to 5.9 per cent in 2014-15 and 4.9 per cent in 2015-16. It declined further to 4.6 per cent in the current financial year, upto February 2017 and stood at 3.7 per cent in February 2017 backed by sharp fall in food inflation. Food inflation based on consumer food price index (CFPI) which was in double digits during 2012-2014 declined to 6.4 per cent in 2014-15 and 4.9 per cent in 2015-16. It declined further to 4.4 per cent in the current financial year, upto February 2017 and stood at 2.0 per cent in February 2017.

 

The Government, in consultation with RBI has also fixed the inflation target of 4 per cent with tolerance level of +/- 2 per cent for the period beginning from 5th August, 2016 to 31st March, 2021.

TRADE

 India’s trade deficit was highest at US$ 190.3 billion in 2012-13. However, it declined by 13.8 per cent to US$ 118.7 billion in 2015-16 which was lower than the level of US$ 137.7 billion in 2014-15. During 2016-17 (April-February), trade deficit decreased to US$ 95.3 billion as against US$ 114.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 FOREIGN INVESTMENT

 Inflow of foreign direct investment increased from US$ 43.6 billion 2013-14 to US$ 51.8 billion in 2014-15 and further to US$ 59.5 billion in 2015-16.  During 2016-17 (April-December), net FDI was US$ 31.2 billion as compared to US$ 27.2 billion in 2015-16 (April-December).

 BALANCE OF PAYMENT

 India’s external sector position has been comfortable, with the current account deficit (CAD) progressively contracting from US$ 88.2 billion (4.8 per cent of GDP) in 2012-13 to US$ 22.2 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2015-16. On a cumulative basis, the CAD narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP in April-December 2016 from 1.4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2015-16 on the back of the contraction in the trade deficit.

 EXTERNAL DEBT

 At end-September 2016, India’s external debt stock stood at US$ 484.3 billion, recording a decline of US$ 0.8 billion (0.2 per cent) over the level at end-March 2016.

 Most of the key external debt indicators show an improvement in September 2016. The share of short-term debt in total external debt decreased to 16.8 per cent at end-September 2016 from 17.2 per cent at end-March 2016. India’s foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 76.8 per cent to the total external debt stock at end-September 2016 vis-à-vis 74.3 per cent at end-March 2016.

 India continues to be among the less vulnerable nations in terms of its key debt indicators which compare well with other indebted developing countries. According to the World Bank’s “International Debt Statistics, 2017” which gives external debt data of developing countries for 2015, the ratio of India’s external debt stock to gross national income (GNI) at 23.4 per cent was the fifth lowest. In terms of the cover provided by foreign exchange reserves to external debt, India’s position was sixth highest at 69.7 per cent.

 AGRICULTURE AND FOOD MANAGEMENT

 As per the Second Advance Estimates of National Income released on 28th February 2017, the growth rates in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the agriculture and allied sectors were at 4.4 per cent in 2016-17, 0.8 per cent in 2015-16, (-) 0.2 per cent in 2014-15. As per the second Advance Estimates of production of foodgrains released by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare on 15th February 2017, production of total foodgrains during 2016-17 is estimated at 271.98 million tonnes compared to 251.57 million tonnes in 2015-16 (Final) and 252.02 million tonnes in 2014-15.

 INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

 As per the Second Advance Estimates of National Income 2016-17 released by CSO on 28th February 2017, the growth rates in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the industrial sector were 5.8 per cent in 2016-17, 8.2 per cent in 2015-16 and 6.9 per cent in 2014-15.

The index for eight core industries (comprising crude oil, natural gas, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement, steel, and fertilizers) registered 4.8 per cent growth in 2016-17 (April-January) as compared to 3.4 per cent in 2015-16 and 4.5 per cent in 2014-15.

With the introduction of UDAY scheme in power sector in 2015, most of the States have made significant efforts to reduce AT&C losses. The scheme has already addressed 62% of the DISCOMs’ debt that existed at the end of 2014-15.

                It is widely felt that the spectre of high-value economic offenders absconding from India to defy the legal process seriously undermines the rule of law in India. It is, therefore, felt necessary to provide an effective, expeditious and constitutionally permissible deterrent to ensure that such actions are curbed.

 

            In view of the above context, a Budget Announcement was made by the Government in the Budget 2017-18 that the Government is considering to introduce legislative changes or even a new law to confiscate the assets of such absconders till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. The relevant extract from the Budget Speech is re-produced below. 

 

“In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, including economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of law. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. Government is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or even a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the country, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. Needless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed in such cases.”

 

            Pursuant to the above Budget Announcement, a draft law, known as ‘The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2017’ has been prepared. A copy of the Draft Bill along with an Explanatory Note explaining the key legal provisions of the Bill are also hosted on the home page of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance at http://dea.gov.in/recent-update

 

            All stakeholders concerned / public are requested to forward comments / suggestions that they may wish to submit on the Draft Bill by 3rd June 2017  by e-mail to parveen.k63[at]gov[dot]in or in hard copy to Shri Parveen Kumar, Under Secretary (FSLRC), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Room No. 48, North Block, New Delhi-110001. The decision of the Government with respect to the Draft Bill will be taken after receipt of public / stakeholders comments and after following due procedure thereafter.

                Operation Clean Money Phase I: 18 lakh persons identified; More than 9.72 lakh taxpayers submitted online responses for 13.33 lakh accounts involving cash deposits of around Rs 2.89 lakh crore

 5.68 lakh new cases identified for e-verification process

 The Union Minister of Finance, Shri Arun Jaitley, officially launched the Portal of Operation Clean Money (https://www.cleanmoney.gov.in) in New Delhi today in the presence of senior officers of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue and the Central Board of Direct Taxes.

 The Operation Clean Money was initiated by the Income Tax Department (ITD) on the 31st January, 2017 with the launch of e-verification of large cash deposits made during 9th November to 30th December 2016. In the first phase, around 18 lakh persons were identified in whose case, cash transactions did not appear in line with the tax payer’s profile. There has been an encouraging response to the online verification process and more than 9.72 lakh taxpayers submitted their response without visiting Income tax office up to 12th May, 2017.  These taxpayers have provided response for 13.33 lakh accounts involving cash deposits of around Rs. 2.89 lakh crore. The online responses have been assessed and no further action will be taken in cases of satisfactory explanation.

 The salient features of the Operation Clean Money Portal launched today are:

 ·         Providing comprehensive information at one place consisting of Step by Step Guides, Frequently asked Questions, User Guides, Quick Reference Guides and Training Toolkits related to verification process and other issues.

·         Enabling Citizen Engagement for creating a tax compliant society where every Indian takes pride in paying taxes.  Citizens would be able to support the Operation Clean Money by taking pledge, contribute by engaging and educating fellow citizens, and share their experiences and provide feedback.

·         Enabling Transparent Tax Administration by sharing status reports (including sanitized cases and explanation of verification issues) and thematic analysis reports (e.g. taxpayer segment analysis of cash deposit data).

 The ITD on-boarded two specialised data analytics agencies and a business process management agency to augment departmental capability in analyzing large volumes of cash deposit data, track the compliance status of taxpayers and reporting entities.

 In Phase II of Operation Clean Money, the high risk cases will be handled by selecting appropriate enforcement action (verification, search, survey, scrutiny). A targeted campaign will be initiated in cases with identified risk issues. The key components of the targeted campaign are:


	Communication of specific issue through digital channels (Email, SMS etc.)
	Providing detailed explanation to create environment of transparency
	Sharing investigation findings for specific segments (e.g. Jewellers, petrol pump, traders, property purchasers etc.)
	Centralised monitoring and gradual escalation of inadequate response cases for enforcement action


 With the continuous flow of information from various sources including Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT), the ITD is conducting analysis in conjunction with previously available/analysed data. Such incremental data analysis has already led to identification of new cases for e-verification. Furthermore, ITD has also identified 3.71 lakh new accounts relating to 1.58 lakh taxpayers who made partial declaration of accounts/amounts in their earlier responses.  In addition to the earlier 18 lakh cases, 5.68 lakh new cases have been identified for e-verification process.

 The Income Tax Department urges all taxpayers and citizens to actively participate in Operation Clean Money for a common cause of building a proud nation, which runs on the strength of the honest taxpayers.

A consolidated Outcome Budget 2017-18 was presented in the Parliament as a part of the Budget Documents. Each Scheme will now have a start and a sun-set date co-terminus with the Finance Commission Cycle.

                With a vision to promote people’s ownership of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and a share in their prosperity through disinvestment, and efficient management of public investment in CPSEs for accelerating economic development and augmenting Government’s resources for higher expenditure, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance, has been working tirelessly to achieve these goals.

 



Figure 1: Areas of Achievements of DIPAM in the past three years

 

The major achievements of DIPAM in the past three years are outlined below.

 

1)      Disinvestment Performance

 

          The total disinvestment achieved in the last three years (2014-15 to 2016-2017) was Rs. 87,714 crore as against Rs. 53,670 crore in the previous three-year period. The average yearly realization of Rs. 29,238 crores during the period between 2014-15 to 2016-17 (last 3 years) vis-à-vis Rs. 19,873 crore for the period between 2009-10 to 2013-14 (5 years) represents an increase of 47%.



Figure 2: Disinvestment achieved (Rs crore)

(Figures for 2016-17 are till end February, 2017)

 

2) Accelerating the Disinvestment Process

 

A system of Rolling Plan has been brought-in, replacing the earlier system of annual plans, wherein shares are readily available for transactions, to take advantage of the market conditions without any loss of time and with an element of surprise for the market players. This helps in minimizing the price hammering during disinvestment of CPSEs. 

 



Figure 2: Accelerating the disinvestment process

 

Based on the suggestion made by DIPAM, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) through its circular dated 15th February, 2016 has reduced the notice period for an Offer for Sale (OFS) transaction from T-2 to T-1 (T being the transaction day). This change is now helping in minimizing price hammering between the notice day and the transaction day, which used to take place earlier under the T-2 dispensation.

The Government is evolving an Equity Culture and has made the CPSEs’ disinvestment programme more inclusive by following an approach to reserve 20 per cent of shares in CPSEs-OFS transactions for retail investors on a case to case basis.

 

3) Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)

 

The CPSE ETF allows the Government of India to simultaneously divest multiple stocks spread across various sectors in one bundled instrument, thereby reducing overhang on individual stocks and maximizing the sale proceeds for the Government.

 

The Government launched a Further Fund Offer (FFO) of the CPSE ETF Scheme. Overall, the issue got oversubscribed by 2.30 times – Rs. 13,802 crore worth of applications were received as against the maximum issue size of Rs. 6,000 crore. The number of Retail applications was 2,70,712 (approx. 7 times the Retail applications received during first tranche held in March 2014), with corresponding value of Rs. 2,465 crore. This was one of the largest retail offering (Government / Private) in capital market in last few years. The Government realized an amount to the tune of Rs. 6000 crore through this offer.

 

4) Strategic Disinvestment

 

As a part of the initiative to fast-track strategic disinvestment of CPSEs, the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment (CGD) was constituted on 21st March, 2016. Based on the report of the NITI Aayog and the recommendations of CGD, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 27thOctober, 2016, has approved, ‘in-principle’ the proposal for strategic disinvestment of some CPSEs, units of CPSEs and subsidiaries of CPSEs.

 

For the purpose of uniformity and efficient implementation of strategic disinvestment transactions, the 'flow of activities' to be completed within a specified time in respect of disinvestment of Government equity as well as disinvestment of equity of parent CPSE, subsidiary and sale of units of CPSEs has been prepared and communicated to the concerned Administrative Ministries/Departments for completion of the activities within the specified timeline.

 

These efforts are in sync with the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley’s Budget Speech of 2015-16 where he had stated that “the budget reflects considerable scaling-up of disinvestment figures. This will include both disinvestment in loss making units and some strategic disinvestment.”

 

The objective of strategic disinvestment includes the Government exiting from non-strategic business, unlocking optimum economic potential by promoting efficiency & professional management in such companies.

 

5) Promotion of payments through cards and digital means

 

To promote digital payments, BHIM application has been launched that facilitates digital payment transactions through UPI and USSD modes.  The acceptance infrastructure is being ramped up through procurement of Aadhaar ready PoS machines.  Further, alternative acceptance options through QR code have also been developed.

 

A number of incentives have been provided to encourage digital payments amongst merchants and consumers.  Capacity building and awareness campaigns have been launched by various Departments and State Governments to promote digital payments.  The Business Correspondents network is being expanded through inclusion of Fair Price Shops and Post Offices to provide digital transaction options at various geographically convenient locations.  Seeding of Aadhaar and mobile numbers in the bank accounts is also underway to enable the accountholders to undertake transactions through mobiles or Aadhaar authentications. 

 

6) Time-bound listing of CPSEs on Stock Exchanges

 

The Budget 2017-18 announced to put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. This will enable unlocking the true value of the company and promote ‘people’s ownership’ by encouraging public participation in CPSEs, making them accountable to its shareholders. DIPAM has issued circular dated 17.02.2017 on the mechanism and procedure, along with a list of activities with indicative timelines, for time bound listing of CPSEs by all the Administrative Ministries/Departments.

The Committee constituted by the Finance Minister to suggest the areas in respect of which further Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) may be notified under the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) has suggested the notification of ICDS in respect of Real Estate Transactions and submitted the draft of the same.

 

The draft ICDS submitted by the committee is based on the Guidance Note issued on Real Estate Transactions issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). For the purposes of providing uniformity and certainty and harmonising the same with provisions of the Act, the committee suggested certain changes in draft ICDS.

 

The draft ICDS on Real Estate Transactions along with the significant changes suggested in ICDS vis-à-vis the Guidance Note issued by ICAI are uploaded on the Income-tax website at http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) invites comments from stakeholders on the draft ICDS on Real Estate Transactions, which may be submitted to Director TPL-III by e-mail at dirtpl3[at]nic[dot]in by 26th May, 2017.

 

Section 145(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) provides that the Central Government may notify Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) for any class of assessees or for any class of income. Accordingly, Central Government notified 10 ICDS vide Notification No. S.O. 3079 (E) dated 29th September, 2016. These ICDS inter-alia contain provisions relating to valuation of inventory; construction contracts; effects in changes of foreign exchange rates, borrowing costs etc. These ICDS are applicable from assessment year 2017-18 (previous year 2016-17) in respect of specified assessees for computation of income under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” or “Income from other sources”.

 

The Finance Minister had constituted a Committee comprising of experts from accounting field, departmental officers and representatives from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to suggest the areas in respect of which further ICDS may be notified under the Act.

The Income Tax (IT) Department has made it easy for taxpayers to link their PAN with Aadhaar. Responding to grievances of taxpayers regarding difficulties in linking PAN with Aadhaar as their names did not match in both systems (e.g., names with initials in one and expanded initials in another), the IT Department has come out with a simple solution now.

 

Taxpayers can go to http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in and click on the link on the Left Pane à Link Aadhaar, provide PAN, Aadhaar number and ENTER NAME EXACTLY AS GIVEN IN AADHAAR CARD (avoid spelling mistakes) and Submit. After verification from UIDAI, the linking will be confirmed.

 



Figure 2: Linking Aadhar with PAN simplified

 

 

In case of any minor mismatch in Aadhaar name provided by taxpayer when compared to the actual data in Aadhaar, a One Time Password (Aadhaar OTP) will be sent to the mobile registered with Aadhaar.  Taxpayers should ensure that the date of birth and gender in PAN and Aadhaar are exactly same. In a rare case where Aadhaar name is completely different from name in PAN, then the linking will fail and taxpayer will be prompted to change the name in either Aadhaar or in PAN database. 

 

There is no need to login or be registered on E-filing website. This facility can be used by anyone to link their Aadhaar with PAN. 

 

This facility is also available after login on the e-filing website under Profile settings and choose Aadhaar linking. The details as per PAN will be pre-populated. Enter Aadhaar number and ENTER NAME EXACTLY AS GIVEN IN AADHAAR CARD (avoid spelling mistakes) and Submit.

 

Taxpayers are requested to use the simplified process to complete the linking of Aadhaar with PAN immediately. This will be useful for E-Verification of Income Tax returns using OTP sent to their mobile registered with Aadhaar.

                Dr. Hasmukh Adhia, Revenue Secretary, Government of India, expressed his satisfaction with the preparation for the roll-out of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1st July, 2017. He was holding a detailed review of IT Preparedness for GST System at the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) office in national capitalyesterday. The meeting was attended by Smt. Vanaja N. Sarna, Chairperson Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), Shri Navin Kumar, Chairman GSTN, Shri B. N. Sharma, Additional Secretary Revenue, Shri S. Ramesh, Member CBEC, Shri Prakash Kumar, CEO GSTN, Shri Binod H. R., Executive Vice President, Infosys and Shri C. N. Raghupathi, Infosys India Business Unit Head.

Dr. Adhia reviewed GST System preparedness of GSTN and CBEC. He was briefed about the software system being developed for GST, training of tax officials and outreach program being undertaken by Tax Departments across the nation. Out of 62,937 tax officials, 24,668 tax officials have been given hands-on training on the application software on live system while the remaining officials will be trained by 15th June, 2017. The training is being conducted on Registration, Returns and Payment Modules developed by GSTN.

 

GSTN is also conducting a pilot on GST System Software from 2nd May to 16th May, 2017, where 3200 taxpayers drawn from each State/UT and Centre will be participating. The pilot covers all the three modules and is being run to give the taxpayers first hand opportunity to work on the live system as the creation of return has become an interactive process.

 

This pilot will also give an opportunity to test all the modules by a large set of users in real life environment so that all possible scenarios get tested. All stakeholders involved in the GST System from taxpayer to bank to RBI to accounting authorities are participating in this exercise which is like a rehearsal for the real rollout. The feedback from the pilot will be used to further improve the GST Software. The modules covered under the pilot are:

 

        i.            Upload of invoice data using Offline Tool, developed by GSTN

      ii.            Creation of Supply Return (GSTR-1)

    iii.            Viewing auto-generated inward supply (Purchase) Return (GSTR-2A)

    iv.            Editing of GSTR-2A by purchaser to create final inward supply return (GSTR-2)

      v.            Viewing and acceptance/rejection of added invoice data by purchaser (GSTR-1A)

    vi.            Viewing System generated GSTR-3, payment of taxes using net banking and submission of GSTR-3.

  vii.            Creation of bank scroll by Banks and RBI,

viii.            Reconciliation of payment by Accounting Authorities with data received from Banks and RBI

 

The Revenue Secretary Dr Adhia also reviewed the progress on enrollment of existing taxpayers. As on 30th April 2017, when Phase-1 of enrollment was closed, 60.5 lakh taxpayers out of 84 lakh had enrolled. The enrollment window will be re-opened for 15 days from 1st June,2017 to give another opportunity to taxpayers to enroll.

The Finance Act, 2017 inserted clause (x) in sub-section (2) of Section 56 of the Income-tax Act 1961(‘the Act’) so as to widen the scope of taxability of receipt of sum of money or property without/inadequate consideration. Under the said clause read with Rule 11UA of the Income-tax Rules, 1962(‘ the Rules’) if a person receives jewellery or artistic work or shares and securities for no / inadequate consideration, the fair market value(FMV) of the same is taken into account for computing taxable income under the said clause. Similarly, for immovable property, the stamp duty value is taken into consideration for determining taxability under the same section. However when these assets are received as underlying assets of unquoted equity shares of company, the book value (and not the FMV / stamp duty value) is taken into consideration for determining the value of such shares.

 

Further, the Finance Act, 2017 inserted new Section 50CA in the Act with effect from 1st April, 2018 to provide that where consideration for transfer of unquoted equity share of a company is less than the FMV of such share determined in accordance with the prescribed manner, the FMV shall be deemed to be the full value of consideration for the purposes of computing income under the head ""Capital gains"". 

 

In view of this, it is proposed to amend the Rules to prescribe the method of valuation of unquoted equity share for the purpose of clause(x) of sub-section (2) of section 56 and section 50CA of the Act by taking into account the FMV of jewellery, artistic work, shares & securities and stamp duty value in case of immovable property and book value for the rest of the assets.

 

In order to have wider consultation in this matter, the draft of proposed Amendment of Rules under the Income-tax Rules, 1962 to prescribe the method of valuation of unquoted shares for the purpose of clause(x) of sub-section (2) of Section 56 and Section 50CA of the Act has been uploaded on the website www.incometaxindia.gov.in. The stakeholders are requested to send their comments/suggestions on the draft notification by 19th May, 2017 to the e-mail address (dirtpl2[at]nic[dot]in).

The promulgation of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 inserting two new Sections (viz. 35AA and 35AB) after Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 enables the Union Government to authorize the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to direct banking companies to resolve specific stressed assets by initiating insolvency resolution process, where required. The RBI has also been empowered to issue other directions for resolution, and appoint or approve for appointment, authorities or committees to advise banking companies for stressed asset resolution. 

This action of the Union Government will have a direct impact on effective resolution of stressed assets, particularly in consortium or multiple banking arrangements, as the RBI will be empowered to intervene in specific cases of resolution of non-performing assets, to bring them to a definite conclusion. 

The Government is committed to expeditious resolution of stressed assets in the banking system. The recent enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 has opened up new possibilities for time bound resolution of stressed assets. The SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Acts have been amended to facilitate recoveries. A comprehensive approach is being adopted for effective implementation of various schemes for timely resolution of stressed assets.

                Eight States have passed the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Act in their respective State Assembly in less than a month’s time. The Legislative Assembly of Telangana State passed the State GST Act on 9th April, 2017, that of Bihar State passed it on 24th April, 2017, Rajasthan Assembly on 26th April, 2017, that of Jharkhand on 27th April, 2017, Chhattisgarh Assembly on 28th April, 2017, that of Uttarakhand on 2nd May, 2017, Madhya Pradesh Assembly on 3rd May, 2017 while the Assembly of State of Haryana passed the State GST Bill today i.e. 4th May, 2017. 

Earlier the GST Council had approved the model State GST (SGST) Bill in its 12th Meeting held on 16th March, 2017. The remaining States/UTs (having Legislative Assembly) are likely to pass the State GST Bill in their respective Assemblies before the end of this month, except one or two States which may pass the same in early next month. 

The next GST Council meeting is scheduled to be held at Srinagar, J&K on 18th and 19th May, 2017. The Central Government has already informed that GST will be rolled-out from 1st July, 2017. The quick passage of the State GST Act by the different State Assemblies in a time bound manner shows the keenness on the part of the State Governments to ensure that implementation of the GST in letter and spirit is not further delayed and takes place from 1st July, 2017 as targeted by the Central Government. The officers of the Department of Revenue, Government of India led by the Revenue Secretary, Dr. Hasmukh Adhia and the concerned officials of the State Governments have already started the outreach programme in order to create general awareness among the people at large and stakeholders in particular and remove their doubts, if any, about the various provisions of GST and its related legislations.

                “In the last three years our efforts have been towards building a ‘Swasth Bharath’ and as such prevention of diseases and timely intervention will always remain in the forefront, whether for Communicable or Non-Communicable Diseases,” stated Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare. He was speaking at the inauguration of National Training for Universal Screening and Control of five Common Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes and three common cancers: cervix, breast and oral cavity, here today. Also present was Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State (Health & Family Welfare). 

Speaking at the occasion, Shri J P Nadda stated that under the universal screening of common NCDs program, everyone above the age of 30 years will be screened in the 100 districts of the country in the first phase. Gradually, it will cover the entire country and around 50 crore people will be covered so that timely intervention can reduce the disease burden in the country, Shri Nadda said. “NCDs are acquired lifestyle ailments, which places a very high burden through the healthcare cost,” Shri Nadda added. The Health Ministry is working through a two-pronged strategy, he stated. This included healthy children through the total immunization program whereby in the past three years, the basket of vaccines has been increased from providing cover to 11 vaccine preventable diseases, from the earlier six. This is complemented by the goals set under the National Health Policy 2017 which has sharpened the focus towards promotive and preventive health care and wellness; these mandate the government to shift attention to non-communicable diseases. 

Shri Nadda further said that much progress has been made in past two years and now NCD clinics have been operational in more than 400 districts. “We have adopted 10 National targets in our action plan to prevent and control NCDs. 20 State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and 50 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) are being set up for providing comprehensive Cancer care. National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar (with bed capacity of 710) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also being established,” Shri Nadda added. 

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State (Health & Family Welfare) said that the challenge and threat from NCDs has increased manifold and around 90 lakh people die every year due to these diseases. Smt Anupriya Patel further stated that 7 crore people are suffering from diabetes and around 7-8 crore from cardio vascular diseases. She further informed that 13 lakh patients of cancer are added every year. “All these figures explain the magnitude of the issue in hand. All these are lifestyle generated and can easily be prevented, she said. Smt Anupriya Patel emphasized on the need for generating awareness about these issues and collaborating with various stakeholders like community, NGO, etc. 

Shri J P Nadda also released a set of four training modules for primary health care team constituting the frontline workers, namely, the ASHAs and ANMs and the facility based service providers, namely - the Staff Nurses and the Medical Officers. 

Also present at the event were Dr. Jagdish Prasad, DGHS; Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary (Health); Shri Manoj Jhalani, Joint Secretary; Shri Navdeep Rinwa, Joint Secretary and other senior officers of the Health Ministry and representatives of development partners.

“No child should die in the country from Vaccine Preventable Diseases” is the Goal & Commitment of our government. We stand committed to reducing child deaths and providing a healthier future to our children.” Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare stated this as he announced the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) of the country in a function at Mandi, today. Terming this as an historic moment and an exemplary step in India’s immunization programme, the Union Health Minister added that the Government is committed to reducing morbidity and mortality in children. Strengthening routine immunization is an essential investment in India’s children and will ensure a healthy future of the country, he noted. 

PCV protects children against severe forms of pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia and meningitis. Currently, the vaccine is being rolled out to approximately 21 lakh children in Himachal Pradesh and parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the first phase. This will be followed by introduction in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan next year, and eventually be expanded to the country in a phased manner. Shri Kaul Singh Thakur, Minister of Health, Government of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Ram Swaroop Sharma, Member of Parliament, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh and Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary, Health, were also present at the function. 

Reiterating the commitment of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to save lives of children against vaccine preventable diseases, Shri Nadda said that the Government has taken notable steps in the direction of total immunisation. Under Mission Indradhanush, so far, more than 2.6 crore beneficiaries have been immunized. From 1% annual increase in coverage of Full Immunization, Mission Indradhanush has resulted in a 6.7 % annual expansion in the immunization cover. “The immunization programme started with providing protection against 6 vaccine preventable diseases, it will now offer protection to our children from 12 diseases,” Shri Nadda said. 

The Health Minister further said that all these vaccines were available in the private sector for many years, not only in India but also across the world. “While these vaccines in the private sector were accessible to only those who could afford them, by making them available under the UIP, the government is ensuring equitable access to those who need them the most, the underprivileged and underserved,” Shri Nadda added.

“Pneumonia kills more children under five years of age in India than any other infectious disease. The pentavalent vaccine which was scaled up in all states under the UIP by 2015 protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) pneumonia. Now, the introduction of PCV in the UIP will reduce child deaths from pneumococcal pneumonia. It will also reduce the number of children being hospitalized for pneumonia, and therefore reduce the economic burden on the families and the health cost burden on the country,” The Health Minister elaborated.

The Health Minister informed that the ICT-based Patient Satisfaction System (PSS) “Mera Aspataal / My Hospital” for implementation in public and empanelled private hospitals, is envisaged to empower the patient by seeking his / her views on quality of experience in a public healthcare facility. He further said that the Free Drugs Services Initiative, universal screening for non-communicable diseases for all people above 19 years to be rolled out shortly in select 100 districts in the first phase, the Free Diagnostics Services Initiative, the District Hospital Strengthening support, roll out of comprehensive primary health care, and Quality Assurance Programme - all represent initiatives intended to reduce fragmentation of care, improve quality of care and reduce out of pocket expenses. 

Shri Kaul Singh Thakur, Minister of Health, Government of Himachal Pradesh, stated that PCV is a very important for children as it will provide protection cover to all the children below 5 years of age from pneumonia and meningitis. Shri Kaul thanked Shri J P Nadda for launching the PCV from Mandi Himachal Pradesh. “This vaccine will support efforts of the state government in further bringing down the child mortality,” he added.

To raise awareness about PCV, Shri Nadda also unveiled the communication material comprising TV and radio spots, posters, banners, etc. at the event. The Ministry has planned an extensive awareness campaign so that maximum number of people can avail these services.

Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five years of age globally and in India. India accounts for nearly 20% of global pneumonia deaths in this age group. In 2010, pneumococcal pneumonia accounted for approximately 16% of all severe pneumonia cases and 30% of pneumonia related deaths in children under- five years of age in India. Introducing PCV, therefore, will substantially reduce disease burden in the country.

Also present at the function were Smt. Vandana Gurnani, Joint Secretary (RCH, IEC), Shri Prabodh Saxena, Principal Secretary (Health), Govt. of Himachal Pradesh along with the other senior officers of the Health Ministry and Himachal Pradesh Government and representatives of development partners such as WHO, UNICEF, PHFI etc

Members of a five country international delegation called on Shri C K Mishra, Secretary Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, here today. They interacted with the Health Secretary to learn more about the global best practice of eVIN (electronic vaccine intelligence network) project of the Health Ministry and to understand how it is being implemented in the country and the ways in which it be replicated in their own countries. Representatives from Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand are on a visit to India to study the project. Mr. Jaco Cilliers, Country Director, UNDP and Dr Rakesh Kumar, Addl. Country Director, UNDP were also present during the meeting.

Shri Mishra said that the Ministry is ready to provide support and collaborate with other countries to strengthen their capacities and scale up their programs. He also stated that this is a big boost for the Digital India and Make in India initiatives of the Government. This sets a benchmark in the field of immunisation, he said. The delegation shared the experience from their countries of the immunisation projects, and expressed the shared view that the India visit shall enrich them to strengthen their own country programs.

Stating that India has a lot to share in terms of best practices and new learning, Mr. Jaco Cilliers, Country Director, UNDP stated that such visits provide an opportunity to other countries to learn from these best practices of India in the field of immunisation and strengthen their own programs.

Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Addl. Country Director, UNDP stated that while the country is working towards enhancing the coverage of immunisation, quality of vaccines through maintenance of the right temperature is also a critical component to for the quality and efficacy of the vaccines. eVIN is a step towards ensuring that, he stated.

eVIN (Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network) is an indigenously developed technology system in India that digitizes vaccine stocks and monitors the temperature of the cold chain through a smartphone application. The innovative eVIN is presently being implemented called across twelve states in India. eVIN aims to support the Government of India’s Universal Immunization Programme by providing real-time information on vaccine stocks and flows, and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in these states. The technological innovation is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

eVIN aims to strengthen the evidence base for improved policy-making in vaccine delivery, procurement and planning for new antigens in India. eVIN provides an integrated solution to address widespread inequities in vaccine coverage by supporting state governments in overcoming constraints of infrastructure, monitoring and management information systems and human resources, often resulting in overstocking and stock-outs of vaccines in storage centres.

The integrated solution combines:


	Technology: to facilitate evidence-based decision-making by making available online real-time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperature through the eVIN application software and temperature loggers;


 


	Governance: to ensure efficient vaccine logistics management by systemizing record keeping through standardizing stock and distribution registers; identifying gaps and improving clarity on vaccine cold chain network; drawing attention to infrastructure upgrades; developing standard operating procedures; and encouraging good practices;


 


	Human Resources: to empower the state cold chain network by building the capacities of government cold chain handlers; and deploying vaccine and cold chain managers in every district for constant support to estimate vaccine requirements, supervise cold chain handlers and coordinate with cold chain technicians across the district.


 

 

eVIN empowers the cold chain handlers by building technical capacities and providing a robust decision-making tool for cold chain managers through a complete overview of vaccine replenishment times, supply and consumption patterns.

 

By streamlining the vaccine flow network, eVIN is a powerful contribution to strengthening health systems and ensures equity through easy and timely availability of vaccines to all children.

The more you learn, you will understand that you know so little,” Shri Nadda said. “ This is the first time such a foundation training programme is being undertaken. This will also orient you to your roles and responsibilities about healthcare delivery systems in the country, legal ethical issues, and schemes programme of the Ministry, OPD, emergencies, pharmacies, administration AYUSH, Yoga, etc. You will learn new things,” Shri Nadda mentioned. 

Shri Nadda further stated that the course provides an opportunity to expand ones horizons, learn the philosophy and depth of life. “Trainings provide a platform to further know your strengths, weaknesses and be dedicated to your service,” Shri Nadda added. 

Speaking at the function, Shri Faggan Sing Kulaste, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare said that these trainings will provide an opportunity to enhance the existing potential and skills for being more effective medical officers. “The nine week course especially designed for the new recruits will enable the medical officers to broaden their knowledge base, confidence level and experience in public health facilities,” Shri Kulaste said. 

Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare stated that this course will contribute greatly to the public healthcare of the country. “With technical skills, soft skills are also important as doctors deal with lives and wellbeing of patients,” she said. Encouraging the participants, she stated that understanding administrative procedures, enhancing inter-personal behavioural skills and better knowledge of healthcare schemes/programme will improve their capacity for higher efficiency. 

Central Health Service (CHS) Cadre is a cadre governed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and its doctors are working all over the country providing health care services to a large number of people. CHS has four sub-cadres, namely, GDMOs, Teaching, Non-Teaching Specialists and Public Health, with a sanctioned strength of more than 4000 of which the GDMOs constitute the largest chunk, more than 2000. 

On an average, every year around 400 to 600 doctors are recruited through UPSC. Incidentally, throughout the under-graduate and post-graduate education and thereafter, these doctors are not been trained in the areas of management, supervision, leadership, communication, conduction of office procedures, etc. The training module is designed to fill this gap so that they can look after the administration of the organization and implementation of various national health programmes for which they have very limited exposure. 

Also present at the event were senior officials from the Health Ministry and NIHFW.

At present, the Indian auto industry is contributing by approximately 7.1 percent in the country’s total GDP. Recently, the India’s two wheeler industry has become the largest market in the world after replacing China. These days, the way technology is evolving, the Government of India is also looking forward to adopt new and different pathways to promote clean, safe, cheap and futuristic mobility services. This will help in creating new jobs both in research, development and manufacturing sector. As per the recent report of NITI Aayog on Transformative Mobility Solutions for All, India can reduce it energy demand by 64 percent and carbon emissions by 37 percent with the help of connected, shared and electric passenger mobility across the country. 

 

The Minister said currently, the Government is also promoting the use of electric vehicles under FAME India Scheme, as it would help the Government to reduce the dependency on oil import. The National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP) will play a crucial role to achieve the goals set by Government in the automotive sector under various initiative like BNVSAP, up-coming BS VI Emission norms, Make in India initiative, Skill India, Minimum Government Maximum Governance etc. in coming years.

 

He said NATRIP is the largest and one of the most significant initiative of the Government of India in the Automotive sector so far and represents a unique joining of hands between the Government of India, a number of State Governments and Indian Automotive Industry to create a state of the art Testing, Validation and R&D infrastructure in the country.

 

The Project aims at creating core global competencies in Automotive sector in India and facilitate seamless integration of Indian Automotive industry with the world as also to position the country prominently on the global automotive map, Shri Geete added. 

 

He said the Global Automotive Research Centre (GARC) is one of the biggest test centre established by Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises under NATRIP which is spread over 304 acres of land having the research & development laboratories and test tracks at one location.

 

The GARC has full-fledged homologation test facilities including the Test Tracks to certify all categories of vehicles, systems and components as per national and international standards.

 

This centre is surrounded by major automobile manufacturers like Hyundai, Daimler, Renault, Nissan, Ford, BMW, Mitsubishi and many component manufacturers. Recently, Government of India has notified GARC as one of the authorized test agency for Type Approval and Homologation Testing under Rule No.126 of CMVR.

 

The Minister express the hope that homologation facilities will help the manufacturer to save their cost to test their product elsewhere in the country or abroad for both domestic and international market. He said it is evident from the construction works that these test tracks are of global standards. He express confidence that these facilities will attract many more major players from the automotive industry to setup their facilities in the State of Tamil Nadu.

 

GARC-Chennai with an overall investment of Rs. 963 Cr. is one such and largest endeavour under NATRiP banner.

GARC is one of the six facilities being developed under NATRiP (National automotive Testing and Infrastructure Project) under Department of Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises, Government of India. GARC has a total of 304 Acres of land where it houses all other automotive test related facilities and out of that the test track covers ¾th of the total land area. It has 5 different types of test track namely high speed track (HST), gradient or hill track, External noise track (ENT), Braking surface track (BST) & steering pad. GARC will have Steering Pad Track, External Noise Test Tracks, Hill Test Tracks with various gradients, ABS test tracks with different friction surfaces and the High Speed test track of 4.5kms length for homologation activities. The total cost of Test tracks project being 193.25 Crore.

 

GARC located in southern auto-cluster of the country is now notified under the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 to issue test certificates for homologation. The facilities are expected to be used by the automotive OEMs and component manufacturers for homologation and R&D. The commissioning of this facility is expected to encourage effects to towards “made India” and invite greater investments in the automotive and automotive component sector.

                Shri Anant G. Geete, Union Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises today inaugurated the three day long CSR Fair 2017 at Pragati Maidan here in New Delhi. This mega event is organised by The Department of Public Enterprises, Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises; PHD Chamber in collaboration with ONGC, to provide a platform to all stakeholders, including Central Ministries/Departments, CPSEs/State PSUs, Private Companies, NGOs/Foundations etc. for showcasing their CSR activities, sharing of their best practices and also an opportunity to connect with other stakeholders.

 



 

            In his welcome address Dr. Madhukar Gupta Additional Secretary in the Department of Public Enterprises highlighted the importance of this event and appreciated the overwhelming response of the participants.

 



 

            Union Minister Shri Anant Geete exhorted upon the CPSEs to focus on core areas of social sector especially the Swachtha Abhiyaan, Education and Drinking Water on priority basis. He said, though the  amendments carried out in the Companies Act, 2013 making it mandatory for the establishments to incur 2 percent spending on CSR activities from their profit, be it in private sector or the CPSEs, still a voluntary approach and mind set in this regard is capable of bringing sea changes. He said the Swachtha Abhiyaan is running successfully just because of the active participation of CPSEs. The Minister said it is just because of the lack of sanitation facilities in our rural areas school that is aggravating the school dropout cases of girls. Shri Geete said lack of basic infrastructure facilities in rural areas is hindering the quest of students for Secondary and Higher Education. He also referred to the drinking water scarcity in our country. Shri Geete said there is no dearth of either funds or resources in our country and hence the CSR activities should be oriented in this direction amicably.

 



 

Shri Geete referred to the Prime Minister initiative’s of Skill India, Digital India and Make in India and made a fervent appeal to the CPSEs heads to follow the guidelines chalked out by the DPE in this regard. He however expressed concern on the said reports of CSR funds getting diverted by frivolous means to NGOs. He advised the CPSEs to remain vigilant and cautious in this regard. He said success of CPSEs ultimately makes the Ministry and the Minister successful on every count. He said “I am proud of the exemplary work rendered by our CPSEs for CSR activities so far.” Shri Geete expressed the hope that this will continue for him too. He further hoped that the deliberations in this three day meet will certainly frame a new charter of success.

 

On this occasion Minister of State in the Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo lauded the role of CPSEs in fostering the CSR measures satisfactorily. 

 

The uniqueness of this event lies in the activities as there will be:

 

§  Three days of dedicated information packed sessions on CSR

§  Never before opportunity to meet Who’s Who of CSR

§  Personalized solutions from CSR experts

§  Innovative case study presentations of successful CSR interventions by the leaders

§  Side Events: Exhibition by all stakeholders, including Central Ministries/Departments, CPSEs/State PSUs, Private Companies, NGOs/Foundations etc.

§  Launch of CSR Compendium, it will be an exhaustive review of success stories of CSR initiatives of CPSEs/State PSUs, Private Companies, NGOs/Foundations etc.

 

The objective of fair is to provide a leading platform to corporate leaders, organizations, implementing agencies and business experts to identify practical solutions for the problems concerning the participatory implementation of CSR projects at the ground level. Besides, this is to brainstorm a way forward to integrate CSR into core business values of the corporate houses, and to give an opportunity to network and build mutually enriching strategic relationships with various stakeholders and key partners.

 

The agenda of CSR fair includes:

 

·         Business leaders and Directors of Companies to gain valuable insights into emerging trends and issues concerning CSR

·         CSR Heads, CSR Committee members seeking creative and innovative ideas for CSR planning

·         Compliance managers who wish to seek solutions and advise relating to CSR

·         Civil society groups, development sector organizations to explore partnership opportunities with industries

·         Development sector organizations seeking like-minded corporate houses for CSR projects and collaboration

·         Social entrepreneurs for mutually enriching networking and partnerships

·         CSR consultants for networking and partnerships

·         Academicians, researchers, implementing agencies and other stakeholders.

 

The importance of this event is in the light of sequences after the introduction of the Companies Act as it has changed the CSR landscape in India by putting in place-legal provisions that have had a domino effect that includes better informed and sensitized stakeholders, and a development sector that has begun to align itself to accepting CSR funds from corporates. In the realm of Business Sustainability, SEBI has mandated Business Responsibility Reporting for top 500 listed companies based on their market capitalization from 1 April 2016. This move is an effort to improve corporate governance practices and transparency in terms of reporting of socially responsible activities carried out by the business houses.

                The closing ceremony of Sashastra Seema Bal’s (SSB) 7th Inter-Frontier Band Competition was held here yesterday. The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju was the Chief Guest of the closing ceremony which was studded with dazzling programmes and prize distribution. 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Rijiju said that Bands in the Security Forces have a long history. Earlier during war time instruments like Truhi, Shankh were used to start or end the war whereas Drum Rolls and Nagada were used to announce attack and other tactics in the war field. Similarly during modern days, the band is an integral part of ceremonial events and parades. Bands play motivating tunes to keep the morale of troops high and also entertain the troops during their leisure time. 

Speaking on the occasion, Director General, SSB Smt. Archana Ramasundaram said this Inter-Frontier Band Competition was started in 2011 with a motive to provide a platform for the band performers. She congratulated all the SSB Frontier Band Team participants and motivated them to excel in all competitions. 

Smt. Renuka Mishra, IG (P&T), in her address, highlighted about the number of Bands SSB is having at present and the prominent place which SSB occupies among All India Police Band competition. 

The evening started with a spectacular demonstration of synchronised Pipe and Brass Band of Silliguri Frontier, which was followed by splendid display by others participant band teams. A symphony concert was organised in which members of SSB’s Central Band Team also participated. DG, SSB applauded the contribution of Retd. Col. GP Thapliyal and Major Ashok Kumar in preparing this concert. 

The Siliguri Frontier secured First position in Brass Band, Lucknow Frontier secured First position in Bugler competition, Patna Frontier was adjudged First in Pipe and Brass Band whereas Jazz Band competition was won by Guwahati Frontier.

                The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir flagged off the “Bicycle Patrols” launched by the Delhi Police at a function here today. The Chief Guest flagged off the first batch of 65 bicycles allotted to the Eastern Range of Delhi Police in the presence of the Guest of Honour, Shri Manoj Tiwari, MP, Shri Amulya Patnaik, Commissioner of Police, Delhi and a large number of police officers and residents including Police Mitras of the three districts of Eastern Range.

As a 'green' initiative for patrolling the parks, congested lanes and by-lanes, the cooperative societies etc, the Delhi Police has introduced bicycle patrols to complement and supplement its existing motorcycle and PCR patrols which focus mainly on crime prevention along the arterial and main roads of Delhi.

Cycle patrols can go where traditional patrol vehicles cannot. The bicycle patrols will reach the narrow and heavily congested areas where mechanized vehicles find it difficult to reach and maintain a steady presence. They will also be utilized for patrolling during odd hours when the residents are taking rest, since they are less disturbing.

One of the main areas of focus of these bicycle patrols will be parks where citizens including senior citizens and women go for morning and evening walks. The bicycle patrols will also be introduced in the University campus areas and near schools/colleges where the police officers can have a friendly interface with the student community.

With zero environmental costs and additional health benefits for the riders, the bicycle patrol parties will also bring the concept of 'Policing by community involvement’ close to the largely immigrant and working class population which inhabits several areas of these three districts. The credibility and legitimacy of policing largely depends on the community support that follows from transparency in police functioning, integrity in exercise of its functions/services, and the accountability in doing so. The camaraderie developed by the bicycle patrol officers will further strengthen the strong community-oriented policing practised by Delhi Police.

The bicycle patrols will mostly be in 'buddy pairs' and will normally cover a distance of 2 to 5 kilometres per patrol. The patrolling officers are equipped with standard police communication equipment which will operate in 'hands-free mode' and function like mobile police posts of the local Police Station. Each bicycle has been fitted with cell phone docks and equipment for keeping other accessories.

While focusing on the ‘Policing by community involvement’ model, the bicycle patrols will, apart from assuring the law abiding citizenry of their friendly and protective presence, also play the role of area domination, sending out a message of deterrence to the law breakers in the vicinity. Being slow paced, the spectrum of observation of bicycle patrol officers will be qualitatively much more meaningful in detecting unwarranted movements and questionable/suspicious presence in the areas of patrol. The officers are being specifically trained to make a note of the happenings around them for sharing and validation.

As a beginning, a total of 65 high-end bicycles have been operationalized, - 30 for North East district, 20 for East district and 15 for Shahdara district. The scheme will be extended to other areas of Delhi in due course.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon the youth to abide by the values in all situations of life, which will make them winner and help them achieve anything in life. Delivering the Convocation Address at the 30th Convocation of Kurukshetra University at Kurukshetra, Haryana today, Shri Rajnath Singh said that convocation connotes the completion of study for a degree, but not the completion of education, which is a lifelong process. In the Indian context, the convocation purports qualification of an individual to serve the society through the knowledge and skills imbibed through education. World remembers the people for their values and their service to the society and not because of their wealth, might or even knowledge, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said that India aspires to be a vishwa guru and  not a super-power because a nation becomes a super-power by might, dominance and even coercion and the nations come to it because of fear. As a vishwa guru, people will join with India because they would see their well being. He acknowledged the contribution of the youth in making India a vishwa guru and called upon them to draw inspiration from the rich heritage and feel proud of belonging to a great nation.

Speaking on the occasion, Governor of Haryana and Chancellor of Kurukshetra University, Prof. Kaptan Singh Solanki said that education should imply using the knowledge to establish a change in life. Chief Minister of Haryana, Shri Manohar Lal congratulated Kurukshetra University for being ranked as No. One University in Haryana and among top 100 institutions of higher education in the country in the NIRF survey.

About 2,000 students were conferred with the Masters, M.Phil and Ph.D degrees at the Convocation. On this occasion, Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh and Shri Manohar Lal were conferred with Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) in Science and Doctor of Literature (Honoris Causa) in Social Science degrees for their contribution to the knowledge domain and their service to the society.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju Co-chaired a Plenary session on “National and Local DRR Strategies”, along with Paraguay’s Minister for National Emergency Secretariat, Mr. Joaquin Roa and Mayor of Tlalnepantla, Mexico, Ms. Denisse Ugalde Alegría at Cancun, Mexico yesterday. Following are the key recommendations made by Shri Kiren Rijiju, while presenting the summary of the session.

 

·         Strategies: The strategies of the national and local Governments should be in alignment, integrated, supportive and supplementary. The policies, legal frame work, directives, and guidelines of the national Government should support the strategies of the local for implementation, enforcement, development planning and mitigation at the local level. What we need is “Globalisation” of strategies.

 

·         Financial resources. The national and local Governments should have their own budgets for DRR. But the additional support should be from national Governments for risk reduction. This mitigation fund should be based on a formula based on risk, population etc. and also should be based on a system to give incentives to the good work done by the local Governments and communities.

 

·         Capacity Building: The local Governments should pro-actively build capacity of the institutions and communities for DRR. The national Government should support capacity building through networking of institutions, technical support, documenting and sharing best practices, up scaling successful projects at local level- decentralisation for DRR cannot be successful unless adequate capacity is built at the local level. Capacity building of women for DRR leadership must be given special emphasis. Further special action to be taken to care for disabled, old aged and children.

 

A special round table meeting was convened by UN Deputy Secretary General Ms. Amina J. Mohammed, to exchange views on coherence between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sendai framework and Paris agreement on Climate Change. Representing India at the meeting, Dr. P. K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, emphasised that disaster resilient infrastructure is a strategic entry point which will help us not only achieving the targets enshrined in the Sendai framework but also help in achieving SDGs and implement the Paris agreement. India emphasised that there is a need to bring greater focus in investing at the local level. The meeting was also attended by the leaders of 13 countries.

 

The Indian delegation led by the Minister, held bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Global Platform with delegations of Mongolia, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Japan and UNDP. These countries showed their willingness to work closely with India and to share mutual experience and expertise in various areas of DRR.

                2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction  opened in Cancun, Mexico yesterday. The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju is leading the Indian delegation. Shri Rijiju made the country statement in the special session organized for the Ministers. The members of the delegation, - Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to Prime Minister and  Shri Kamal Kishore, Member NDMA, addressed the gathering in two different thematic sessions. 

 

While addressing in critical infrastructure session Dr. P.K. Mishra said that the damage and loss resulting from impacts on critical infrastructure accounts for as high as 66% of the public sector losses and there is also the untold story of small and medium scale disasters, where the damage to infrastructure may not be catastrophic but its progressive degradation leads to productivity losses and makes communities dependent on this infrastructure more vulnerable. These damages disrupt economic and social activities and lead to hardship and distress, particularly for the poor and handicapped.

 

While referring to PM’s 10 point agenda for Disaster Risk Reduction, Dr. Mishra emphasized   for international cooperation and initiative of forming a coalition on risk resilient infrastructure which will address the most pressing needs in infrastructure development and help us create a knowledge base that will benefit all countries. Preliminarily, the focus will be on four thematic areas, - Understanding of risk in infrastructure sectors, risk metrics, indicators of sustainability, better standards of design, operations and maintenance, enforcement, regulation, Regulating the professions,  financing of disaster resilient infrastructure and mechanisms to support recovery in infrastructure sectors.

 

Shri Kamal Kishore, in his address on monitoring the progress of Sendai Framework, flagged the clarity of each partner and said their roles should be very clearly defined and the monitoring indicators should align with the system of governance. He said that appropriate time should also be given for understanding the monitoring indicators and efforts should be made for capacity development so that it should be understood properly at every level of governance.

 

On the sidelines, Shri Rijiju held two delegation level bilateral meetings with Mongolia and Indonesia for future collaboration for Disaster Management. Minister of Interior led Indonesian team and Deputy Prime Minister, Mongolia led the Mongolian Government team. Dr. P.K Mishra also  participated  in the meeting. On the request made by these countries, India has offered to help both the countries for disaster management, response and capacity building.  A draft MoU will be shared amongst the countries to have specific areas of collaboration.

 

A unique plan made by Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India for protecting animals was also launched in the global platform.

 While presenting the Country Statement yesterday, Shri Kiren Rijiju briefed about the steps taken by India, after the adoption of the Sendai Framework. He said that in June 2016, Prime Minister of India launched the National Disaster Management Plan which aligns with the Sendai priorities. He said that, at Regional level, India had hosted the first Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction after the adoption of Sendai Framework in November 2016, which brought together more than 50 countries from the Asia-Pacific and adopted the Asia Regional Plan for the implementation of Sendai Framework.

 The Minister said that, through strengthening statistical capacity, India is putting in place systems for monitoring progress and taking practical steps towards achievement of Sendai targets. He said that, with regards to Target A, India is analyzing the patterns of disaster mortality, both spatially and temporally, for different hazards and taking focused, urgent steps to reduce preventable deaths. India is on course towards achieving Target E of the Sendai framework pertaining to development of plans and strategies by 2020, he added. Shri Kiren Rijiju said that on 7th May, 2017, India had launched South Asia Geostationary Communication Satellite with an aim to support and improve communication, weather forecasting, natural resource mapping, disaster information transfer etc. among the South Asian countries, which demonstrates India's strong sense of commitment towards Target F and G. We are also mainstreaming Sendai principles in the national flagship programmes, he added.

 Shri Kiren Rijiju said that DRR is a work in progress and in this respect we look for opportunities to collaborate with other countries, learn from their experiences and share what we have learned through ours work.

 The Minister held bilateral meetings on the sidelines of GPDRR with Indonesia and Mongolia and also met representatives of civic societies from India who are attending GPDRR.

 In one of the session on ‘Ensuring Risk Resilient Critical Infrastructure’, Dr. P. K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister highlighted the need to focus on critical infrastructure since much of the disaster related loss is due to damage to critical infrastructure. He said that the damage to physical and social infrastructure disrupts economic and social activities, which leads to hardship and distress, particularly for the poor and handicapped and adversely affects livelihood of large number of people.

 Dr. P. K. Mishra also spoke about the Issues and challenges in DRR of critical infrastructure, such as lack of awareness, wrong perception of high cost and less urgency, lack of skill and knowledge in Risk Assessments methods, Governance and institutional structure to follow disaster resilient norms in development of infrastructure; measures to ensure risk resilient infrastructure by mainstreaming DRR and better understanding of risk, risk metrics, indicators of sustainability.

 He highlighted India’s role in International cooperation such as Recent Asian Ministerial Conference on DRR in New Delhi and spoke in detail on Indian Initiative of forming a coalition on risk resilient infrastructure. He said that the proposed “coalition” will address the most pressing needs in infrastructure development and help us create a knowledge base that will benefit all countries. It will focus on four thematic areas - understanding of risk in infrastructure sectors; better standards of design, operations and maintenance, enforcement, regulation; financing of disaster resilient infrastructure and mechanisms to support recovery in infrastructure sectors, he added.

Shri Kailash Satyarthi calls for sensitizing Police on Crimes Against Children.

 

Nobel Peace Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi has called for sensitizing the Police on Crimes Against Children. Addressing the Valedictory function of the 1st National Conference of Micro Missions of National Police Mission (NPM) here today, Shri Satyarthi proposed the creation of Special Children Cell in the Police Forces.

 

Quoting NCRB data, the Nobel Laureate said the rising pendency of Crimes Against Children is a matter of concern. Shri Satyarthi said that the recent Amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act, Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, popularly known as Nirbhaya Act, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) 2012 should be effectively used to ensure a safe and secure environment for our children, who constitute about 35% of India’s population. Neither the politicians and the bureaucracy nor the judiciary, but it is the policeman who represents the face of governance and rule of law in the society, he added.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. M. C. Borwankar, Director General, Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), said that on the suggestion of Shri Satyarthi, the ninth Micro Mission under the NPM has been set up on Crimes Against Children. She announced that the BPR&D will soon be shifting to its new campus in Mahipalpur, Delhi. Dr. Nirmal Kumar Azad, IG, Director, NPM, said the BPR&D will soon initiate a process to rank State Police Forces through a third party audit as proposed by Shri Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), ih his inaugural address yesterday. Shri Parvez Hayat, ADG, BPR&D also graced the occasion.

 

The two-day Conference was organised by the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The Conference aimed to review, share learnings and trace the journey of NPM ever since its inception in 2008. It witnessed participation of representations of all eight Micro Missions.

Shri Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), has advocated conducting a survey on the status of Policing in various States. Inaugurating the 1st National Conference of Micro Missions of National Police Mission (NPM) here today, Shri Kant said the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) should come out with the survey of State Police, including at district-level, based on various parameters including outcomes, to bring about change in policing. Stating that economic development and internal security have a symbiotic relationship, he said the police will also have to act as an instrument of social change. 

Laying out a survey of districts based on four development indices, - Health, Eductaion, Poverty & Roads, Shri Kant pointed out it is apparent that the districts lowest in the combined index are concentrated in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. These very 100 districts lowest on the development index pose the gravest challenges to security and law and order, he added. 

Shri Kant said as India aims to accelerate the growth rate from the present 7.6% annually to 9-10% for the next three decades or more, it will be marked by a demographic profile consisting of a majority 72% youth population and witness a huge amount of urbanization. For the economy to pick pace India will also have to take the share of women’s contribution to GDP from the present 17% to 40% share in the developed world economies, he added. 

Shri Kant also deliberated on ‘Out of Box Ideas’ to reform the current policing framework in the country. He gave various examples to state the heightened competitiveness being demonstrated by various State Governments in terms of ‘Ease of doing business’. He further laid stress on adoption of similar competitive spree amongst different Departments of the Government including the Police.

He also emphasized on areas which could revolutionize the current police functioning across India. These included: 

• Improve Citizen-police interface 

• Improve the condition of Police Stations 

• Improve judicial system 

• Improve rate of conviction 

• Provide healing touch to victims 

• Ensure extensive & pragmatic use of technology 

Shri Kant gave references of international police departments to exemplify emphatic use of technology in crime investigation and prevention. Prudent use of Social Media & Data Analytics can help in gathering information, tracing suspects and identifying crime trends, he added. Shri Kant also unveiled the National Police Mission’s Compendium on Projects, which shares insights on various Micro Mission Projects being carried out under the aegis of NPM. 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. M. C. Borwankar, DG, BPR&D, said the eight Micro Missions under the NPM have been redesigned to include at least 25% young Officers of the level of Superintendents of Police. Shri Parvez Hayat, ADG, BPR&D also graced the occasion. Dr. Nirmal Kumar Azad, IG, Director, NPM is the Conference Secretary. 

The two-day Conference is being organised by the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The Conference aims to review, share learnings and trace the journey of NPM ever since its inception in 2008. It witnesses participation of representations of all eight Micro Missions. Nobel Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi will grace the Valedictory function tomorrow.

                A training programme being conducted by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) began here today to improve the preparedness of Parliament House Complex (PHC) security staff to respond to CBRN emergencies, encompassing threats emanating from the use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and/or Nuclear (CBRN) material. 

The five-day training programme will train security personnel of PHC on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri R.K. Jain, Member, NDMA said, ""In today's world, CBRN emergencies have become a reality. Comprehensive planning, preparedness and an effective response strategy will equip us to deal with such exigencies effectively."" 

Underlining the need for CBRN training, Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA, said that even small CBRN accidents can trigger immense psychological distress among people. ""It is, therefore, important that our security personnel are able to deal with such eventualities holistically,"" said Dr. Sharma. 

The programme consists of lectures, live demonstrations of detection and decontamination as well as use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The participants will also be trained on Basic life support, triage and casualty carrying techniques as well as the working of a HazMat (Hazardous Material) vehicle. 

Participants will also be given a hands-on training by way of a mock drill in a simulated CBRN scenario by a trained National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team at its 8th Battalion base in Ghaziabad. 

This is the 17th in a series of training programmes conducted by NDMA for security personnel over the years. So far, more than 800 security staff have been trained to handle CBRN emergencies.

A two-day multi-stakeholders’ second meeting of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction concluded here today. The valedictory function was addressed by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Power, Coal New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju. Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Mehrishi, Members NDMA and over 1,000 delegates representing various stakeholders in the Disaster Management also attended. 

Speaking at the Valedictory Session, Shri Piyush Goyal made an appeal to everyone to come together to fight against the disaster. He referred to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s 10 point agenda for drafting the roadmap leading to the reduction of disaster impact. He said that if we cannot prevent disaster, we must work for reducing the impact of disaster. We need to make investments in preparedness and risk reduction. He also quoted Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh for mentioning that if we spend one rupee in preparedness, we save ten rupees in post-disaster losses. He also emphasised that Disaster Management should not be seen in isolation. It has linkages with poverty and all development schemes of the Government. Poverty has direct impact on vulnerabilities, so we have to work simultaneously. He quoted Bejamin Franklin, “if we fail to prepare, we are preparing to fail”. 

Shri Kiren Rijiju, who is also the Vice-Chairman of the NPDRR, reiterated the Prime Minister’s 10 point agenda for drafting targeted and time bound action plan for making India resilient by 2030. He emphasized on investment in Research and Development and building partnerships with the universities and research Institutions.

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh reviewed the security situation in the North East with the Chief Secretaries and DGsP of the eight North Eastern States namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, MoS for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju, National Security Advisor Shri Ajit Doval, the Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Mehrishi and DGs/ADGs of ITBP, Assam Rifles and BSF also participated.

Home Minister complimented the States and Security Forces for the notable improvement in the security situation in the North East in recent years. He mentioned that the North East has got huge potential for development with rich human and natural resources. The Home Minister emphasised that for speedier development of the Region, improved security situation is extremely important.

Shri Rajnath Singh stated that since counter-insurgency operations are now not taking as much time of the Security Forces as before, the State Police forces need to focus on improving normal police functioning, better prosecution and conviction in criminal cases. There is a need to improve investigation by adding scientific tools and Forensic Science Laboratories. Presence of illegal arms needs to be reduced through a sustained organised campaign by State Police forces. The Home Minister stated that the Police also needs to take pre-emptive action to handle the threat of radicalisation and to handle cyber crimes. For this, well equipped and well trained police forces will be needed. Shri Rajnath Singh said that the issues of repatriation of Brus and citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs need the active cooperation from the concerned State Governments.

In the meeting, issues discussed covered, inter-alia, counter-insurgency operations, strengthening of security at Indo-Bangladesh and Indo-Myanmar borders, issue of detection and deportation of foreigners, border fencing, border area development programme, implementation of ground rules with ceasefire groups, modernization of police forces, functioning of Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme, repatriation of Brus from Tripura to Mizoram, citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh, deployment charges for CAPFs and rental compensation cases in Mizoram were also discussed.

On behalf of the States several issues were raised including issues of need for creation of proper detention centres for illegal migrants in Assam, need for central assistance to upgrade police infrastructure in border areas of the region, rehabilitation of surrendered militants, upgradation of police infrastructure and training to handle modern age crime such as cyber crime, drugs and radicalisation, better facilities to trade with neighbouring countries, disbursal of land compensation for fencing and border roads, the need for drastically improving telecommunication coverage in the region, upgradation of the village guards system where it had been set up, further improvement of road infrastructure at international borders, early finishing of fencing and floodlighting at the border and exploring alternative options for difficult terrains such as hills, riverine areas and wildlife parks.

            The Union Home Minister Shri
Rajnath Singh chaired the meeting on issues related to North
East, here today. The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region
(I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions,
Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Minister of State for Home
Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju, National Security Advisor, Shri Ajit Doval and
senior officers from the Central Government and North eastern states are
attending the meeting.

 

 Following
is the text of Home Minister’s opening remarks at the meeting:

 

“विगत वर्षों में North-East की Security Situation में उल्लेखनीय सुधार हुआ है। इस क्षेत्र का ज्यादातर हिस्सा  militancy से मुक्त हो चुका है और बची हुई कुछ pockets में militancy अपना support तेजी से loose कर रही है। Effective counter insurgency, Responsive development orientation
और पड़ोसी देशों के साथ बेहतर रिश्तों से स्थिति में काफी सुधार दर्ज हुआ है। हालांकि कुछ क्षेत्रों में Armed Gangs, militancy की आड़ लेकर Extortion, Kidnapping एवं abduction जैसी गतिविधियों में लिप्त हैं।

 

सरकार द्वारा इस क्षेत्र में road, rail, air, power और digital infrastructure के fast track development हेतु लिये गए initiatives एवं local human resource के development पर emphasis देने से बेहतर सुरक्षा स्थिति सहित अन्य क्षेत्रों में भी और अच्छे परिणाम मिलने की आशा है। हमारी Act East Policy से इस  region के द्वार South-East Asian markets के लिये खुल जायेंगे। 

 

North-East India, Human और natural resources के मामले में काफी rich है। यहाँ के इस potential का उचित दोहन करने के लिये आवश्यक है कि हम इस क्षेत्र में secure एवं peaceful environment create करें।

 

इस संबंध में हमें निम्नलिखित प्रयास करने कि आवश्यकता है:- 

            

       
i.           
इस क्षेत्र में लम्बे समय से चली आ रही militancy ने security eco-system को vitiate कर दिया था। security scenario में सुधार के साथ police को अपना orientation normal police function की ओर करना चाहिए यथा crimes का prevention और detection, जो पिछले दशक से काफी suffer कर रहा था। दुर्भाग्यवश North-East के कुछ राज्यों में criminal cases का prosecution और conviction ratio काफी poor है। एक राज्य में तो prosecution का ratio, all India
average 86% की तुलना में मात्र 5% है। कई राज्यों में Kidnapping, Abduction और  Extortion के cases काफी rampant हैं। परंतु इन cases के prosecution एवं conviction का ratio 1% से भी कम है जो स्वीकार करने लायक नहीं है। एक criminal जब crime करने के बावजूद court से छूट जाता है, तो आम जनता का विश्वास justice system से उठ जाता है। और जब acquittal का ratio काफी ज्यादा हो, तो इससे एक तरफ तो राज्य की moral legitimacy undermine होती है साथ ही यह crimes को भी incentivise करता है।

इतने ज्यादा acquittals होने का प्राथमिक कारण poor investigation है। ऐसा देखा गया है कि investigation के scientific tools adequately
use नहीं हो रहे हैं। North-East के कई राज्यों में forensic science
laboratories की स्थिति भी संतोषजनक नहीं है। इस दिशा में police chiefs और राज्य सरकारों को special attention देने की आवश्यकता है।

 

     
ii.           
इस क्षेत्र में illegal arms का proliferation भी बहुत तेजी से बढ़ा है। हांलाकि North-East का बड़ा area, militancy से मुक्त हो चुका है, परंतु इतनी बड़ी मात्रा में illegal arms की मौजूदगी के कारण crimes की संख्या भी अधिक है।

मैं सभी राज्यों के DGPs को सलाह दूंगा कि illegal arms के traders और उनके holders के against organised campaign चलाएं।

 

    iii.           
West में स्थित Siliguri corridor को छोड़कर अन्य सभी sides से North-East क्षेत्र अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सीमा से लगा हुआ है। इन borders के through, illegal arms,
drugs, narcotics और fake Indian currency की smuggling होती है। हमारे यह border areas, practically un-policed है। इन border areas में
policing को प्राथमिकता देते हुए हमें पर्याप्त संख्या में police stations set up करने की आवश्यकता है। इससे cross border crimes में कमी आयेगी और साथ ही दूर-दराज के क्षेत्रों में रह रहे यहां के लोगों के मन में एक security का sense भी पैदा होगा।

 

    iv.           
अगर हम Future Security Threats की बात करें तो
radicalisation की समस्या एक बड़े challenge के रूप में सामने आयी है। Radicalisation एक trans-national phenomenon है। अगर इसे रोका नहीं गया तो यह आतंकवाद के रूप में परिवर्तित हो सकता है। North-East और उसके आस-पास के क्षेत्रों की sensitivity ऐसे मामलों के प्रति इस क्षेत्र को ज्यादा ही vulnerable बना देती है। इसलिए यह आवश्यक है कि radicalisation के agents को identify किया जाए। इनके कुछ agents धर्म की आड़ लेकर operate कर रहे हैं। जबकि कुछ लोग  NGOs और individual, socio
cultural और educational development के नाम पर operate कर रहे हैं।

आवश्यकता है कि हम उनकी activities को closely monitor करें और जहां आवश्यक हो वहां pre-emptive action लें। इनमें से कतिपय agents की funding foreign से होती है। अत: यह भी आवश्यक है कि उनके foreign funds के flow एवं utilization को closely monitor किया जाए।

 

     
v.           
एक अन्य Emerging Security Threat,
Cyber Crime है। Cyber Crime की घटनाएँ विश्व भर में बढ़ रही हैं। Financial Crimes के साथ साथ Cyber Space का उपयोग unrest और instability create करने के लिए किया जा रहा है। जैसा कि हम सब जानते है, किस प्रकार हमारे दुश्मनों ने 2012 में आसाम में कुछ ethnic clashes के बाद
instability create करने के लिए  Cyber Space का misuse किया था। अत: Cyber Crime को investigate करने की एवं digital media के abuse  को prevent करने की capability में हमें काफी सुधार करने की आवश्यकता है। North East में हमें
well-equipped cyber forensic laboratories स्थापित करने जरुरत तो है ही, साथ ही IT trained Police Officers के sizeable pool की भी आवश्यकता है।

 

    vi.           
Brus जनजातियों का त्रिपुरा से मिज़ोरम repatriation और 50 वर्षों से अधिक समय से अरुणाचल में रह रहे Chakmas और Hajongs को citizenship देने जैसे कुछ issues  काफी समय से pending हैं और इन्हें जल्द-से-जल्द resolve करने की आवश्यकता है। इन issues के settlement से tensions और crimes में कमी आयेगी। इस सम्बन्ध में राज्य सरकारों से active
cooperation की आवश्यकता है जिससे हम इन्हें जल्द-से-जल्द resolve कर सकें।

 

  vii.           
कई ethnic armed
organizations अपने grievance के peaceful
resolution के लिये सरकार के साथ engaged हैं। उनके armed cadres को designated camps में रखने की आवश्यकता है। साथ ही engagement के कुछ agreed ground rules को भी observe किये जाने की आवश्यकता है। जैसा कि मुझे बताया गया है कि उनमें से कुछ violent criminal activities जैसे- extortion, kidnapping आदि में सलंग्न है। ये गतिविधियाँ ground rules का serious violation हैं। designated camps के बाहर उनके unauthorised movements को तुरंत रोकने की आवश्यकता है और उल्लंघन करने वालों को कानून के तहत firmly deal किये जाने की आवश्यकता है।

भारत एक plural democracy है। जो विविधताओं से भरा हुआ है। विभिन्न race, religion और culture के लोग एक साथ शांति से रहते हैं। यह diversity, North-East में ज्यादा दिखती है। यहां लोग peaceful तरीके से हज़ारों वर्षों से एकसाथ रह रहे हैं। Modern State की growth ने resources और power के लिये प्रतिस्पर्धा create की है। ऐसी प्रतिस्पर्धा सामान्य रूप से हमें बेहतर बनने हेतु प्रेरित करती है परंतु कभी-कभी इससे तनाव भी बढ़ सकता है। कभी-कभी यह regional अथवा ethnic
aspiration के रूप में प्रकट होती है। ऐसे negative articulation को sensitive तरीके से firmly discourage किये जाने की आवश्यकता है। 

North-East region के लोग विशेषकर युवा काफी aspirational हैं। वे अपने बेहतर और समृद्ध भविष्य की तरफ देख रहे हैं तथा देश के दूसरे हिस्सों की प्रगति के साथ कदम-से-कदम मिलकर चलना चाहते हैं। यह हमारी जिम्मेदारी है कि हम उनके लिए एक बेहतर माहौल तैयार करें। आइये हम सब अपने North-East के लिए एक बेहतर, सुंदर और समृद्ध भविष्य के लिए कार्य करें।”

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the two-day second meeting of National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR) here today. The theme of the Second meeting of NPDRR is “Disaster Risk Reduction for Sustainable Development: Making India resilient by 2030”. The Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju and Additional Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Dr. P. K. Mishra were also present on the occasion. The NPDRR is a multi-stakeholders National Platform headed by the Union Home Minister and it promotes participatory decision making in disaster management, and strengthens federal policy of our country.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that NPDRR is a multi-stakeholders National Platform for sharing the experiences in disaster management and for making a collective effort for disaster risk reduction.  He emphasized the role of prevention and mitigation in reducing disaster losses. He pointed out that 1 extra Rupee spent on disaster preparedness and mitigation could save 10 Rupees of disaster loss. He recollected global agreements like Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goal and Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP21) for disaster risk reduction. He highlighted the ongoing efforts of Governments in disaster risk reduction like preparation of disaster management plan and policy, development of early warning systems, construction of cyclone shelters and saline embankments, raising of disaster response forces at national and state levels and capacity building of communities through continuous training and awareness programme.


Shri Rajnath Singh also shared the recent initiatives of Government of India for increasing the regional co-operation, like launching of dedicated satellite for South Asian Countries, Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) 2016 and setting up of SAARC disaster management centre. He appealed to the stakeholders to prevent “preventable death” caused by disasters and also prepare an action plan for vulnerable communities of societies. As sustainable developments are closely related with better disaster management, he urged all stakeholders to make all development initiatives disaster resilient. He informed that 14 pre-events were organized as build up to this meeting.


Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, informed that India is a disaster prone country and stressed the need to continuously enhance our preparedness and risk reduction measures. He referred to 10 point-agenda for disaster risk reduction given by our Prime Minister during AMCDRR 2016 and urged the participants to draw concrete plans to implement this agenda into reality. He requested the disaster managers to give proper consideration to geo-physical condition of the particular State/UTs, while making any action plan for disaster risk reduction. 


Shri  R. K. Jain, Member, National Disaster Management Authority in his welcome address highlighted the achievements of Government of India in disaster risk reduction. A film emphasizing the theme that Disaster Management is Everybody’s Business was screened. Further, version 3.0 of National Database on Emergency Management (NDEM) was launched by Shri Rajnath Singh. This version of 3.0 is device independent and browser independent and equipped with latest resource mapping tools and audio and video conference facilities. 
The Union Home Minister also chaired a Ministerial Session which was attended by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh, Ministers of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir & Shri Kiren Rijiju and Ministers from states of Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Prof Jagdish Mukhi, LG of Andaman and Nicobar Islands also participated.  Shri Rajnath Singh informed that growing population, unplanned urbanization and climate change are the new challenges posing new disaster risks to the country. He emphasized the primary role of States and Union Territories in disaster management and urged them to equip themselves for facing these new disaster risks. He lauded the initiatives and preparedness of States. He appealed to all the State/UTs to continuously upgrade their preparedness and plan for making the country disaster resilient. While stressing the need for political commitment, he emphasized the need for bilateral and regional cooperation among the States, Union Territories and Central Government.  Ministers from Union and States highlighted their initiatives in disaster risk reduction and endorsed their commitment to make the country disaster resilient by 2030 in line with the Prime Minister’s 10 point Agenda.


Besides opening and Ministerial sessions, this NPDRR  meeting will have one Plenary Session, one session on outcomes of pre-events, four technical sessions on four priority areas of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, one technical session on monitoring of Sendai Framework and a closing cum valedictory session. Along the meeting, innovative ideas by start-ups in disaster management and best practices in disaster management by the States are displayed in the exhibition area.


The meeting is being attended by over 1000 distinguished guests including State Ministers, Parliamentarians, Heads of Local Self Government, Heads of specialized disaster management agencies, academicians, representatives from private sector organizations, media and civil society organizations.

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the second meeting of National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction here today. Following is the text of his address at the inaugural session:

 

“आज मुझे आपदा प्रबंधन के राष्‍ट्रीय मंच National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR) की दूसरी बैठक में आप सभी के साथ भाग लेते हुए अत्‍यंत हर्ष हो रहा है। जैसा कि आपको विदित है कि भारत विश्‍व के आपदाओं से सर्वाधिक प्रभावित होने वाले देशों में एक है। हमारी लगभग 50% से अधिक आबादी भूकंप, बाढ़, समुद्र तटीय  चक्रवात, सूखा और सुनामी से प्रभावित है। आपदाओं से होने वाले जान-माल की क्षति को प्रभावी तरीके से कम करने के लिए भारत सरकार ने एक Multi Stake Holder National Platform का गठन किया है। जिसकी पहली बैठक वर्ष 2013 में हुई थी, जिसमें केंद्र सरकार के संबंधित विभागों के मंत्रिगण, राज्यों के मंत्रीगण, अधिकारी, स्‍वयं सेवी संस्‍थाएं तथा technical institution के लोगों ने भाग लेकर अपना सार्थक योगदान दिया था।

 

इस National Platform के गठन का मुख्‍य उद्देश्‍य सभी Stakeholders के साथ अपने अनुभवों को साझा करते हुए देश के लिए एक रणनीति बनाना है। साथ-ही-साथ, समय-समय पर उठाए गए कदमों का review करना एवं राज्यों के साथ coordination स्‍थापित  करना है।

 

आज की बैठक का मुख्‍य उद्देश्‍य Disaster Management  एवं Sustainable Development  की दिशा में हम कैसे सक्षम हों, इस पर चर्चा करना तथा प्रभावी रूप से काम करने के लिए आगे की रणनीति तय करना है।

 

आपको याद होगा कि वर्ष 2015 में विश्‍व स्‍तर पर 03 महत्वपूर्ण समझौते हुए है-

 


	Sustainable Development Goal,
	Sendai Frame Work for Disaster Risk Reduction और
	COP 21- Paris Agreement on Climate Change.


 

भारत इन तीनों समझौतों में Signatory है। प्राकृतिक आपदाओं से निपटने की दृष्टि से, यह तीनों ही एक दूसरे से जुडी हुई हैं। क्‍योंकि अब जोर आपदा के पश्चात् response पर ही नहीं, बल्कि आपदा के जोखिम को कम करने पर है। जैसा की होना चाहिए।  अगर रिस्क को कम करना है, तो इंसान की गतिविधियों से climate change नहीं हो, यह ही आवश्यक है। इसी प्रकार विकास और प्रगति - जो स्वयं अपनी जगह आवश्यक एवं महत्‍वपूर्ण हैं , आम आदमी के living standards और quality of life को बेहतर करने के लिए, ऐसे विकास से ecology or environment का degradation नहीं हो , यह भी आवश्यक है।  अतः यह अंतरराष्ट्रीय  समझौते एक कड़ी के भाग हैं और किसी एक उद्देश्य, उदाहरणार्थ disaster risk reduction  को पाने हेतु, अन्य दो उद्देश्‍यों को पाना भी  आवश्यक है।

 

 

इस महत्वपूर्ण inter -dependence की महत्‍ता को समझते हुए, उसे focus में रखते हुए, दिल्ली में अभी हाल ही 2016 में Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) का आयोजन किया गया था। इसमें Disaster Risk Reduction के लिए Asia Regional Action Plan को adopt किया गया। इसी क्रम में हम  इन दो दिन की NPDRR की बैठक में, आपदा के Risk को कम करने हेतु इसके विभिन्‍न components यथा Prevention, Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, Reconstruction और Rehabilitation पर पूर्णरूप से विचार कर, वर्ष 2017 से वर्ष 2030 तक का Action Plan बनायेंगे।

आपदाओं के Risk को कम करना अब हमारे लिए choice नहीं है अपितु एक अहम जरूरत है। मुझे याद है कि वर्ष 1999 के ओडिशा Super Cyclone में करीब 10 हज़ार से अधिक लोगों की जाने गई थी और अरबों रुपयों का आर्थिक नुकसान देश ने उठाया था। उसके पश्‍चतात वर्ष 2001 में गुजरात में आए भूकंप और वर्ष 2004 में आई सुनामी ने देश को झकझोर दिया था। तब से, lessons लेते हुए, भारत वर्ष में आपदा प्रबंधन के approach में paradigm shift हुआ है।

 

देश में संस्‍थागत  एवं योजनाबद्ध तरीके से आपदा के प्रभाव को कम करने हेतु विभिन्‍न प्रयास किए गए हैं, जिसमें Disaster Management Act, 2005, Disaster Management Policy 2009, NDRF, NDMA और NIDM का गठन महत्‍वपूर्ण है। इसी क्रम में वर्ष 2013 में प्रथम National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR)  का गठन किया गया था।

 

विश्‍व स्‍तर पर भी United Nations  के द्वारा आयोजित विभिन्‍न बैठकों में भारत ने अपना योगदान दिया है। वर्ष 2015 में जब जापान में Sendai Framework पर चर्चा हो रही थी, तो मैंने स्वयं इस बात पर ज़ोर दिया था कि आपदा के Risk को कम करने में सरकार के साथ-साथ अन्‍य संगठनों की भूमिका भी उतनी ही महत्वपूर्ण होनी चाहिए जितनी की सरकार की है।

 

Sendai Framework  की केवल 03 महत्‍वपूर्ण बिन्‍दुओं को अगर हम देखें तो इनमें आपदा से होने वाले मृत्यु, प्रभावित होने वाले लोगों की संख्‍या तथा आर्थिक नुकसान को कम करना शामिल हैं। Development के विभिन्‍न योजनाओं को बनाते वक्‍त हमें इस बात का ख़ास ध्‍यान रखना होगा कि future investments, इन सभी factors को कम करने में कैसे मददगार साबित होंगे।

 

हम लोग यह सुनकर पले-बढ़े हैं कि ''prevention is better than cure''। विश्‍व में कई देशों ने इसे धरातल पर करके दिखाया है। भारत वर्ष भी इस प्रयास में पीछे नहीं रहा है। मैं दो उदाहरण आपके समक्ष रखूँगा ।  पहला - National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project, जो कि विश्‍व का शायद सबसे बड़ा इस तरह का कार्यक्रम है।  इस कार्यक्रम ने जिन तटीय राज्यों में early warning को सुदृढ किया है, स्थानीय स्तर पर cyclone shelters बनायें हैं, वहाँ पर चक्रवातों से होने वाली मृत्यु दर को हम 95 % तक काम कर पाए हैं।  दूसरा - हमारे पर्वतीय इलाकों में भूकंप आने के बाद जो पूर्ण निर्माण हुआ, और जहाँ जहाँ भूकंप अवरोधी मकान बनाये गए, वहाँ भले ही इन मकानों की लागत, 8 से 10 % अधिक रही है।  लेकिन भूकंप की प्रबल संभावना वाले इन इलाकों में, इन मकानों को बाद में, आने वाले भूकम्पों से न के बराबर क्षति हुई है। हम कह सकते हैं की हर एक रुपये की अतिरिक्त लागत से लगभग 10 की बचत हुई है। 

 

इसी तरह, वर्ष 2001 में आए गुजरात के भूकंप के पश्‍चात जो long term recovery के लिए कदम उठाए गए, उसे global best practices के रूप में पहचान मिली है। इसके लिए गुजरात सरकार को UN Sasa Kava award से सम्‍मानित किया गया है। यहाँ तक कि, इसके फलस्‍वरूप Sendai Frame Work में भी ''build  back better'' को प्राथमिकता दी गई है।

 

वर्ष 2013 एवं 2014 में आए Cyclone Phailin एवं Hudhud में हमनें नुकसान को काफी कम किया। इसका अनुमान आप ऐसे लगा सकते हैं कि इनमें मृतकों की संख्‍या क्रमश: 42 एवं 24 रही हैं। जबकि इसी से comparable ओडिशा के 1999 के Super Cyclone में करीब 10,000 व्यक्तियों की मृत्‍यु  हुई थी।

 

हाल ही में केन्द्र सरकार ने सभी मंत्रालयों से Disaster Management Plan बनाने का अनुरोध किया है। जिसमें अपने-अपने क्षेत्र के Risk को कम करने के लिए आवश्‍यक कदम उठाने का अनुरोध किया गया है। मुझे बताया गया है कि कृषि मंत्रालय द्वारा पशुधन की सुरक्षा के लिए ""Livestock Disaster Management Plan"" बनाया है जो विश्‍व में अपने तरह का पहला प्रयास है।

 

इसी तरह, देश के अन्‍य राज्‍यों में भी कुछ सराहनीय व अनुठे प्रयास किये जा रहे हैं।  

 

Early Warning System, Cyclone Shelter का निर्माण, Saline Embankments का निर्माण, मज़बूत Disaster Response Force का  केंद्र एवं राज्य स्‍तर पर गठन तथा community preparedness एवं capacity building,  इस दिशा में उठाये गये महत्‍वपूर्ण कदम हैं।

 

इन उदाहरणों से यह बात बिल्‍कुल स्पष्ट है कि ''अगर हो पूरी तैयारी तो आपदा नहीं है भारी।'' अत: हम सभी को मिलकर आपदाओं के Risk को कम करने के लिए पहले से ही पहल करनी होगी।

 

माननीय प्रधानमंत्री जी ने AMCDRR, 2016 के दौरान अपने उद्बोधन में 10 सूत्रीय agenda points का जिक्र किया है। इस platform के माध्‍यम  से उन बिंदुओं  पर क्रमवार चर्चा करते हुए भविष्‍य के लिए समयबद्ध कार्य योजना बनायी जाएगी । इन कार्य योजनाओं के मूल्‍याकंन हेतु एक व्‍यवस्‍था की रूपरेखा की संरचना पर भी गहन विचार-विमर्श किया जाना अपेक्षित है। ताकि हमें इस बात का पता चलता रहे कि हम इस दिशा में कितना प्रयासरत हैं। और इसमें हमनें साझा रूप से कितनी सफलता हासिल की है।

 

भारत ने आपदाओं को कम करने के लिए दक्षिण एशियाई देशों के बीच क्षेत्रीय सहयोग को सदृढ़ करने में अग्रणी भूमिका अदा की है। इस क्रम में नई दिल्‍ली में सार्क आपदा प्रबंधन केन्‍द्र स्‍थापित किया गया है। इसके साथ-साथ भारत BRICS, BIMSTEC, East Asia क्षेत्रों में भी अपना सहयोग देता रहा है। इसी क्रम में आपदा प्रबंधन हेतु विशेष Satellite  दक्षिण एशियाई देशों के लाभ के लिए पिछले सप्‍ताह प्रक्षेपित किया गया है। माननीय प्रधानमंत्री जी के इस कदम से Disaster Risk Reduction के क्षेत्र में हमारे देश का नाम  एक अग्रणी देश के रूप में पुन: स्‍थापित हुआ है।

मुझे बताया गया है कि इस बैठक के पूर्व महत्‍वपूर्ण  विषयों पर 14 pre events, NDMA एवं NIDM द्वारा आयोजित किए गए हैं। जो कि इस दिशा में एक सराहनीय पहल है। इन चर्चाओं में स्‍थानीय स्‍तर पर क्षमता निर्माण, inclusiveness, women empowerment एवं national plan आदि मुद्दों पर गहन विचार-विमर्श कर सिफारिशें की गई जिन पर इस बैठक में चर्चा कि जाएंगी।

 

इस बैठक में समाज के vulnerable community पर विशेष action plan बनाने हेतु मैं appeal करता हूँ और आशा करता हूँ कि इस पर महत्‍वपूर्ण  चर्चा होगी।

 

अभी पिछले सप्‍ताह की ""THE ECONOMIST"" Magazine ्‍ज्‍ीम न्‍न ्‍दूके एक caption, ""Death is Inevitable but a bad death is not"" ने मेरा ध्‍यान अपनी ओर आकर्षित किया। इसका तात्पर्य यह है कि मृत्‍यु को तो हम रोक नहीं सकते परन्तु आपदा से होने वाली असामयिक मृत्‍यु को रोका जा सकता है। परिवार के एक सदस्‍य  की असामयिक मृत्‍यु से सम्पूर्ण परिवार तहस-नहस हो जाता है। इसी बात का ध्‍यान रखते हुए हमें ""Preventing the preventable deaths"" की दिशा में पूरी क्षमता से कार्य करना चाहिए।

 

अंत में मैं आप सभी का ध्‍यान National Plan की ओर आकृष्ट करना चाहूंगा जिसको माननीय प्रधानमंत्री जी ने जून, 2016 में release किया है। इस Plan का उद्देश्‍य भी भारत को Disaster Resilient  बनाना तथा जान और माल के नुकसान में कमी लाना है।

 

हमारी सरकार प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्‍द्र मोदी जी के नेतृत्व में Disaster से हो रहे नुकसान को कम करने के लिए अपनी कटिबद्धता को दोहराते हुए Sustainable Development को प्राप्‍त करने के लिए निरंतर प्रयासरत है।

 

भारत सरकार द्वारा इस हेतु आवश्‍यक वित्तीय व्यवस्थाएं भी की गई है। राज्यों के प्रयास को supplement करने हेतु SDRF की समग्र निधि को 33580.93 करोड़ रु. (2010-15) से बढ़ा कर 2015-20 की अवधि के लिए 61220 करोड़ रुपये कर दिया गया है। 

 

Sustainable Development एवं Disaster resilient development  के लिए यह आवश्यक है कि केन्‍द्र सरकार द्वारा चलाए जा रहे कौशल विकास, कृषि सिंचाई योजना, सांसद आदर्श ग्राम योजना, Digital India, स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान तथा बेटी बचाओ-बेटी पढ़ाओ कार्यक्रम आदि के साथ Disaster Mitigation Programmes की सही synergy  स्‍थापित  की जाये ।

 

विकास एवं आपदा प्रबंधन में एक गहरा रिश्‍ता है। सही विकास, जो Risk को कम करे, उसमें आपदा प्रबंधन विभाग के अलावा अन्‍य संबंधित stakeholders के साझा प्रयास से ही resilient development के लक्ष्‍य को प्राप्‍त किया जा सकता है। हम उम्‍मीद करते हैं कि आने वाले वर्ष, जो Technology Oriented है, उसकी सहायता से हम इस बड़े चुनौती का बड़ी ही आसानी से सामना कर सकेंगे।

 

Disaster Risk, Dynamic है। कल का Risk, आज के Risk से भिन्‍न हो सकता है। अत: भविष्‍य की रूपरेखा उसी के अनुरूप flexible बनाए जाए, जिसमें बदलाव को adopt  किया जा सके। 

 

मैं बैठक में आए सभी महानुभावों का स्‍वागत करते हुए बैठक की सफलता की शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ और मैं यह उम्‍मीद करता हूँ कि हम सभी संगठित रूप से देश को एक सुंदर और सु‍रक्षित भविष्‍य देने का भरोसा दे सकते हैं।”

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh launched the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Mobile Application for grievance redressal of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) personnel, here today. The Union Home Minister also launched BSFMyApp on the occasion.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that he had proposed this App at the DGPs conference held in Hyderabad last year. He said that he wished to relate to every jawan working for nation. He congratulated the BSF for developing this App in short span of time. He said that the CPAFs are one of the most disciplined forces. If they are disciplined, this does not mean that they do not have emotions, he added. He said that they also have some personal problems and the system keeps on resolving their problems from time to time. Shri Rajnath Singh said that this App is required when the jawans feel that their problems need attention of the Ministry of Home Affairs. This has given a ‘Digital Option’ to jawans to lodge their grievances and he is just one click away from jawans, the Home Minister said.  Shri Rajnath Singh said that he will review the dashboard of the App every month and check the status of redressal of grievances. The MHA will intervene, wherever required, he said. He said that everybody should get benefitted from the telecom revolution.

 

The Home Minister also appreciated the jawans for the dedication with which they do their duty. He said that the Government is making efforts for the welfare of jawans. He said that to curb stagnation, 34,000 jawans have been promoted to Head constable position. He also said that the families of the jawans, who sacrifice their life for the nation, should get minimum assistance of Rs one crore. He said that the Government has recently launched a web portal “Bharat ke veer” to enable the willing donors to contribute towards the family of a braveheart who sacrificed his/her life in line of duty. The web portal is getting very good response, he added.

 

The MHA Mobile App has been developed in view of the fact that personnel of various Central Armed Police Forces are discharging their duties at their places of duty all over the Country. In the course of discharging their duties, they come across various personal/service related problems which can be addressed and re-addressed by their organizations. All Central Armed Police Forces have well organized mechanism for Redressal of Grievances of their personnel. Notwithstanding, there are still some personnel who feel that their grievances need further consideration and better solution. As a result, they have a keen desire to raise their level of grievances to the level of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This required a suitable mechanism to enable Force personnel to submit their grievances to MHA and at the same time provide an opportunity to their organization for further consideration of their requests. Considering this requirement, the MHA Mobile App provides a common system in which all personnel of various CAPFs can submit their grievances through a Mobile Application and the same provides respective Forces to receive the submitted grievance for further action. The Mobile application also has a provision for MHA to continuously monitor the action taken by various CAPFs on their grievances and regulate the process for further improvement in the Grievance Redressal System.

 

The BSFMyApp launched on the occasion has been developed to cater to the requirement of BSF personnel regarding Grievance Redressal as well as various other service and welfare related issues of the Force personnel, deployed in the field. It provides mechanism to address issues related to Pay, GPF, Leave, Deputation etc. The most significant feature of the Application is its Financial Literacy Module which not only educates BSF Personnel about investment of their savings but also facilitates investment in a safe and systematic manner.

 

The DGs of CAPFs and senior officers of the Ministry of Home Affairs and CAPFs were also present on the occasion.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh presided over the Review Meeting of Left Wing Extremism affected States here today. Following is the text of his Opening Remarks made during the Afternoon Session this afternoon on Development Issues:

 

“In this session after lunch I would like to welcome all the Union Ministers who have joined us now. In the first session of this important meeting we have discussed in detail the Security related issues of the LWE areas. We have deliberated extensively on a new doctrine, ‘SAMADHAN’ which has the following 08 pillars-   

 

1.S- Smart Leadership

2.A- Aggressive Strategy

3.M- Motivation and Training

4.A- Actionable Intelligence

5.D- Dashboard Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

6.H- Harnessing Technology

7.A- Action plan for each Theatre

8.N- No access to Financing

 

You will all agree that in addition to the various facets of security, the socio-economic empowerment of the people at large is essential so that the public support stays with the Government. It is necessary for States to work on a coordinated strategy of security and development so that the confidence of the public in the democratic process is maintained in the LWE affected areas.

Our Government has taken various steps with this objective, so that the confidence in our Government has grown in the minds of the tribals and others living in the LWE affected areas. They are coming forward to avail the benefits of Government Schemes. 

 

In the year 2014, the Government of India had sanctioned a plan to establish 2199 mobile towers in the 10 LWE affected States at a total cost of Rs. 3567.58 crores. Out of these 2187 mobile towers have been made operational, which is a good achievement.

 

The Road Requirement Plan is being implemented by the Government of India to improve connectivity in 34 LWE affected districts of 08 States. 4290 Kms of the sanctioned 5422 Kms of the road has been completed.

 

The ‘Road Connectivity Project for LWE Affected Areas Scheme’ has recently been approved by the Government of India. Under this  5412 Kms of roads and 126 bridges are envisaged to be constructed in 44 districts of 09 affected States, at a cost of Rs. 11725 crores.

 

In the area of financial inclusion special efforts in the last two financial years, specially in the 35 worst affected districts have lead to the opening of 358 Bank branches and 752 ATMs. 1789 new Post Offices have also been sanctioned for these districts.

 

Under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana youth of LWE districts will receive skill training for self employment. At present 32 of the 35 most affected LWE districts have been covered in the scheme. 

 

Skill Development Scheme is being implemented for the purpose of establishing Skill Centers for training the youth of LWE affected districts of 09 States. The scope of this scheme has been expanded from 34 to 47 LWE affected districts. 47 ITIs and 64 Skill Development Centers were also to be opened under the scheme. Out of these, construction work have been completed in 12 ITIs and 34 Skill Development Centers.

 

The Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) is being implemented for the electrification of un-electrified villages in the entire country. For the LWE districts special focus is being given under this scheme. The electrification of 5778 villages has been completed and a target of December, 2017 has been set, for the electrification of the remaining 1461 villages.

 

In the field of education special efforts are being made. Under this, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) are being opened in 05 districts of the 35 worst affected LWE districts. These districts did not have any JNV earlier. In addition, new Kendriya Vidyalayas are planned to be opened in 11 most affected LWE districts. Proposals from 08 districts have already been approved, and work commenced. 

 

Under the National Secondary Education Campaign, construction of 348 hostels have been approved in 354 educationally backward blocks of 35 most affected districts. Construction of 100 hostels has been completed and work on 82 hostels is in progress. 94 hostels have actually started functioning so far.

 

To improve Rail Connectivity a number of projects have been sanctioned. The progress of these projects is very good. However, land acquisition is a hurdle because of which many projects have not taken off. I would like that problems and issues regarding land acquisition should be resolved by the States at the earliest so that the projects may take off soon and get completed.

 

I would like to suggest to the State Governments, that they should complement and top-up the programmes of the Central Government through their own schemes. This would ensure the holistic development of the LWE affected areas and  fulfil the dream of Hon’ble Prime Minister of “SABKA SAATH - SABKA VIKAS.”

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has written a letter to the Principal Secretary/Secretary Home (In-charge of Prisons) of all States and Union Territories on the resolutions adopted by 5th National Conference of Heads of Prisons of States/UTs on Prison Reforms.

The 5th National Conference of Head of Prisons of States and UTs on Prison Reforms was held at New Delhi on September 29-30, 2016. The Conference was inaugurated by Minister of State (Home) Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir and was attended by 150 delegates from various States/UTs, CPOs, NGOs etc. After detailed deliberations on various aspects of prison administration, some important resolutions were adopted for guidance and implementation by the State/UT Prison authorities.

The State/UT Governments have been accordingly advised to consider for implementation of the following suggestions which are aimed at having an effective prison administration system:

i)                    The nomenclature of Prisons Department may be changed to ""Prisons and Correctional Administration"", which should have integrated prison, correctional and probation services.

ii)                  Every State should establish a Welfare Wing under Prison Department comprising Welfare Officers, Law Officers, Counselors and Probation Officers.

iii)                In order to ensure basic uniformity in prison rules and regulations, all States and Union Territories should revise their existing Prison Manuals by adopting the provisions of Model Prison Manual, 2016 prepared by Ministry of Home Affairs & circulated to all States and UTs in May 2016.

iv)                The Prisons should be linked with Courts through video conferencing for expeditious trial and to save costs in escorting under-trials to the Courts.

v)                  The existing vacancies in all ranks of Prison Departments to be filled up expeditiously.

vi)                Prison e-system should be integrated with Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) as well as e-Courts on priority basis.

vii)              Combined training of Prison, Police, Health Department and Judiciary on under-trial Management to be conducted periodically. Separate training course on de-radicalization of prisoners should also be conducted.

The States and UTs have been advised to make concerted efforts to implement the same in a time bound manner, which will go a long way in alleviating the condition of prison inmates and bring the desired improvement in prison administration.

The State Governments and UT Administrations have also been requested to intimate the updated status of implementation of the above advice.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh presided over the Review Meeting of Left Wing Extremism affected States here today. Following is the text of his Opening Remarks made during the Inaugural Session this morning on Security Issues:

 

“Chief Ministers and Ministers of participating States, my colleagues the Ministers of State in the Home Ministry, National Security Advisor, Union Home Secretary, Union Defence Secretary, DIB, Director Generals of Central Armed Police Forces, Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police of the State Governments, Collectors and SPs of the 35 worst affected districts and other senior officers of the Government of India and the States.

-          This meeting has been convened to jointly understand the different aspects of Left Wing Extremism with the 10 affected States, so that Left Wing Extremism can be countered with full force and competence. To discuss and work out an integrated strategy of Security and by giving impetus to Development in the 35 worst affected districts, the LWE influence can be eliminated.

-          The whole country is agitated with the martyrdom of 25 CRPF personnel in the incident of April 24, 2017 in Burkapal, Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. In such situations, the challenge before us is to maintain focus and move towards our goal with speed, in a planned manner.  

-          I am concerned but not perturbed by the attack on the CRPF Camp by the Left Wing Extremists. Today’s meeting is therefore important because we have to consider and deliberate in totality, as to what would be our thinking, our strategy, our preparedness and how we have to use our resources. I have full confidence on you, and our forces and together, with a new strategy and with full force we will counter and achieve victory against Left Wing Extremism.

-          India is the largest democracy in the world. However, Left Wing Extremism desires to weaken and make the roots of democracy hollow. The development of new India that our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji is envisaging is based on development and strength of democracy. In order to free India from the influence of LWE that encourage violence and killing, it is necessary that we all should think and work in this direction. I believe that efforts to suppress democracy through the influence of the gun will never succeed.

-          Today in this room Chief Ministers and Heads of Administrative and Police department of 10 States are present. You are the policy-makers as well as the implementation agencies. The fight against Left Wing Extremism is a coordinated battle on security and development fronts that has to be fought to finish and won. Who could be more suitable and competent than you all? The presence of our forces should instil fear in the Left Wing Extremists and a sense of confidence among the local people and tribals – ‘Let your action speak for itself’’.

 

-  12000 citizens of our country have lost their lives in violent activities of the Left Wing Extremists.

-  Out of these 12000 people, 2700 are jawans of the Security Forces and the remaining 9300 are innocent and simple common people who are not guilty.

-  The anti-development Left Wing Extremism not only target the Security Forces but also public property like roads, culverts, railway tracks, electricity and telephone towers, hospitals, schools, anganwadi and panchayat bhawans etc, that are created by the Government for benefit of the common man.

- It is evident from the destruction caused by the Left Wing Extremists that they do not want people to get facilities and access to the development, in the remote and inaccessible areas, because these facilities provide the path of economic and social progress, to the local people. It also joins them to the mainstream of the nation. The cancer of LWE flourishes in poverty or backwardness. Therefore, the LWE strategy is to ensure that the people of this area stay without electricity, without road, without education, so that the vested interest of the Left Wing Extremists continues unabated.

Solution SAMADHAN-       

- The solution to the LWE problem is not possible with any silver bullet. There is no short-cut for it. For this short term, medium term and long term policies need to be formulated at different levels. There is need to find a solution for this problem and the strategy is available and encompassed in the word ‘SAMADHAN’ which means-

1.         S- Smart Leadership

2.         A- Aggressive Strategy

3.         M- Motivation and Training

4.         A- Actionable Intelligence

5.         D- Dashboard Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KRAs (Key Result Areas)

6.         H- Harnessing Technology

7.         A- Action plan for each Theatre

8.         N- No access to Financing

 

I would like to elaborate the new Doctrine ‘SAMADHAN’ for use in Security Operations:

1. S – Smart Leadership-

-  You also know that effective leadership can lead to any desired outcome. A leader is the one who makes the impossible possible, converts failure to success and defeat to victory.

- The key properties of ‘Smart Leadership’ are:

Vision, Mission, Passion and Self belief.

 

- A leadership full of self confidence should have a solid vision on how he would envisage the challenges of the future and prepare his team and energise his team to a mission mode, in order to achieve his objectives. To make his team secure, disciplined and victorious, should be of paramount importance for him.

- The success stories of many police officers in India are inscribed in the minds of the common people, as to how they kept their teams alive with energy. On the Left Wing Extremism front, we also need such leadership, who despite adversity, keep their jawans full of enthusiasm and teach them only to win.

- Be it Central Forces or the district police, they will have to work under a coordinated strategy and plan. The most important thing is that the officers will have to lead from the front. Success in this regard cannot be achieved only by sitting in Delhi, Ranchi or Raipur.

- Unified Co-Ordination and Command is needed in the LWE Front. Along with Strategic Command, Unified Command is also required at the Operational and Tactical Level. Intelligence sharing is important too.

 

2. A-Aggressive Strategy-

You are aware that in the last three years, Government has seen good results from the Multi Pronged Strategy against Left Wing Extremism. Statistics of violence from 2014 to 2016 indicates this. In the year 2016, 150 percent Left Wing Extremists were killed as compared to the previous year 2015, and arrests and surrender taken together has seen an increase of 47 percent.

 

- In the year 2016, Left Wing Extremists have suffered heavy losses. They also mentioned this in their statements and documents. It is also true that Left Wing Extremists are constantly trying to take action against the security forces to increase the morale of their cadres, and undoubtedly the incident of the Burkapal of Sukma is one such example.

 

- Even in the year 2017, figures show that LWE  incidents have decreased by 23.3 percent (377 to 289). But two to three incidents have occurred in which Security Forces have suffered heavy losses. Therefore, it is necessary that an analysis of these events is carried out, in order to assess the reasons as to why  such incidents occur. The first session of the meeting will analyse the mechanism in place to combat Left Wing Extremism and other related issues.

 

- Today, we need to consider whether to react only after the occurrence of such events? Should our role not be Proactive?

- Learning from the old incidents, we need to bring aggression into our policy. Aggression in thinking, Aggression in strategy, Aggression in deployment of forces, Aggression in operations, Aggression in development and Aggression in road construction.

- We will have to be cautious that extremely defensive deployment may result in reduction of operational offensive.

- We have to consider that although the figures of the surrenders of the Left Wing Extremisms are increasing, but whether benefit of intelligence from these surrendered LWE cadres is being derived.

- We must ensure that the States take the ownership of LWE operations and CAPFs cooperate with them fully. At the same time, the forces on the Ground level should not lack leadership. ""Unity of Purpose"" and ""Unity of Action"" are essential for the success of operations.

 

3. M - Motivation and Training -

- The Government has superior resources, training, technology, than the Left Wing Extremists. But there is a need for better coordinated efforts to counter the strategy of the LWE.

- Success on this front cannot be achieved only by being emotional in this regard. The right vision, right strategy, efficient use of resources, knowledge of enemy strengths and weaknesses, training of their security forces, their facilities and arrangements of tools are necessary for success. So we have to consider all these issues correctly, point wise. Today's meeting is important in this regard.

- In the camps where the security forces are residing, proper facilities of power, water, connectivity should be provided so that the Security Forces may remain stress free. They should also be able to contact their family as per requirement.

- In addition to information about the place of posting, security forces should also have knowledge of language, dialects, traditions and culture so that they can adapt to the local conditions and earn the trust of the local people.

- Security forces must adhere to Standard Operating Procedures so that they are conscious about their own security.

 

4. A-Actionable Intelligence

- To develop actionable intelligence it is important that all intelligence agencies and security forces establish a good network with local people.

- Surrendered LWE cadre should be used for intelligence collection to the maximum possible.

- In comparison to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the Technical Intelligence Inputs in Bastar Zone of Chhattisgarh are very low and the reason for this is only 20 percent effective connectivity in Bastar. It is only 4 percent in a district like Sukma. There is a need to create special action plans through the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) to increase connectivity across the entire LWE affected area.

- From the point of view of Intelligence, I believe that there is a need to depute Shadow Intelligence Officers to trace the prominent targets associated with Left Wing Extremism.

- There is a need to establish specific procedures between State Police and Central Forces for the exchange and use of intelligence.

 

5. D-Dashboard based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KRAs (Key Result Areas)

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Result Areas (KRAs) should be determined both for the State Police and the CAPFs. This would not only help to assess the preparedness but also their performance, regular progress of its unit and individual abilities of each police officer.

 

6. H - Harnessing Technology -

- We are all aware that Technology is a Force Multiplier.

- Many technologies including Space, IT and Communication have brought revolutionary changes in the world. Many new techniques are also being used in dealing with law and order and the crime. On the LWE  front, there is a need to use more of such latest technologies.

Now I would like to talk about the use of some Cutting edge Technologies : -

- Currently the use of the UAV is sub-optimal, that needs to be augmented both by numbers and by use in the right place.

- The Mini UAVs are extremely useful. Therefore, they should be procured and available in more quantities. We must try that with every battalion there must be atleast one UAV / Mini UAV.

- We need to use high resolution PTZ Cameras, GPS Tracking, Handheld Thermal Imaging, Radar, Satellite Image etc.

- We also know that Left Wing Extremists mostly use looted weapons. In order to prevent this, it would be advisiable to have 

- Trackers in Weapons,

- Biometrics in smart gun triggers.

- Trackers should also be embedded in Shoes, BP jackets etc.

- In addition, Unique identification numbers should also be used in Gelatine and other explosive materials.

- States that do not have expertise in such state of the art technology, the Central Government can assist in this regard.

 

7. A-Action plan for each theatre-

- You are also aware that the situation of Left Wing Extremism in different States is not the same.

- In different States, to fight Left extremism, there is a need to fight on multiple fronts and to create a specific action plan for each of such fronts, in order to achieve success on a systematic basis.

- There is a need to create separate short-term, medium-term, long-term strategies, whose goals and deadlines are clearly defined. The Implementation should be done on a Mission Mode defining the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for continuous monitoring and Key Result Areas (KRAs), that should also be aligned with these strategies.

 

8. N-No access to financing-

- It is well-known that economic resources play an important role in any war or any such exercise, because when money is available, only then will it be possible to buy, eat, drink and possess ammunition and weapons. Therefore, choking the financial resources of the LWE is the most basic mantra in this fight.

- I would like to remind you how the US took the 9/11 incident as a challenge, in order to prevent it from repeating itself. In the report it was stated that the 9/11 incident was not a ""failure of intelligence but the failure of Imagination"". Therefore, the 'Samadhan' which we have discussed today has inbuilt potential for imagination. We have to work on imaginative thinking on the whole situation so that we can ""Out Think"" and ""Out Manoeuvre""  the LWE.

- We have come a long way in defeating the fight with Left Wing Extremists. In the remote areas, our young men are constantly working for the development and protection of the area endangering their lives. In the yagya for the security of the country many soldiers have been martyred. I am convinced that their martyrdom will not go in vain. That day is not far when this mindless violence will be completely finished and once again the atmosphere of peace and prosperity will prevail and people will rapidly join the main stream along with enjoying the fruits of development.

- Now I would like to also mention the ongoing Security related Assistance given to the State Governments by the Government of India. Under this, 118 Battalions of CAPF have been deployed in the States. Besides, States have been given the sanction for IR Battalions and SIRB to strengthen the security Apparatus of the States. 10 CoBRA Battalions have been deployed, in addition to handle this kind of LWE issues.

- In the last few years, the Ministry of Home Affairs has assisted the States through various schemes for Capacity Building. Under the SRE Scheme, reimbursement of security related expenses, such as ex-gratia, transportation, training, honorarium for SPOs etc, was done by the Central Government in 106 districts of 10 States. In the financial year 2016-17, the Home Ministry has reimbursed Rs 210 crore.

- Under the Special Infrastructure Scheme, 122.13 crores was given to strengthen the special forces of 6 States. Apart from this, a sum of 24 crores was provided for setting up 16 CIAT schools in 6 States. More than 4000 police personnel are being trained every year by Army and Greyhounds.

- Similarly, under the Fortified Police Station Scheme, the Central Government has made available Rs. 624 crores to the States for the construction of 400 Fortified Police Stations in 10 States.

- LWE Affected States have been sanctioned 56 IRB and 10 SIRB. States have been given these sanctions to increase their force resources. The SIRB is a major step towards providing security for the State's infrastructure projects, especially in these sensitive areas. But now 20 IR Battalion and 06 SIRB are yet to be raised with both the security and engineering components. In addition, engineering components of 02 SIRBs are pending.

- The Home Ministry has provided support to security forces for other facilities such as Helicopters, UAVs etc. From time to time, the amount required for the CRPF is being provided by the GOI for the basic facilities, due to lack of resources of the State Governments.

- We assure the States that we will continue to provide full support to them for their capacity building and training needs. Intelligence sharing and deployment of Central security forces will continue as per requirement. But the States must take initiative to conduct Operations and use Resources optimally.

- I have full confidence that today's deliberations will be fruitful and we will be able to realize the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister of building a Left Wing Extremism free India.”

The Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu chaired the third Governing Council meeting of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) here today, to deliberate upon the steps to further strengthen the Mission at different levels. The Minister of State for Urban Development and Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri Rao Inderjit Singh and Madhya Pradesh Urban Development and Housing Minister Smt. Maya Singh also attended the meeting.

The steps taken to strengthen the mission include,

 

§  Under skill training, it was decided to enhance financial provisions for differently-abled, who will be provided extra conveyance allowance, additional post-placement support, support for personal assistive aids and additional uniforms to encourage them to get trained. Further Training Providers shall be incentivized for training differently-abled and undertaking job outreach activities for them. 

 

§  The employment generated during 2016-17 was 2,36,218, which is 155% more than the previous year. Besides this, the physical progress of the other components has also shown a significant increase in 2016-17.

 

§  Below poverty line (BPL) population shall now be able to avail conveyance charges while participating in skill training programmes under the Mission. Uniforms shall also be provided to all beneficiaries undergoing skill training. 

 

§  In view of non-availability of suitable land in the metros for construction of shelters near to the concentration of homeless, it was decided to allow State/UTs to hire buildings and refurbish them suitably for running of shelters till the permanent shelters are constructed.

 

§  For expediting faster setting up of shelters, it was also decided to seek land, for construction, from PSUs including Railways, encourage CSR support, rope in reputed social organizations to run DAY-NULM shelters and co-opt shelters being run by them under DAY-NULM and provide for management cost. The decision will provide the State/UT Govt. an additional option for providing shelter for urban homeless.

 

§  Since the goal of shelters is not only to provide a space for living, but also to provide a conducive environment to the homeless so that they can achieve their potential, it was decided to ensure access to skill training programmes by organizing special screening and mobilization camps for the shelter inmates.

 

§  It was decided to remove the observance of expenditure ceiling of Mission Management costs at State Level. However, the expenditure would continue to be monitored at National Level within the prescribed ceiling. It will help the States in positioning and training of requisite manpower for better implementation of the mission.

 

§  It was decided to increase the salary of Community Organisers from Rs.10,000 to Rs.15,000 per month. Further it was decided to authorize the state to further enhance it according to the subsequent revision of minimum wages.

 

Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu expressed satisfactory while reviewing the physical and financial progress under DAY-NULM during the last three years and said that the focus should be given more on skill development which enables in self-employment.  

As against the target of formation of 1,05,000 Self-Help Groups, actual performance has been 1,90,266. Under Self-Employment Programme component, 1,78,896 beneficiaries have been given subsidized bank loans for setting up individual and group enterprises against the target of 1,25,062. A total of 8,37,764  urban poor have been imparted skill training, during the last three financial years. 666 shelters for urban homeless have been so far made functional.

Outlines urban renaissance taking place in India ; Credit Ratings a pointer, Says Minister 
 

Newly elected President of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat and Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today urged the international funding agencies to support programmes aimed at promoting inclusive urban development that benefits all sections of the society in the context of rapid urbanization in developing countries. 

In his Presidential Address the Plenary Session of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat in Nairobi, Kenya today, Shri Naidu stressed that affordable housing, provision of other basic urban infrastructure, solid waste management, environment friendly public transport and skill development needs to be accorded priority in funding by the international agencies to enat sure inclusive development so that public spaces and opportunities in urban areas are equitably shared by all. 

Stressing on the need for collective actions by the global community to take forward the New Urban Agenda adopted at Quito, Ecuador last year, Shri Venkaiah Naidu suggested a five point strategy to improve urban governance at the local level. He suggested decentralization of decision making, devolution of functions, funds and functionaries to urban local bodies, reform of administrative and financial processes, augmenting resource collection and enhanced citizen participation for effective functioning of urban local bodies. 

Stating that growing urbanization is an irreversible process, particularly, in the developing countries, Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu stressed on the need for collective actions through effective global partnerships to take advantage of this growing urbanization to catalyse global economic growth. 

Shri Naidu further said that under the over arching philosophy of ‘Perform, Reform and Transform’ suggested by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, a process of urban renaissance has been set in motion in India under which the political and administrative leadership in urban areas is adopting new decision making, planning and execution methods. 

“From a state of total neglect of urban planning and execution, urban local bodies in India are now enthusiastically obtaining credit ratings that impact a wide range of urban governance issues. This is a clear sign of urban renaissance in India” Shri Naidu asserted. 

The Minister said that new urban missions like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart City Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and the measures for promoting environment friendly public transport are aimed at ensuring inclusive and sustainable urban development. 

The Presidential Address of Shri Venkaiah Naidu was appreciated by the experts and participants including Mr.Joan Clos, Executive Director of UN-Habitat and representatives of other member countries of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat. 

Shri Venkiah Naidu was unanimously elected as the President of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat on Monday this week.

Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation has condoled the sudden demise of Shri Anil Madhav Dave, Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change.

In his condolence message Shri Naidu said “I am shocked and extremely sad to know about the untimely demise of my colleague Shri Anil Madhav Dave. It is our misfortune that we lost a committed environmentalist just when he had become the Environment minister. He was in true sense a 'Son of Mother Narmada', and devoted a lifetime for the conversation of that great river. An amateur pilot, photographer and passionate reader, he was scholar in his own right. Dave wrote numerous books including his magnum opus Shivaji Aur Suraj- a study on Shivaji's good governance with a foreword by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

A simple and an unassuming person, it was a joy to interact with him. He had been a Member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh since August, 2009. His non-partisan and level headed interventions promoted a sense of peace in the House. He was firm believer in grass root level democracy and development. He formerly edited 'Charaivety (monthly) and 'Jan Abhiyan Parishad' journal.

He once flew a Cessna 173 aircraft along the banks of Narmada for 18 hours to complete his circumabulation in air. On another occasion he completed an insurmountable raft journey of 1312 kilometers on Narmada in 19 days. Peace be upon the 'Son of Mother Naramada'.

Born on July 6, 1956 he shared his birthday with Jana Sangh founder Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee.”

While giving an overview of issues discussed during the review meeting, Shri Naidu said that Government of Jharkhand has been requested to provide a dedicated power supply through separate feeders to All India Radio & Doordarshan Stations in the state. He mentioned that action was being taken to cover all shadow areas of Koderma region by December 2018, to ensure 100% coverage of all geographic regions in the state by DD & AIR.

 

During the review meeting, Shri Naidu urged State Government to make use of the platform of Community Radio to ensure last mile reach. Educational Institutions & NGOs should be motivated to set up community radio stations.  He said that Community radio was an empowering tool which caters to the information needs of the people in local language/dialect. It broadcast programmes on various local issues relevant to the community. He added that to give a boost to radio outreach, Ministry of I&B has increased the subsidy amount to 75% for stakeholders for setting up of CRS in various states.

                Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said the Government’s initiatives like Make in India, Skill India and Digital India campaigns were clearly positive signals for new transformation including GST which would prove to be a game changer for Indian Media and Entertainment sector, especially the Broadcasting sector. The Minister stated this while inaugurating the Two Day seminar organized by Telecom Authority of India on the occasion of completing two decades here today.

Elaborating further, Shri Naidu mentioned that the broadcasting sector in the country was at the threshold of entering into new era of digital broadcasting, which would open lots of opportunities to use latest technological innovations to not only enhance reach but also enhance the quality of the reach. The revival of radio, the digitisation of cable and the free to air DTH audience growth point to the latent demand for broadcasting in the Indian market at a time when broadcasting in advanced markets in the west is losing out significant space to digital on-demand media platforms. The push towards Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) thus comes at a critical juncture as Doordarshan, the public broadcaster in India looks to expand its DTT footprint from the current 16 cities to another 44. The Minister acknowledged and appreciated TRAI’s recent recommendation on time bound implementation of DTT in India.



The Minister stated that the government was committed to provide an enabling environment through various policies for the further growth of the Media and Entertainment sector. The Digital India campaign along with the Make in India campaign would strengthen the industries such as video streaming, online music services and gaming in India taking advantage of the increased internet penetration.  The Minister also mentioned that indigenous manufacturing of various digital broadcasting equipment had taken roots under the initiative of Make in India and that. He urged all the stake holders to encourage and promote indigenous development of equipments in the country.

 

Shri Naidu stated that the gap between the premium Direct To Home (DTH) market and the low quality cable market, lay an opportunity that was currently being tapped by the free to air (FTA) DTH platforms like Doordarshan’s FreeDish. With transparent online auctions allowing for market based discovery of the value of these free to air channels, there was an audience revolution of sorts with rural audiences getting on the FTA DTH bandwagon and contributing for enhanced number of entertainment channels.

 

Speaking on the role of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the Minister said that the transition to Digital Broadcasting had posed several challenges and the role of TRAI was extremely crucial in this regard for overcoming any hurdles that may put the transition to newer technologies on a slow path. Shri Naidu congratulated TRAI for completing two decades of regulatory services to the nation, which had contributed immensely to the growth of Telecom and Broadcasting sectors while keeping consumer protection in mind.

The Minister of State for Labour & Employment(IC), Shri Bandaru Dattatreya launched EPFO’s Citizens’ Charter 2017 and e-court management system in Bangalore, today. Citizens’ Charter 2017 is an attempt to bring transparency and accountability on the part of EPFO and make service delivery system and grievance redressal mechanism more efficient so that it delivers goods and services to its all stakeholders in a time bound manner with a reduced timeline from earlier timeline of 30 days. The timeline in case of claim settlements is 10 days and 15 days in case of grievance redressal management.

The citizens’ charter has been launched with the vision of social security coverage to all employees as well as implementation of policies for benefit of all stakeholders with adequate support level of social security.

EPFO e-court Management System has been launched which is in tune with the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi of digital India. The objective of the project is a transparent and electronic case management system which will cater to aspirations of all stakeholders – the employers, the employees, litigants and CBT. It is a step towards paperless court system wherein court procedure of EPF & MP Act, 1952 and EPFAT will take place in a digital environment.

Further, in order to facilitate easy access to the tribunal, automated messages will be sent to the litigants on their registered mobile numbers on the status of their cases. The stakeholders can also track the individual cases online.

Now the parties can file all their paper / evidence / documents online and all the details alongwith status can be accessed online. Updation is an important part of e-court management system in which digital case record will create a digital database which can be utilized to generate meaningful and accurate reports. This is also an attempt to create paperless court procedure alongwith efficiency and transparency in the system.

                The Government has notified the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act,2017 on 28th March,2017 and the provisions of the Amendment Act have come into force with effect from 1st April,2017, except those relating to crèche facility {Section 4(1)} which would come into force from 01.07.2017. 

Keeping in view queries received from various quarters, the Ministry of Labour & Employment, on 12.04.2017, had issued certain clarifications on various provisions of Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017. One of the clarifications issued by the Ministry stated that the enhanced maternity benefit, as modified by the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) bill, 2016 can be extended to women who are already under maternity leave at the time of enforcement of this Amendment Act. 

Having received further queries and to remove doubts, it is further clarified that it is mandatory on the part of employers to extend the benefit of enhanced maternity leave to those women workers who were already on maternity leave on the date of enforcement of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act,2017 i.e. as on 01.04.2017.

                Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment, Shri BandaruDattatreya launched two schemes “One IP- Two Dispensaries” and “Aadhaar based Online Claim Submission” on the occasion of International Labour Day today.


Under One IP- Two Dispensaries schemeESIC has given an option to an Insured Person (IP) to choose two dispensaries, one for self and another for family through an employer. This will benefit all IPs, especially migrant workers who are working in other than home State, while their families are living in their native States. Because of non-availability of option of second dispensary, the dependant members of family are often deprived of medical benefits. By introducing the concept of ‘One IP- Two Dispensaries’, IP as well as their family members would now be able to get treatment from either of the dispensaries and in case of emergency from any ESI Institution.As of now, around 3 crores IPs are covered under ESIC and total number of beneficiaries i.e. IPsand their family members is over 12 crores.


Under Aadhaar based Online Claim Submission scheme all EPF Members who have activated their UAN and seeded their KYC (Aadhaar) with EPFO will be able to apply for PF final settlement (form19), Pension withdrawal benefit (Form10-C) and PF part withdrawal (Form31) from the their UAN Interface directly. The three forms collectively form more than 80% of EPFO’s claim workload.Members can complete the whole process online and they neither need to interact with the employer nor with the EPFO field office to submit online claim.They are not required to give any supporting document while preferring online PF part withdrawal case. Member’s applying online will be taken as his self-declaration for preferring the advance claim.


Launching the schemes Shri BandaruDattatreya said that the Government has recognised the importance of labour and the contribution of workers and is dedicated to their welfare. It is ensuring job security, wage security and social security to them.The Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment said that the Governmentis trying to provide social security to the workers of unorganised sector also. He said that in the recently launched scheme ‘SPREE’ by ESIC the new accounts of 77 lakh individuals and 66 thousand establishments have been opened and EPFO has also added around 50 lakhs new accounts in its recently launch scheme. 34 million registrations havealready been done on National Career Service (NCS) Portal.


Earlier, Smt. M. Sathiyavathy, Secretary, Labour and Employment said that the ministry has undertaken many steps for the welfare of workers. The Ministry is also rationalising the labour laws for the ease of business. She said that upgradation of skill is necessary for the job opportunity.

A high-level committee, constituted on 10th January, 2017 to frame roadmap including places where these institutes will be established, will soon submit its report. Our target is to start academic session in these institutes from 2018. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions. About 100 Navoday Vidyalaya type schools will also be opened in Minority concentrated areas in the coming months. To ensure better education to every person belonging to poor sections a campaign “Tehrike Taleem” is being launched. Under which every needy person will be provided resources and facilities.

During the last three years, the Ministry has created infrastructure development projects such as 33 Degree Colleges; 1102 school building; 15,869 additional class rooms; 676 hostels; 97 ITIs; 16 Polytechnics; 1952 drinking water facilities; 8532 Aanganwadi Centres; 2090 health centres; 223 Sadbhav Mandaps (during last 6 months); 18 Gurkul type residential schools (in last six months). Besides, 47,986 pucca houses have been constructed under PM Awas Yojana.

During the last three years, scholarships worth Rs 4740 crore were given to 1.82 crore students. Rs 116 crore were given to 32,705 students under free coaching scheme for competitive exams, while Rs 166 crore were distributed among 1,38,426 girl students under “Begum Hazrat Mahal Scholarship. Money of all these scholarships have been transferred directly into bank accounts of the students through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode leaving no room for any leakage.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last three years, over 5.2 lakh youths including about 40 per cent women, have been covered under various job-oriented skill training schemes of the Ministry of Minority Affairs at an expenditure of Rs 578 crore. Under “Seekho aur Kamao”, over 2 lakh youths have been provided employment oriented skill training and employment with an expenditure of more than Rs 300 crore; 1.99 lakh women have been provided various leadership development training under “Nai Roshni” and 70,000 youths have been covered for training and employment opportunities under “Nai Manzil” scheme. Thousands of Minority communities’ schools and Madrasas have been connected with “3T”- Teachers, Tiffin and Toilets during last three months. These educational institutions also include institutions run by Gurudwaras and those run by Jain, Buddhist and Parsi community.

The Minister of State (I/C) for Minority Affairs said that while on one hand “Progress Panchayat” have proved to be a strong mission to fulfil our commitment to “Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas” and “Antyodaya”, on the other hand “Hunar Haat” is providing encouragement, market and opportunity to master artisans belonging to Minority communities. Two “Hunar Haat” have been organised by the Ministry so far. More than 35 lakh people (about 26 lakh visitors at Baba Kharak Singh Marg, Connaught Place, about 9 lakh visitors at Pragati Maidan) visited these two “Hunar Haat”.

Shri Naqvi said that with the theme “Craft Aur Cuisine Ka Sangam”, the second “Hunar Haat” was unique in the sense that it showcased crafts and traditional cuisines brought from different parts of the country at “Bawarchikhana”. The first “Hunar Haat” had been organized from 14 to 27th November at India International Trade Fair in November 2016. After huge success of these two “Hunar Haat”, the Minority Affairs Ministry has decided to establish “Hunar Hub”, to organize such events, in every state. Several states have come forward to provide land for the project. Next “Hunar Haat” will be organized at Puducherry, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Gauhati, Ahmedabad, Jaipur.

Shri Naqvi said that joining “Digital India” campaign launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Minority Affairs has made all its schemes and programmes digital/online. Even entire Haj process has been made online this time and also a Haj mobile app has been launched. A total of 1lakh 70 thousand pilgrims will go to Haj from India this year. Saudi Arabia Government has increased India’s Haj quota by 34,005. It’s a significant increase in our country’s Haj quota after several years.

Minister of State for Minority Affairs (I/C) Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Saudi Arabia Ambassador in India Dr Saud Mohammed Alsati discussed various issues related to about 1 lakh 70 thousand pilgrims from India going for Haj 2017 today in New Delhi.

After significant increase in India’s Haj quota by Saudi Arabia Government, a total of 1,70,025 people will go to Haj pilgrimage this year from India out of which 1,25,025 pilgrims will go through Haj Committee of India while 45,000 people will go through Private Tour Operators. 

Shri Naqvi said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, bilateral relations between India and Saudi Arabia have been further strengthened. He said that facilities of Haj pilgrims especially their safety is our top priority. Various issues such as visa process, accommodation and transport facilities for the pilgrims were discussed in the meeting. 

Shri Naqvi said that all the preparations for Haj this year has been completed before time. He also expressed thanks to the Saudi Arabia Government for increasing India’s annual Haj quota by 34,005. It is the biggest increase in the quota of Haj pilgrims from India after several years.

They also discussed about reviving the option of sending Haj pilgrims through sea route. Shri Naqvi said that sending pilgrims through ships will help cut down travel expenses by nearly half as compared to air fares. The practice of ferrying Haj pilgrims between Mumbai and Jeddah by waterways was stopped in 1995. Shri Naqvi said that another advantage with ships available these days is that they are modern and well-equipped to ferry 4,000 to 5,000 persons at a time. They can cover the 2,300-odd nautical miles one-side distance between Mumbai and Jeddah in just two-three days. Earlier, the old ships used to take 12 to 15 days to cover this distance. 

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs is in constant touch with Saudi Arabia Government, Haj Committee of India, Air India and other concerned agencies. A team of senior officials from the Ministry and Haj Committee of India had recently visited Saudi Arabia to take stock of various facilities.

Shri Naqvi said that a high level committee, constituted to frame new Haj Policy 2018, will soon submit its report. The new Haj Policy is aimed at making entire Haj process easier and transparent. Haj pilgrims’ facilities will be the focus of the new Haj policy.

                Argentina, Burkina-Faso, Chad, France, India, Ivory Coast, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Sénégal, Uganda and Yemen have jointly supported commissioning of a study to define and structure a Common Risk Mitigation Mechanism (CRMM) for solar power generation projects in solar rich countries today . This is a major step in the implementation of the Paris Declaration of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) adopted on 30 November 2015 and of the ISA Programme aimed at mobilising “Affordable finance at scale”. This instrument will dramatically lower the cost of finance for renewable energy and the overall price of electricity. 

Today, the cost of capital represents a substantial amount of the final costs of renewable energy, in particular solar PV. The Council on Energy, Environment and Water calculates that in India it represents 70% of the total cost of solar power. The proposed CRMM will offer a simple and affordable tool that will create a secure environment for private institutional investment in solar assets. The instrument will help diversify and pool risks on mutualized public resources and unlock significant investments. 

The study was entrusted by the Interim Secretariat to a task force chaired by Terrawatt Initiative (TWI), the World Bank Group, the Currency Exchange Fund (TCX), the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and also the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). Public and private stakeholders and partners will be consulted to contribute to the initiative and to ensure collective buy-in and validation. Participating countries may each appoint a qualified representative who will liaise with the task force and convey information regarding countries’ specific expectations, experience and needs. They call all other countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics to join them and support this initiative to attract investments into the solar sector. 

Background on ISA: 

The International Solar Alliance is an initiative jointly launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on 30 November 2015 at Paris, in the presence of the Secretary General of the UN, on the side lines of COP21. Under the ISA, solar rich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics are invited to share and aggregate data regarding their needs and objectives; emulate successful practices; and set up common mechanisms and instruments, in order to address obstacles to deployment at scale of solar energy.

History is created today, as the record low tariffs achieved in the auction concluded on 09.05.2017 for Bhadla Phase-IV Solar Park, Rajasthan has been broken, with even lower tariff of Rs. 2.44 per unit discovered in the auction carried out by Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) for 500 MW capacity in Bhadla Phase-III Solar Park, Rajasthan. The park is being set up by M/s Saurya Urja Company of Rajasthan Limited, a joint venture between the Govt. of Rajasthan and M/s IL&FS Energy Development Company Limited. This tariff is fixed for 25 years with no escalation and the bidders have sought no VGF from the Government. The winners are M/s ACME Solar Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (200 MW) at a tariff of Rs. 2.44 per unit and M/s SBG Cleantech One Ltd. (300 MW), quoting a tariff of Rs. 2.45 per unit. 

The entire solar power will be consumed in the State of Rajasthan and power sale agreement with the State Distribution Companies is already tied up. The developers are responsible to connect to the pooling sub-station of solar park. The developers will be paying solar park charges of Rs.45.2 lakh per megawatt towards land, connectivity (from pooling substation to state network) and other infrastructural facilities. The projects are likely to be completed in about 12-13 months. 

The earlier lowest tariff of Rs. 2.62 per kWh, was discovered recently in the auction conducted by SECI for 250 MW Bhadla Phase-IV Solar Park in Rajasthan. 

It is understood that this fall in solar tariffs is the result of combination of various factors, most important being the decision of the Government of India to cover solar power by SECI under the ambit of Tripartite Agreement for payment security against defaults by State distribution companies. Other factors contributing are about 7-8% higher yield in Rajasthan due to better solar radiation conditions, drop in module prices in International market, and strengthening of Indian rupee against US dollar. 

For the present bid, the bids were submitted by 24 bidders for a capacity of 5500 MW which is 11 times of the bid capacity. Bid received overwhelming global response including developers from Finland, France, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Japan. This became possible only due to constant endeavor at SECI to streamline the bidding process with highest level of transparency and integrity under the guidance of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.

                The Memorandum of Agreements (MoAs) for purchase of 1000 MW wind power under MNRE’s first wind auction Scheme were signed here today between PTC India, the trading company, and Discoms of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Delhi, Odisha and Assam. The signing ceremony took place during the two days Conference of Power, New & Renewable Energy & Mines Ministers of States and UTs. 

As per MoAs the Discoms of UP to buy 449.9 MW, Bihar- 200 MW, Jharkhand – 200 MW, Delhi – 100 MW, Assam – 50 MW and Odisha – 50MW of wind power for meeting their non-solar RPO. 

The Letter of Award (LoA) to the successful wind power developers under the first wind auction scheme have been issued by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) on 5 April 2017 and the projects are to be commissioned within 18 months from the date of issue of LoA. 

This was the first time such auction process was done in the country for wind power through e-reverse auction and its success can be seen from the fact that a record low tariffs of Rs. 3.46 per kWh was obtained. 

With the success of first wind auction scheme, MNRE today launched Scheme for another round of wind auction for 1000 MW capacity wind power projects. 

The Scheme is open for all obligated entities purchasing wind power for compliance of their non-solar RPO. The differentiation between windy and non-windy States has been done away with. The SECI will sign Power Purchase Agreements with selected wind developers and back-to-back Power Sale Agreements with buying utilities.

                A delegation of DANICS (Delhi Andaman Nicobar Islands Civil Service) officers met Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and sought his intervention for issues related to their delayed promotions and upgradation of seniority lists. Led by Shri V.K. Jain and others, the officers complained that they had qualified and joined the DANICS services over 30 years ago and since then, they had been offering their services with dedication, while, in the meantime, some of them also got promoted into the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). 

In a memorandum presented to the Minister, the officers requested that their seniority list be worked out in the terms of unamended rules of seniority i.e. prior to the notification dated 18.04.2012. The memorandum also noted that meanwhile, these officers were constrained to knock at the door of CAT (Central Administrative Tribunal) and from there also, they had received a favourable response wherein the CAT had quashed and set aside the seniority list published vide notification dated 22.11.2012. 

Pleading for the CAT order to be implemented, the officers submitted that most of them were nearing superannuation and many of them would get retired in this year itself. Therefore, in recognition of their services, the DoPT should take a sympathetic view so that, before their superannuation, they have the satisfaction of at least being rewarded with their due seniority and pay-scales. 

Dr Jitendra Singh gave a patient hearing to the DANICS officers. He said that the Government values the services of the Civil Servants who are essential for good governance and said, everything possible is always sought to be done to provide a friendly environment wherein each officer can perform to the best of his ability. He assured that he will get their representation evaluated and if feasible under rules, an appropriate view and follow-up will be done.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh inaugurated here today the 3-day Medical Conclave on Legal and Ethical Challenges in Healthcare Eco System.

The Conclave, organized by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in collaboration with ""Research Foundation of Hospital and healthcare Administration"", will have separate sessions spread over three days, exclusively devoted to different themes including Legal and Ethical Challenges in Healthcare Eco System, negligence in medical practice, Consumer Protection Act, medico-legal issues in organ transplantation, crucial decisions like euthanasia, etc.

In his inaugural address, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that when the Consumer Protection Act was made applicable on medical fraternity about 20 years ago, there was a huge debate about it. But now, it has not only become an essential part of our lives, but has also gone one step further to get influenced by even more legalities. He said, a number of factors may be responsible for the present state of affairs, which include breakdown of rural-urban divide with a more awakened and informed rural population, mushrooming of private sector and last but not the least, change in the disease spectrum of India with shift from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases, which involve life-long management with consequent life-long economic burden and life-long family support. All these factors, he said, are also liable to conflict situations involving ethics and legalities.

In the final reckoning, however, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the ultimate remedy to all this is the evolution of a self-code to be observed not only by doctors but also by patients and in fact by the society as a whole. Until the time that level is achieved, he said, we will have to continue working out different checks and balances.

Medical Superintendent AIIMS, Dr Shakti Gupta, who is also the Chairperson of the Conclave, in his welcome address, said that the 3-day conclave will deliberate in detail on various issues which have become a matter of concern and attention for both the medical fraternity as well as the society in the recent years. He hoped that the conclusions arrived at the three-day meet would pave the way for charting out a future course of action to meet the legal and ethical challenges while optimum healthcare.

Dr Siddhartha Satpati, Prof. & Head of Department, Department of Hospital Administration and Dr D.K. Sharma, Medical Superintendent also spoke on the occasion.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that grievances filed by the public with the Government increased five times during the present Government. While the number of grievances has increased almost five times, Dr Jitendra Singh said, this was possible mainly because of the prompt disposal of complaints in a time-bound manner, which encouraged larger and larger sections of population to come forward and file their complaints. Now people feel motivated to file a complaint, he added. 

Briefing the media here today on the Public Grievances system of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), Dr Jitendra Singh cited figures to state that before the present government came in, the total number of grievances or complaints filed in the grievance cell in the DARPG was hardly about two lakhs annually, which showed a steep and progressive rise in the last three years. In 2013, from 1st January to 31st December the total number of grievances filed was 2,09,297 but in 2014 after the present Government took over on 26th May, the seven months’ period also made a difference and the total number of grievances registered was 2,70,413. In 2015, the number further increased to 8,79,230, in 2016 it went up to 11,94,931 and in the current year 2017, from 1st January to 15th May we have already received 5,49,761 grievance complaints, which means that by the end of this year, this figure may go up beyond around 12 lakhs. 

Similarly, on the other hand, Dr Jitendra Singh claimed that in 2013, the average time taken for the disposal of any grievance was 220 days, which has been remarkably reduced to just 24 days in the current year. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, a number of innovative steps in the last two to three years also helped in making the Grievance Cell proactive. For example, now we have a round-the-clock portal and the facility is also available on mobile app so that a citizen is in a position to file complaint any time from anywhere. In addition, he said, a ‘Twitter Sewa’ is also available for the purpose. Referring to a unique experiment started by him, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last one year, he started the practice of randomly calling up some of the complainants in order to assess the level of satisfaction and also to seek their inputs and suggestions. He said, the response to this exercise has been unique and citizens have showered compliments through social media and other means. 

Dr Jitendra Singh also read out the names and telephone numbers of some of the complainants who he has been speaking from time to time at random and also gave the contact details of two of such complainants whom he had spoken this morning, one of the them being from Telangana and the other from Punjab. 

Dr Jitendra Singh appealed to the media to help in educating the masses to understand that grievance disposal does not necessarily mean fulfillment of individual aspiration or wish. For example, he said, if a citizen files a complaint claiming that he is more deserving to get a departmental promotion than his other colleagues, the grievance disposal cell will provide him with the response from the respective department within stipulated timeframe, but that does not mean that grievance cell gets him the promotion if the concerned department denies him so on its own considerations. 

He also appealed to the State Governments to activate their respective grievance cells and expressed disappointment that in certain States, the grievance cell was dormant or was never even attended appropriately. 

Among those present at the Press Conference were Secretary (Personnel), Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT), Shri B. P. Sharma and Establishment Officer, DoPT, Shri Rajiv Kumar.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh presented awards to the probationers for outstanding performance in different categories at the felicitation-cum-valedictory function of 2016 Batch IAS Probationers held at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie yesterday.

Among those present on the occasion were Academy Director Smt Upma Chowdary, Course Coordinator Smt C. Sridhar, Associate Course Coordinator Shri M.H. Khan, faculty members and Trainee Officers of 2016 batch IAS who had completed the Phase-1 of professional course at the Academy.

After completing their 16-weeks Foundation Course training, the 2016 batch IAS Probationers had started their Phase-1 professional course from 13th December 2016 and were now being relieved from the Academy for district training in their allocated cadre. After completion of 54-week State and district training, these officer trainees will once again return to the Academy for an 8-week course in Phase-2.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Indian Administrative Service has come a long way since it reincarnated itself from its earlier ""Avatar"" of British ""Indian Civil Services"", soon after India achieved independence. The basic difference, however, is that, he said, while the district head during British rule was described as “Collector” and was expected to raise revenue for the Empire, in independent India he is known as “District Development Commissioner” and is expected to generate revenue for the welfare State.

Over the recent years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, not only the profile of responsibilities has undergone a change but the expectations from a civil servant have multiplied manifold and at the same, there is a very high degree of accountability and close public as well as media scrutiny. He said, citizen-centricity and citizen participation in all the programmes not only gives the citizens a sense of involvement, but also enables the civil servants working in the districts or in the field to avoid public indifference or antagonism.

Referring to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Mantra of “Maximum governance, minimum government”, Dr Jitendra Singh said, civil servant is an essential tool of governance and therefore, in the last two or three years, a series of decisions were taken by the government to make the service conditions more conducive and to make the working environment more friendly and compatible, so that each officer is able to perform to the best of his ability and potential. In this regard, he referred to the Government’s decision to streamline transfer policy for bureaucrats, to fix time limit for completion of proceedings in case of any charge or allegation against an officer and provision of seeking permission before prosecuting any officer.

It is the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led government, Dr Jitendra Singh said, which introduced the new designation of Assistant Secretary, so that the new outgoing IAS Probationers are able to spend three months of mentorship in various Ministries of the Union Government before leaving for their respective State cadres to take up their assignment in the State. This experiment, he said, has proved highly successful in giving a new orientation to the young IAS officers and added that the present batch of 2016, for which today’s ceremony was being held, will also have the opportunity of coming for a three months’ stint in the Union Government as ‘Assistant Secretaries’ in 2018.

Under the instructions of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said, not only the ease of governance has been sought to be achieved, but a larger participation of young IAS officers in Government of India’s flagship programmes is also being ensured. He cited the example of Prime Minister’s “Excellence Awards” presented on Civil Services Day on 21st April this year, when a record number of entries were received and as many as 599 districts of the country participated through their respective Deputy Commissioners and district administration.

Describing them as the torch bearers of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s “New India"", Dr Jitendra Singh said, this generation of IAS officers will be privileged to be the architects of India’s ascent as a supreme world power.

“Incorruptibility” is the ultimate remedy against corruption. The final goal in the drive against corruption cannot be achieved simply by eradication of corruption but by achieving a state of mind which is incorruptible. This was stated here today by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, while delivering the CVC Lecture on the topic “Government’s Recent Initiatives to Curb Corruption” here today. This was the 19th lecture of the “Lecture Series” organised by the Central Vigilance Commission and was attended by Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri K V Chowdary, Vigilance Commissioners Shri Rajiv and Dr T M Bhasin as well as several other senior officers of Government of India. 

Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that soon after assuming the office, one of the earliest statements made by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi focused on “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”. He said, this dictum goes hand in hand with the crusade against corruption because governance can never achieve its maximum limit or potential as long as it is constantly hampered by the menace of corruption. 

In the last three years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the focus of the Union Government has been two-fold, - (1) an approach towards zero corruption and (2) adequate protection to officials who perform their duty with diligence and competence without indulging in any unethical or corrupt practices. The series of decisions taken during the last three years are also aimed to achieve these twin objectives, he added. 

At the same time, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that right from the day of the formation of the present Government in May 2014 till date, one after the other, several path-breaking and even revolutionary decisions were taken to bring in more transparency and citizen centricity in various organs of the Government, which also exercises a check on corrupt and malafide practices. Citing some examples, he said, from January, 2016, under the direction of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, a courageous decision was taken to abolish the practice of holding interviews for selection to junior level and non-gazetted posts. This single decision has gone a long way in checking nepotism and favouritism in appointments and has at the same time, also brought about considerable saving to the public exchequer. 

Over the last 70 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a number of much hyped initiatives were taken by earlier Governments which included the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1988 and Right to Information Act, 2005. However, it is the NDA Government which has sought to implement these provisions in true letter and spirit. He said, many may not be aware of the fact that for the first time, under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, all the ten vacancies of the Information Commissioners were filled up in the Central Information Commission whereas it never happened so in the past and there were also times when the CIC was functioning with just 3 or 4 Information Commissioners. This itself is an evidence of the Central Government’s sincere will and conviction for transparency and accountability, he added. 

Dispelling the observation in certain quarters that the Lokpal Bill had got delayed under the present Government, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the matter of fact is that the Lokpal Bill brought by previous Government just two months before the last General Elections was drafted in haste, which left a number of missing gaps. For example, there was no clarity that in the absence of a recognized Leader of Opposition, who would replace him/her as member of Selection Committee. Similarly, the tenure of appointment of the jurist member in the Selection Committee was left undefined. In order to overcome these pitfalls, he said, Lokpal Amendment Bill was brought in Parliament but on the advice of all the parties including the Opposition parties, it was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee, and hence the delay. Now that the Bill has been sent by the Standing Committee with its recommendations, the further follow up will be done accordingly, he added. 

What is most important, however, Dr Jitendra Singh said is that the present Government under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has carried forward its resolve to check corruption with conviction and courage. An important evidence of this is that the path breaking decision of re-monetisation was announced on the eve of crucial election to five State Assemblies without any consideration of electoral outcomes, he said. 

The Lecture was attended by the Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) of Government Departments based in Delhi NCR as well as CMDs, Directors and other officers of Government Ministries / Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Nationalized Banks, and other Organizations. Senior Officers of the CBI and Enforcement Directorate also participated.

                A delegation of J&K Bar Association led by its newly elected President, Advocate B. S. Salathia, called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today.

 

The other members of the delegation consisted of the new office bearers including Shri Sachin Gupta, Vice President, Shri Prem Sadotra, General Secretary, Shri Himanshu Sharma, Joint Secretary and Shri Chetan Misri, Treasurer.

 

Shri Salathia assured Dr Jitendra Singh that the entire team of the Jammu Bar Association fully supported the Government of India’s stand on Kashmir and was of the firm view that there cannot be any compromise or second thought on the issue. He said, the Bar Association will soon start a campaign across the State to mobilize the public opinion in this regard and to educate the masses about the various facts and evidences of history.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh told the team of new office bearers of the Bar Association that time has come for all the nationalist forces to unite and defeat the mischievous designs of a handful few who keep raising the bogey of so-called Kashmir issue only to promote their vested agenda, at the cost of the common man and the common youth. He said, the lawyer community, being opinion makers in the society, have a significant responsibility to play as a part of their duty and obligation to Mother India.

 

Referring to the commitment and conviction of the government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last three years, several new vistas of growth and progress have opened up across the country, particularly for the youth. It is, therefore, he said, for the literate and representative bodies like the Bar Association to make the common people understand their stakes and not allow the State of Jammu & Kashmir to lag behind in seeking the rich benefits and dividends available to the other States of India.

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan assures Industry to convey concerns to Finance Minister for agreeable solutions 

Petroleum Minister also asks Industry Players to raise concerns with Oil and Gas producing States, to make changes in provisions which impact new investments and employment generation 
 

Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan reviewed the impact of GST on the Oil & Gas Sector. A workshop was organized by the Ministry after various public and private sector stakeholders from upstream, downstream and midstream segment raised several concerns on the likely impact of GST on the Oil and Gas Industry. Secretary for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri K D Tripathi was also present during the review. 

While welcoming GST as a progressive form of taxation, the Industry representatives referred to several provisions in the GST which could have adverse impact on upstream, midstream and downstream sectors. Several petroleum products namely Crude Oil, Petrol, Diesel, ATF and Natural Gas have been kept out of the GST. It was brought to the notice of the Ministry by the Industry representatives during the workshop, that, this exclusion will result in huge stranded taxes in the hands of oil industry due to non-availability of Input Tax Credit towards non-GST products. 

The Industry representatives highlighted that GST in its present form needs few amendments and clarifications as it may have negative impact on the Domestic Oil and Gas production, manufacturing, capital investment, pipeline expansion plans etc. It was also brought to the notice of the Ministry that exclusion of pipeline network from the definition of Plant & Machinery may adversely affect long term capital investment in the pipeline infrastructure projects. A suggestion was made that Green fuels like Natural Gas, CNG, Bio-Diesel and Ethanol Blended Petrol should be zero rated to promote environment friendly fuels. 

The Petroleum Minister, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan noted the concerns raised by the Industry and assured them to convey this to Hon’ble Finance Minister for agreeable resolution of the issues involved. Minister also asked the representatives of the industry to raise their concerns with respective state governments particularly oil and gas producing states to agree to make changes in those provisions pertaining to Oil & Gas Sector which may affect the new investments and employment generation.

Today, the Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan met H.E. Prime Minister Mr Pravind Kumar Jugnauth of Mauritius who is on a two day visit to India for bilateral meeting.  It is the first overseas visit of Prime Minister Jagnauth to India following his taking over the office as PM of Mauritius in January 2017.

 

During his meeting, Sh Pradhan discussed the strong and ongoing engagement with Mauritius in the hydrocarbon sector. Since 2006, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), India’s PSU refinery, has been supplying petroleum products to Mauritius. Both countries are presently working towards further deepening the engagement in the oil and gas sector. Both also discussed on the bunkering and oil jetty projects that are being jointly taken up by MRPL, Indian Oil Corporation along with State Trading Corporation of Mauritius (STCM). Both discussed on cooperation in the Natural Gas sector in Mauritius. In this regard, they decided that a delegation from Petronet LNG Ltd (PLL) will visit Mauritius at the earliest to have detailed discussion with authorities and stake holders in Mauritius.   



 

Mauritius, under its ‘Vision 2030’, wants to develop as a regional hydrocarbons trading hub. During the meeting, Sh Pradhan conveyed India’s continued support to Mauritius in meeting its energy requirement and also expressed India’s commitment in Mauritius becoming a regional petroleum hub, through requisite oil and gas sector infrastructure development.

1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2017 was 1847.16 TMT which is 0.08% higher than the monthly target and 2.51% higher when compared with April, 2016.  

1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during April, 2017 was 273.24 TMT which is 2.42% lower than monthly target but 4.53% higher than production in April, 2016. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 v  Less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Shalmari, Chandmari and Moran fields primarily on account of rise in water cut.

v  Less than planned contribution from new drilling wells and work over wells.

 

1.3  Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2017 was 818.45 TMT which is 6.31% lower than the monthly target and 8.44% lower than April, 2016. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

v  RJ-ON-90/1: Bhagyam production less due to 33 KV OHL rectification works. Mangala 70 wells shutdown for work over. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.

v  Panna-Mukta: Planned shutdown from 19-27.04.2017

v  Natural Decline in Ravva & CB-OS/2

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production

 

 

3.1    CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2017 was 11153.76 TMT which is 0.47% lower than the target for the month but 0.15% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

v  IOCL, Paradip: Throughput restricted due to maintenance works in SRU

v  IOCL, Haldia: Throughput is restricted due to high VGO stock and low crude availability due to pilferage in crude oil pipe-line.

v  BPCL, Mumbai:  Planned outage of CDU3 & HCU for turnaround & revamp.

v  HPCL, Visakh: Unplanned shutdown of CDU – II.

v  CPCL, Manali: Lower than target due to shutdown of OHCU/HGU on account of Instrument Air failure and also exchanger leak in HGU.

v  CPCL, CBR: Product upliftment constraints on account of BS-4 norms.

 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during April, 2017 was 1372.44 TMT which is 10.77% higher than the target for the month but 5.59% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year.  

3.3    Production in private refineries during April, 2017 was 7487.66 TMT which is 0.50% lower than the target for the month and 1.03% lower when compared with April, 2016.

3.4    Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of April, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.

                “Excellency and friends from OPEC, it is indeed a pleasure to meet you all here at OPEC headquarters.

·         Just before joining you all in this Hall, I had a very good meeting with the Secretary General. We briefly discussed issues that concern both India and OPEC.
 

·         I am happy that we are able to meet at regular intervals to share with each other our perspectives on the global hydrocarbon sector.
 

·         I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the arrangements made for this 2ndIndia-OPEC Institutional Dialogue, just prior to the OPEC Ministerial scheduled two days later.
 

·         I have brought a Group-7 of Indian Refiners. My delegation includes 7 Chief Executives from public and private sector, who head all 23 refineries in India processing 235 Million Metric Ton of crude annually or 4.7 Million Barrel per day capacity. They are important stakeholders, as they import 4 million barrel per day of crude and refine it and market it both in domestic and international markets.

Excellency and friends,

·         The India-OPEC dialogue is an important mechanism for us. I would like to give you a general perspective about India’s energy landscape. My colleagues will make detailed presentations during the course of the day.
 

·         Our Government is committed to provide clean and affordable fuel to all citizens of India. Lot of people still do not have ready access to quality energy, and we are expanding access of energy to the poor and excluded segment of the society.
 

·         In the energy sector, the priorities of the government are:

- Energy access
- Energy efficiency
- Energy sustainability
- Energy security
 

·         Towards achieving this, we have introduced several policies and reforms in the hydrocarbon sector. With the reforms and schemes the consumption of petroleum products is fast growing. We are also able to increase the penetration of fossil fuel in the country. With the shifting economic paradigm to the global East we plan to do much more.
 

·         Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is having the most stable political situation with solid macroeconomics. We are largely insulated from global slowdown. We have inflation under control, our current account deficit and fiscal deficit are under control.
 

·         Coming to the India-OPEC dialogue, it is crucial for us as we import about 86% of our crude, 70% of natural gas, 95% of cooking gas from the OPEC countries.
 

·         We expect this dialogue mechanism to be a useful tool to convey our position to the OPEC member countries.
 

·         During my last visit to Vienna for the 6th OPEC International Seminar in 2015, I had raised the issue of ‘Asian Dividend not Asian Premium’. The issue of Asian Premium still continues to exist. Our companies pay billions of dollars on this account. They still don't understand the rationale of this cross subsidisation of tariff between West and the East.
 

·         OPEC should treat Asian markets as Primary markets. It's  strategy of incentivising Western markets in the past did not result in retaining those markets.
 

·         I am fully aware that OPEC member countries are in the business of selling oil and not subsidising it. However, my purpose of raising this issue again today is to say that don’t subsidise others at our expense. I urge the OPEC and through you also to Non-OPEC countries to purposefully consider this.
 

·         The other issue I have been raising is that OPEC should work towards “Responsible Price” which would allow major consuming countries to provide energy to the common people. Higher prices would force them to go for alternate forms of energy which would be slowing down the demand of crude oil.
 

·         The energy mix in India in last 3 years has changed with renewables coming in a big way and pricing of solar energy coming down to 4 cents per unit. There is huge pressure to shift focus to solar, wind, Electric Vehicles, Hybrid cars etc. Yesterday I saw video of Lockheed Martin developing Hybrid Aircrafts. We need to realise that the oil Industry is at a delicate cross road and higher crude prices will give a further push to renewables.
 

·         I believe the purpose of setting up this Institutional Dialogue is to exactly serve this purpose, and to have a dialogue between OPEC as a producer and India as a consumer, to sensitise each other’s concerns and to better understand our perspectives.

 

Excellency and Friends,

·         I would like to inform that India is growing consistently at a rate above 7 % annually. The growth rate in the energy sector is over 7-8%, which is double the rate of many developed markets. With increasing demand and consumption, we are increasing imports and also our refining capacity.
 

·         Today, our annual refining capacity is 235 MMT of which 194 MMT of products are consumed domestically, while the rest is exported. At the same time our energy consumption is expected to double in the next 15 years. We are in fact net exporters of Gasoline, Naptha, Jet fuel and Gas oil. We are in the process of increasing our refining capacity around 310 MMT by 2023. India is fast becoming a refinery hub.
 

·         We are also investing about US$ 80 billion in Petrochemicals in next 3-5 years.

·         Excellency and friends,

·         India has three important resources:

i.  Technology;
ii.  Human resources; and one which connects these two
iii. Market, in fact one of the largest markets.

·         This is supplemented by a strong, dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Modi.
 

·         Technology has changed the very fundamentals of our industry. In India it has helped us to become more effective and efficient. We have been able to set up complex and efficient refineries and petrochemical complexes in India. These refineries can refine all kinds of crude from different parts of the world.
 

·         Indian engineers today have mastered the technology in refining sector and have set up large and complex refineries with high efficiency. Last year our engineers built a state-of-the-art refinery in Paradip in the Eastern part of India. It is one of the most advanced refineries in India with a Nelson index of 14. It is our effort to continuously upgrade our personnel to meet global industry standards.
 

·         Presently, India’s per capita energy consumption is 0.55 tons of oil equivalent, which is far below the global average of 1.9 tons of oil equivalent. The energy consumption is expected to grow to almost double by 2035.
 

·         All the three factors  have placed India in a very unique position which makes us an important customer who cannot be neglected. There are similar customers in our part of the world, however, India is the only country where the demand will continue to rise for more than a decade.
 

·         This is where the need for revisiting our engagement with OPEC is felt important.
 

·         I would like to highlight that there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil and gas to explore and develop. In fact, the revolution in shale technology in the USA is an important contributor to today’s level of oil prices.
 

·         I would like to also underline here the importance of market. In today’s oversupplied market, it is important for producers to understand the perspective of consumers and demand centres and the changes that have taken place in these demand centres.
 

·         As the security of supplies is an important factor for consumers, security of demand is equally important for producers.
 

·         I understand that energy security is a full circle. We all know that production cut is an attempt to arrest the slide in prices, however, it also has an inherent chance of under investment and consumer’s needs not being met in the long run, which is not in the interest of a balanced and healthy global oil and gas market. We are not just sellers and buyers, we are Energy Partners.
 

·         Given the technological advances and scenarios that might develop and in order to benefit from the available global spread of energy resource base, we are engaged with several non-traditional producers and suppliers. Our Group of Seven Refiners, who are here today, are working out details of the strategy to buy cargos, including from the USA and Canada, which happens to be becoming very competitive.
 

·         Our government is working to make India as a gas based economy. We are creating several gas based infrastructure in India, including adding of another 14,000 kms of gas pipelines to the existing 16,000 kms pipelines. We are building mega refineries, petrochemical complexes and LNG terminals.
 

·         In this context, we are confident that the India-OPEC engagement will prove to be a very productive dialogue mechanism to grow together.

Thank you.”

                Shri Pradhan emphasised on ‘Asian Dividend rather than paying Asian Premium’

Stressed on work towards “Responsible Pricing” by OPEC; important for India for socio-economic and developmental reasons

The production cut is an attempt to arrest slide in prices; But there is chance of under investment and consumer’s needs not being met in long run

 

The Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan visited Vienna, Austria to co-chair the 2nd India-OPEC Institutional Dialogue at the OPEC headquarters. The meeting took place two days prior to the OPEC Ministerial meeting that is scheduled from 25th May.

Shri Pradhan held a one-to-one meeting with the Secretary General of OPEC Mr Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. Later he discussed bilateral issues of interest at a delegation level dialogue. Shri Pradhan highlighted the importance of India – OPEC engagement and discussed on the effects of the production cut of 1.8 mbpd by OPEC and non-OPEC countries on the global oil market volatility.

The Minister said that India had been and continued to be a reliable customer of OPEC countries, the only big economy where the demand for crude oil continues to rise each year. About 86% if India’s import of crude oil, 70% of natural gas, 95% of LPG are from OPEC countries. Shri Pradhan alos informed about the increasing refining capacity of India and future expansion plans. He also briefed OPEC about the expanding petrochemical sector in India.

 In this context, Shri Pradhan underlined the importance of market and reiterated the need to intensify bilateral dialogue to change the nature of engagement from a buyer-seller relationship to an Energy Partnership. He added that in today’s oversupplied market, it was important for producers to understand the perspective of consumers and the demand centers and the changes that have taken place in these demand centres. He stressed on the fact that while the security of supplies was important for consuming countries, the security of demand was equally important for producers. In this context, he emphasised the importance of a purposeful and improved dialogue among producer and consumer countries, particularly benefitting India as a fast growing market.

Shri Pradhan reiterated that as a large import destination there should be no ‘Asian Premium’ on the crude supplied to India and Asian buyers. He highlighted that India provided timely payments and honored all its contractual commitments and demanded due acknowledgment through discount in prices for large volumes that India imports. He added that for a long time OPEC subsidised western buyers at the cost of Asian buyers. Given the importance of Asian market for OPEC, particularly fast growing Indian market which stood by OPEC as a reliable and continued customer, Shri Pradhan emphasised on ‘Asian Dividend rather than paying Asian Premium’. 

The Minister also stressed that the OPEC should work towards “Responsible Pricing” which is important for India for socio-economic and developmental reasons. It would allow India to provide energy to the common and marginalised people who have been deprived of access to energy so far. Higher crude prices would retard growth rate which will result in slowing down the demand of crude oil.

 

The Minister highlighted that the Energy Mix in India is undergoing major changes with renewables coming in a big way and pricing of solar energy coming down to 4 cents per unit. There is also a shift in focus to solar, wind, biomass, Electric Vehicles, Hybrid cars etc. He emphasised that the oil Industry is at a delicate cross road and higher crude prices will give a further push to renewables.

 

On the proposed plan of continued production cut by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, Shri Pradhan said that energy security was a full circle. He said that while the production cut is an attempt to arrest the slide in prices, however, it also has an inherent chance of under investment and consumer’s needs not being met in the long run, which is not in the interest of a balanced and healthy global oil and gas market.

The Minister was accompanied by Secretary for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Indian Ambassador in Vienna and CEOs of seven large refiners of India,  both from public and private sector including IOCL, HPCL, BPCL, MRPL, HMEL,  Reliance and Essar. The CEOs also emphasised their points of view during the OPEC meeting.

This was the first time that both public sector and private refiners from India came together to present their common issues, concerns and demands before the OPEC.

Shri Pradhan thanked the Secretary General for hosting the meeting. It was agreed that India will host the next meeting during 2018.

It is requested that general public should not respond to the advertisement or any other communication from this entity in any manner.

Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan addressed the media on the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), a flagship scheme of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas here today.

Shri Pradhan said that the PMUY has surpassed the targets for the financial year 2016-17 in terms of installing new connections. Over 2.20 Crore connections have been given in the first year of its launch scheme to BPL families as per the SECC 2011 data.  This has surpassed the target of 1.5 Cr connections for the financial year. PMUY was launched on 1st May, 2016 at Ballia, Uttar Pradesh by Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

In the financial year 2016-17, Oil Marketing Companies have given 3.25 Cr new connections across the country. This is the highest ever LPG connections released in any given year. Today the total number of active LPG consumer has crossed 20 Crore. This has been a quantum jump from 14 Cr in the year 2014 he said.

Shri Pradhan said that the LPG demand in the country has registered a growth rate of more than 10%. More than 4,600 new distributors have been added in the last 3 years which have come up primarily in rural areas.

Speaking on the key features of implementation of PMUY, Shri Pradhan said that 85% of the new consumers have come back for a refill. About 38% of the beneficiaries in PMUY are from SC/ST category. He added that PMUY has been implemented in a participatory mode involving beneficiaries, elected representatives, distinguished personalities, local administration etc. A differential communication strategy to popularize the scheme as well as educating beneficiaries on safety norms through regional languages was carried out. There is a 360-degree engagement and also monitoring of the implementation of the scheme. Shri Pradhan said PMUY has become a social movement with the beneficiaries coming forward in large number to apply and get the cylinders installed.

The Petroleum Minister also highlighted the efforts made by the Ministry and OMCs by the use of Digital Governance in the execution of the PMUY Scheme. Activities like Digitally aided identification and selection of beneficiaries of Ujjwala; Digital filing of KYC of Ujjwala beneficiaries; transfer of Subsidy to all PAHAL beneficiaries digitally without human interference; Monitoring of Ujjwala implementation on daily basis using IT enabled dashboard; Identification of new locations to set up LPG distributorships through use of technology; Online Application and Online draws have been carried out by the Ministry and Oil Marketing Companies for successful execution of this scheme.

The Minister laid emphasis on the efforts made by District Nodal Officers (DNOs) from Oil Marketing Companies. He said that the DNOs have been ‘foot soldiers’ at the ground level to effectively coordinate with all the stakeholders to implement the PMUY.

The Minister also said that an exercise was undertaken to get the feedback of the beneficiaries through the district visits by Senior officials of Ministry and the Oil PSUs (over 650 districts were visited).

Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan while addressing media today, congratulated the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force for unearthing the racket involved in short delivery of fuel at petrol stations in Lucknow. These raids were carried at 11 petrol pumps out on specific information regarding tampering with fuel calibration by use of electronic chips. Of these, electronic chips were found at 9 fuel stations, 3 of which belong to IOCL and the other 6 belong to BPCL. 

The Minister said that he held talks with the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and DGP of Uttar Pradesh on this issue. The Central and State Governments have decided to hold a meeting in Lucknow in light of the raids, which would be chaired by the Chief Secretary, Uttar Pradesh and will be attended by representatives of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Oil Marketing Companies. 

The Minister said that all fuel stations in Uttar Pradesh will be re-assessed by a team comprising of representatives from State Government’s Weight and Measures Department, Civil Supplies Department, Special Task Force and the Oil Marketing Company. At the same time, random surprise checks will be conducted all across the country at fuel stations. The instructions to this effect have been given to all concerned. Shri Pradhan said that the Central Government hopes for full cooperation from the States as Weights and Measures is a State subject and the annual supervision cum certification of fuel delivery units at fuel stations is carried out by the Weights and Measures Departments of the concerned State. 

Shri Pradhan said consumer interest is paramount and that strict action will be taken against those found guilty of tampering with fuel calibration. He said that those dealers violating the Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) will also face strict action mounting to even termination of licences.

Projects with an outlay of Rs. 42,553.17 Crores approved for 32 States/UTs

 

 

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal addressed the media on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) here today. The Minister said, “Every state in the country has joined Power for All agreement”. All the states have pledged to boost holistic development of entire village electrification process to provide 24x7 affordable and quality power to all which is planned under DDUGJY. 

 

The Minister interacted with the regional media representatives from 12 State Capitals through video conferencing and informed them about latest achievements under the DDUGJY scheme in the respective States. Shri Goyal also launched the new dashboard for GARV application and booklet on rural electrification on the occasion. 

 

Talking about the impact of good governance in Rural Electrification, Shri Goyal said, “The Government is working on the concept of 4S i.e. Skill, Speed, Scale and now Sewa to improve the lives of the rural populace as the prime priority. The Minister further added, “We have changed the rules of this game. Instead of counting 10% households in the village to complete electrification process, now the Government is focusing on providing power connections to each and every household of village, thus providing meaning to the concept of ‘Antyodaya’.

 

Shri Goyal said that, in line with the philosophy of Pandit DeenDayal Upadhyaya of ANTYODAYA (serving the last Man), on 20th November 2014, Government of India had approved Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), an integrated scheme covering all aspects of rural power distribution viz., Feeder Segregation, System Strengthening, Metering. Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address to the nation on 15th August 2015 pledged to electrify all Un-electrified villages within 1000 days. Government of India therefore taken up Village Electrification on Mission mode targeting completion by May 2018.

 

Shri Goyal further added that, out of the 18,452 un-electrified census villages in the country, 13,469 villages have been electrified up to 15th May, 2017.

More than 350 Gram Vidyut Abhiyantas (GVA) deployed in the field to monitor the progress of village electrification works. GARV Mobile App (garv.gov.in) was developed for monitoring progress of electrification in 18,452 un-electrified villages, in line with milestones. GVAs update in the GARV App, field photographs, data and other information. On 20th December 2016, updated GARV App had been launched for monitoring Household electrification in all 5.97 Lakh Villages. Updated GARV has the special feature of SAMVAD – engaging the citizens for establishing transparency and accountability.

 

The scheme is expected to transform lifestyle of villagers and bring in overall socio-economic development in rural areas. Following are the key outcomes of the scheme: 

·         Increased productivity in agriculture

·         Reducing drudgery for women 

·         Improvement in children education

·         Connectivity to all villages and households

·         Viable and reliable electricity services in rural areas

·         Improvement in delivery of health & education services

·         Improvement in access to communications (radio, telephone, television, mobile)

·         Improvement in public safety through lighting

 

The scheme has complete flexibility for selecting scope of works as per local requirement/priority of States. The population criteria have been dispensed with and all Villages/hamlets without any population restriction are eligible under the scheme. States are to consult District Electricity Committee (DEC) while formulating DPRs and the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) proposals of Members of Parliament are necessarily to be covered in the scheme. The scheme has other features like Mandatory E-tendering, compliance of Standard Bidding Document. Private Discoms and RE Cooperative Societies are also eligible under the scheme. The scheme is being reviewed by DISHA (District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee). Government of India is committed to transform the lives of rural populace and provide 24x7 Power for All (PFA).

                Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal presided over the launch of World’s largest efficient lighting programme, UJALA – UK (UK Joins Affordable LEDs for All) by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. (EESL) in London, United Kingdom today. Talking about the philosophy of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi about preventing wastage of all resources especially electricity, Shri Goyal said that, “a sustainable lifestyle is important for the future of the planet and if the planet has to be saved for the future generations, it is I, you and we all who have to collectively make a difference and act today itself. We are running out of time.”

Informing the august gathering about the scale at which the EESL LED programme is expanding, the Minister said that, “the EESL LED programme in India has grown 140 times in less than 2 years and I don't think we will find any parallel to that anywhere in the world. EESL would achieve the turnover target of $1.5 million by 2019, concomitant with the Government of India’s target under the UDAY scheme and 100% rural household electrification”. Shri Goyal further stated that even in the Developed countries like the US and Europe, there is a great potential for incorporating energy efficiency measures like the EESL LED programme, especially looking at the climate change scenario in the present context. India's share in the Global LED market has increased from a mere 0.1% a few years back to around 16% today, it was informed.

Talking about the potential energy savings by implementing the LED programme in India, Shri Goyal said that lighting alone consists of 15% of the total energy needs of the population across the country, especially the lower middle class families, which is about 180 billion units of energy. As India moves towards becoming a 100% LED Nation, the potential savings would be around 112 billion units, in other terms reducing carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 79 million tonnes every year. Consequently, India’s peak load will reduce by about 20 GW and our consumers will save around $6.5 billion worth in electricity bills annually, the Minister added.

Describing the strategy for scaling up the LED penetration in UK, Shri Goyal said that India was able to significantly reduce the purchase price of the LED by increasing efficiency and not giving subsidies to the consumers. The scheme has sustained itself on the savings achieved by increasing energy efficiency in the whole lifecycle of the LED bulbs. “Government of India has fine tuned the process, brought down the costs of manufacturing and sold nearly 230 million LED bulbs whereas the private sector, in the same period, sold about 330 million LED bulbs, effectively replacing about 560 million incandescent bulbs in the last 2 years. The consumers are the direct beneficiaries by saving on electricity bills and reducing the carbon footprint on the environment for the future generations, he added.

The Minister requested the Government of UK to get EESL in touch with all the stakeholders like local distribution companies, e-commerce companies, hotels, industry, large businesses, supermarket chains etc. and replicate India's model in the UK so as to achieve a similar kind of scale up that the programme has witnessed in India as a zero investment model. He stressed that a massive deployment of this LED programme throughout the world will go a long way in fighting climate change and make the world a better place to live in for the future generations. The Minister urged all the dignitaries present to become ambassadors of this Energy Efficiency programme for a better tomorrow. “I hope that we all will come together in a mission mode to adopt Energy Efficiency as a way of life in the future”, Shri Goyal added.

The Minister also suggested to the Government of the UK a target of replacing at least 100 million incandescent bulbs with LEDs by March 2019 and reduce the individual household consumption of energy by at least half. Further, it was informed that as a beginning to UJALA-UK operations, EESL has started the retrofitting of the facade and other lights of the High Commission of India in UK and the India House which would lead to considerable energy savings. EESL’s engagement with the UK will cover a broad spectrum including marketing of the world class energy efficiency products, services, investments and raising capital, scouting for new energy efficiency technologies and partnering with British companies to establish presence in third world country markets.

During the event, MoUs were signed between Indian High Commission and EESL and between the British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers Association (BEAMA) and the Indian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association (IEEMA) to strengthen bilateral industry cooperation and exchanges between India and the UK.

Dignitaries present during the event were Shri Y.K. Sinha, the High Commissioner of India to the UK, Shri Dinesh Patnaik, Deputy High Commissioner of India in UK, Pankaj Patel, President, FICCI along with other dignitaries from Governments of India and UK, FICCI and other stakeholders from the industry.

In the context of free flow of capital and people, he pointed to India’s large market, its economies of scale, its potential as a manufacturing hub for the rest of the world and asked Austrian companies to join the growth oriented process of evolution in India. 

The well attended event included over 30 representatives of Austrian companies, the Vice President of WKO, Ms Ulrike Rabmer-Koller and the FICCI delegation including, inter alia, Shri Pankaj Patel, President FICCI and Chairman and Managing Director of Zydus Cadila. Representatives of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research & Economy also attended the event. 

Austrian companies indicated keenness to collaborate with Indian partners and share new technologies and innovations. They emphasized the importance of finding right partners in India and Austria in the renewable sector and spoke about their areas of expertise and priority as also their experiences of doing business in India. 

On May 11, 2017, Shri Piyush Goyal delivered the Key Note Address at the Opening Ceremony of the Vienna Energy Forum. He annotated, what the Organizer’s introduced as “the largest energy transformation project in the world”. He highlighted Government of India's priorities and commitments towards sustainable energy. He reminded that SDGs could only be fulfilled through a comprehensive approach which could lay emphasis on affordability, reliability and sustainability. 

Recalling that the road from Paris had been somewhat difficult, he reiterated that India stood committed to what it had undertaken at Paris, irrespective of what happened in other parts of the world. This commitment was an article of faith for Prime Minister Modi. 

He spoke of the rapid strides made by India in energy conservation and energy efficiency, the goal of 24x7 power for all by 2022, the year of India’s 75th Anniversary of Independence and his personal commitment to make this happen even earlier by 2019.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhu said that Indian Railways started third party Cleanliness Index of Stations since last year. Railways have accomplished a significant improvement in cleanliness at station. This index instils competitive spirit among the stations. The biggest challenge for cleanliness at the platforms is visitors along with the passengers, even the toilets are used by large number of visitors who are not Railway travellers. However, Railways have to move forward. The focus is on Platform cleanliness, coach cleanliness, toilets cleanliness in the coach & track cleanliness. Railways have introduced Clean My Coach services which is getting overwhelming response of the passengers, Four green corridors have been marked which are free from discharge of human waste. I urge the municipal corporation of the cities which have encroachments to come forward and cooperate in eliminating human waste from the tracks.

Background:

Indian Railways is the third largest rail network with 66,000 route kilometre stretch covering more than 8000 stations. Consequent to the launch of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ on 2nd Oct’2014 by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Indian Railways had also launched ‘Swachh Rail Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ to achieve the vision of ‘Clean India’ by 2nd Oct’ 2019, which shall be the 150th Birthday of father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi.

 

In the Rail Budget presented in Feb’2015, 2016 and 2017, series of measures to improve the cleanliness of stations were announced to take forward the momentum of ‘Swachh Rail Swachh Bharat’. One of the measures given in Feb’2016 Budget is ranking of A1 and A category stations based on regular periodic third party audit and feedback from passengers, with a view to identify unclean spots/gaps and to improve cleanliness standards and also to propel healthy competition among railway stations. Ministry of Railway (Environment and Housekeeping Management Directorate, Railway Board) commissioned a passenger feedback survey on cleanliness at major railway stations. The task of survey was entrusted to Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).

 

First survey conducted by IRCTC in 2016 by conducting interviews of passengers at the stations on various parameters of cleanliness and rating them on these basis. The second survey has been conducted by Quality Council of India (QCI) who with the help of their partners have conducted the survey of 407 major railway stations (75 A1 category and 332 A category stations) of Indian Railways.

 

The parameters adopted for conducting the survey are: Evaluation of Process of cleanliness in Parking, main entry area, main platform, waiting room,(33.33%) direct observation by QCI assessors of cleanliness in these areas (33.33%) and passenger feedback(33.33%). A 24x7 control room was set up  and images were geo-tagged to monitor progress.

 

The survey was conducted through interviews with respondents on the questionnaire on cleanliness indicators, which was done face to face by survey teams by visiting each of the 407 stations across 16 Zonal Railways. Every passenger was asked to rate the cleanliness of stations objectively on 40 different cleanliness parameters.

 

Purely based on the survey on the cleanliness of stations and the analysis thereof, 407 major stations have been given rankings in this Report submitted by the survey agency to Ministry of Railways for scrutiny and further action. Final report is expected to be submitted by QCI shortly, which will include specific actionable items for each division. Ministry of Railways will take further action for improving the cleanliness standards at major stations of Indian Railways thereupon.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Phephana-Indara and Mau-Shahganj (excluding Indara-Mau) totaling 150 km approximately in Uttar Pradesh.

The respective length of the Phephana-Indara and Mau-Shahganj lines will be 50.53 km and 99.75 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1028.95 crore with expected completion cost of Rs.1190.98 crore. The project is likely to be completed in next five years.

The doubling of these lines will remove the pressure over the congested North Central Railway route by providing an alternative route. Also, more number of goods/passenger trains could be run after doubling. It will lead to economic prosperity and development of the areas.

Background:

The areas served by this route are densely populated and there has been persistent unfulfilled demand of additional trains for the local and metropolitans cities. Shahganj-Mau-Phephna provides an important link between Amritsar-Moradabad-Lucknow-Mughalsarai-Patna section and Gorakhpur-Chhapra-Hajipur-Guwahati section. Thus doubling of this section will provide much needed relief toVaranasi-Mughalsarai and Makama-Barauni section which are highly congested.

                Taking forward the vision of the Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi to link the Chardham pilgrimage centres through rail connectivity and in keeping with its budgetary commitment, the Indian Railways is taking the significant step to commence the Final Location survey for a single BG line rail connectivity for the Chardham Pilgrimage. Reiterating his commitment to fast-track this rail project, Minister for Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, to lay the foundation stone for the Final Location Survey For Single Broad Gauge Line Rail Connectivity at a ceremonial program to be held in the presence of Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat, as the Chief Guest on the occasion at 12.30 p.m. on 13 May 2017(Saturday) at Badrinath. Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh, and Members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha of the region along with the Members of Legislative Assembly, Uttarakhand are also slated to grace the function with their distinguished presence.

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Public Sector Enterprise under Ministry of Railways has been entrusted to undertake the Final Location Survey for rail connectivity to Chardham and Chardham Yatra (Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath & Kedarnath via Dehradun & Karanprayag) in the State of Uttarakhand. As alignment will pass through the rugged mountainous terrain of mighty Himalayas, the Railway has to meet the challenges of railway construction integrating the unique challenges of the terrain and adverse geology along with limits of load, capacity, safety and speed. The four Dhams have their varied and distinctive elevation levels along with unique spiritual significance. The Yamunotri tracing the origin of River Yamuna is situated at 3293 m above Mean Sea Level (MSL) while the Gangotri tracing the origin of River Ganga is situated at 3408 m above MSL. The Kedarnath housing the Shrine of Lord Shiva, is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas at 3583 m above MSL, while Badrinath housing the Shrine of Lord Vishnu is at 3133 m above MSL. The existing railheads or the nearest railway stations to the proposed Chardham connectivity are Doiwala, Rishikesh and Karanprayag (on the upcoming Rishikesh-Karanprayag new rail line under construction by RVNL) at mean MSL ranging from 400-825 m. The proposed Chardham rail line connecting to 2000 m MSL and above will be an engineering challenging feat.

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited has undertaken a Reconnaissance Engineering Survey (REC) in the year 2014-15 of the rail connectivity project and has submitted its report in October 2015, recommending two take-off points one from existing Doiwala station and one from Karanprayag station (under construction). For the Gangotri alignment, the proposed rail link takes off from Doiwala station to connect upto Manneri at 1270 m above MSL marking a route of 131 km via Uttarkashi. For Yamunotri, the alignment is proposed to take off midway from Gangotri link at Uttarkashi making a “Y” connection and terminating at Palar (1265 m above MSL) with a take- off route length of 22 km. For the Kedarnath alignment, the proposed line will take off from proposed Karanprayag station and terminating at Sonprayag(1650 m above MSL) via Saikot with a route length of 99 km. The Badrinath alignment will take off midway from Kedarnath link at Saikot making a “Y” connection and terminating at Joshimath (1733 m above MSL) with a route length of 75 km. As per the Reconnaissance Survey the total route length is 327 km at estimated cost of Rs. 43,292 Cr. The REC Survey recommends 21 new stations, 61 tunnels totaling to 279 km tunnel length and 59 bridges. The alignment will have ruling gradient of 1 in 80 with a maximum degree of curvature of 5 degree.

 

Chardham, is one of the unique cornerstones of Hindu pilgrimage which is intertwined to mystical and spiritual aspirations of every devout Hindu. Large number of pilgrims flock to Chardham while foreign and domestic tourist  are attracted to trekking & sightseeing in the state of Uttarakhand. The Railway envisages bringing in a new era of safe and comfortable travel through this Chardham Rail Connectivity Project. Alongside, Indian Railways through Rail Vikas Nigam Limited is concurrently pursuing its ambitious project of construction of new rail line between Rishikesh and Karanprayag and efforts are underway to fast-track the completion of the project. These rail projects shall add momentum to the progress of the State by connecting far-flung areas besides boosting opportunities for the tourism and economic development. When completed, these rail projects would script their own unique engineering marvels in the history world railways.

The Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra Chief Minister Shri Devendra Fadnavis launched India’s first multi-modal electric vehicle project at the Nagpur airport complex today. This unique project brings together e-buses, e-cabs, e-rickshaws and e-autos on a single platform, the Ola App, which will enable commuters in Nagpur to book them. The fleet of 200 vehicles consists of 100 of Mahindra’s new e20 Plus vehicles, besides those from other manufacturers like Tata Motors, Kinetic and TVS. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said that it was his Government’s vision to make India a 100 percent e-vehicle nation. Shri Gadkari said his Ministry was prepared to facilitate manufacturers and other companies to take the Nagpur model to other parts of the country. He said e- vehicles need to be promoted in order to cut down the huge crude oil bill, reduce pollution and create cost effectiveness in transportation. To begin with, the emphasis would be on commercial vehicles and then on others. 

Shri Gadkari informed that growing demand, coupled with R&D would gradually help to bring down the operational costs, and especially the battery cost. He added that once the cost of batteries comes down, e-vehicles will compete with diesel and petrol vehicles and finally phase them out.

Road connectivity in the North-East will see a major transformation when Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurates the country’s longest river bridge –the Dhola- Sadia Bridge in Assam tomorrow. This new, three lane, 9.15 kilometre bridge has been built over river Lohit, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, linking Dhola in Assam to Sadia in Arunachal Pradesh. The bridge will fill a huge connectivity gap that has existed in the region. Till now, the only means to cross the Brahmaputra at this location has been by ferry only in day-time and even this is not possible during floods. The last bridge over the Brahmaputra was the Kalia Bhomora Bridge at Tejpur. This will however change from tomorrow with the Dhola-Sadiya bridge ensuring 24X7 connectivity between upper Assam and Eastern part of Arunachal Pradesh. 

The bridge will also reduce the distance from Rupai on NH- 37 in Assam to Meka/Roing on NH-52 in Arunachal Pradesh by 165 KM. The travel time between the two places will come down from the current six hours to just one hour – a total five hour reduction. This will result in saving of petrol and diesel worth Rs 10 Lakh per day. 

The Dhola-Sadia bridge promises to usher in prosperity in the North-East. It will provide efficient road connectivity to remote and backward areas which have poor road infrastructure. This bridge will also give a major boost to overall economic development of the areas north of Brahmaputra in upper Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. It will also cater to the strategic requirements of the country in the border areas of Arunachal Pradesh, besides facilitating numerous hydro power projects coming up in the state , as it is the most sought after route for various power project developers. 

The total length of the Dhola-Sadia Bridge project, including the approach roads on each side, is 28.50 km. The length of the bridge itself is 9.15 Km. It has been constructed on BOT Annuity basis at a total cost of Rs 2,056 crore, as part of the Arunachal Package of Roads and Highways under the Ministry’s SPECIAL ACCELERATED ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME for NORTH EAST (SARDP-NE). The objective was to bring the people of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh closer to each other.

The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) today denied as baseless and misleading reports in a section of the media that it was reluctant on going ahead with the CBI enquiry in the matter of alleged irregularities in land acquisition matters in Nagina – Kashipur, Kashipur – Sitarganj, Sitarganj – Tanakpur and Rudrapur - Kathgodam sections in the State of Uttarakhand. 

The matter pertains to alleged change in land use under section 143 of the Zamindari Abolition Act by revenue authorities in the process of acquisition of land for NH projects. 

The NHAI never objected to any enquiry or investigation by any agency at any point of time in the matter. NHAI only conveyed its stand to various authorities in the State Government to clarify the roles and responsibilities of officials of the State Government and NHAI in land acquisition matters. 

The NHAI officials have no role to play in deciding the nature of land or the compensation amount to be paid for acquisition of land. The role of NHAI officials is limited to depositing the amount as may be decided by the competent revenue authorities or the Courts. 

NHAI requested the State authorities to intervene in the matter only because dragging NHAI officers in such incidences is going to be counterproductive. This may not only lead to adverse impact on the process of land acquisition in Uttarakhand, but also affect our targets in other States too. 

In the present situation, the NH projects in Uttarakhand have come to a complete halt. It is feared that such a situation may arise in other States also and the whole NHDP may get affected severely. 

It is clarified that land for NH projects is acquired under the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956 (NH Act). As per the recommendation of the State Government, the revenue officials of the State are duly appointed as Competent Authorities under section 3a of the NH Act. All the subsequent activities relating to preliminary notification u/s 3A, final notification u/s 3D as well as declaration of awards are within the domain of the Competent Authority under the Act. NHAI has a huge challenge to expedite projects, and acquisition of land is a major milestone in this process. Especially the matter of defining or changing the land use vests entirely with the State revenue authorities and NHAI has no role to play whatsoever. Generally, NHAI does not question the award announced by the Competent Authorities, as the revenue officials are the custodians of the revenue records and NHAI officials have no role to play in the acquisition process. This is also a fact that questioning the awards and going for arbitration delays the project which generally goes against the interest of the project.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the development of four laning of Porbandar-Dwarka Section of NH-8E in Gujarat.

The cost is estimated to be Rs.1958.88 crore including cost of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities. The total length of the road to be developed is approximately 118 kms.

This work will be done under the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) Phase IV on Hybrid Annuity Mode.

The project will help in expediting the improvement of infrastructure in Gujarat and in reducing the time and cost of travel for traffic, particularly heavy traffic, plying between Porbandar-Dwarka section. The development of this stretch will also help in uplifting the socio-economic condition of this region in the State.

It would also increase employment potential for local labourers for project activities. It has been estimated that a total number of 4,076 mandays are required for construction of one kilometre of highway. As such, employment potential of 4,80,000 (approx.) mandays will be generated locally during the construction period of this stretch.

                The National Highways Authority of India signed an MoU with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) in New Delhi today, for the development of a Multimodal Logistics Park in the Ponneri Industrial Node area near Kamarajar Port in Tamil Nadu. The MoU was signed in the presence of the Road Transport and Highways and Shipping Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari and Shri M.C. Sampath, Minister for Industries of Tamil Nadu government.


Speaking on this occasion, Shri Gadkari said that it is an important agreement for the development of an integrated, multi-modal transport infrastructure in the country.


The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is planning to develop Mutimodal Logistics Parks in under its Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) in 15 locations all over India at a cost of Rs 33,000 crore, including Rs 1295 crores investment for the Chennai Region. The proposed logistics parks will bring down the overall freight costs, reduce vehicular pollution and congestion and will enable reduction of warehousing costs.  All this is expected to result in lower logistics costs.

                India & UK today agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on bilateral cooperation in urban transport policy planning, technology transfer and institutional organization of transport.

The decision to enter into a bilateral cooperation arrangement between the Transport For London (TFL) and the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on a wide range of transport mobility solutions and associated activities in urban environments was taken during the three-day official visit of the Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari to Britain.

During his visit to the headquarters of Transport For London (TFL) , Shri Gadkari was given a presentation on strategy and policy reforms, customer experience and data analysis in respect of London buses and other integrated modes of public transport in Greater London area.

Under the proposed MOU, the TFL will share with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways its expertise on the mobility and efficiency of transport system and methodologies to facilitate the planning and delivery of mobility solutions including ticketing , passenger information, major project financing, infrastructure maintenance strategies and behavioural change and public transport promotion. 

Shri Gadkari later said the signing of the MOU will be done through diplomatic channels shortly. Possibilities of further cooperation on electric buses, bus innovation and capacity augmentation and water transport were also explored during his interaction with the TFL authorities.

The TFL provides world class services that keep the British capital better equipped with public transport. The TFL virtually coordinates all the London transport, including London metro, the bus network, Dockland Light Rail, water transport and cable car.

                The Minister of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari has been invited by the London Stock Exchange to address its guests and the media on the Government of India’s initiatives in infrastructure and opportunities for investors to participate in India’s growth story. The Minister will also open the market for the LSE for trading on the 11th of May 2017.

Shri Gadkari’s trip may also coincide with the culmination of the NHAI’s debut Masala Bond issuance which is expected to list on the LSE shortly.

Masala Bonds are a major initiative being encouraged by our Government . They have been gaining in popularity among foreign investors. Until recently, the ability of Indian companies and other issuers to borrow from the overseas markets was predominantly limited to foreign currencies, but Masala Bonds have finally taken off, giving Indian companies from various sectors the ability to access the international capital markets and raise financing without taking on the attendant exchange rate risk. What Indian companies need to do now, is to access the Masala Bond market to enhance its liquidity and give international investors the opportunity of exposure to the Indian Rupee.

It is with this objective that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) decided to access the Masala Bond Market. Given its strong linkages to the Government of India and its strategically important role for the national economy, the NHAI is uniquely placed to help attract the widest possible investors to the Masala Bond market and help develop it. Towards this objective NHAI has been conducting a global investor engagement exercise targeted at the world’s largest Supra Nationals and Sovereign Wealth Funds, Global Macro Funds and International Asset Managers This exercise is expected to culminate in London.

The state has close proximity to the prosperous northern and western regions of the country. Air infrastructure in the state is also good with Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur having full fledged airports. She said multi modal integrated transport and logistics would benefit Rajasthan to a great extent.

			India Integrated Transport & Logistics Summit
		
	


 

A panel of experts at the India Integrated Transport & Logistics Summit deliberated on ways and means to make urban transportation faster and more efficient. Growing urbanization has increased the need for efficient and seamless public transport systems. Development of public mass transport systems has picked up recently, with a proposal to build a metro rail system in every city with a population of more than 2 million. Multiple trial runs for BRTS system have also been conducted, with varying degrees of success, to improve the intra city transportation infrastructure. Developments in inter-city rail connectivity are also on the anvil. There is a pressing need to address issues of congestion, especially in view of the growing movement of consumer goods and to deploy new age technologies & practices to improve traffic movement and road safety.

The discussion focused on urban transport policy and role of public-private partnership in improving the same. Strengths and limitations of public and private participants in urban transit was also discussed. Currently, most common PPP model worldwide is government investing in infrastructure and private participants managing operations and maintenance activities. However, most panelists agreed that public transport which requires large investment would also benefit from private participation in infrastructure investment. There is also a need to adopt innovative models like land monetization and advertisement to enhance viability of public transport. 

Experts suggested that a unified urban transport body on the lines of Transport for London or the newly founded Riyadh authority can enable integrated and coordinated network and can have huge impact towards seamless urban mobility.

The role of technology in enabling a seamless connectivity and enhancing public transport use was also discussed.

Dr Ekroop Caur ,MD, Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) highlighted the key initiatives, like network optimization,taken up by her organization in providing adequate transportation in Bangalore. She also highlighted the importance of integrated planning in providing adequate connectivity to commuters.

Shri. Mukund Sinha OSD, Ministry of Urban Development talked about the funding mechanisms in place for public transportation by Government of India and highlighted the importance of transit oriented development.

Shri.M. Ramshekhar, MD, DIMTS talked about the future of mobility and Shri. Shashi Verma ,CTO and Director of Customer Experience, Transport for London highlighted the importance of an integrated authority in providing seamless urban mobility. He also highlighted the measures taken by TFL in enabling safer and greener urban freight mobility.

The lack of adequate and efficient warehousing and storage facilities is recognized as a major weakness of the logistics system in India. A panel of experts at the India Integrated Transport and logistics Summit deliberated on the issue of how to bring about supply chain transformations in the country.

Mr Nick Vyas  from the Centre for Global Supply Chain Management, USC Marshall, talked about multi-partner collaborative supply chain models in developed economies. He suggested that future supply chain requirements will depend on the increasing number of megacities and rising disposable incomes. He also stressed on the importance of aligning supply chains with evolving distribution channels on account of disruptive technologies like drones and AGVs.

Mr. Mike Mullin,Senior Director for Global Government Affairs, Brambles Limited, suggested the use of foldable and stackable direct packaging to increase packing efficiency in transportation and thereby reducing the final cost of product.  This will also lead to reduction of handling cost and carbon footprint. He also emphasized on the need of improvement of IT capabilities in developing nations.

Ms. Cecilia Briceño-Garmendia,Lead Economist, World Bank Transport and ICT, mentioned that logistic costs as a percentage of product cost is dependent on the maturity of product as well as the type of market. She suggested the need for government intervention via infrastructure development and policy formulation, to enhance profitability potential for private players.

The panel discussed the need for clustering of warehouses post GST implementation. The panel also talked about improving vehicle efficiency by implementing a relay system for truck drivers. The need of technology to have better tracking & tracing systems and improving the efficiency of logistics systems was also discussed. The panel suggested reduction in carbon footprint via local sourcing and stressed on the need to develop workforce skills in supply chain.

Multi Modal Logistics Parks are the way forward for reducing logistics costs in India, and the Government needs to focus on putting in place the right regulatory and institutional support for building the same.  A panel of experts discussed the issue at the India Integrated Transport & Logistics Summit at Vigyan  Bhawan in New Delhi yesterday.

 

Developing a network of multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) to act as logistics hubs will address the issues of unfavorable modal mix, inefficient fleet mix and an underdeveloped material handling infrastructure. Logistics parks are expected to help transition from the current situation of point-to-point freight movement to an ideal situation of hub and spoke model freight movement.

The large-scale investment required for developing logistics parks and the need to leverage industry best practices make the PPP model the most viable option. The involvement of a private player will enable access to state-of-the-art technologies available with the private sector and help in achieving efficient delivery of quality operational and maintenance services. Availability of long tenured loans, assistance in land acquisition and quality of trunk infrastructure are some of the other reasons which make the participation of the government critical in the development of logistics parks.

Addressing the session the Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha highlighted that both time and cost of logistics need to be considered while planning for efficient logistics. He gave international examples of multimodal integration and talked about developing Guwahati into an efficient multi-modal logistics hub. Shri. Mohammed Jamshed, Member (Traffic), Railway Board also addressed the session and presentations were made by Mr. Robert Brekelmans, Chief Executive Officer, Transforium Company Support and Shri Prakash Tulsiani, Chief Operating Officer, All Cargo Logistics Limited.

 

The panel discussed issues like  success stories of MMLPs in developed economies , Changing economic landscape and the need for MMLP, Impediments for multimodal logistics movement in India changes needed in Multimodal Transportation Act and the need for coordinated action

 

Multi Modal Logistics Parks are expected to bring down logistics costs by serving four functionalities - Freight aggregation and distribution, Multi Modal freight transportation, Storage and Warehousing with modern, mechanized warehousing space satisfying the special requirements of different commodity groups and  value added services: such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards,

warehousing management services, etc.

The development of Dedicated Freight Corridors has emerged as one of the  key solutions to improving  logistics in India. The emphasis here is on connecting  centres of economic importance in the most efficient ways using an optimal, multi-modal mix of transport, so that there is  consistent  and congestion free passage of cargo along key routes.  Such efficient transport of cargo will bring about the much needed reduction of logistics cost.

 

A special session at the India Integrated Transport & Logistics Summit (IITLS) discussed the key issues related to the development of such corridors. The Union Minister of State, Commerce & Industry Smt Nirmala Sitharaman addressed the session that was  chaired by NHAI Chairman Shri Yudhvir Singh Malik  and co-chaired by Shri. Vinayak Chatterjee, Chairman, CII National Committee on Infrastructure & PPP and Chairman, Feedback Infra Ltd.

As a means for developing an efficient transport system, the panel discussed themes like  adopting corridor approach to road development with considerations for  logistics and last mile connectivity , need for comprehensive ecosystem to promote coastal shipping, adopting global models to accelerate development of inland terminals and whether coastal shipping & inland waterways  will drive the next wave of logistics cost transformation

India has invested heavily in developing its road network over the last 25 years. India has a network of  about 5.25 million km of roads, accounting for about 60% of total freight movement. However, National Highways, the most important links in the Indian road network carrying 40% of total traffic movement, account for just 2% of the total road network. The government has taken steps to improve the national highway network by setting up of six corridors (4 legs of Golden quadrilateral, North-South & East-West corridors). These corridors carry 35% of total road freight.

Additionally, with 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways and a 7,500-km coastline, India has an immense potential for inland and coastal transportation. However, transportation through inland waterways has a share of less than 5% in the total logistics volumes. In comparison, China and EU transport about 45% of shipments through inland waterways. There are cost benefits of transportation through waterways and coastal shipping, with cost of these modes being half of competing modes like road and rail.

Government has taken visible steps to promote coastal shipping and inland waterway transport as viable alternates to road and rail by compensating the costs incurred on first mile and last mile connectivity, for the commodities with potential to be moved through inland waterways or coastal network. Government has also announced measures under the Sagarmala program for port-led development of coastal areas to enable multi modal transportation. Further steps like dedicated infrastructure to ensure priority berthing, port tariff rationalization to align rates for major and non-major ports etc. are required to make the value proposition of logistics movement through inland waterways and sea attractive for logistics players.

In his presentation Mr Jose Luis Irigoyen, Senior Director, World Bank Transport & ICT Group emphasized on  physical planning, adequate institutions and governance, and apt policy instruments as key enablers for development and management of economic corridors. He also highlighted areas in the corridor development program where World Bank could add value. Shri . Anil Devli CEO, INSA talked about the need to enhance the share of waterways in transport of cargo . Mr. H.F.W. de Leijer Partner, STC NESTRA, Netherlands presented a theoretical framework for the development of economic corridors and showcased the role of inland ports. He also discussed the concept of bundling cargo and presented about internationally adopted best practices.

The panel discussion that followed flagged the  importance of administrative and procedural interventions. Members also discussed the constraints and challenges before the railways and ports sectors. The panel talked about several institutional frameworks for the execution of corridor development and among other suggestions, a corridor-wise SPV was discussed.

The Minister of Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the three day India Integrated Transport and Logistics Summit (IITLS) organized by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion, he said that “Antyodaya” or the welfare of the weakest person in society is the foremost aim of this Government. To achieve this aim it is necessary to boost economic growth in the country. From the present GDP of around 7.5 percent we need to achieve double digit growth figures. Shri Gadkari said that for India, one of the major impediments to such growth is our high logistics cost. If our economy is to flourish and if we want to ensure sustainable and balanced growth in the country, we urgently need to reduce our logistics cost to globally comparable rates. 

The Minister further said that our high logistics costs are a result of the various modes of transport growing and developing in silos, in an un-integrated manner. Integrated, multi modal transport planning will help us to achieve a healthy modal mix of transport, which is efficient, faster, safer, import substituting, cost effective and pollution free. He also said that the logistics and transport sector has a very high potential for employment generation. It can provide jobs to the local youth after proper skill training. It can also provide employment opportunities in rural areas. 

The IITLS has been organized with the objective of facilitating constructive dialogue between various stakeholders for the development of multimodal infrastructure in the country. For the first time, the Ministries of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Civil Aviation, Railways, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Skill Development, Commerce, Urban Development, Finance, various state governments and industry and infrastructure experts are getting together to deliberate on various connected issue and discuss the modalities for bringing about a transformation of the logistics and transportation scenario in India. This is urgently required to improve logistics costs in India. Currently India has a very poor Logistics Performance Index due to an unfavourable modal mix of transport and a lack of seamless intermodal connectivity. 

In his address the Minister for Civil Aviation Shri P Ashok Gajpathi Raju said that India has witnessed explosive growth of air traffic and infrastructure in the last two to three years. He said that the Air Cargo industry is expected to register around 9% growth in the next few years. Given the circumstances, the coming up of logistics parks in the country will be very useful. 

The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan in his address said that there is an impressive growth in Road, Waterways, Air and Rail sector. He said that procurement, storage and distribution of agricultural produce need proper and efficient logistics system to plug leakages, avoid rotting of grains and other perishable items and timely transport of the produce to the market . He said that there is a need to develop a National Common Market. He said connectivity between rail, road and waterways are required, so that farmers can take their produce to market in time and get better price. 

Welcoming the efforts being put into the development of an integrated transport and logistics system the Minister for Railways Shri Suresh Prabhu said that there is an urgent need to integrate all transport systems. He said that with implementation of GST, trade and business will grow with much faster rate. While fiscal barriers to the movement of goods have been done away with, the physical barriers also need to be removed. The Minister said that the various transport sectors like railways, aviation, roads and shipping are seeing a lot of growth and development in the recent years. The railways have greatly enhanced their investment, and decongestion and electrification of routes are being done on a war footing. Efficiency of freight terminals is being improved, and three more dedicated freight corridors have been planned. He also said that port rail connectivity is also becoming better and more efficient with the Sagarmala programme. He added that to make transport systems in the country truly efficient we need to focus on integrated, seamless, multi-modal growth. 

The Minister for Skill Development Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy said with all infrastructure and logistics development the need to develop skills of man power is also required. The employment seeker will need proper training for this area. He said that with the transport and logistics sector poised for a makeover, a lot of new jobs are likely to become available. He emphasized the need to train the youth to make the best of these upcoming opportunities. 

The Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Pon Radhakrishnan proposed a vote of thanks. Earlier during the session the Minister for State for Road Transport & Highways and Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya welcomed the delegates. Speaking on the occasion Shri Mandaviya stressed upon the need for an integrated approach for development of multi modal transport. He said the government is also working for alternatives for cargo movement from road to inland waterway and rail. He said the mission of the government is to bring down carbon emission to 10 percent. 

The Chairman and Chief Executive officer of DP World, H.E. Sultan Bin Sulayam also addressed the summit. Shri Sulayam said that due to lack of proper storage, nearly 10,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables get wasted in India. If proper planning is done and proper storage facility and logistic infrastructure made available, this wastage could be stopped. He said India has huge potentials and opportunity to unlock. 

An MoU was signed between DP World and National Investment Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) to develop projects spanning the port and logistics sectors including opportunities under the Sagarmala initiative, the Dedicated Freight Corridors and Logistics infrastructure aimed at reducing agriculture produce losses. 

The inaugural session was followed by the plenary session. The session was addressed by Secretary Shipping Shri Rajive Kumar, Chairman Railway Board Shri A.K.Mittal, Commerce Secretary Smt Rita Teoatia, Secretary Civil Aviation Shri Rajive Nayan Choubey , Secretary DIPP Shri Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary Food and Public Distribution Smt Preeti Sudan and Secretary Road Transport & Highways Shri Sanjay Mitra. The secretaries all welcomed the step to organize the seminar and flagged issues relevant to their ministries. 

The IITLS is envisaged as a platform for all stakeholders in transport and logistics sectors to come together and initiate collaborative partnerships to realize the various greenfield and brownfield opportunities in logistic parks, freight corridors and IT solutions. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) had undertaken a study, called the Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP), which has identified four key solution themes to improve the state of logistics in India. These are, freight corridor upgradation, logistics park development, seamless interstate movement and electronic toll collection systems. Taken together, these initiatives are expected to reduce India's logistics costs and bring them closer to the accepted global benchmarks from the current high levels of 13-14% of GDP. The Ministry plans to develop 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) in India which will, cater to 50% of the freight movement, enable -10% reduction in transportation costs and -12% reduction in C02 emissions. Land parcels have been identified and pre-feasibility studies initiated on six of these locations. The government is also working to formulate a uniform policy for the development of MMLPs.

                The Ministry of Rural Development has created employment opportunities of more than 813 crore person days during the last three years (2014-17) in the schemes of MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri AawasYojna, Grameen (PMAY-G) and in Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY). Briefing the media here, Union Minister for Rural Development, Drinking Water & Sanitation and Panchayati Raj, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar said that during the last three years while 636.78 crore person days were generated under MGNEREGA, about 78 crore person days under PMGSY and 99 crore person days under PMAY. Apart from this, under Deen Dayal Upadhyay-Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDY-GKY), 86,120 candidates were trained in the year 2014-15 and 54,196 got jobs. Similarly, in 2015-16, about one lakh thirty-five thousand candidates were placed after the skill training, while in 2016-17, the number of candidates getting placement is 84,900. 

Shri Tomar said that in the current year, the Ministry of Rural Development proposes to train 5 lakh candidates with an assured placement of over 70 percent of these youth in Wage and Self Help employment programmes. He said that Rural Self Employment Training Institute (RSETIs) trained 4 lakh rural youth in 2016-17 for Self Employment. 

Shri Tomar said that under MGNREGA during FY 2016-17, more than 1.23 crore assets have been geo tagged and placed in public domain and about 96% of wage payments were electronically credited into the accounts of the workers through DBT system. So far, 8.73 crore Aadhar number of workers have been seeded in NREGASoft (MIS) and 4.73 have been enabled for Aadhar Based Payment with their consent. He added that Job Card verification/updation was taken on priority basis during FY 2016-17 and more than 1 crore Job Cards have been deleted after verification. 

On the subject of PMAY-G, Shri Tomar said that in line with the government’s stated objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, the Government intends to provide houses to 1 crore poor people by 2019 in rural areas. A total of 34.82 lakh houses have been constructed during 2014-15 to 2015-16, against a target of 45.98 lakh houses under the erstwhile scheme of Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY). During 2016-17, a total of 32.14 lakh houses have been completed with an expenditure of Rs. 16,074 crore under the revamped scheme PMAY-G. 

On PMGSY, the Minister said that the pace of construction of road has reached a record of 130 kms. per day, which is the highest average annual construction rate, in the last 7 years, with a record 47,447 kms of PMGSY roads constructed during 2016-17 thereby connecting 11,641 habitations, which implies providing connectivity of an average of 32 habitations every day, the highest ever in the last 7 years. He said, during 2016-17, “Road Connectivity project in LWE Affected Areas” has been launched for construction of all-weather roads in 9 LWE states in 44 worst affected LWE districts and adjoining districts with estimated cost of Rs 11,725 crore. This would be completed by March, 2020. 

Dwelling on the issues of drinking water and sanitation, Shri Tomar said that providing safe drinking water is one of the top most priority of the government and the Government is committed to providing tap water on a sustained basis in every household by 2030 as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for which Rs 23,000 crore of central fund will be required annually till the target is achieved. The Minister said that the dream of ‘Har Ghar Jal’ cannot be realized without the involvement of the citizens. Referring to the launch of National Water Quality Sub Mission on Arsenic and Fluoride to provide safe drinking water to about 28,000 affected habitations in the country by March 2021 with an outlay of Rs 25,000 crore, he said that there will be no discrimination of funds against any state to address the twin challenges of drinking water and sanitation. He said that sanitation coverage has increased from 42 percent 2014 to 64 percent in the current year and more that 4 crore toilets were constructed. 

Shri Tomar said that under the 14th Finance Commission, Centre will be releasing more than 2 lakh crore rupees to Gram Panchayats for 5 years to undertake physical and social infrastructure projects in the villages. The Minister said that earlier about Rs 30,000 crore was allocated to the Panchayats in the 13th Finance commission, wherein Panchayats found it difficult to execute developmental projects in a holistic fashion. So far, Rs 51,234 crore were allocated to the states and 44 lakh panchayat functionaries were provided training.

                Ministry of Rural Development in partnership with the State Governments has been trying to ensure timely payment of wages to MGNREGA workers. Timely payment of wages has been a major concern. In the current financial year, 20.88 crore person days of work has been generated so far. 89.08% of wage payments have been made within 15 days of work done. Twenty two States including Puducherry received wage payment directly through National Electronic Fund Management System. The remaining States access Electronic Fund Management System in nearly all cases. The Ministry is continuously striving in partnership with States to ensure timely payment of wages to MGNREGA workers directly into their Aadhar linked Bank accounts.

Over 85% of active MGNREGA workers have their Aadhar details seeded in NREGASOFT MIS (with their consent) and 4.85 crores workers are already on the Aadhar payment bridge linked Bank accounts.

The thrust of the Ministry is on water conservation and States have adopted Mission Water Conservation Guidelines to focus on 2264 water stressed and irrigation deficient Blocks of the country. The evaluation of over 80 lakh hectare of water conservation work done under MGNREGA in 2015-17 has also been taken up through Institute of Economic Growth and the final report would be available by 30th September, 2017. The Ministry of Rural Development is making all efforts to create durable assets and provide employment on demand through a thrust on Mission Water Conservation.

Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Development through micro-industry models using local material

India is now one of the world’s fastest growing centers for S&T entrepreneurship, said the Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr. Harshvardhan.  The Minister was speaking at the Technology Awards Ceremony on the occasion of National Technology Day in New Delhi today.

 

Technology Day commemorates India’s success in using science and technology to address the challenges facing the country. On 11 May 1998 the Pokhran test was conducted. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared India a full-fledged nuclear state after operation ‘Shakti’ and it made India the 6th country to join the Nuclear Club. 

 

India is now one of the world’s fastest growing centres for S&T entrepreneurship. Start-ups and entrepreneurshipare the key to a nation’s economic growth and employment.  The Ministry of Science & Technology through its various programmes have funded and supported thousands of start-ups, incubators and developed new technologies that have reached the market. In keeping with the theme of the day on Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Development, the DST has catalyzed the development relevant rural micro-industry models.

 

Make in India: High-tech manufacturing in S&T is extraordinarily demanding. One collaborative effort is the successful operationalizing of India’s largest steerable optical telescope in Devastahl, Uttarakhand.

 

In Health Technology, the CSIR has developed Saheli the world’s first non-steroidal contraceptive pill which is affordable at 1/10 the cost of conventional pills. The indigenous clot-dissolving drug, Streptokinase saves millions of lives through an affordable alternative to cost drugs in the market. A 1-day Dengue diagnostic test developed by the Department of Biotechnology is fast and effective and has reached millions.

 

In Vaccines, in partnership with the health ministry DBT has recommended several new vaccines for the Universal Immunization Programme. Notable is the affordable indigenous Rotavirus vaccine now a part of the universal immunization programme. Vaccine development for Malaria, Dengue are undergoing trials.

 

Agriculture and Farm Technology is another mission where major success has been achieved.  The programme Biotech-KISAN (Krishi Innovation Science Application Network) has been launched in collaboration with ICAR. In each Agro-climatic zone, farmers will benefit of quality technical solutions to problem of Seed, Water, Soil and Market.  Indian Farmers now get 21 million agro-advisories that have resulted in over Rs.50,000 crores contribution to the GDP as per the NCAER report 2015

 

Arsenic resistance rice has been developed by the CSIR and is now being cultivated in West Bengal, thereby addressing a major problem.

 

Under the National Monsoon Mission, Climate and Weather forecasting have been improved. Dynamical forecast is a major advance, which allows massive data to be analyzed speedily and more reliable predictions made. Errors in cyclone forecast have been greatly reduced and deaths from cyclone have been greatly reduced

 

Wealth from Waste and Waste to Energy has been successfully done. A commercial plant to produce 3000 litres of ethanol from 10 tonnes of agricultural waste has been set up.  It is now being scaled- up by major Oil Manufacturing Companies. Applying the latest technology for treating flowing sewage, a pilot project has been installed at Barapullah drain in Delhi under the international collaboration with The Netherlands.

The Minister of Science & Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Foreign Affairs, The Netherlands, Mr. Bert Koenders and Lt. Governor of Delhi, Sh. Anil Baijal laid the foundation stone to mark the beginning of work on cleaning the Barapullah drain in New Delhi today. The dignitaries also present were Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Prof. K VijayRaghavan, DDA Vice-Chairman, Shri Arun Goel and the Netherlands Ambassador to India H.E. Alphonsus Stoelinga. 

The highlight of the ceremony was the laying of the Foundation Stone for the on-site laboratory and pilot plant and the start of the cleaning and beautification of the Barapullah Drain with unveiling of an art work. The art work represents Indo – Dutch collaboration for the LOTUS HR project in form of two flowers - ‘lotus’ and ‘tulip’, depicting the union of Indian and Dutch strengths. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government has underlined cleaning of our rivers as a major, indeed key mission. The clean Ganga project is being personally monitored by the Prime Minster himself. 

There are many available technologies to clean rivers. Their implementation must go ahead with speed. At the same time new de-centralised technologies need to be constantly developed and tested. Some new technologies could be more cost-efficient or better implementable in our context. 

With this in mind, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and NWO, the Netherlands Science Agency announced a joint call for proposals for cleaning the Barapullah drain. DBT in consultation with DDA has identified the Barapullah drain, Sarai Kale Khan, in the state of Delhi for setting up on-site experimental testing lab and for the establishment of a pilot plant. DDA has leased to DBT, a land measuring 200 Sq meters for a period of 5years adjacent to the Sun Dial Park for this purpose. 

After a rigorous and robust selection process on both sides, the project “Local Treatment of Urban Sewage Streams for Healthy Reuse (LOTUS)” has been finalised for setting up a demonstration plant for cleaning the Barapullah drain. 

The project LOcal Treatment of Urban Sewage Streams for Healthy Reuse (LOTUS HR) is an Indo-Netherlands joint project funded by Department of Biotechnology(DBT), Govt of india and NWO/STW, The Govt of Netherlands. The project has stakeholders from both Academia and Industry from India and Netherlands. It is coordinated by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi with participation of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi and National Environment Research Institute, Nagpur from India while Technical University Delft is coordinating it from The Netherlands, with participation of Environmental Engineering and Water Technology Department, UNESCO, Wageningen University and its Aquatic Ecology Department. There is also commitment from industry, especially from The Netherlands, in terms of both cash and kind towards the project. 

The project aims to demonstrate a novel holistic (waste-) water management approach, that will produce clean water that can be reused for various proposes (e.g. industry, agriculture, construction etc.), while simultaneously recovering nutrients and energy from the urban waste water, thus converting drain into profitable mines. Special attention will be paid to pathogen removal and removing conventional and emerging pollutants. 

The project will develop an innovative pilot scale plant, suitable to cope with Indian conditions in a location specific manner. The final design of the pilot plant will be scalable and modular, to fit into the highly populated urban terrain. 

The participation of end-users in the project will ensure that the demonstration site becomes a self-sustaining initiative that will not finish at the end of the project and will be taken up by the end-users. From the early start of the project, end-users (municipality, DDA, DJB, NGO’s, and companies like Shell, Hydrorock, Nijhuis, Berson, etc.) will be engaged in design at the pilot location as well as in formulation of specific research sub-questions. This will facilitate rapid adoption of the Water Resuse safety plan and the newly developed products. 

Dutch and Indian companies will contribute to the project by sharing their existing technologies, which may need adjustments for becoming functional in the pilot plant. Architects like Schulte Holding will advise on incorporating these water treatment units in urban mega cities. Engineers from DDA will help in site preparation and civil construction of the pilot plant.

All these projects will enhance connectivity of the hinterland   to JNPT. Port Connectivity is among the four pillars of Ministry of Shipping’s flagship Sagarmala programme.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said that huge investments are expected under the Sagarmala programme, which will lead to better infrastructure and creation of new jobs besides giving  a big push to Indian exports. He said a lot of companies have shown interest in acquiring land for setting up factories in the JNPT SEZ zone, and this in turn will create a demand for  skilled manpower. Shri Gadkari informed that a coordinator will be appointed to look into the requirements of these new companies and help to train the local youth from Raigad and Konkan areas to meet their specific needs. He said the government’s aim is to increase efficiency and improve the development in and around the port areas by continuously undertaking new initiatives.

 

Shri Anil Diggikar, Chairman JNPT assured that the Port Trust is fully focused on creating world-class infrastructure to enable hassle free trade and contribute to the ease of doing business. Efforts aimed at improving the infrastructure at JNPT have already started bearing results as congestion has come down to zero and tonnage handled has reached a record high of 4.5 million TEU for the year ended March 2017. Senior officials from various departments and representatives from the industry were also present during the foundation stone laying ceremony.

                The Inland Waterways Authority of India organized a road show in association with the Ministry Of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) in Guwahati last week to brainstorm on the major issues linked with developing the rivers of the North East as viable and sustainable means for cargo and passenger transportation. 

The seminar showcased the potential for cargo and passenger transportation on rivers Brahmaputra- NW- 2, Barak- NW- 16 and others. It also highlighted the enabling policies and infrastructure facilities available for safe handling and transportation of cargo on the navigable stretches where development works have commenced. 

Senior officials of the Govt. of Assam, Govt. of Meghalaya, Govt. of Tripura, Indian Army, Central Rail side Warehousing Company Ltd, Power Grid Corporation of India, Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Coal India, a delegation from Bhutan and various logistics firms and vessel operators attended the event. 

Stakeholders pointed out to the non availability of adequate draft between Sirajganj- Daikhowa & Zakiganj- Ashuganj on the Indo Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route, the need for night navigation facilities, more Ro- Ro facilities and Jetties on NW- 2 and IBP route. The need for an Inland Waterways Terminal between Dibrugarh and Bogibil, more loading - unloading facilities and warehousing facilities on IWT routes in the North East were also discussed. The need for training facilities for manpower engaged in the IWT sector was also pointed out. IWAI Chairperson Smt. Nutan Guha Biswas assured that concerted steps would be taken to enable smooth navigation on rivers in the North East and IBP route. 

Of the 106 new National Waterways that were notified in April 2016 under the National Waterways Act, 2016, 19 are in the North East. These include NW- 16 (river Barak), NW- 95 (river Subansiri), NW- 39 (river Ganol), NW- 93 (river Simsang), NW- 101 (river Tizu and Zungki), NW- 31 (Dhansiri), NW- 62 (river Lohit), NW- 106 (river Umngot), NW- 18 (river Beki), amongothers. 

River Brahmaputra connects the North East with Kolkata through the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route. The IBP route offers a seamless connectivity between NW- 1 (Allahabad – Haldia) and ports in Bangladesh via NW- 2 (Pandu, Assam). Along with river Brahmaputra, river Barak too provides inland water transit between India and Bangladesh through Pandu, Karimganj and Silghat (Assam) and Bangladesh's Narayanganj, Khulna, Mongla, Sirajganj and Ashuganj 

The Government of India is making constant endeavours to promote waterways as a more cost effective, economically viable and environment friendly mode of transport in the country. In this context, a lot of work has already been carried out to develop IWT in the North East Region. The NW- 2 stretch has been augmented with several infrastructural facilities such as a multimodal port and ship repair facility at Pandu, Ro- Ro terminal at Dhubri, Ro- Ro ferry services, night navigation facilities, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Stations and River Information Station (RIS) etc. to facilitate safe transportation of goods and passengers (tourists).

                V.O. Chidambaranar Port is all set for a four-fold increase in the capacity of two of its Coal Jetties – Jetty I and II from 6.25 MTPA to 24 MTPA. The VOCP Trust signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO) for the upgradation of Coal Jetty I and II in New Delhi today. The Minister of Shipping and Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari and Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise, Government of Tamil Nadu Shri P. Thangamani were present on the occasion. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said that the project would benefit both TANGEDCO and the VOCPT. It would make coal handling by the jetties much more voluminous and efficient, and thus bring down logistics costs. He said this would also allow for cheaper production of electricity, which would be very beneficial for industrial growth. 

With the upgradation of the coal jetties, TANGEDCO will be able to handle additional volume of coal cargo for the upcoming new power plants in Uppur and Kadaladi in Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu. In addition to this, there will be quicker turnaround of vehicles with the deployment of high tech handling equipments like two ship unloaders, each with a minimum 2000 TPH capacity and a high capacity conveyor system of 4000 TPH. This enhancement of handling capacity and upgradation of infrastructure will result in reduction of logistics costs. TANGEDCO will therefore be able to utilize the services of the Port in a more cost-effective way. With the power generation from TANGEDCO’s Tuticorin plants being linked to the National Grid, this would enable availability of additional power at reduced costs, which, in turn, can fuel industrial growth and employment generation. 

The project is the outcome of Ministry of Shipping’s Project Unnati, under which a study, ‘Unlocking National Ports Potential’ was done to improve the handling capacity of CJ-I & II. The estimated cost for upgrading CJ-I & II is about Rs.800 Cr. As per the MoU, initially Coal Jetty-I will be upgraded in about 24 months by constructing a new Coal Jetty-I of 300m x25m along with repair of the existing CJ-I. CJ –II will be upgraded thereafter. The upgradation will give a competitive edge to VOC Port and will help it maintain its lead position in coal handling. 

The MoU was signed by Shri S. Anantha Chandra Bose, Chairman, V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust and Shri (Dr.) M. Sai Kumar, Chairman cum Managing Director, TANGEDCO in New Delhi.

                MV V. V. Giri, a vessel of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) began a landmark pilot movement on April 23rd 2017 from Kolaghat in East Midnapore district of West Bengal to Bhagalpur in Bihar with a cement consignment of 240 tonnes. The vessel's journey commenced from Kolaghat on Rupnarayan river (National Waterway- 86) to reach Bhagalpur via river Ganga (NW-1). This marks the beginning of an integrated cargo movement involving two different NWs - NW-86 and NW-1. Rupnarayan river (NW-86) connects with river Ganga (NW-1) at Geokhali near Haldia. On its return trip, the vessel will bring fly ash/pet coke.

A private cement company has committed a consignment of 1.20 lakh tonnes of cement per annum from its plant at Salboni in East Midnapore district in West Bengal to various destinations on river Ganga (NW-1) in the states of Jharkhand and Bihar.

Earlier this year, an IWAI vessel MV Zakir Hussain had transported 350 tonnes of cement consignment from Haldia to Patna. The Government of India plans to make cargo movement on NW-1 (Ganga river) a regular feature.

Many prominent cement companies have also shown interest in transporting their cargo through river NW-1 which the IWAI is developing under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP), with technical and financial assistance of the World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369 crore. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 tonnes.

                A reputed US based international media house in the latest issue of its publication ‘Condé Nast Traveller’ has listed the river cruise on Ganga as one of the ‘six river cruises to take in 2017’. The media house has placed the luxury cruise vessel Ganges Voyager II which sails on the Ganga from Kolkata to Varanasi, in the league of cruises on Mekong and Yangtze in China, Amazon in South America, Volga in Russia and Irrawaddy in Myanmar. Conde Nast’s endorsement of Ganga as a cruise destination is a shot in the arm for river tourism in the country.

The Inland Waterways Authority of India facilitates cruise operations on NW-1 (river Ganga) from Kolkata to Varanasi in collaboration with private cruise operators. The facilities provided by IWAI include navigation aids including night navigation facility, embarking and disembarking at designated locations, facilitating expeditious crossing of Farakka Navigation Lock, pilotage, and assistance in distress

National Waterway NW-1 from Varanasi to Haldia is being developed by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP). In addition to becoming one of the principal cargo movement routes in India, this stretch on NW-1has good potential for river cruise tourism.

The Directorate General of Training (DGT), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has announced the launch of five high end diploma courses in the skill ecosystem for the academic year 2017. The five courses in Welding Technology, Industrial Electronics and Automation, Manufacturing Technology, Automotive Technology and IT, Networking and Cloud Computing were cleared today at the Sub-Committee meeting of NCVT .The need for advance level courses/ specialized courses has been long felt in the vocational training landscape in the country. 

The courses are of two years duration and will be introduced from August/September 2017 at Advanced Training Institutes (ATIs). These courses would enable trainees to acquire cutting edge training by providing an opportunity to sharpen their “hands-on skills” in specialized areas such as computerized pneumatic control (CNC) machining, automotive technology, welding, mechatronics, industrial electronics and automation. This would also extend the skill pyramid beyond current vocational training set up. Over and above this, one fourth of the training period is dedicated for on-the-job training in the form of an industrial attachment. 

Commenting on the development, Minister of State (I/C) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy has said, “Inclusion of five high end diploma courses in the skill ecosystem is our reaction to the great demand created by the industry, which says we do not have the workforce of what is required. Industries are demanding skilled workforce in specialized areas. With this development, Advanced Training Institutes will narrow the gap between demand and supply in the industry. These steps will take us close to our vision of making India the skill capital of the world.” 

The meeting was attended by a host of government officials from MSDE, Ministry of Textiles, and state government representatives from Haryana, Tripura, Chandigarh (UT), Bihar and Rajasthan.

                India is participating in the current phase of International Comparison Programme (ICP) with reference to 2017. It is a global statistical initiative that supports inter-country comparisons of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its components, using Purchasing Power Parity. Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MOSPI) will take up the price collection work in rural and urban areas shortly all over the country. This was stated by the Minister for Statistics & Programme Implementation Shri D.V.Sadananda Gowda while inaugurating the new office building of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Sankhyiki Bhawan in New Delhi today.

Today, with the inauguration of the new building, a new chapter begins in the history of NSSO. Now, with all Divisions under one roof, it will improve coordination of various work at a very closer level resulting speedier and better output. The Minister expressed hope that the present infrastructure will pave the way for a better working environment resulting in quality output. The better facilities will further enhance productivity and will reach new levels of professionalism and Sankhyiki Bhawan will become a new landmark in Delhi. This building has adopted modern energy efficient devices while conserving natural light and using solar power. The new building is equipped with modern facilities like video conferencing, high speed internet, centralized AC, and power backup.The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has adopted the latest Information & Communication Technology (ICT).

Established in 1950, the National Sample Survey Office conducts nation-wide large-scale sample surveys to obtain comprehensive and continuing information relating to social, economic, demographic, industrial and agricultural aspects. It has been instrumental in developing a strong database that has helped the Central as well as State Governments in developmental planning and policy formulations. The work of NSSO has won international acclaim and stimulated the creation of similar organisations in other developing countries. NSSO is known for its professionalism. Every survey is planned meticulously & field data collection mechanism is elaborate. The results brought out by NSSO are used widely both by national & international entities – in a variety of ways for planning, policy formulation, research, decision making, opinion framing & gauging the pulse of the economy. MOSPI has witnessed remarkable advancements since its inception and in recent past it has taken a number of new initiatives to modernize the data collection, processing, storage, dissemination etc. in line with digital India program.

Central Statistics Office(CSO) is also conducting the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), the principal source of industrial statistics in India every year. Nowadays, data is collected online through a web-portal directly from data source. The portal permits either the respondent establishment or the field office of NSSO to submit the data for validation and processing. This has increased the accuracy of data as the validation checks which are provided, reduces the errors considerably. Online collection of data has significantly reduced the cost and time. The web portal is being continuously refined.

CSO is planning to develop a web-based data collection system for Index of Industrial Production (IIP), a monthly index compiled to assess the growth of industrial production and release with a lag of 6 weeks. Data collection exercise has gone digital with conduct of quarterly Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) using tablets, and guided by computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) technique. The project is expected to result in huge time savings and will be performed by the surveyors of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), who will track and upload employment data, among others.

A focused survey on services sector has been incorporated in the 74th round of NSS during 2016-17. The frame for this survey comprises of the list of establishments from Sixth Economic Census (EC), available Business Registers (BR), and the list of active private non-financial companies (MCA-2013-14) with some auxiliary information. Those Enterprises which are maintaining accounts will be covered and data collection will be carried out under the provisions of the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008. The experience of this round will be examined to explore the possibility of conducting the survey of the services sector an annual feature similar to the existing Annual Survey of Industries (ASI).

The Ministry has established a wide area network dedicated to information on ‘State Domestic Product’. The objective is to collect and present data pertaining to SDP from all 29 States and 7 Union Territories of India at one platform. This portal is being used by the Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES) and M/o Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).

The Ministry has made efforts to provide NSS estimates at lower administrative level. At present, the NSS estimates are given at National and State levels due to limitation on size of Central Sample. Increase in sample size by pooling of Central and State sample data enables generation of sub-state level estimates. A Manual on Pooling of Central and State Sample Data covering all methodological aspects of Pooling Central and State sample data, prepared by NSSO, has been released for use by States. NSSO is providing technical support to State/UT DESs in the exercise of pooling of data of central and state samples.

                There have been some recent reports in certain sections of the media which have misquoted and drawn wrong conclusions from the Swachhta Status Report of the Rapid Survey of Swachhta Status which was undertaken alongwith the 72nd Round of the NSSO. The conclusions drawn in these media reports are not only factually incorrect but are also inappropriately interpreted. It is therefore necessary that the factual position and the correct interpretations are brought to the notice of all stakeholders.

The following are some clarifications for the reference of all concerned:

(1)   The Survey period for the Rapid Survey of Swachhta Status was May-June 2015, and hence all the findings of the Swachhta Status Report, including the rural sanitation coverage of 45.3% refer to the period upto June 2015 only, which means the results are nearly two years old, and only nine months into the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).

 

(2)   The Survey does not give any information on the number of toilets built by Government under SBM.

 

(3)   The Survey gives information on, (i) % of households having toilets; and (ii) the % of households having access to water for use in toilets (in households having toilets).  The results show that out of all households which have toilets, 93.9% in rural areas and 99% in urban areas have access to water in these toilets.

 

(4)   In para 4.8.10.1 of the report, the following has been stated:

 

“In rural India, 42.5% households were found to have access to water for use in toilet.”

 

In some articles, this has been interpreted to mean that out of the households that have toilets only 42.5% have access to water. Such an interpretation is incorrect.

 

It may be correctly interpreted as out of all households in rural areas, 42.5% have access to water in toilets. If one were to consider only those households that have toilets, the percentage of the households having access to water is 93.9% for rural areas and 99% for urban areas.

 

 

(5)   The report talks about drainage of household waste water, which includes domestic waste water from kitchen etc., and does not include waste water from toilets.

It is advisable that all users go through the Swachh Status Report in detail, including the Appendices, particularly on ‘Concepts and Definitions’, for a complete understanding of the findings.

1.      The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, revises the base year of the macroeconomic indicators, as a regular exercise, to capture structural changes in the economy and improve the quality and representativeness of the indices. In this direction, the base year of the all-India Index of Industrial Production (IIP) has also been revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 to not only reflect the changes in the industrial sector but to also align it with the base year of other macroeconomic indicators like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

 

2.      Revisions in the IIP are necessitated to maintain representativeness of the items and producing entities and also address issues relating to continuous flow of production data. In the past, such changes were effected at the time of a revision in the base year. With the release of the new series of IIP (base 2011-12), an institutional mechanism has been established for facilitating dynamic revision of the item list of products and the panel of factories, through a Technical Review Committee, chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Statistics & PI. This Committee will meet at least once a year for identifying new items that need to be included in the item basket and removing those that have lost its relevance in the industrial sector or are no longer being produced.

 

3.      IIP in the revised series will continue to represent the Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity sectors. The revised series uses the National Industrial Classification (NIC) 2008 for the purpose of classification of industrial production.  The unit coverage of IIP will, as before, cover entities in the organized sector units registered under the Factories Act, 1948.

 

4.      A detailed note on the changes introduced in the new series of IIP is at Annexure I. Highlights of the changes introduced are summarized below:

 

a.       The selection of items in the new series has been done at the 3 digit level of NIC for better representation as compared to selection at 2 digit level done in 2004-05 series.

 

b.      At the broad level, the new series has a total of 809 items occurring in the manufacturing sector in the item basket (405 item groups), where 149 new items like Steroids and hormonal preparations, Cement clinkers, Medical/ surgical accessories, Pre-fabricated concrete blocks, refined Palm Oil have been added and 124 items such as Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) Films, Calculators, Colour TV picture tubes, Gutka have been deleted from the 2004-05 series which had 620 items (397 item groups) in the manufacturing sector. The sectoral composition of the IIP is as follows:

c.       To reflect the increasing significance of electricity generation from renewable sources, it has been decided to include data on electricity generation figures from these sources in the new series. This inclusion is being done from April, 2014 onwards as monthly data for electricity generation from renewable sources for earlier months were not available.

 

d.      For capital goods, data in the new series will now be captured in terms of ‘work in progress‘ to better represent the growth of capital goods and to avoid reporting of production figures in bulk after the completion of production. Details on this methodology are available in the Report of the Working Group set up for the revision of base year, which may be accessed in the official website of this Ministry. 

e.       The number of source agencies reporting data for compilation of IIP in the new series will be 14 as compared to 15 in the current series. This is on account of the fact that data on ‘Iodised Salt’ in the new series will be provided by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) as O/o Salt Commissioner is not in a position to supply Salt production data after abolition of Salt Cess Act, 1953 in Finance Bill 2016.

 


	
	
		In the Mining Sector the coverage has undergone a change on account of the MCDR Amendment Rules, 2016 resulting in 27 non-metallic minerals being designated as minor minerals and which are no longer monitored by Indian Bureau of Mines.
	
	


 

5.      Based on the recommendations of the Working Group, the Use-Based Classification (UBC) has been re-framed by replacing “Basic Goods” with “Primary Goods” and introducing a new “Infrastructure/ Construction goods” category. The former change is to improve clarity on the movement of IIP of Primary Goods in industry and the latter aims to address the linkage of production with Infrastructure and Construction sector. A brief table giving the use based classification is given below:

6.      As in the 2004-05 series, the practice of using Wholesale Price Index (WPI) to deflate items for which data is reported in value terms will continue. However the number of items in the new series for which data will be captured in value terms will be 109 instead of 54 in the existing series. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) with base 2011-12 has been used for deflation.

7.      Based on the monthly production figures provided by the source agencies from April 2011 till March 2017, the monthly indices and growth rates have been worked out. The monthly indices for the new series with base 2011-12 from April 2012 through March 2017 at the sectoral level are provided at Statement I. The monthly growth rates at the sectoral level for the IIP series with base 2011-12 vis-à-vis 2004-05 are provided at Statement II. The annual growth rates at the sectoral level for the IIP series with base 2011-12 vis-à-vis 2004-05 are provided at Statement III. The annual growth rates as per the re-framed Use-Based Categories are provided at Statement IV.

 

8.      Detailed tables including indices at sectoral level, NIC 2 digit level and as per Use-Based Classification for the old and new series will be made available on the website of MoSPI at 5.30 PM on 12.05.2017.

 


	User of the new IIP series (base 2011-12), while comparing with the old series may like to consider the following aspects:


 


	
	
		The growth rates of the two series are not strictly comparable as the indices for 2011-12 have been normalized to 100 at a monthly level.
		There has been an increase in number of factories in panel for reporting data and closed ones have been removed.
		The item basket has been revised with inclusion of new items and exclusion of old ones.
		The electricity sector now includes data from renewable energy sources.
		The coverage of the mining sector has undergone a change.

ANNEXURE I

 

Changes introduced by CSO, MoSPI in the new series of Index of Industrial Production with base 2011-12

 

1.      Item Basket Selection

 

i.        Selection of items has been done at 3-digit level of NIC 2008 from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data by ensuring that the selected items cover at least 80 percent of the output of each 3 digit group. In comparison, the items in 2004-05 series were selected at 2-digit level of NIC. The selection at more disaggregated level will make the index more representative.

 

ii.      By the above method, the items selected for new series of IIP with base 2011-12 comprised of 809 items, which were clubbed in 405 item groups pertaining to Manufacturing Sector. Mining and Electricity sectors will be represented by a single item index. In comparison, the 2004-05 series basket comprised of 620 items clubbed into 397 item groups for Manufacturing Sector and one item each for Mining and Electricity sectors. The item basket for the new series is placed at Appendix I.

 

iii.    The basket of Mining Sector will now comprise of 29 minerals (Appendix II) identified by the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) as opposed to 62 minerals in the Mining basket of 2004-05 series. The decline in number of items is on account of 27 non-metallic minerals in the existing basket being declared as minor minerals in the MCDR Amendment Rules, 2016.

 

2.      Weighting diagram

 

i.        Weights at the sectoral level for the new series of IIP have been computed using the sectoral Gross Value Added (GVA) figures from National Accounts Statistics with base 2011-12.

 

ii.      The sectoral weights have been distributed at 2, 3 and 4 digit levels of National Industrial Classification (NIC), 2008 using GVA figures from ASI 2011-12.

 

iii.    The weights at 4 digit level of NIC have been distributed at product level using value of output figures from ASI 2011-12.

 

iv.    In view of heavy subsidies involved in the industry group ‘Petroleum products’, it was decided to adjust the GVA from ASI with the actual subsidies provided by the Government of India to the manufacturers to offset the losses made by them while selling products at a price lower than the actual cost of production. The weights of other industries were appropriately readjusted.

 

3.      Comparison of items and weights in the two series

 

Out of 407 item groups (including Mining and Electricity), 258 item groups are common with the existing basket, having a weight of approximately 84.6 percent (as per the new series with base 2011-12) while 124 item groups from existing basket comprising a weight of approximately 14.4 percent (as per the existing series with base 2004-05) are outdated/ obsolete and hence dropped (list of dropped items at Appendix III). The number of new items in the new series of IIP is 149 with a weight of approximately 15.4 percent.

 

4.      Classification

 

National Industrial Classification (NIC)-2008 is being adopted in the new series instead of NIC-2004. 

 

5.      Source agencies

 

The monthly production data for the compilation of new series of IIP are now being made available to the CSO by fourteen (14) source agencies viz. (1) Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), (2) Directorate of Sugar & Vegetable Oils, (3) Tea Board, (4) Coffee Board, (5) O/o the Textile Commissioner, (6) O/o the Jute Commissioner, (7) O/o the Coal Controller, (8) M/o Petroleum & Natural Gas, (9) Joint Plant Committee (Iron & Steel), (10) Railway Board, (11) D/o Industrial Policy & Promotion, (12) D/o Chemicals & Petrochemicals, (13) D/o Fertilizers and (14) Central Electricity Authority.

 

6.      Work in progress

 

In the revised IIP basket, data for 109 item groups is being collected in value terms. Many of these item groups have production span of more than one month for which data will now be reported on ‘work in progress’ so that continuous production is accounted for and will address the fluctuations in production data. The value data reported for such items need to be deflated using an appropriate price deflator. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) with base 2011-12 has been used for deflating value based items in the new series of IIP.

 
 

7.      Frame of factories

 

i.        The frame of factories was drawn from the results of 4 years of ASI to make it more representative and robust and was also duly augmented with frames maintained by source agencies of IIP, as and where applicable.

 

ii.      The frame of factories for D/o Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) which is the most important source in terms of number of items as well as weights underwent a significant expansion in terms of coverage and robustness. The number of factories under DIPP’s purview in the new series will increase by about 1400 in the current series. The number of factories reporting data for each item (except 13 items) will be at least 4 thereby reducing chances of exhibiting abnormal volatility during currency of the series after its launch. The 13 items for which number of factories are less than 4 have been retained in consultation with DIPP in view of their emerging nature and contribution at the industry level.

 

8.      Use-Based Classification

 

The Use-Based Classification has been re-framed to ensure better representativeness. There are two new categories introduced in the new series namely “Primary goods” and “Infrastructure/ Construction goods”. At the same time the category “Basic goods” has been removed. The re-framed Use-based classifications (UBCs) to be adopted in the new series are as follows:

                                i.            Primary goods- consisting of Mining, Electricity, Fuels and Fertilizers. This category will replace the existing category ‘Basic goods’;

                              ii.            Capital goods- e.g. Machinery items;

                            iii.            Intermediate goods- e.g. yarns, chemicals, semi-finished steel items, etc.;

                            iv.            Infrastructure/ Construction goods - e.g. paints, cement, cables, bricks and tiles, rail materials, etc. This category has been constituted to categorize items which were neither part of Consumer durables nor Intermediate goods. This categorization assumes significance in wake of growing importance of infrastructure sector;

                              v.            Consumer durables- e.g. garments, telephones, passenger vehicles, etc.; and

                            vi.            Consumer nondurables- e.g. food items, medicines, toiletries, etc.

Several changes have been made in the new series of the IIP in order that new IIP is able to reflect the changes in the industrial sector in a more representative and robust manner.

The salient features of the new series with base 2011-12 are as under:

·                     IIP in the new series will continue to consist of three sectors viz. Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity, as in the existing series.

·                      The National Industrial Classification 2008 will be followed in the new series for the purpose of classification of products as per industries.

·                      The Use-Based Classification has been revised to reflect the industrial segments and production more accurately as well as to map the products more accurately as per their use in the industries. The new use based classification includes Primary Goods, Intermediate Goods, Infrastruture/Construction Goods, Capital Goods, Consumer Durable Goods and Consumer Non Durable Goods

·                     The coverage of the new series of IIP is limited to the Organized Sector only.

·                     For enabling dynamic revision of the methodology of IIP including the item list and the panel of factories during the currency of a base year, a Technical Review Committee, chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Statistics &PI, will be constituted.

·                     Due to the increasing significance of the electricity generation from renewable sources, it has been decided to include the same in the electricity generation figures for compilation of IIP in the new series.

·                     The new series show higher growth rates in most months in the period April 2012 to March 2017, as compared to the existing series which is attributable to (i) shifting of base to a more recent period; (ii) increase in number of factories in panel for reporting data and exclusion of closed ones and (iii) inclusion of new items and exclusion of old ones.

The Union Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh addressed a press conference on achievements of the Steel Ministry during 3 Years of NDA Government in New Delhi today. He said that the Indian steel industry is at the cusp of another significant milestone by becoming the second largest stainless steel producer in the world, leaving behind Japan. 

 

Chaudhary Birender Singh said that the steel sector is only an example of all-round development in India under PM Modi ji’s leadership. On 3rd May this year the Cabinet under Prime Minister Modi approved two policies of the steel ministry and we are working on their implementation. We are very confident that steel sector will become more vibrant and dynamic after the ‘National Steel Policy 2017’ and ‘Policy for preference to domestically manufactured iron & steel products in government procurement’ becomes effective. The roadmap to implement the new policies will be finalized in the next six months to one year. 

 

He described the last three years journey of steel industry as:

नज़र को बदलो, तो नज़ारे बदल जाते हैं,

सोच को बदलो, तो सितारे बदल जाते हैं,

कश्तियाँ बदलने की ज़रुरत नहीं,

दिशा को बदलो, तो किनारे बदल जाते हैं |

Speaking of the SPU REVIVAL, he said that the three Steel Processing Units, Jagdishpur in UP, Bettiah in Bihar and Kangra in Himachal Pradesh are going to be operationalized within the next one year. This involves an investment of Rs. 500 crores. These units will produce value-added products like crash barriers, black pipes, TMT bars or GC sheets. Special Purpose Vehicle Route has been adopted by the Government of India for creation of Greenfield steel capacity in May 2015. The Process for the same was initiated in four states of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Karnataka.

 

Talking of Zero Waste Production, the Steel Minister said that a 120 MW power plant was inaugurated in April 2017 at RINL Vishakhapatnam using the waste gases of the steel plant. The Huge Fine dumps, waste slag, slime etc. from steel plants need to be utilized by using innovative techniques for Pelletisation of fines, slag-cement for slag towards a Clean & Green Steel Sector in India. The Ministry of Steel & UNDP have worked for energy conservation in 300 secondary steel units. Plans are to upscale to 1000 secondary steel units. This would reduce CO2 emissions, roughly equal to taking all passenger cars off Delhi’s roads, Chaudhary Singh added.

 

Shri Birender Singh said that Steel industry needs to go for a paradigm shift and move from semi-finished/crude steel to value-added steel. This will lead to better margins and improve competitiveness. “We are hopeful that SAIL & Arcelor Mittal would soon formalize the Joint Venture for production of automotive-grade steel. This will be a big step-forward under the Prime Minister’s Make in India Programme” Shri Singh added.

 

Enlisting new Schemes for Secondary Steel Producers in 2017-18, he said that the steel ministry will rate the ranking of Top-50 Secondary Steel/Smart Producers and awards will for best performing plants in secondary steel sector solely on the criterion of their products of BIS standards and cost effectiveness.

 

The Minister also announced the institution of Best Steel Structures Awards for best steel structures in PMAY (Rural and Urban), building projects, and roads made with steel reinforced cement concrete and other extraordinary structures using steel in abundance.

 

Chaudhary Birender Singh said that the GST regime is good for Steel Team as Goods & Services Tax Rates and Slabs for raw materials like iron ore, manganese, coal etc. is in the bracket of 5 %. Semi-finished and unfinished goods is in 18 % bracket. Steel industry will see a reduction in the input cost for steel making with the GST implementation.

 

The Minister of State in the Ministry of Steel Shri Vishnu Deo Sai, Dr. Aruna Sharma, Secretary Steel, and Senior Officials from the Ministry & the Steel PSUs were present on the occasion.

 

Pursuing a clear agenda of growth, the Ministry of Steel has had many firsts to its credit. In the year 2015, India became the third largest producer of steel in the world. Recent data shows that India is now looking at positioning itself as the second largest in the very near future.

 

In the last three years, there has been capacity addition at a steady CAGR of about 7%. There has also been an improvement in the overall capacity utilization. 

 

India has emerged as a net exporter of steel in the year 2016-17, with 97% increase in overall exports and a 37% decline in imports of steel products over the same period in the previous year.

 

 



 

 

First time in the history of Steel making in India, the world witnessed a massive demand –supply gap post 2014. Overcapacity of 700 to 800 MTPA resulted in sudden fall in the global steel prices.

 

 



 

 

Aftermath of the increased imports was evident from the declining domestic steel prices, poor cash flows and the debt serviceability of the major steel producers in the country.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian Government protected the interests of domestic producers by notifying trade remedial measures like Minimum Import Price, Anti-Dumping Duty and Safeguard Duty.

 

The government also eased out financial re-structuring norms through RBI and Ministry of Finance.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition to these, many steps have also been taken to reduce input cost, replace imports & enhance domestic consumption. The government is also working to improve the domestic availability of iron ore, coking coal and natural gas. 

The government’s focus on strengthening the steel sector inter-alia has been on ensuring 

·         Ease of doing business

·         Developing New Products

·         Tackling over Capacity & Imports

·         Sustainable production of Steel

·         Ensuring affordable Raw Material Supply

·         Sustainable production of Steel

·         And demand generation

 

 



 

 

 

 

The Government has populated the three-year timeline with numerous initiatives that comprise steps like increase in Basic Custom Duty, notification of Quality Control Order for steel and steel products, policy on DMISP, National Steel Policy etc.    

 


	
		
			 
		
		
			 
			
		
	

 

 

 

 

The most significant and far-reaching of all policy interventions is the rolling out of the National Steel Policy 2017. The policy will be the road map for the industry in the coming years and will help in harnessing the sector’s untapped potential. 

The policy reflects the aspirations of domestic steel industry for achieving 300MT of steelmaking capacity by 2030-31. This translates into additional investment of about Rs. 10 lakh Crore and 1.1 Million additional workforce getting employed in the steel sector.

 

Key features of NSP 2017 include:

·         creating self-sufficiency in steel production 

·         encouraging adequate capacity additions, 

·         developing globally competitive steel manufacturing capabilities, 

·         cost-efficient production and domestic availability of iron ore, coking coal & natural gas,

·         facilitating foreign investment & asset acquisitions of raw materials 

·         and enhancing the domestic steel demand.

 

As part of the NSP, emphasis is also being laid at considering the total life cycle cost while evaluating projects rather than looking at just the upfront cost in isolation. This would encourage greater usage of steel in Government as well as private sector.

 


Another strategic push for the steel industry has been the policy to provide preference to Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products (DMI&SP) in government procurements. This will not just provide a level playing field to the domestic steel industry but will also promote development of domestic steel Industry. Besides, it will also reduce the inclination to use, low quality and low cost imported steel in Government funded projects.

 

While India roars on the world stage through its Make in India campaign, It plans to increase steel capacity to 300 million tonnes and per capita steel consumption to a level of 158 Kgs by 2030-31. The Ministry of Steel is steadfast at making sure that doing business in the steel sector in India is easier, more profitable, eco-friendly and sustainable while it makes a mark on the global scene.

                As per the UNWTO definition, International Tourist Arrivals (ITAs) comprises two components namely Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) and Arrivals of Non-Resident Nationals. The UNWTO in its barometer ranks countries in terms of their ITAs. So far only the figures of FTAs were compiled in India. However, now India has started compiling the data arrivals of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), also.

The number of NRI arrivals during 2014 and 2015 were 5.43 million and 5.26 million, respectively. Accordingly, the numbers of ITAs in India during 2014 and 2015 were 13.11 million and 13.28 million, respectively. The data of ITAs, containing both the arrivals of NRIs and FTAs, is now as per International recommendations.

Due to this inclusion, India’s improved rank reflecting the true and comparable scenario has now been acknowledged by the UNWTO. As per the latest UNWTO Barometer for March 2017, Rank of India in International Tourist Arrivals in both 2014 and 2015 is 24 as against the previous rank of 41 and 40 in the year 2014 and 2015, respectively. With this inclusion the share of India in the ITAs has also increased from 0.68% (based on FTAs) to 1.12% in the year 2015.

Earlier India’s rank in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), 2017 had also shown a 12 places jump from 2015. Rank of India in TTCI Report of 2017 was 40th as compared to 52nd in 2015, 65th in 2013 and 68th in 2011.

While UNWTO gives ranking in terms of numbers of ITAs, TTCI is composed of 14 pillars organized into four sub-indices of ‘Enabling Environment’, ‘Travel & Trade Policy and Enabling Conditions’, ‘Infrastructure’ and ‘Natural and Cultural Resources.

                National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has expressed its displeasure over the slow progress on the issue of displacement of tribals due to Roukela Steel Plant. In its meeting held in New Delhi today the commission directed Principal revenue Secretary Odisha, district collector of Sundergarh and senior officials of Rourkela Steel Plant that they should report back to the commission within a month about the action taken by them on its directives. The commission said, if it is not satisfied with the action taken report than it will summon the Chief Secretary and CEO of Rourkela Steel Plant. 

The commission also directed the Union Steel Ministry to constitute a high level committee under a Joint Secretary to investigate that whether the land acquired for the steel plant was handed over to any cooperative society or private organisation and if so, whether the prior permission of the Govt was obtained or not. The committee should also investigate that how much land is being utilised by the steel plant. 

The commission directed the District collector of Sundergarh to submit a report about the status of land returned by the steel plant to the tribal. NCST also expressed its displeasure over the non issue of Pattas for the agricultural and residential land issued to the displaced tribals and directed the District administration to issue these Pattas immediately. 

The NCST directed Steel Plant officials that remaining people out of the 1098 persons identified in 1993 should be immediately provided employment in Steel plant. The Plant authorities should also certify that only genuine displaced tribals were provided employment. The commission also directed the steel plant authorities to ensure supply of basic facilities such as electricity and water in the colony set up for displaced tribals.

Ministry of Urban Development will launch measuring of Liveability Index of cities next month based on indigenously evolved Index. This was announced by Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary (Urban Development) here today while addressing a World Bank organized knowledge sharing workshop on improving accountability for local governments. 

To start with, Liveability Standards of 140 cities including 53 cities with population of one million and above and Smart Cities will be assessed. The Ministry has already invited bids for selecting the agency for carrying out the assessment based on the parameters evolved by the Ministry. The Ministry of Urban Development has come out with a detailed document on “Methodology for Collection and Computation of Liveability Standards in Cities” for the benefit of States and Cities. 

Cities will be assessed on 15 core parameters relating to Governance, social infrastructure pertaining to education, health and safety and security, economic aspects and physical infrastructure like housing, open spaces, land use, energy and water availability, solid waste management, pollution etc. Cities will be ranked based on Liveability Index that would cover a total of 79 aspects. 

Shri Rajiv Gauba said that a sense of healthy competition is being promoted among cities and towns in the country to focus their attention on improving governance and infrastructure availability. He further said that more than providing funds to State and City Governments, Ministry of Urban Development is according priority for incentivizing implementation of reforms that have a far reaching impact on governance and service delivery. 

Stressing on the need for decentralization and empowering of city governments, Shri Gauba stressed that “Cities can’t be run and managed from state capitals and secretariats. They should be made to stand on their own for improving performance, responsibility and accountability”. 

Government officials and experts from India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are participating in the workshop for sharing respective experiences on decentralization and empowerment of local bodies.

                Dhansa Bus Stand in the National Capital will be connected by Delhi Metro in the next three years. Government of India  has approved the 1.18 km Under Ground metro extension from Najafgarh to Dhansa Bus Stand at a cost of Rs.565 cr. This extension is scheduled for completion by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation by 2020.


Of the total cost of the project,central government will bear Rs.107 cr in the form of 50% Equity (Rs.75.50 cr) and Subordinate Debt. Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will provide Rs.323 cr while the rest will be borne by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi including Equity (Rs.75.50 cr) and Subordinate Debt.


Najafgarh –Dhansa Bus Stand Metro Extension is estimated to serve the travel needs of an additional 10,000 passengers per day catering to the needs of people of Nangloi, Dhansa, Bahadurgarh and the adjoining areas.


As per 2016 estimates, 3.61 lakh vehicle trips are generated at Najafgarh. Since the area between Najafgarh and Dhansa is densely populated with substantial built up areas, extension to Dhansa Bus Stand has been made Under Ground.


The 4.50 km Dwarka – Najafgarh Metro Section, approved in September, 2012 is likely to be completed by December this year.

                Indore has emerged as the India’s Cleanest City in the Swachh Survekshan-2017 conducted in 434 cities and towns, the results of which were announced here today by the Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venakaiah Naidu.

                Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Surat, Mysuru, Tiruchirapally, New Delhi Municipal Council, Navi Mumbai, Vadodara and Chandigarh are among the Top 10 clean cities in that order.

                Announcing the Survey Results, Shri Naidu described Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh followed by Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as the Movers and Shakers for having significantly improved their rankings from that of the Survey conducted in 2014 before the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission in October, 2014. Swachh Survekshan conducted in 2016 covered 73 cities with over million population each besides capital cities.

                The Minister further informed that in Swachh Surekshan-2017,  all the cities surveyed in Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand have substantially improved their rankings over that of 2016 and 2014. Gujarat did so in respect of all cities excepting Rajkot and similar being the case in respect of Chattisgarh except Bilaspur. In Telangana, only two cities have dropped in rankings this year while it happened in respect of four cities in Andhra Pradesh.

                Shri Naidu stated that a total of 14 States were represented in the Top 50 clean cities with Gujarat accounting for 12, followed Madhya Pradesh-11, Andhra Pradesh-8 and one each from Chandigarh, Chattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh.

                25 towns from Uttar Pradesh are ranked among the bottom 50 cities with followed by Rajasthan and Punjab with five each, two in Maharashtra and one each from Haryana, Karnataka and Lashadweep.

                Varanasi has however, improved its rank from 418 in 2014 to 32 this year to become the Fastest Big City Mover in the North Zone.

                The Minister said that UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Punjab and Kerala need to substantially step up efforts to improve sanitation standards in urban areas.

                Faridabad in Haryana has improved its rank from 379 in 2014 to 88 this year and has been awarded for being the ‘Fastest Mover’ among cities with a population of above one million each.

                Shri Venkaiah Naidu stressed that this year’s survey results are “Citizens’ Verdict” on cleanliness in urban areas of the country with 37 lakh citizens’ enthusiastically providing feedback on cleanliness in 434 cities and towns accounting for about 60% of the total urban population in the country. He stated that such survey will be commissioned in all the 4,041 statutory towns and cities.

                Shri Naidu further referred to India improving its position by 12 places in the global Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and feedback from media persons as further confirmation of improving sanitation in urban areas.

                Referring to Mysuru in Karnataka which topped the ranks in 2016 and 2014 and ranked five in this year’s survey, Shri Naidu asserted that in no way it meant that cleanliness has declined in the city or the city government scaled down its efforts. He explained that Mysuru scored over 87% out of the total score of 2,000 in both 2017 and 2016 indicating that sanitation level has not come down this year while other cities have scored over Mysuru. “This spirit of competition is sought to be promoted through such surveys to help cities know where they stand in absolute terms and in relation to other cities as well” said the Minister.  

                38 cities were awarded including the Top five clean cities at the national level, cleanest cities and fastest movers  in different zones in 5-10 lakh and 2-5 lakh population categories.

                Swachh Survekshan-2017 aimed at capturing the outcomes on ground of the ongoing efforts to make urban areas Open Defecation Free and to improve door-to-door collection, processing and disposal of Municipal Solid Waste. Of the total score of 2,000, 900 marks were assigned for performance in respect of ODF and solid waste management, 600 marks for Citizen Feedbak and 500 marks for Independent Observation.

                Quality Council of India that conducted the survey during January-February this year deployed 421 assessors for on the site inspection of cleanliness in 434 cities and towns and another 55 for real time monitoring of progress of survey and field inspections. Field inspectors used geo-tagged devices for collecting evidence in real time of their inspection at 17,500 locations.

While Bagaha and Bahraich have improved their rankings from 2014, Shajahanpur remained stay put while the other 7 have slipped from 2014.

Composition of top and bottom 50 rankings:

-Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh account for 31 of the top 50 clean cities with 12 in Gujarat, 11 in MP and 8 in AP. Telangana and Tamil Nadu account for 4 cities each in top 50, followed by Maharashtra with 3.

Chandigarh, Chattisgarh, Delhi, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Sikkim and UP account for one city each in top 50 clean cities of the country.

While 14 States/UTs find a place among the top 50 clean cities, competition is not so much for a place in bottom 50, with UP alone accounting for 25 of the bottom 50 towns.

Rajasthan and Punjab have 5 towns each in the bottom 50, followed by Maharashtra-2 and one each from Haryana, Karnataka and Lakshadweep.

Out of the 62 cities and towns surveyed in UP in 2017, 41 of them figure among the bottom 100 cities/towns.

Surprises of 2017 Sanitation Survey:

Jharkhand and Chattisgarh have emerged as the major success stories  in Swachh Survekshan -2017.

While all the 9 cities/towns of Jharkhand surveyed in 2017 have substantially improved their rankings over that of 2016 and 2014, 7 of 8 in Chattisgarh have achieved this feat.

The largest ever Sample Survey of over 18 lakh citizens has revealed that sanitation in cities and towns of the country has  substantially improved during the last one year, confirming that the ‘Swachh Bharat’ buzz is making a difference on ground with people clearly perceiving a change for the better.

Results of the ‘Swachh Survekshan-2017’ have confirmed that the efforts being made under Swachh Bharat Mission have made a positive impact on cleanliness situation in urban areas.

Revealed major improvement in cleanliness in last one year. Swachh Bharat buzz is reflecting on ground. Swachh Rankings of 434 cities and towns will be announced on Thursday this week. More than rankings, citizens’ perception and field reports are more exciting.”

A total of over 37 lakh citizens responded with their feedback under the two month long Survey. After  a careful verification of the responses and deletion of multiple responses, Quality Council of India that conducted the Survey have taken in to consideration over 18 lakh responses. The findings of the Swachh Survekshan-2017 are:

She announced that fish ladders, which aid fish in their migration upstream to spawn, would be installed in the Farakka Barrage. Issues such as silt management, tourism potential of the area that could generate employment and ensuring adequate water flow to promote inland waterways in the State were also discussed in the meeting.

The Union Water Resources Minister, who is on 2500 km. Ganga Nirikshan Abhiyan has concluded the first leg of her Abhiyan in West Bengal. During her tour in the State the Minister took part in Ganga Arti at Vaishnav ghat in Kolkata where she urged the gathering to participate selflessly in Ganga cleaning as people’s participation is indispensable in the task. 

On the second day of the Abhiyan, the Minister inspected Ghat cleaning works in Kakdweep at Ganga Sagar. She also interacted with local government officials, local dwellers and other stakeholders during the inspection. Ganga Chaupals were organised at two locations on 27th May - Ganga Sagar and Diamond Harbour. On both the occasions the Minister interacted with local communities and heard their concerns. She assured people that adequate arrangements for toilets will be made at Ganga Sagar.  

Sushri Bharti addressed people and officials at Kon Nagar in Hoogly during the Ganga Chaupal. Apart from informing the people about various ongoing and planned schemes and projects under Namami Gange programme, she requested them to contribute in keeping Ganga clean by refraining from polluting it. A similar interactive programme was organised in Nabdweep in Ganga Sagar.

 The Minister will start the second leg of the Abhiyan from Sultanganj, Bhagalpur tomorrow.

              The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on May 25, 2017 was 35.053 BCM, which is 22% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 23 for the week ending on May 18, 2017. The level of May 25, 2017 was 127% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 104% of storage of average of last ten years.  

              The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 157.799 BCM which is about 62% of the total storage capacity of 253.388 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

 

REGION WISE STORAGE STATUS:-

 

NORTHERN REGION:-

The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are six reservoirs under Central Water Commission (CWC) monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.01 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 4.36 BCM which is 24% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 22% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 28% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year but is less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

EASTERN REGION:-

The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura. There are 15 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.83 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 5.66 BCM which is 30% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 23% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 19% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

WESTERN REGION:-

The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 27 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 27.07 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 6.87 BCM which is 25% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 14% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 25% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is equal to the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

CENTRAL REGION:-

The Central region includes States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 12 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 42.30 BCM. As per Reservoir Storage Bulletin dated 25.05.2017, the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 14.25 BCM which is 34% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 23% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 18% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

SOUTHERN REGION:-

The Southern region includes States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states) Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 31 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 51.59 BCM.

The storage during corresponding period of last year was 11% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 170/o of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year and is also less than
the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

 

States having better storage than last year for corresponding period are Punjab, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana. States having equal storage than last year for corresponding period are AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states). States having lesser storage than last year for corresponding period are Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.

Chitale committee on Desiltation  of Ganga has recommended a slew of measures which include study of reach wise sediment transport processes along with establishing annual sediment budgets to guide de-silting activities, Preparation of annual reports (Sand registry) describing the previous de-silting/ dredging activity and a technical institute may be entrusted to conduct the sediment budget, morphological and flood routing studies that would examine and confirm the necessity of the de-silting of the reach under consideration.

 

The committee was constituted in July 2016 by the Ministry of Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation to prepare guidelines for desiltation of river Ganga from Bhimgauda (Uttarakhand) to Farakka (West Bengal). Shri Madhav Chitale (Expert Member, NGRBA) was appointed as Chairman of the committee. The other members of the committee were: Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change and Dr. Mukesh Sinha, Director, Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune. The committee was asked to establish difference between desilting and sand mining and also to establish need for desilting for ecology and e-flow of the river Ganga. 

 

The committee in its report says erosion, sediment transport and siltation are very complex phenomena. It is impossible to apply a “one-size-fits-all‟ approach to sediment management and control, because the issues involved are frequently very regionally-specific. Local factors such as topography, river control structures, soil and water conservation measures, tree cover, and riparian land-use or land disturbance (for example agriculture, mining, etc.) can have a large impact on sediment loads in rivers. River control structures (such as reservoirs), soil conservation measures and sediment control programmes can cause downstream sediment loads to decrease, while factors such as land disturbance (clearing of vegetation, for example) or agricultural practices can cause increased sediment loads. At the same time, indiscriminate de-siltation works may result into more harm to ecology and environment flow. Thus, there is a need to evolve Guidelines, better broad principles, which should be kept in mind while planning and implementing de-silting works.

 

According to the report erosion, sediment transport and siltation in large rivers like Ganga are very complex phenomena and their estimation has inherent limitations and uncertainties. A reconnaissance of Main River Ganga on Google earth map reveal that different reaches are in a dynamic equilibrium phase. Sedimentation is mainly seen downstream of Bhimgauda barrage and near the confluences of tributary rivers with Ganga. The discharge congestion, large scale sediment deposition and its negative effects are mainly seen downstream of the confluence of Ghagra and beyond. The river flood plain drastically widens beyond the confluence of Ghagra and is estimated to be around 12 to 15 kms.

 

The committee says though de-siltation works can improve hydraulic performance of the river and this itself can justify undertaking de-siltation, these have no direct role in improving environment flow in the river. On the other hand, indiscriminate de-silting or sand mining would cause adverse impacts on river e-flow. Recognizing the importance of sediment transport in rivers, following basic principles of siltation in rivers should be kept in mind while considering de-siltation works:

 

·         Catchment Area Treatment and Watershed Development works, along with good agricultural practices and river bank protection/anti-erosion works, are necessary to reduce silt inflow into the river system and must be undertaken in a comprehensive way.

 

·         Erosion, movement and deposition of sediment are natural regulating functions of river and Sediment equilibrium of river should be maintained.

 

·         Rivers should be provided with sufficient flood plains (lateral connectivity) without any hindrance to the flow.

 

·         Instead of “keeping the silt away”, strategy to “giving the silt way” should be adopted.

 

In specific reference to de-siltation works in river Ganga, in addition to MoEF&CC Sand Mining Guidelines, which are statutory in nature, and the GSI Guidelines, the committee has suggested following Guidelines;

 

1.      River Ganga tends to achieve equilibrium on its own given the hydrology, sediment and natural bed and bank disposition. It is necessary to provide the river sufficient areas of flood plain and lakes along the river to moderate the flood level. Any encroachment of flood plain, reclamation of lakes or disconnection of lakes from river should be avoided; rather adjoining lakes/depressions may be de-silted to increase their storage capacities. The de-silting of lakes, etc., should be in such a manner that the sediment continuity is maintained and should not lead to head cut that creates safety issues for the river crossings, water intakes or river training works locally, downstream or upstream.

 

2.      Upstream reaches of natural constriction works, like barrages/bridges, etc., tend to get silted leading to wandering of river. Possibly river training, cut-off developments and provision of extra water way near the constrictions could be tried after proper assessment without impacting the morphology of river elsewhere. The area freed from the development in the form of oxbow lakes should be used for flood moderation rather than reclaiming it for other purposes.

 

3.      In case where constriction is causing large scale siltation, de-siltation along the preselected channel to deepen and attract the flow could be tried to guide the main course of flow. The dredged material may be dumped along the alternate channel which was to be closed to avoid bank erosion. Care shall be taken to develop stable channel which do not affect the flow either on upstream or downstream. Efforts should be made to provide silt continuity along the weirs and barrages.

 

4.      Embankments, spurs and river training measures provided to protect the banks should not encroach upon the flood plains and delink the lakes, flood plains and other riverine environment from the river.

 

5.      The proposed de-silting of any river reach need to be justified bringing out clearly the flooding caused due to siltation along with technical comparisons of the alternative flood mitigation measures with “do nothing” or “proposed de-silting/ dredging” being other options. It should invariably be associated with sediment flux studies and morphological studies to confirm no significant adverse effect on downstream or upstream reach of the river including the safety and effectiveness of river crossings, water intakes, existing river bank / flood protection measures etc.

 

6.      De-silting of the confluence points, especially with huge silt carrying tributaries, such as Ghagra, Sone, etc., may be necessary to make confluence hydraulically efficient.

 

7.      Reservoirs in main river Ganga and its tributaries, particularly in upper reaches, should be operated in such a manner that first floods, having high silt load, are allowed to pass through without storage and river flows in later phases of the monsoon are only stored for use during non-monsoon season. This would require quantitative long term forecast with decision support system to be established for optimum reservoir operations.

 

8.      Agricultural practices along the river flood plains should be such that it does not disturb the passage of flood by increasing the resistance to flow causing aggradations.

 

9.      River morphological studies should be carried out to initiate in-stream channel improvement works. It shall be ensured that the head cut induced upstream should automatically de-silt the reach. The headcut induced should progress upstream slowly so that the flora and fauna will have sufficient time to re-adjust its habitat.

 

10.  The proposal should also contain environmentally acceptable and practically feasible silt disposal plan. River gravels/sands/silts could be used gainfully in construction works, including housing, roads, embankment and reclamation works. Under no circumstances, disposal should create any contamination of the water bodies, harmful to the flora and fauna existing adjacent to the disposal sites. It should also be ensured that disposed material should not come back into the river again.

 

11.  In view of specific issues being raised about siltation in front of the Farakka Barrage, it is suggested that the shoals formed may be de-silted/dredged by taking care of the river training works around it. The sediment removed may be used for re-grading the Farakka Feeder Canal or may be used for strengthening the existing embankments around the barrage pond. Sediment sluicing may be incorporated to maintain sediment continuity from upstream to downstream reaches after carrying out necessary studies. The de-silting / dredging works of the barrage pond shall not cause any structural problem to the barrage by excessive erosion on the downstream. In view of this the dredging shall be restricted only up to original bed level or higher.

 

12.  Feasibility of introducing an arrangement need to be studied to pass the incoming sediment safely to downstream of the dams/ barrage structures to maintain the sediment equilibrium. It shall also be ensured that the concentrated sediment flux passed downstream will not create any major morphological changes on the downstream reaches.

 

13.  Any bridges across River Ganga which are causing large afflux (more than 1% of normal depth) should be modified to reduce the afflux, which in turn will also reduce the sediment deposition and erosion of banks on the upstream.

 

14.  The dredging/de-siltation/mining activities may result into some adverse impacts, i.e., (a) River bed degradation; (b) Bank erosion; (c) Channel widening; (d) lowering of water surface elevations in the river channel; (e) lowering of water table elevations adjacent to the river; (f) a reduction in the structural integrity of bridges, pipelines, jetties, barrages, weirs, foundations supporting high tension lines, existing bank protection works and other manmade structures; and (g) a loss of environmental values resulting from (a) through (e). Restrictions as presented in Appendix IV of this Report need to be enforced before planning and executing any dredging/ de-silting / mining activities. These restrictions may be modified only after proper study and monitoring the effects of dredging / de-silting / mining.

 

15.  The Ganga Flood Control Commission, a sub-ordinate office of Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and secretariat and executive wing of Ganga Flood Control Board, headed by Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation with the Chief Ministers of Ganga river basin States and Member, NITI Ayog (erstwhile Planning Commission) may be entrusted with additional mandate to carry out necessary studies with regard to sediment management in river Ganga and incorporate sediment management strategies in their comprehensive plans prepared for all sub-basins of river Ganga. These integrated plans could serve as base documents for Central, State and District Level Authorities for considering proposals for environment clearances for works related to river Ganga.

                A section of the media has incorrectly reported that Central Water Commission (CWC), External Assistance Directorate has rejected Gujarat Government request for funds for Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation Yojana (SAUNI) on technical grounds, questioning the feasibility of the project. 

 

It is clarified that the report is incorrect.  The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has conveyed its 'in-principle' approval of SAUNI-II Project to the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India in October, 2016. 

 

The facts are as follows: 

 

As a standing procedure, all major and medium irrigation projects are required to undergo technical evaluation by CWC and that States should submit a compliance report on the observations of CWC. This is a continuous, consultative process, which is taken both at the Preliminary Project Report (PPR) and Detailed Project Report (DPR) stages. 

 

In the case of SAUNI-II Project, CWC had made certain observations on the Preliminary Project Report submitted by Gujarat Government. The State Government has since submitted a detailed compliance report and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has recommended SAUNI-II Project to the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, for obtaining external assistance.

                The National Commission for Women (NCW) organized a one day Consultation in New Delhi today with various stake holders to achieve a consensus regarding the procedure to be adopted while dealing with cases related to NRI Matrimonial Disputes. NCW Chairperson, Smt. Lalitha Kumarmangalam along with other  Members of the Commission, Smt. Rekha Sharma, Ms. Sushma Sahu, Sh. Alok Rawat chaired the different sessions of discussion highlighting the various issues involved in the NRI matrimonial disputes and the possible assistance that can be more effectively provided through available civil and criminal remedies under Indian legal system and schemes or guidelines available covered in the draft SoPs.

The Consultation was attended by representatives from Judicial Services, MWCD, MEA, MHA, MoLJ, State Women Commissions, State Police Authorities, NCPCR, Legal Experts in the field.

National Commission for Women (NCW) is mandated under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990 to, inter-alia, monitor the proper implementation of all the legislations made to protect the rights of women so as to enable them to achieve equality in all spheres of life and equal participation in the development of the nation. 

NCW has also been nominated as the Coordinating agency at the National level for dealing with issues pertaining NRI marriages by Ministry of External Affairs. The NRI Cell of the Commission has been working ceaselessly to raise awareness on the issues faced by women deserted in after Matrimonial Disputes in NRI Marriages. 

Women who have been deserted by their NRI husbands have a long and arduous struggle ahead of them which is further exacerbated by lack of knowledge regarding the various avenues of relief available to them. 

Recognizing the severity of the problems faced by women deserted in NRI marriages, the Ministry of Women and Child Development instituted an inter-ministerial Committee to examine the issue. The inter-ministerial Committee has drafted a Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and sought the opinion of the Commission regarding the same.

Many relevant suggestions emerged from today’s Consultation such as:-

1. Utilization of more tech savvy means for service of summons or warrants such as service vide emails and taking statements through video conferencing

2.Utilizing the employer address for service of judicial documents/summons etc. as employment is more stable in comparison to place of residence.

3.Request for Impounding of passport can be made to the concerned RPO even at the stage when challan is not filed in the court and the investigation is pending

4.Compulsory registration of marriage need to be mandated under State Law as well as incorporating other necessary details like passport no., Social Security no, employment status etc. As reported Gujarat State and Punjab State have already implemented this.

5.SoPs need to incorporate relevant legal avenues available for recognizing Indian court decrees abroad and vice versa Foreign court decrees in India.

6.MEA, under its Scheme for providing legal and financial assistance overseas, should also consider the situations where the deserted woman is in India, and NRI husband has filed for divorce or custody case overseas.

              

These suggestions will be incorporated in the Commission’s Report to the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a reader titled “Raising Happy Children and Providing Safe Childhoods”.  It provides advisory guidelines to parents, teachers and community to protect children from being involved in delinquent behavior through early detection, counselling and positive engagement. It draws upon basic principles laid down in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 which provides a strong formal framework for dealing with children in conflict with the law throughout the criminal justice process. 

 

Young children experience their world through their relationships with parents, teachers, peers and other caregivers.  Therefore, there is a need to create a warm, loving and nurturing environment where their physical, emotional and spiritual needs are recognized and honored by their family, school and community so as to allow them to reach their full potential.  

 

Keeping the above in mind, the reader draws upon good practices across the world which have proved to be successful in keeping children safe and away from delinquent behavior.   Every child is different and deserves support that is specifically tailored to their own needs and circumstances. The reader suggests a broad framework for imbibing positive skills such as conflict resolution and violence prevention to keep them protected and help them achieve their full potential.

 

The reader is divided into three parts wherein part-I is for parents and what they can do to prevent violence and crimes by children, followed by part-II and III for teachers and community members respectively. Each part briefly discusses few major problems that can push children on the wrong side of law, the early signs of this, what can be done to strengthen protection or intervene to reduce risks.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a Standard Operating Procedure for tracing of missing children as per the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated January 13, 2015 in the matter of Bachpan Bachao Andolan v. Union of India & Ors, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 75 of 2012. The Apex court had observed that there are many Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) developed by States to trace out missing children and therefore, had directed the Ministry of WCD, to take help of TISS to compile a model SOP which may be used by all States/UTs to deal with cases of missing children and to follow a uniform procedure throughout the country.

The SOP for tracing of missing children is finalized in consonance with the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules 2016. The SOP mainly deals with the tracking of missing children and their rehabilitation after recovery. It defines roles and responsibilities of various stake holders such as Police, Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) etc.

Rule 92(1) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules 2016 defines a missing child as – a child whose whereabouts are not known to the parents, legal guardian or any other person or institution legally entrusted with the custody of the child, whatever may be the circumstances or causes of disappearance, and shall be considered missing and in need of care and protection until located or his safety and well-being established.

The objectives of the Standard Operating Procedure are to work in coordination with stakeholders and respond with urgency to issues of missing child; create awareness and basic understanding of key concepts pertaining to missing children, child vulnerability and child protection; provide a set of comprehensive standard operating procedure for key stakeholders involved in child tracing, family tracing, repatriation, rehabilitation social reintegration and preventive work; effectively work with all categories of missing/found/traced children and other group of vulnerable children at risk; ensure expeditious and effective law enforcement including prosecution; create mechanism and systems to prevent further victimization of missing children and ensure that appropriate and timely protection/care/attention is provided to victims/witnesses.

Tracking of missing children is the primary responsibility of Police. The SOP clearly defines role of an Investigating officer.  There is also a checklist for Investigating Officer that provides a framework of actions, consideration and activities that may assist in performing competent, productive and thorough investigation in cases of missing children. The SOP has been shared with all the Director Generals of Police and Principal Secretaries of States/UTs for further dissemination and use.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to Pan-India implementation of Maternity Benefit Program which now has been extended to all districts of the country w.e.f. 01.01.2017. The Prime Minister in his address to the nation on 31.12.2016 had announced Pan-India implementation of Maternity Benefit Program.

The Maternity Benefit Program will provide compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the women can take adequate rest before and after delivery and not be deprived of proper nutrition. 

The total cost of the proposal for the period from 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2020 including Central and State Government share isRs.12,661crore. Government of India’s share during the period 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2020 comes to around Rs. 7932 crore.

 

Objective of the Scheme

i)        To provide partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child.

 

ii)      The cash incentives provided would lead to improved health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mother (PW&LM) to reduce the effects of under-nutrition namely stunting, wasting and other related problems.

 

Target Group

All eligible Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM), excluding the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are in regular employment with the Central Government or State Government or Public Sector Undertakings or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being. It has been decided to give the benefit of Rs.5000/- to PW&LM in three installment for the birth of the first live child by MWCD and the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under existing programmes after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman will get ₹ 6000/-.

 

Conditions and installments

Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are eligible will receive a cash benefit of Rs.5,000/- in three installment at the following stages as specified in the table given below:

 


	
		
			
			Cash Transfer
			
			
			Conditions
			
			
			Amount

			(in ₹)
			
		
		
			
			First installment
			
			
			·   Early Registration of Pregnancy.
			
			
			1,000/-
			
		
		
			
			Second installment
			
			
			·   Received at least one antenatal Check-up (after 6 months of pregnancy)
			
			
			2,000/-

Mode of cash transfer to the Beneficiaries 

The conditional cash transfer scheme would be in DBT mode.

Background:

The Government of India is committed to ensure that every woman gets adequate support and health care during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and every newborn is immunized on time which is the foundation for better health of the mother and the newborn. Normally, the first pregnancy of a woman exposes her to new kinds of challenges and stress factors. Hence, the scheme intends to provide support to the mother for safe delivery and immunization of her first living child. The improved health care seeking behaviour of the PW&LM would lead to better health status for the mother and the child.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been making several efforts to deal with the problem of online Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). In a major step, a stakeholder Consultation was held last year on this issue wherein it was decided that the Ministry will establish a National Alliance against   Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation, focusing primarily on the online content. Subsequent to this decision, an Inter-Ministerial Committee(IMC) was constituted on request of the WCD Ministry. The IMC includes MHA, MEITY, Ministry of Law, Ministry of External Affairs and Department of Telecom.  


    Based on the consultations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology(MEITY) in collaboration with Ministry of Women and Child Development has issued immediate interim measures to curb the menace of Online Child Sexual Abuse Material. MEITY has issued this Order under Section 79(2) (c) of the Information Technology Act 2000 to curb online child sexual abuse material (CSAM).


Under this order, the Internet Service Providers(ISPs) shall be required to adopt and implement the Internet Watch Foundation(IWF) Resources by 31st July 2017. This foundation maintains a dynamic global list of websites and URLs which contain CSAM. Implementation of IWF Resources will result in the relevant content being blocked/removed on an ongoing basis.


    This is an interim measure till the IMC puts in place a centralized mechanism to monitor online CSAM. The Order of MEITY also reiterates that the ISPs will continue to observe due diligence requirements described under the IT Act for removing and disabling any content which is in violation of the extant rules and regulations.

                The Committee, constituted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to look into the issues related to growing problems of obesity in children and its relationship with consumption of junk food, has submitted its report.

The Ministry had constituted the Committee this year under the Chairmanship of Director, National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad on matters relating to availability of junk food in myriad forms at various places accessible to children. The members of the Committee included representatives from Neeti Ayog, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Department of AYUSH, Ministry of HRD, Bureau of Indian Standards, FSSAI, National Institute of Public Cooperation & Child Development, ICMR and independent experts in the field of nutrition and clinical psychology/ behavioural science. The Committee submitted its report this week.

The members of the Committee have expressed concern about the increasing incidence of obesity in children and the related physiological issues including diabetes, hypertension etc. They have also given details of consequences of increasing psychological/behavioural dysfunctionalities in children including binge-eating, body dis-satisfaction, low self-esteem etc.

The Committee has comprehensively reviewed the prevalent practices of regulation of junk food in 23 countries across the world and has also examined the legislative/institutional framework available in India. Based on their study, a number of recommendations have been made. The Committee has suggested a comprehensive definition of junk food in the context of children and has suggested that all food items falling in the definition of junk food should be banned in the school canteens. It has also suggested that vendors/street vendors should not be permitted to sell these foods during school timings in a vicinity of 200 meters from any school. They further suggested that shops and restaurants selling food within 200 meters of a school should not be permitted to sell these foods to children in school uniforms. They have further suggested that a list of desirable food items to be offered in the school canteen. Recommendations have also been made for labelling of pre-packaged food stating clearly as “unfit for infant/children/pregnant and lactating mothers or persons with specific ailments”.

A number of recommendations have been made regarding modification of school health card to include nutrition related aspects and that the School Health Programme should be renamed as School Health and Nutrition Programme. The Committee has given detailed recommendations regarding establishment and management of school canteen and comprehensive advertisement/ promotion campaign to be undertaken jointly by different stakeholder ministries. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is examining the report.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for rehabilitation of children in conflict with law under the Juvenile Justice System. The said SOP aims to emphasize the cause of rehabilitation and social re-integration by providing for types of institutional care, after care services, foster care and sponsorship to such children. The SOP is based on the principles of presumptive innocence and best interest of the child. 

 

The objective of the SOP is to reduce incarceration while protecting children from violence, abuse and exploitation. The SOP promotes rehabilitation that involves families and communities as a safer, more appropriate and effective approach than punitive measures. The SOP has been designed to be a useful guide for stake holders while dealing with children in conflict with law such as functionaries of child care institutions, Juvenile Justice Boards/ Children’s Courts, National and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, State/UT Governments and Police etc.

 

The Ministry adopted a consultative process in developing the SOP by engaging with experts and advocates on issues of child rights and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). It was also placed on the website of the Ministry of WCD for seeking comments from various stakeholders.    

 

The SOP will help to provide possibilities and opportunities to children in conflict with law to reintegrate in the society.

Smt Maneka Gandhi urged the Chairpersons of ICCs to ensure that all affiliated organizations with their Ministries set up ICCs in their offices. Smt Maneka Gandhi asked the participants to ensure the genuineness of a complaint while carrying out the enquiry and to complete every enquiry within the stipulated time frame.

                The facility of online registration of Child Care Institutions across the country was launched by the Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi today. The Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj, Secretary WCD, Ms. Leena Nair and senior officers of the Ministry, CARA and Childline among others were present on the occasion. 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that online registration of CCIs is a very important part of good governance. It will now make it easy for CCIs to register themselves, she added. 

The WCD Minister, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that online registration will provide a centralized system where all the information will be readily available about the CCIs in the country. It will be possible to know on a real time basis as to how many children are available in each CCI, how many are available for adoption, which children need help and what type of assistance needs to be provided to them, she added. 

The Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj said that with the new online registration process there will be transparency in the system now and it will be possible to offer greater care and protection to the children. 

In her introductory remarks, Secretary WCD, Ms. Leena Nair said that the new facility has been created to have a uniform system of registration for all Child Care Institutions. 

The module for online registration of CCIs has been developed by the WCD Ministry with the assistance of NIC. This will facilitate and streamline the functioning of State Governments/UT Administrations and set in place a uniform registration process throughout the country. In this regard the Ministry held various consultations and meetings with representatives from different States/UTs, NIC to finalize the module for registration of CCIs. 

The proposed system is in accordance with Rule 21 (12) of Juvenile Justice Central Model Rules 2016 which states that “The Central Government shall facilitate developing a model online system for receipt and processing of applications and grant or cancellation of registration and in the interim the systems existing in the States and Union Territories shall continue”. Further, Section 41 (1) and Section 42 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 (JJ Act), provides for mandatory registration of all Child Care Institutions with penal provisions in case of non-compliance with imprisonment which may extend to one year or a fine of not less than one lakh rupees or both. 

At present there is a system of manual registration of CCIs followed by States/ UTs due to which there is no national data base on the number of CCIs being registered under the JJ Act in the country. Further there is a lack of transparency and it is difficult to monitor the Child Care Intuitions and their functioning due to lack of data available. 

The proposed online registration system will ease the process of registration of CCIs through an online process, end to end Information and Communication Technology enablement and ensure efficient monitoring by Central and State Governments. 

Some of the salient features of the online system include e-alerts to the applicants and the registration authorities, easy information sharing and online issuance of registration certificates. The Organizations willing to run CCIs will be required to register on the portal and submit their application with complete documentation online. 

The States/UTs need to designate one nodal officer at State level and one District level nodal officer in each of the district to make them responsible in the implementation of online registration process. Further, the States/UTs shall also designate an officer who shall be the Registration Authority at State/UT level to grant registration.

                All stakeholders meeting was held here today to review the preparations for the Commonwealth Games 2018, the Asian Games 2018 and the Olympic Games 2020. Representatives of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Sports Authority of India, Laxmibai National Institute of Physical Education, Indian Olympic Association, representatives of ‘High Priority’ and ‘Priority’ sports disciplines, the members of Olympic Task Force, Members of the TOP Scheme Committee and also the National Observers attended the daylong brain storming session. 

Addressing the inaugural session of the meeting the Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel said that the government has taken a number of steps to strengthen the various kinds of support given to the athletes and the sportspersons. The major steps include enhancement of the amount of financial assistance under the scheme of assistance to the National Sports Federations. He said that while a lot has been done to broad base the sports activities in the country a lot is still needed to be done to achieve excellence and make India is sports power house of the world. 

Shri Goel also said that IOA should take the lead in various spheres like dispute resolution in the NSFs, holding of National Games regularly, holding of multi disciplinary mega events in India etc. He also said that attention should also be paid to focus on games such as Baseball, Cycling and Martial Arts etc. where India has not participated traditionally so far in International competitions. Shri Goel also stressed that the Federations should bring best coaches and support staff to provide training to the athletes. Shri Goel said that we should upgrade the sports infrastructure, spot talent at a very young age, monitor performance, promote School and University level games in a big way, utilize stadiums to their full potential and involve best available coaching academies in training of the sportspersons. 

Secretary Sports, Shri Injeti Srinivas, in his opening remarks mentioned that there is no dearth of either the resources or the talent to achieve excellence and win medals at the highest level of sport i.e. the Olympics. What is needed is the ability to identify the talent and nurture them to achieve excellence. The NSFs are required to identify the talent and increase the bench strength of young athletes and provide them strong support system. Shri Srinivas also stated that the success of the plan lies in the convergence and coordination among all the stakeholders. 

During the meeting eminent players, coaches, representatives of different national sports federations and IOA and officials of the Ministry and Sports Authority of India made presentations and deliberated on the issues related to finalizing the approach for the forthcoming mega events.

The committee stressed the need for streamlining the organisational set up of Bharat Scouts and Guides and Hindustan Scouts and Guides. It has further recommended that there should be a permanent monitoring Committee, which will periodically assess the activities of both the organisations and submit report to the Ministry. The committee has also recommended that there should be government nominees on the Boards of both the organizations.  Complaints have also been reported, regarding leakage of question papers related to Rashtrapati Puruskar (2016–2017) in Bharat Scouts and Guides.

 

Earlier, the Committee had submitted its first interim report on January 31, 2017. The committee has recommended that the Scouts movement should become an integral part of Youth movement, which is one of the important missions of the Ministry.

 

In the context of the complaints received from various sections of the societies against the Bharat Scouts and Guides and Hindustan Scouts and Guides, Shri Vijay Goel, had constituted a seven-member High Level Committee on Scouts and Guides in the month of October, 2016 under the chairmanship of Shri Harsh Malhotra, to conduct physical inspection of the infrastructure and assets of the two recognized Scouts and Guides Organizations. These two organizations have been recognized by the Ministry for conducting scouting and guiding activities all across the country. The Ministry also gives them grant-in-aid for conducting the scouting/guiding activities.

In a statement on C.K Vineeth controversy here today, Shri Goel added, “A player has to play continuously and hence is unable to meet the mandatory guideline. I will speak to Kerala Chief Minister and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) office in New Delhi to seek their intervention to accommodate this player and change the rules”. 

The Minister reiterated that the Government is always committed to the welfare of players and their overall conditions. “I shall monitor such cases”, he stated. Shri Goel has also said that if players face any issue, he/she can directly contact him for redressal of their issues.

                The countdown to FIFA U-17 Football World Cup has already begun and even as the football fever rises, ticket sales are already on in the presence of legendary footballer Carles Puyol.  The football mega-event is all set to reach yet another milestone, with a Mini Football Fest to be hosted in the heart of the national capital, tomorrow.

 

The Mini Football Fest will be organized in Delhi’s Connaught Place in the presence of Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Vijay Goel, Chief Minister of Manipur, Shri Biren Singh and renowned boxer, Shri Vijender Singh. A large football will also be unveiled during the event that will create a buzz for the upcoming World Cup in October this year.

 

Shri Biren Singh has been a footballer himself and is excited to be a part of this event. Shri Goel, on the other hand, has undertaken extensive tours across the venues that will host the World Cup to ensure that preparations are taken care of in a swift manner, with the best facilities for the players, as well as fans. The Sports Minister has visited Kochi, Kolkata and Mumbai.  He will also visit Guwahati soon, to take stock of the preparations.

 

FIFA Under-17 World Cup will commence on October 6 and the final will be played on October 28 at Kolkata’s Salt Lake Stadium. It is for the first time that India is set to host a FIFA World Cup, in any form. 

 

The Government has already kicked off Mission 11 Million to push the football frenzy further and take football to 11 million kids across India.  This move will enable the creation of a sports culture, as well as nurture and train budding young talent.

Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Shri Vijay Goel attended an event to promote the ticketing launch for FIFA Under-17 World Cup India 2017 at Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, here today.  Spanish World Cup winner, Carles Puyol joined the Minister on the occasion.  Welcoming Carles Puyol, the Sports Minister said, “To launch the tickets sales for this tournament, we have with us somebody, who was a star with not one, but two incredible teams – Spain and Barcelona. Puyol is a football legend and it is an honour to have him with us for the launch”.  Shri Goel added, “We have made sure the tickets are priced very nominally, you can buy a World Cup ticket for less than fifty rupees, so there is no reason not to come and support this tournament in large numbers. I do not see this tournament as the conclusion, rather it is the start of the next revolution in Indian football and I need all your support to make the most of this amazing opportunity”.

The legendary Spanish defender engaged in a friendly match with Shri Vijay Goel and children of the Mission XI Million programme.   Shri Goel and Carles Puyol handed over the first ticket to Ms. Gouri Bhaduri, the grand daughter-in-law of Shibdas Bhaduri, captain of Mohun Bagan AC.  It was for the first time that an Indian football team, Mohun Bagan AC, defeated an English team - East Yorkshire Regiment and won the IFA Shield in 1911.  The ceremonial ticket will allow her family to attend any of the matches across the six host cities.  Speaking on the occasion, Carles Puyol said, “I was very excited and curious to discover the country and its people and I am glad that I didn’t only get to see India’s rich history, but also honour it.

Tickets for the first FIFA event in the country will go live on May 16 at exactly 19:11 hrs, paying tribute to the year in which Indian football made history.   The tickets will be available on a first come, first serve basis, and will be exclusively available on FIFA.com.   The Official Draw for the tournament will take place on July 7, 2017.

                Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Shri Vijay Goel undertook a visit to Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium here today, where the Asian Wrestling Championship 2017 is being held. He had earlier visited Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, National Stadium and Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool. 

The Minister was informed by the Administrator that as per the condition of the booking of various facilities in Indira Gandhi stadium, it is the responsibility of the organizers to keep the premises clean from the date of taking over, till the handing over of the stadium. 

The Minister directed that from now on, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) should not depend on organizers, but should look after the cleanliness work on their own. Interacting with the media, Shri Goel said, “When an international event is held, the players and others go back with the impression about India and not about various agencies involved.”

Shri Goel added that the maintenance and sustenance of the stadia has to be throughout the year and should not be event-specific.

Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Youth Affairs & Sports, Shri Vijay Goel flagged off four Clean Himalaya expeditions and a Medical Mountaineering expedition to Mt Satopanth (7075 Mtrs) at the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF), here today. Appreciating the IMF for its efforts to promote mountaineering and allied adventure sports, Shri Goel said that such initiatives will not only help in ensuring safe practices during the conduct of adventure activities, but will also add to the skill levels of the youth, enhancing their employability, as well as instil discipline and courage in youngsters. 

Interacting with the team members, the Minister stressed upon the need to address environmental concerns while promoting adventure tourism. He added that adventure tourism not only contributes in transforming the youth, but also holds a lot of potential in helping in the economic growth of the country. Shri Goel also wished the team a safe and successful climb. 

Making a presentation on the cleaning expeditions, President IMF, Col HS Chauhan pointed out that in an effort to extend the Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to the Himalayas, IMF is launching four Himalaya Cleaning expeditions to popular destinations in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand & Arunachal, which have been sponsored by ONGC as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. 

The Medical Mountaineering Expedition is a Certification course on Expedition Medicine for Mountaineers & Trekkers approved by the Medical Commission of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA). The core mission of the expedition is to create an expanding pool of Holistic Mountain Leaders, capable of providing integrated basic health care, life support and rescue logistics to expeditions and the remote mountain communities until the arrival of definitive medical care. 

A team of 25 non-medical mountaineers and 25 trekkers led by Dr Anil Gurtoo, an experienced mountaineer and Professor, Medicine at Lady Hardinge Medical College will participate in this expedition from May 8 to June 10, 2017. The expedition will also include lectures by specialists from leading teaching hospitals of Delhi on various medical issues faced by mountaineers at high altitudes. 

Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs, Dr. A.K Dubey, President, Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Col H.S Chauhan and renowned mountaineer Major H.P.S Ahluwalia, as well as school children and young mountaineers were among those present on the occasion.

IMF conducts activities under the National Programme for Youth and Adolescent Development (NPYAD) scheme of the Ministry to promote mountaineering and land-based adventure sports among the youth of the country.

 Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Youth Affairs & Sports, Shri Vijay Goel announced the formalization of new National Youth Awards, here today.  The initiatives have been taken in an effort to make the National Youth AwardS (NYA) more broad-based and to promote transparency in the selection process.   The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports confers the National Youth Award (NYA) every year to young persons to give recognition to the outstanding work and to motivate them to achieve excellence in the field on National Development and Social Service, to encourage them to develop a sense of responsibility to the community and also to improve their own potential as a good citizen. Some of the key features of the initiatives on NYA include:

ONLINE APPLICATION:- For the first time, it has been decided that the nomination for the National Youth Awards  (NYA) should be received and processed through online mode, on the lines of the Padma Awards announced by the  Prime Minister recently, to cover the people on pan-India basis.  Earlier, the nominations were received only through State/UT Governments with the restriction that they should nominate only 5 names for Individuals and 2 nominations in Voluntary Organizations Category.  It was a routine affair and no adequate publicity was given by the State Governments/UTs to popularize the Awards and seek varied nominations.

In contrast, an applicant can apply now online directly to the Ministry on the recommendation of the Head of the Institution/SDM/DM/DC, or any officer, not below the rank of Deputy Secretary in the Government of India. An online application has been developed in consultation with MyGov team.  Applicants will be given 30 days to apply online at https://innovate.mygov.in/national-youth-award/. The final selection will be made by the 8-member Central Selection Committee, headed by the Secretary, Department of Youth Affairs and prominent and eminent personalities. 

            It will now be ensured that the selection process is transparent and the restrictions in the nomination process are removed, thus making the Awards more broad-based and accessible to the deserving youth of the country. A new Logo for the National Youth Awards has also been released.

  INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THE AWARD

            Earlier, only one Award was given under Voluntary Organization Category, working with the youth for national development and social service. The number of Awards in the Organization category has now been increased from 1 to 10 and the prize money is Rs. 2,00,000 with a Trophy and Certificate. This initiative has been taken with a view that more recognition needs to be given to voluntary Organizations working in the field of Youth development, keeping in view of the number of organizations working in the country. Further, these outstanding organizations will be partners in promotion of the different schemes and policies of the Ministry in the field of youth development in the country. The initiative is expected to expand the reach of the Ministry in programme implementation across the country. The amount of money for the Award in the Individual category has also been enhanced to Rs. 50,000/- and will be given to 25 individuals.

EXPANSION OF FIELD OF ACTIVITIES

The NYA was earlier conferred for excellent work in the field of youth development activities and social service without specifying the individual fields thereby making it more general and less focused.

            It has also been decided that in line with the focused approach of the Padma Award, the NYA should also be conferred for excellent work done in the specific field of activities by the Youth. Accordingly, the field of activities for conferring the NYA has been categorically specified in order to have concentrated effort in those fields. The fields of activities in the course of youth development work are health, research and innovation, culture, promotion of human rights, art and literature, tourism, traditional medicines, active citizenship, community service, sports and academic excellence & smart learning and any other similar field.

PAN-INDIA ADVERTISEMENT

            In order to address the drawback of limited awareness of the NYA, it has been decided that a pan-India colour advertisement, seeking nominations for the Awards should be released in all the major and regional newspapers. Also the advertisements will be put on Mygov portal and Ministry’s website. The advertisements inviting nominations for the award will be released on May 10, 2017.  This initiative, combined with the online application, will be a game-changer for the NYA.

Shri Devender Kumar Sikri, Chairman, CCI will deliver the Welcome Address on the occasion.

 The Competition Act, 2002, as amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007, follows the philosophy of modern competition laws. The Act prohibits anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position by enterprises and regulates combinations (acquisition, acquiring of control and M&A), which cause or are likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition within India.

The objectives of the Competition Act are sought to be achieved through the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which has been established by the Central Government with effect from 14th October 2003. It is the duty of the Commission to eliminate practices having adverse effect on competition, promote and sustain competition, protect the interests of consumers and ensure freedom of trade in the markets of India.
