                Following are the highlights from his speech


	Compliments to my dear countrymen on the momentous occasion of completion of 75 years of independence. Many congratulations to all! It is heartening to see our tricolour being unfurled with pride, honour and glory, not only at all the corners of India, but also worldwide by our Indians who love their country immensely. 
	All the countrymen are deeply indebted to Pujya Bapu, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Veer Savarkar, who devoted all their life on the path of duty towards the nation. The path of obligation has been their sole life path. 
	This country is grateful to Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad, Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Ram Prasad Bismil and countless such revolutionaries of ours who shook the foundations of British rule. This nation is grateful to those brave women, be it Rani Lakshmibai, Jhalkari Bai, Durga Bhabhi, Rani Gaidinliu, Rani Chennamma, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Velu Nachiyar, who showed the mettle of women power of India.
	Today is an opportunity to pay homage to countless such great men like Dr. Rajendra Prasad ji, Nehru ji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Deendayal Upadhyay, Jai Prakash Narayan, Ram Manohar Lohia, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Nanaji Deshmukh, Subramania Bharati who fought the war of independence and built the country after independence.
	When we talk about the freedom struggle, we cannot forget to take pride of our tribal society living in forests. There are countless names like Bhagwan Birsa Munda, Sidhu-Kanhu, Alluri Sitarama Raju, Govind Guru, who became the voice of freedom movement and inspired my tribal brothers and sisters, mothers and youth in the remotest jungles to live and die for the motherland. It has been the good fortune of the country that there have been many aspects of the freedom struggle. 
	From the last year, we are witnessing how the country is celebrating the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’. It all began with Dandi Yatra in 2021. The people held programs in every district, every corner of India to enlarge the scope of goals of the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ of Independence. This was perhaps for the first time in history that such a huge and comprehensive festival for a single purpose was celebrated.  
	An attempt was made in every corner of India to remember all those great men who did not find mention in history for some reasons or who were forgotten.  Today, the nation found out all such heroes and great men from every corner of the country and paid tributes to them for their sacrifices. It was an opportunity to pay tributes to all these great men during the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’.
	Today, as we are celebrating the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, it is an opportunity to recall the contributions made by those who dedicated their lives for the country during the last 75 years, those who protected the country and fulfilled the country’s resolutions; be it the army personnel, police personnel, bureaucrats, public representatives, administrators of the local self-government, state administration or central administration. Today we must also recall the contributions made by the crores of citizens of the country who have done everything possible to take the country forward despite various challenges in 75 years. 
	This journey of 75 years has been full of ups and downs. Amidst good and bad times our countrymen have made various achievements; they have made efforts and have not given up. They didn’t let the resolutions to get lost. 
	The world was not cognizant that India has an inherent potential of strong culture and values, a bond of thoughts deeply embedded in mind and soul; and that is – that India is a mother of all democracy. And when those who have democracy pulsating in their mind walk with determination and resolve, it augurs doom for the most powerful sultanates of the world. This Mother of Democracy, our India has proven to all that we have this invaluable strength. 
	In the journey of 75 years, in the midst of hopes, aspirations, ups and downs, it is with everyone’s effort that we could reach thus far. And when in 2014, my countrymen gave me this responsibility, I was the first Indian born in free India, who got the privilege to sing praises of glory to my dear countrymen from the ramparts of the historical Red Fort. 
	From the farthest of latitudes and longitudes of India-east or west, north or south, ocean beds or Himalayan peaks, I have left no stone unturned to reach the corners and fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of inclusion. I have committed myself to his vision of empowering and uplifting the person sitting at the last mile. 
	 We are embarking on the glorious years of 75 years today on AMRIT MAHOTSAV. On the first morn of 76th year, I am filled with pride to see such an immensely endowed nation. 
	Every citizen of the country wants to change things, wants to see things change, but is not ready to wait. He wants these things to happen in front of his eyes and wants to do it as part of his duty.  And I believe whether it is the central government, state governments, institutions of local self-government, no matter what kind of governance system, everyone has to address this aspirational society and we cannot wait longer for their aspirations. 
	Our aspiration society has waited for a long time. But now they are not ready to force their future generations to live in wait and hence the first dawn of this ‘Amrit Kaal’ has brought a huge golden opportunity for us to fulfil the aspirations of that aspiration society.
	Recently, we have seen and experienced one or two such forces and that is the collective consciousness renaissance in India. I think that this awakening of consciousness, this renaissance, is our greatest asset.  Until 10th August, people would not even be aware of the power within the country. But for the last three days, the way the country has set about celebrating the journey of the Tricolour, even the leading experts of social science can't imagine the power within my country which has been shown by the Tricolour. 
	The world is looking at India proudly and with anticipation. The world has started searching for solutions to the problems on the soil of India. This change in the world, this change in the thinking of the world, is the result of our experienced journey of 75 years.
	The world has started realising where the power to fulfil the expectations actually lies. I see it as a feminine power. I see it as triple power or tri-shakti, i.e. aspiration, re-awakening and the world’s expectations. We are aware that to fulfil it, today, my countrymen have a major role in awakening this trust of the world in India. 
	130 crore countrymen after several decades of experience have shown the world the importance of a stable government, the power of political stability, policies and how trust develops in the policies. The world too is now able to understand it. And now when there is political stability, dynamism in policies, speed in decision making, ubiquity and universal trust, then everyone becomes a partner in development. 
	We started our journey with the mantra of  Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, but gradually the countrymen have added more colours to it with Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas. So, we have seen our collective power and collective potential. 
	Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is being celebrated with the campaign to build 75 Amrit Sarovars in every district today. People from every village are joining the campaign and offering their services. With their own efforts, the people are running a massive campaign for water conservation in their respective villages. 
	Today, I am talking about the strength of 130 crore countrymen, witnessing their dreams and feeling their resolutions from the ramparts of Red Fort, I believe we must focus our attention on the “Panch Pran” for the coming 25 years. You have to concentrate on your resolves and strength. And we must take up the responsibility of fulfilling all the dreams of the freedom fighters by embracing those Panch Pran by 2047 when the country celebrates 100 years of independence.
	The Panch Pran of Amrit Kaal- Goal of developed India, to remove any trace of colonial mindset, take pride in our roots, unity and sense of duty among citizens.
	The need of the hour is cooperative competitive federalism. Let there be a healthy spirit of competition among the states on progressing in different sectors.
	When, I first spoke about cleanliness during my first speech, the entire country embraced it. Everyone moved towards cleanliness as per his capacity and there is now antipathy towards filthiness. This is the country which has done it, is doing it and will continue to do so in future also. Freedom from open defecation has become possible in India today.
	When the world was in a dilemma, this is the country which crossed the target of 200 crore vaccinations in a time-bound manner and broke all the previous records. 
	We are dependent on the fuel from the Gulf. We had decided how to move towards bio-oil. The 10 percent ethanol blending seemed like a very big dream. Old experiences showed that it was not possible, but the country has realized this dream of 10 percent ethanol blending before time.
	Providing electricity connection to 2.5 crore people in such a short time was not a small task, but the country has done it. Today the country is rapidly providing water from tap to the homes of lakhs of families. 
	Experience tells us that we can achieve our goals once we are determined. Be it the goal of renewable energy, the intention of building new medical colleges in the country or creating a workforce of doctors, the pace has increased a lot in every field. 
	Brothers, how long will the world continue to distribute certificates to us? How long will we live on the certificates of the world? Shall we not set our own standards? Can a country of 130 crores not make an effort to exceed its standards? Under no circumstances should we try to look like others. It should be our temperament to grow with our own potential. We want freedom from slavery. The element of slavery should not remain in our mind even under the distant seven seas.
	I look with hope the way the new National Education Policy has been formulated with a lot of brainstorming, with the exchange of ideas from various people and is at the root of the country’s education policy. The skill that we have emphasized is such a power, which will give us the strength to be free from slavery.
	We have seen that sometimes our talent gets tied in the bondage of hope. This is the result of slave mentality. We should be proud of every language of our country. We may or may not know the language, but we should be proud that it is the language of my country and it is the language given to the world by our ancestors.
	Today we are witnessing the structure of Digital India. We are looking at start-ups. Who are these people? This is that pool of talent who lives in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, or in villages and belongs to poor families. These are our youngsters who are coming before the world today with new discoveries. 
	Today the world is discussing about holistic health care. But when it talks about holistic health care, it looks towards India’s yoga, India’s Ayurveda and India’s holistic lifestyle. This is our legacy that we are providing to the world. 
	The world is being influenced by it today. Now look at our strength. We are the people who know how to live with nature. Coarse paddy and millets are household items. This is our heritage. Due to the hard work of our small farmers, paddy flourished in small pieces of land. Today the world is moving ahead to celebrate the millet year at the international level. That means our heritage is being appreciated around the world today. Let us learn to be proud of it. We have a lot to offer to the world.
	We are the people who see the divine in the plants. We are the people who consider the river as mother. We are those people who see Shankar in every stone. This is our power. We see every river as a form of mother. Such enormity of the environment is our pride! When we are proud of such heritage, the world too will feel proud of it. 
	Today the world is facing a severe crisis due to conflicts caused by the attitude of one upmanship- the reason of all tensions. We have the wisdom to resolve this. Our scholars have said “Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti” meaning that absolute Truth is one but it is manifested differently. This is our glory. 



	We are the people who have seen the welfare of the world; we have been on the path of social good not only for our people but the whole world by believing in “sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ, sarve santu nirāmayāḥ”. It is ingrained in our values that we will pray that may all be prosperous and happy, may all be free from illness, may all see what is auspicious, and may no one suffer.
	In the same way, another very important issue is Unity and solidarity. We need to celebrate the diversity of our huge country. The peaceful co-existence of innumerable traditions and creeds are our pride. For us all are equal. No one is inferior or superior; all are our own. This feeling of oneness is important for unity. 



	My brothers and sisters, from this rampart of Red Fort, I also want to share an agony.  What I wish to share is that it hurts me to say that we have witnessed a perversion in our day to day speaking, behaviour. We have been casually using expletives and cuss words which are abusive and against our women. Can we not pledge to get rid of every behaviour, culture that humiliates and demeans women in our daily life? Women’s pride is going to be a huge asset in fulfilling the dreams of the nation. I see this power and therefore I am insistent on it. 
	It is the job of the government to make efforts to provide 24 hours electricity, but it is the duty of the citizen to save as many units as he can. It is the responsibility and efforts of the government to supply water to every field, but a voice should come from each of my fields that we will move forward by saving water by focusing on 'per drop more crop'. It is our duty to do chemical free farming, organic farming and natural farming.
	Friends, whether it is police or people, ruler or administrator, no one can be untouched by this civic duty. If everyone performs the duties of a citizen, I am sure that we can achieve the desired goals ahead of time.
	Today is also the birth anniversary of Maharishi Aurobindo. I bow at the feet of that great man. But we need to remember the great man who gave a call for ‘Swadeshi to Swaraj’ and ‘Swaraj to Suraj’. This is his mantra. And, therefore, ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ becomes the responsibility of every citizen, every government and every unit of society. ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ is not a government agenda or a government programme. This is a mass movement of society, which we have to take forward.
	My friends, today we heard this sound after 75 years of independence for which our ears were yearning to hear. For the first time after 75 years, the Made in India cannon has saluted the Tricolor from the Red Fort. Will there be any Indian who will not be inspired by this sound? 
	My dear brothers and sisters, today I want to congratulate the soldiers of the army of my country from my heart. I salute the way the army jawans have shouldered this responsibility of self-reliance in an organized way and with courage.  The resolution of our country is not small when the armed forces make a list and decide not to import 300 defence products.
	Speaking of the PLI scheme, people from around the world are coming to India to try their luck. They are bringing new technology along with them. They are generating new employment opportunities. India is becoming a manufacturing hub. It is building a foundation for a Self-reliant India. 
	Be it manufacturing of electronic goods or mobile phones, today the country is progressing at a very fast pace. Which Indian wouldn’t be proud when our Brahmos is exported to the world? Today the Vande Bharat train and our metro coaches are becoming objects of attraction for the world.
	We have to become self-reliant in the energy sector. How long will we be dependent on others in the field of energy? We should be self-reliant in the field of solar energy, wind energy, various renewable energy sources and must lead in terms of Mission Hydrogen, bio fuel and electric vehicles. 
	Today natural farming is also a way of becoming self-reliant. Today the factories of Nano Fertilizer have brought a new hope in the country. But natural farming and chemical-free farming can give a boost to self-reliance. Today, new employment opportunities in the form of green jobs are opening up very fast in the country. 
	India has opened up space through its policies. India has come up with the most progressive policy regarding drones in the world. We have opened up new doors of opportunities for the youth of the country. 
	I also call upon the private sector to come forward. We have to dominate the world. One of the dreams of a self-reliant India is to ensure that India does not lag behind in fulfilling the needs of the world. Even if it is the MSMEs, we have to take our products to the world with Zero Defect, Zero Effect. We have to be proud of Swadeshi.
	Till today we always remember our revered Lal Bahadur Shastri ji for his inspirational clarion call of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan meaning “Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer. Later Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji added a new link of Jai Vigyan which meant “hail science” and we gave it utmost importance. But in this new phase Amritkal now it is imperative to add jai Anusandhaan that is “hail innovation”. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhaan
	Today we are all set to enter the 5G era. You don’t have to wait too long before we match the global steps. We are ensuring that optical fiber reaches each and every village until the last mile. I am fully informed that the dream of Digital India will be attained through the rural India. Today I am happy that four lakh Common Service Centers of India are being developed in villages which are being managed by the youth of that village. 



	This Digital India movement of developing semiconductors, entering 5G era, spreading the network of optical fibers is not just to establish ourselves as modern and developed, but it is possible because of three intrinsic missions. The complete transformation of education eco-system, revolution in health infrastructure and improvement in quality of lifestyles of the citizens will be possible only through digitalization. 



	Friends, I can foresee that India will march ahead phenomenally in this decade which is hailed as the tech-age for humanity. It is a decade of technology. In the field of IT, India has become a force to reckon with globally. We have the competencies to contribute in this tech-age. 



	Our Atal Innovation Mission, our incubation centers, our startups are developing a whole new sector, opening up new opportunities for the younger generation. Whether it is a matter of space mission, whether it is about our Deep Ocean Mission, whether we want to go deep into the ocean or we have to touch the sky, these are new areas, by which we are moving forward.
	We must acknowledge and strengthen the potential of our small farmers, entrepreneurs, small and medium sized enterprises, cottage industries, micro industries, street vendors, domestic labourers, daily wagers, auto rickshaw drivers, bus service providers etc. These form the largest population who need to be empowered. 



	I want to say something from the experience of the last few years. You must have seen the power of ‘Nari Shakti’ in courts who are working in the field of judiciary. Look at the public representatives in the rural area. Our ‘Nari Shakti’ is devotedly engaged in solving the problems of our villages. Look at the field of knowledge or science, the ‘Nari Shakti’ of our country is visible. Even in the police force, our ‘Nari Shakti’ is taking the responsibility of protecting the people. 



	In every walk of life, whether it is the playground or the battlefield, the ‘Nari Shakti’ of India is coming forward with a new strength and a new belief. I can see the manifold contribution of ‘Nari Shakti’, my mothers, sisters and daughters, in the next 25 years compared to the contribution in the 75 years of India’s journey. The more we pay attention to this aspect, the more opportunities and facilities we provide to our daughters, they will return us much more than that. They will take the country to a new height. 



	There are many states of our country, which have played a great role in taking the country forward, have led and worked as examples in many fields. This gives strength to our federalism. But today the need of the hour is that we need cooperative federalism as well as cooperative competitive federalism. We need competition for development.
	I do not want to discuss everything but would definitely want to focus on two issues. One is corruption and the other is nepotism. We have to fight against corruption with all our might. In the last eight years, we have been successful in working for the betterment of the country by saving two lakh crore rupees which used to go into the wrong hands, using all the modern systems like Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar and Mobile. 



	Those who fled the country after looting banks during the tenure of previous government, we have seized their property and are trying to get them back. Some have been forced to go behind the bars. We are trying to ensure that those who looted the country are compelled to return.
	Brothers and sisters, the corrupt are eating away the country like termites. I have to fight against it, intensify the fight and have to take it to a decisive point. So, my 130 crore countrymen, please bless me and support me! Today I have come to seek your support and cooperation so that I can fight this battle. I hope the country becomes victorious in this war. 



	It is truly a sad state of affairs that even after conviction in corruption cases in court of law or those who were jailed for such cases, some people stoop so low even to glorify them. Therefore, till there is a feeling of hatred against corrupt ones in society, this kind of mindset is not going to end.
	On the other hand, I want to discuss about nepotism and when I talk about nepotism, people think, I am only talking about nepotism in politics, but the reality is that this malaise has spread into all institutions of the country, which adversely affects the talent and opportunities. I, therefore, appeal to the people of the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort to take a pledge under the tricolor to root out the menace the nepotism for purification of India’s politics and all intuitions of the country in the true spirit of Indian Constitution.
	I urge the countrymen to start the ‘Amrit Kaal’ today by nurturing new possibilities, realizing new resolutions and moving ahead with confidence. The “Amrit Mahotsav’ of freedom has moved in the direction of ‘Amrit Kaal’ and, therefore, ‘Sabka Prayas’ (everyone’s efforts) is necessary in this ‘Amrit Kaal’. The spirit of Team India is going to take the country forward. This Team India of 130 crore countrymen will realize all the dreams by moving forward as a team.

1.      This is my first visit to Mizoram after being elected President of India. I am truly happy to be here and thank the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Chief Minister and all the other members of the Mizoram Legislative Assembly for inviting me to address this House.

2.      Mizoram is special in India. It stands out for a very mature and dignified political culture. This Assembly is the true embodiment of Mizoram’s political culture as well as of the will and aspirations of the people of the state. We are aware of the three Ds of the legislature. This is a place to debate, dissent and finally decide. Yet there are other principles to follow too. Ideally, the functioning of the legislature should be marked by dignity and decorum. And the political system should not allow differences to become disputes. 

 3.      While these principles are cherished in all democracies, they are not always followed. Sometimes, there are unfortunate disruptions. Here, I must commend and congratulate the Assembly of Mizoram. In its 45-year history, it has established a reputation for smooth conduct of business. The behaviour and participation of its members – of all of you, I should say – has conformed to the highest standards. This Assembly is a role model for our democracy and for how a legislative House should function.

 4.      The sense of honour and dignity that one sees in public life in Mizoram is heart-warming. It is also typical of this state’s rich society. The signing, implementation and adherence to the Mizo Accord of 1986 is still held up as a shining example all over the world. Yesterday I called it a miracle. And it truly is a miracle in the way in which it ended an insurgency situation and a conflict that had divided our country and Mizo society itself.

 5      All political stake-holders as well as civil society groups – including the Church and Church-affiliated groups, women’s groups and other non-governmental organisations – have got together to create an atmosphere for peace and development in Mizoram. The Accord and its legacy represent one of the greatest successes in India’s long history. One must recall the enlightened and far-sighted leadership of Pu Laldenga, as well as the efforts and generosity of spirit of Pu Lal Thanhawla, who is of course the Chief Minister today as well. And here I would also like to mention another stalwart of Mizoram, the respected Brigadier T. Sailo. Our Mizoram and our India owe these nation builders so much.

 

Members of the House

6.      India is a nation of astonishing diversity. In our country – and frankly even within states of our country – we see a huge variety of ethnic and religious identities, and so many languages, cultures and customs, modes of dress, food habits and types of cuisine. This diversity is our strength. It enriches each of us and contributes to both the unity and the wonder of India. It is important to preserve and cherish this diversity. 

7.      Economic integration and the movement of people from one part of the country to another for work or education are making all of us much more familiar with each other. For example, young men and women from Mizoram may be found working in the hospitality industry in Kerala or in an IT company in Pune. They contribute, they earn, they stand out for their professionalism – and they add to the cultural wealth of our shared society. It is this human connectivity that makes our country so unique.

8.      It is critical to complement it with physical and infrastructural connectivity. That is why Mizoram is such a focus of the government of India’s Act East Policy. This Policy aims at enhancing connectivity and trade linkages between Mizoram and the other states of the Northeast and the rest of the country – as well as neighbouring countries of Southeast Asia. 

 9.      This will give Mizoram’s agricultural produce and traditional products access to new markets. It will also strengthen IT and Internet connectivity, a process that will have a multiplier effect across a range of industries. Once we create this infrastructure, we can simply leave it to the entrepreneurship, the energy and the genius of the young people of this state to capitalise on it. With their high literacy levels and English-language skills, a golden opportunity lies before the youth of Mizoram.

 10.  To emphasise a point, I made in another speech recently, for a short time in our history there was a misconception about the Northeast being a “frontier”. Far from that, it is at the heart of an ancient trade corridor. For centuries, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been perceived as a composite trading region, with cultural similarities as well. Mizoram is right at the centre of this process and of this area. Mizoram’s geography can be its biggest asset – and the government of India is working to ensure just that.

 11.  A member of the House is elected by his or her voters. But once elected, the MLA represents the entire constituency, and not just those who have voted for him. The legislator equally represents those who did not vote for him or in fact those who opposed him. Similarly, a rival in an election is a political competitor and not an enemy. After the election, the competitor could become a colleague in the task of ensuring the well-being and development of a constituency, of the state and of the country.

12.  This is the beauty of a democratic polity that we must appreciate. I am glad to see that this philosophy has such an instinctive acceptance in Mizoram. Please keep it up.

 13.  In a short while, I will leave Aizawl and Mizoram. I am reluctant to go as the charm and warmth of the people of the state and the loving reception that I have received here have really touched my emotions. In particular, I was very struck by the friendly, easy-going and yet disciplined manner in which people of the city lined up to greet me as I drove from the helipad yesterday. Some of the lovely smiles I saw are still fresh in my memory. I promise to come back. 

14.  And before I conclude, I would like to convey to all the members of the House, as well as to the officers and staff of the Assembly, the security persons deployed here, and of course all your families -- and indeed all the people of Mizoram – my best wishes for the upcoming Festive Season. 

 

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in advance. May all our dreams for Mizoram come true!

 

Thank you                     

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated housing complexes for economically weaker sections under Basic Services to Urban Poor (BSUP) schemes of Government of Mizoram in Aizawl, today (November 29, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that housing for all as well as planning for our urban population, which is growing by the day, is a challenge not just for Mizoram but for the entire country. It is the focus of flagship programmes of the government of India. The meeting of certain milestones in housing for the poor and in building urban infrastructure will help us achieve the goals of New India by 2022, when we complete 75 years as a independent nation. And New India is simply not possible without New Mizoram. 

The President said that there is a vitality to Mizo society that is commendable. This state is a role model for the world in terms of peaceful resolution of political disputes. The Mizo Accord of 1986 has been honoured by all sides, and an insurgency situation ended with all stake-holders agreeing to work peacefully for the greater common good of the state and its people. This is a miracle of our times. It gives us an insight into Mizo society – a society of honourable men and women. He congratulated all the people of Mizoram, including the Church and its affiliated organisations, the youth and women’s groups, civil society groups and political parties, for this spirit of fraternity and cooperation. 

The President said that the Indian economy is today among the fastest growing in the world. From innovation in agriculture to the digital economy, from manufacturing to the expanding services sector – there are so many good news stories. Young people from Mizoram are very much part of the story. In the IT industry, the hospitality industry and other service sector industries, Mizo boys and girls are making their mark in different corners of the country. And their work is drawing admiration for Mizoram. There is admiration for the education and literacy skills of young Mizos. A literacy rate of 91 per cent – as per the 2011 census – is truly remarkable. There is also admiration for the values, work ethic and professionalism of young men and women from Mizoram. 

The President said that we have a lot of hope in the young people of Mizoram. They will build Mizoram’s future and India’s future. And they are the risk takers, the entrepreneurs and job creators who will shape our destiny. The need is to create more opportunities within Mizoram itself. Like the rest of the Northeast, Mizoram is key to India’s Act East Policy. Trade will grow and to everybody’s benefit. 

The President noted that Mizoram has so much to offer. Harnessed appropriately, bamboo can be a wonder crop. With value addition, it can be used to create a variety of products and many, many jobs. Horticulture is another area with huge potential. Mizoram grows pineapples and exotic fruit such as passion fruit. These deserve a much wider market. And they deserve a thriving food processing industry locally, which can combine technology with the amazing traditional skills of the Mizo people.

	This is my first visit to Mizoram after becoming President of India. I am truly glad that my first event here is so meaningful to the lives of some of our most deprived fellow citizens – and that I am inaugurating Housing Complexes for Economically Weaker Sections under Basic Services for Urban Poor Schemes. I commend the efforts of the State Government and Chief Minister Pu Lal Thanhawla.


 


	Housing for all as well as planning for our urban population, which is growing by the day, is a challenge not just for Mizoram but for the entire country. It is the focus of flagship programmes of the government of India. The meeting of certain milestones in housing for the poor and in building urban infrastructure will help us achieve the goals of New India by 2022, when we complete 75 years as a independent nation. And New India is simply not possible without New Mizoram.


 


	There is a vitality to Mizo society that is commendable. This state is a role model for the world in terms of peaceful resolution of political disputes. The Mizo Accord of 1986 has been honoured by all sides, and an insurgency situation ended with all stake-holders agreeing to work peacefully for the greater common good of the state and its people. This is a miracle of our times. It gives us an insight into Mizo society – a society of honourable men and women. And I should say very strong-minded women. Women who are held up as a cherished example in other parts of our country.


 


	I congratulate all the people of Mizoram, including the Church and its affiliated organisations, the youth and women’s groups, civil society groups and political parties, for this spirit of fraternity and cooperation. Our endeavour must now be to take it forward. And to enhance economic opportunities for the talented young men and women of Mizoram.


 


	The Indian economy is today among the fastest growing in the world. From innovation in agriculture to the digital economy, from manufacturing to the expanding services sector – there are so many good news stories. Young people from Mizoram are very much part of the story. In the IT industry, the hospitality industry and other service sector industries, Mizo boys and girls are making their mark in different corners of the country.


 


	And their work is drawing admiration for Mizoram. There is admiration for the education and literacy skills of young Mizos. A literacy rate of 91 per cent – as per the 2011 census – is truly remarkable. There is also admiration for the values, work ethic and professionalism of young men and women from Mizoram.

	The need is to create more opportunities within Mizoram itself. Like the rest of the Northeast, Mizoram is key to India’s Act East Policy. This will link our Northeastern states to our neighbours in Southeast Asia as well as to other parts of India. That is why the government of India is focusing on infrastructure and connectivity projects in the region. Trade will grow and to everybody’s benefit.


 


	Mizoram has so much to offer. Harnessed appropriately, bamboo can be a wonder crop. With value addition, it can be used to create a variety of products and many, many jobs. Horticulture is another area with huge potential. Mizoram grows pineapples and exotic fruit such as passion fruit. These deserve a much wider market. And they deserve a thriving food processing industry locally, which can combine technology with the amazing traditional skills of the Mizo people. Fisheries is another sunrise sector. Mizo products can flood distant markets.


 


	I am told the state government has undertaken two programmes that have led to appreciable outcomes – the New Land Use Policy and the New Economic Development Policy.


 


	Under the New Land Use Policy the government is providing financial support to less-advantaged sections that seek to move away from shifting cultivation or jhoom cultivation and get into sustainable agriculture, horticulture, sericulture, animal husbandry or other livelihoods.


 


	The New Economic Development Policy is a long-term growth strategy for Mizoram. It has been formulated after the shift in fiscal federalism following the government of India’s implementation of the report of the 14th Finance Commission. This has transferred more tax revenues to the states. Along with the Act East Policy, it opens up opportunities for the state government and the people of Mizoram. In particular, I am encouraged by the efforts to promote entrepreneurship in Mizoram.


 

Friends


	We have a lot of hope in the young people of Mizoram. They will build Mizoram’s future and India’s future. And they are the risk takers, the entrepreneurs and job creators who will shape our destiny.


 


	Young Mizos are our sporting heroes. From hockey to mountaineering, boxing to weight-lifting, Mizos excel nationally and internationally. Of course in football, our Mizo boys and girls are special. In 2011, Mizoram got its first all-weather artificial turf football ground. Within two years, in 2013, the state team had won the Santosh Trophy. In 2015, it won the gold medal in the football event of the National Games.


 


	And just this year, in April 2017, Aizawl Football Club became the first Northeast club to win the I-League. These are great achievements. I am confident Mizoram’s young people can replicate the energy of football in the economy and in entrepreneurship.


 


	On that optimistic note, I will conclude. But before I do, I must wish everybody here a happy and prosperous Festive Season and a Merry Christmas. May you and your families always know joy!


 

God bless you all

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the closing ceremony of centenary celebrations of the Bose Institute in Kolkata today (November 29, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Bose Institute occupies a unique and exalted position in the landscape of Indian science. This was one of the earliest scientific institutes to be established in the country. It has served the cause of science and served the cause of India. It has contributed much to research in the biological and physical sciences. At the same time, this Institute has had a very active social outreach programme in rural Bengal through its rural bio-technology initiative. It has also been pursuing educational uplift programmes for school children in various states of the Northeast. Truly, it is making an honest effort to spread the culture of science and innovation down to the grassroots of our society.

The President said that Bengal was one of India’s earliest industrial and manufacturing economies. With that legacy, and with its educational institutions, it should have led the IT revolution in our country. But for whatever reason, it was a slow starter in IT and IT-enabled services. That boom moved to other states, such as those in the south of our country. Now Bengal has another chance. We are in the midst of an explosion of digital technologies. Cutting-edge disciplines like precision manufacture and bio-informatics are changing the way we work. And robotics is changing the way we live.

The President said that all this throws up great opportunities for Bengal, for Bengal’s science, and for Bengal’s talented pool of young scientists. Our greatest tribute to Acharya J.C. Bose would be to embrace this new era of innovation and discovery – just as he embraced and led the process of innovation and discovery a century ago.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the scientific community of Kolkata at a Vigyan Chintan event organised at Raj Bhavan, Kolkata today (November 28, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in its essence, science is about human fascination and curiosity. It is about that endless quest for new frontiers. For thousands of years, from the age of Aryabhatta and Charaka, India has embraced science and its sense of inquiry. Science has been our intellectual trigger as well as our force multiplier. In modern times Kolkata and Bengal have been central to this process. Today the challenge is to widen that culture to other geographies, both within the state and outside. As well as to deepen that culture by incubating a society that understands, encourages and embraces innovation – down from our leading scientific institutions to our schools and our educational system. 

The President said that there is truly something special about Bengal. Pointing out the fact that IISc, Bengaluru was started after Swami Vivekandnda’s request to Jamsetji Tata set up a world-class science research institution in our country, he stated that on this soil even a Swami devoted to spiritualism can have a sensitive appreciation for – and a fascination for – modern science. 

The President said that to this day, young students from Bengal, young science graduates and scientists, young engineers and technologists, contribute so much to the furthering of science and of knowledge. They do so all over the country and all over the world. It is important to harness that scientific talent pool in Bengal for the good of Bengal itself. And to once more convert Kolkata into the tech hub of India that it was a century ago, or even 50 years ago. 

The President appreciated the commitment of scientists to the nation. He said that they are true nation builders and have a major responsibility for the realisation of New India – an India that will achieve certain developmental milestones by 2022. New India cannot be achieved without New Bengal. And neither New India nor New Bengal can be achieved without the scientific community here contributing in strong measure. 

Tomorrow, the President will visit the birthplace of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore at Jorasanko and Netaji Bhawan in Kolkata. He will also address the closing ceremony of the centenary celebrations of the Bose Institute in Kolkata and visit the Ramakrishna Mission and Math at Belur before leaving Kolkata for Mizoram.

1.      It gives me great pleasure to be at this special gathering of the scientific community of Kolkata and to interact with and learn from some of our country’s finest intellectual minds. I am happy to know about your work and future plans. 

 

2.      In many senses, I am in a city that has been the capital of modern Indian science. As far back as 1876, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science was set up by Dr Mahendra Lal Sircar in Kolkata. As the name suggests, it was felt that there was a need to cultivate and promote the spirit of science and inquiry among Indians.

 

3.      In subsequent years, this city contributed many illustrious names to our galaxy of scientists and technologists. J.C. Bose and S.N. Bose and Meghnad Saha are household names across India. C.V. Raman worked here in Kolkata and won the Nobel Prize for his findings and discoveries. In the 19thcentury, the brilliant mathematician Radhanath Sikdar was the first to measure the height of Mount Everest. But he was denied the credit by the then colonial government.

 

4.      And Bengal’s scientists did not just confine themselves to the laboratory. The chemist Acharya P.C. Ray was an ardent nationalist who used his knowledge to set up the first Indian-owned pharmaceutical company – Bengal Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals. A few weeks ago, I visited Bengaluru and had a similar interaction with scientists at the Indian Institute of Science in that city. I learnt that the Indian Institute of Science was started after Bengal’s very own Swami Vivekananda requested Jamsetji Tata to set up a world-class science research institution in our country.

 

5.      There is truly something special about Bengal. On this soil even a Swami devoted to spiritualism can have a sensitive appreciation for – and a fascination for – modern science.

 

6.      To this day, young students from Bengal, young science graduates and scientists, young engineers and technologists, contribute so much to the furthering of science and of knowledge. They do so all over the country and all over the world. It is important to harness that scientific talent pool in Bengal for the good of Bengal itself. And to once more convert Kolkata into the tech hub of India that it was a century ago, or even 50 years ago.

 

7.      I appreciate the commitment of scientists to the nation. You make India proud. I can say without doubt that you are true nation builders and have a major responsibility for the realisation of New India – an India that will achieve certain developmental milestones by 2022. New India cannot be achieved without New Bengal. And neither New India nor New Bengal can be achieved without the scientific community here contributing in strong measure.

 

8.      And yet, I would not want to confine the excitement of science to the narrow achievement of developmental goals – whether in healthcare or sanitation, agriculture or renewable energy.

 

9.      In its essence, science is about human fascination and curiosity. It is about that endless quest for new frontiers. For thousands of years, from the age of Aryabhatta and Charaka, India has embraced science and its sense of inquiry. Science has been our intellectual trigger as well as our force multiplier.

 

10.  In modern times Kolkata and Bengal have been central to this process. Today the challenge is to widen that culture to other geographies, both within the state and outside. As well as to deepen that culture by incubating a society that understands, encourages and embraces innovation – down from our leading scientific institutions to our schools and our educational system.

 

11.  After listening to all of you today, I am confident we are on the right track. To borrow the words of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, we can look forward to a dynamic era when it will be said: “What Bengal innovates today, India innovates tomorrow!”

 

12.  Thank you all for making excellent presentations. I am sure after this interaction you will go back both energised and determined to do more. I wish you and your colleagues the very best in your endeavours to achieve excellence and contribute to nation building. 

 

Thank you

Jai Hind

1. Thank you for this warm welcome and this truly passionate reception in the city of Kolkata. This is my first visit to Bengal as President of India, and I am absolutely glad to be here – in this glorious state and this lovely city. In this City with a Heart!

 

2. I am not a stranger to Bengal. I have been visiting the state and I have been coming to Kolkata for decades now. I would say I have long been an admirer of Bengal and its culture and its history. In fact, there are few people anywhere in our country who have not been touched by Bengal or by some creation of Bengal. Somehow, in some manner, this state has touched every Indian and enriched the life of every Indian. Every Indian child has grown up on stories about Bengal or written in Bengal.

 

3. Bengal has been central to our national identity. Our national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, was written on the soil of Bengal by the Nobel Laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. Gurudeb ke pronam korte jabo Tomorrow morning, I plan to visit Jorasanko, Gurudev’s ancestral home, to pay my heartfelt tributes.

 

4. Our national song, Vande Mataram, a rallying cry for our freedom fighters, was composed by Maharishi Bankim Chandra Chatterjee as early as the 19th century. And our beloved slogan Jai Hind was given to us by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a great son of Bengal and a leader who is cherished, remembered and missed to this day in all parts of our country.

 

5. A few days ago, I had the honour of visiting the Indian National Army Memorial in Moirang in Manipur. This is where freedom fighters of the INA, inspired by Netaji, raised the national flag for the first time on Indian soil. It was a very moving moment for me.

 

6. These three – Gurudev Rabindranath, Maharishi Bankim and Netaji Subhas – were instrumental in defining our nationalism. Our freedom came faster because of the energy they gave our people.

 

7. During the course of my visit here I plan to visit Netaji Bhawan, where I understand there is a memorial and research centre dedicated to the life and work of Netaji.

 

8. I am also travelling to Belur to pay my respects to two other illustrious sons of Bengal who have contributed so much to our national life – Ramakrishna Paramhansa and his finest disciple, Swami Vivekananda. In their own manner, they rediscovered our ancient Indian ethos not only for us in India – but for the world. Swamiji was among our earliest modern cultural ambassadors. His work lives on through the Ramakrishna Mission. This institution has been instrumental in our nation building process.

 

Friends

9. Our nation building owes so much to Bengal and the sacrifices and achievements of the people of this land. A galaxy of revolutionary heroes from Bengal helped us get Independence, each doing his or her little bit, quietly, without seeking any reward. Young Khudiram Bose went to the gallows with a smile and with the dream of a free India in his eyes. The elderly but determined Matangini Hazra was shot by the colonial police. She died with Vande Mataram on her lips and the hopes of our motherland in her heart.

 

10. The Bengal Famine of the 1940s was a man-made disaster inflicted on innocent people by a diabolical imperial government. It remains one of the greatest tragedies in human history. Bengal suffered that tragedy with fortitude. Every Indian felt Bengal’s pain.

 

11. A quarter-century later, Bengal embraced refugees escaping from a brutal military crackdown in what was then East Pakistan. It generously shared whatever little it had with those who had run away from oppression, and had lost everything. We can never forget that. The world can never forget that. It is not for nothing that I called Kolkata a City with a Heart. And Bengalis a People with a Heart!

 

12. A people with a heart and a people with a mind, I should say. A number of our pioneering women leaders were from Bengal – perhaps the most famous of them being Sarojini Chattopadhyay, who became Sarojini Naidu after her marriage. So many of our foundational social reform movements began here – from the times of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and later Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who set up among the first institutions for women’s education.

 

13. And in education, we cannot forget the contribution of that remarkable father and son, Ashutosh Mukherjee and Shyamaprasad Mukherjee. Or in the field of law, the humanism of that upholder of justice, the jurist Radha Binod Pal. He is still recalled with affection in Japan for his sympathy for ordinary men, women and children who had suffered the horrors of two nuclear bombs.

 

14. In recent times, another illustrious son of Bengal, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, served the nation at the highest level as President of India.  We all refer to him affectionately as Pranab Da. 

 

15. Tomorrow morning, I am visiting the Jagadish Chandra Bose Institute. It is celebrating its centenary and renewing the learning of the scientist-scholar it is named after. J.C Bose, S.N. Bose, Meghnad Saha – where would Indian science and technology be without Bengal? Where would our literature be without the novels of Sarat Chandra and the poetry of Nazrul? And where would our cinema be without the mastery of Satyajit Ray? Aar Uttom Kumar ke kaeyu bhoolte pare ki?

 

16. I have mentioned only a handful of the innumerable men and women of history and of stature that Bengal has produced. If I were to list all of them, I would be speaking for a few hours, and not a few minutes. So great is our Bengal’s legacy.

 

Friends

17. Bengal has a great history – but it is for each one of us to ensure that Bengal also has a great future. This state was an early industrial and manufacturing centre in our country. Its economy must sing again in this age of digital and robotic technologies. Its green fields and hard-working farmers must be equipped with the latest agricultural knowledge to allow them to realise their potential.

 

18. In 2022, India will be celebrating 75 years as a free country. This will be an occasion to reach certain developmental milestones for our people, and to create a better India. For this, we need to invoke the same idealism and fervour that contributed to our freedom movement. Bengal was one of the leaders of our freedom movement. It must lead this effort for a better India by 2022.

 

19. As you know the Government of India has embarked on an ambitious Act East Policy. This involves building connectivity projects and taking economic initiatives. These will be of mutual benefit to our eastern and Northeastern states as well as to neighbouring countries. The people of Bengal are crucial to this programme.

 

20. Being a border state gives Bengal certain advantages. It also gives it certain responsibilities. Forces of radicalism and extremism, some of them with cross-border linkages, seek to take advantage of our democratic spaces. We must guard against this.

 

Friends

21. As I conclude, I must thank you again for this warm reception, which has really touched my heart. Khub hi bhalo laglo  I would like to thank the Chief Minister and government of Bengal – and most of all the people of Bengal – for this reception. I will always remember it with affection. In particular, I would like to thank the children present here. They are the future of Bengal and of India. I wish them great success.

 

22. And I promise to come back again – to come back to Bengal and to come back to Kolkata, the city of mishti, adda and football.

 

23. Recently the Under-17 Football World Cup was played in our country. Kolkata hosted many of the matches, including the final. Some of you may have watched the matches in the stadium. You played perfect hosts. And you did all of us proud. Many congratulations.

 

24. May the success of the World Cup inspire your efforts in other directions as well!

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                 I extend a warm welcome to all of you at the Distinguished Indologist Award Ceremony.  It is indeed a privilege for me to address this august gathering of eminent scholars and personalities. 

         

2.   A few centuries ago, people from different walks of life came together to delve deep into India’s ancient past. And so, Indology was born. Scholars the world over have continued to study this academic tradition to understand Indian civilisation and its ancient heritage. The Distinguished Indologist Award is a befitting recognition to all scholarly works, past and present, to discover the deeper essence of Indian thought and expression.  I compliment the Indian Council for Cultural Relations for this initiative. 

  

Ladies and Gentlemen,

3.         I am delighted to have conferred the third Distinguished Indologist Award on Professor Hiroshi Marui of Japan. That I did so with Lord Buddha blessing us from behind would perhaps make it even more special. Professor Hiroshi Marui has spent over forty years working on Indian philosophy and Buddhist Studies. His many acclaimed publications and research papers are considered final authority on several subjects the world over. As the President of Japanese Association of Indian and Buddhist Studies, he has made significant contribution to propagate Indology amongst the youth in Japan. I congratulate him for receiving this prestigious award and warmly thank him for his exemplary contribution to Indology.

 

4.         It is a matter of great satisfaction for us that the third Distinguished Indology Award has been conferred on a scholar from Japan, a country with which we have had cross-flow of ideas, art, literature and religious philosophy for ages. These have led to deep spiritual affinity and   cultural understanding between the two peoples.

 

5.   We have illuminating accounts of Japanese scholars, Kibi-no-Makibi and Kōbō Daishi, who are credited for evolving the kana syllabary, having studied Sanskrit from Indian scholars. This could have led to similarities that we see between Devanagari and Japanese syllabary. There are other similarities to be noted too; the sentence in Japanese language is arranged in the same order as in Sanskrit – subject (karta), followed by object (karm), and then the verb (kriya).  This intermingling impacted us as well. With Okakura Tenshin and his association with Swami Vivekananda and Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, a new chapter unfolded in Indo-Japanese understanding. Japan’s success in modernising itself while keeping its traditional values intact had deeply impressed both. 

 

6.  Today, when India-Japan relations have acquired a higher salience, Indology and the works of Professor Hiroshi Marui and his fellow scholars have become even more meaningful.  

 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

7.         Indology is the study of India, its multifaceted and ancient culture and civilization. It is fascinating how the cross-currents of time in the 17th -18th century led to deep interest among Western scholars to study Sanskrit and ancient Indian texts. Universities in Europe and Orientalists in India sought solace in Upanishadic thought and admired the literary sophistication of Shakuntalam. Monier Williams and others saw in Ramayana and Mahabharata the clue to the Indian mind and ethos.   Max Muller, the great Indologist, said and I quote: “If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered over the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant, I should point to India”.

 

8.   Spiritual leaders and social reformers, from Swami Vivekanand to Raja Rammohan Roy, delved deep into the writings of Indologists and reminded Indians of their ancient heritage. The Indologists brought a new consciousness in India that ignited self pride. They became a bridge between India and the western world. This also encouraged many Indian scholars to take up Indology.  

 

9.         Indian culture and its many attributes have evolved over centuries.  The depth of time has given it a unique strength and character. It is integral and holistic, synthetic and accommodating.  That is why it could survive the onslaughts of time and transcend the limits of space.  Indian-ness is characterized by inclusive pluralism; it is rooted in the principle of DHARMO RAKSHATI RAKSHITAH that is - Dharma or the virtuous order, which when protected, protects all without exclusion.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

10.    Today, we all live as a global community.  There is greater need for mutual understanding. New ideas are shaping our daily lives. People and policy makers are looking for options to make living more sustainable, one where we have a symbiotic relationship with nature and ecology around us. We are delving deep into our traditional knowledge and ancient wisdom to share with the humankind the best of our achievements.  India is doing its best to explain the virtues of Yoga and Ayurveda for the well-being of humanity. Likewise, other nations and societies are making efforts to revive their traditional cultural expressions.  In such a scenario, Indology assumes greater significance to promote better undertaking between peoples and to share what India has to offer to humankind.  


11.       Indologists over generations have helped in a deeper understanding of India’s history and civilisation. We are truly grateful to Professor Hiroshi Marui for his contribution to Indology.   I am confident that such endeavours will lead to a greater interest in not only study and research of classical Indology but also study of India in all its aspects.

 

12.       With these words, I would like to once again congratulate Professor Hiroshi Marui.  I wish him all success in his future endeavours.   

Origato

 

Thank you

JAI HIND!

                General Duty Medical Officers (GDMOs) of the 2nd Foundation Course, conducted by the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (November 27, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the medical officers, the President said that the disease burden in our country is undergoing change. We have to tackle Communicable diseases such as TB, Malaria and Dengue and at the same time deal with the rising incidence of Non-Communicable diseases. To address these shifting health priorities, the Government has after more than a decade come up with a revised National Health Policy. It outlines new and innovative ways to provide affordable healthcare for all. 

The President said that the goal of universal health coverage is a priority for our Government. The implementation of the National Health Mission critically depends on commitment of the medical fraternity. This needs effective governance at the community, village and district levels. He stated that while health may be a core concern for them, they have an equally important role to play in the socio-economic progress of the country. Several key Government initiatives such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Swachh Bharat need their support and service. 

The President advised doctors to actively listen to their patients and their concerns, as simply listening to the patients for a couple of minutes can bring psychological benefits to them and aid in the recovery process.

                I warmly welcome you to Rashtrapati Bhawan. I am delighted to meet you. 

As Doctors and Health practitioners you have a seminal role to play in nation building. You represent the life-line of this nation. You are responsible for keeping us healthy and fit.

We as a country have made rapid progress in many fields. These have led to several options for doctors and health administrators. But you have chosen to join the Government, which means you have chosen to serve the country, to make a difference to people’s lives.

Ideeply respect your decision. Our society places high faith in you and your noble profession.  I am sure you will reciprocate their faith with committed service, always being compassionate and sensitive to the poor and the needy. 

The task ahead for you is challenging. Our disease burden remains high. Coupled with it we have issues of delivery, access to services and affordability.  But with dedication, drive and determination, we can achieve our goals.

During your long career ahead, you will be performing many roles in the health field.  You will be involved in health care delivery, in administering and leading projects, and at times providing policy inputs.

I am happy that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has started the Foundation Training Programme for the General Duty Medical Officers of the Central Health Service to equip them deal with multiple roles. And I congratulate the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare for successfully conducting this Programme.

The goal of universal health coverage is a priority for our government. The implementation of the National Health Mission critically depends on your commitment. This needs effective governance at the community, village and district levels.

The disease burden in our country is undergoing change. We have to tackle Communicable diseases such as TB, Malaria and Dengue, and at the same time deal with the rising incidence of Non-Communicable diseases.

To address these shifting health priorities, the Government hasafter more than a decade come up with a revised National Health Policy. It outlines new and innovative ways to provide affordable healthcare for all.  I expect that all of you will give your best to make it a success. 

Over the years, our health initiatives have led to significant improvements in the health status of the country. To name a few, we have eradicated Polio, made marked improvement in Immunization coverage, and  brought down the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Total Fertility Rate (TFR].

Young Officers,

Our country is making rapid economic progress. Health and socio-economic indicators must gallop along with it. 

While health may be a core concern for you, you have an equally important role to play in the socio-economic progress of the country. Several key Government initiatives such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Swachh Bharat need your support and service.

The adverse Male to Female sex ratio is a major cause of concern.  Undernutrition and Malnutrition remains an area where we have a lot more to do.

I would also suggest that you should take a preventive approach to health rather than solely a curative one. In this context, integrating our traditional systems of medicine – AYUSH- into our healthcare system must be a priority. 

As young and bright minds, you must engage in research and innovation and see how best we can use our scientific and human resources for the benefit of all.

Digital Technology combined with Aadhar and Mobile telephony can work wonders for health care. Our E-Aushadhi programme is on course. Tele-medicine is another effective technology intervention which we must put to greater use.

The Global community at the United Nations in 2015 adopted a menu of Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs]. Health challenges form an important part of it. The SDGs have been dove-tailed in our national development programmes. And for India to achieve them, we have to do exceedingly well on the health front.

Young Officers, there is high expectation from you. I am sure you will serve the country with a deep sense of commitment. I wish you all success in your career ahead.

Jai Hind.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the International Ambedkar Conclave, organised by the Forum of SC and ST Legislators and Parliamentarians, today (November 27, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President noted with appreciation that Dr B.R. Ambedkar had attained senior public positions and acclaim on the basis of his extraordinary educational achievements, despite facing conditions of deprivation and inequality. Dr Ambedkar made unique contributions towards building a modern society in India, emphasising the struggle for social rights in public life. 

The President said that the Constitution, of which Dr Ambedkar is considered the Chief Architect, has given our democracy a strong framework. And yet it is also flexible so that it can be amended according to the needs of the times. The Constitution provides us the way to fulfil hopes of all sections of people in the world’s largest democracy. 

The President emphasised the necessity of working within the purview of the Constitution and the rule of law. The President noted that Dr Ambedkar had said that the basis of the success of any constitution is not just its text. The success of the Constitution depends on the people and political parties, which are used by the people as instruments for the achievement of their aspirations and priorities.

                 The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Constitution Day celebrations, organised by the Supreme Court to mark the anniversary of the adoption of our Constitution on November 26, 1949, today (November 26, 2017) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that our Constitution is not static but is a living document. The Constituent Assembly was conscious that the Constitution would need to be interwoven with new threads. In a dynamic world, this would be the best way to serve the people and the nation as a whole. As such, over the years, many amendments have been carried out to the Constitution by Parliament. 

The President said that the Constitution is not just an abstract ideal. It has to be made meaningful to the lives of ordinary people in every street, every village and every mohalla of our country. It has to somehow connect with their everyday existence and make it more comfortable. 

The President said that at the heart of the constitutional project was trust – trust in each other, trust between institutions, trust in the goodness of fellow citizens, and trust in the wisdom of future generations. This sense of trust is inherent in constitutional governance. When the Government trusts citizens to attest their documents themselves, it is in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution. When the Union government trusts state governments by devolving financial powers to them, and taking ahead the mission of cooperative federalism, then too we are working in the spirit of the Constitution. 

The President said that our Constitution framers realised that a Constitution, no matter how well written and how detailed, would have little meaning without the right people to implement it and to live by its values. And in this, they placed their faith in generations that would follow. The Constitution empowers the people as much as the people empower the Constitution. When individuals and institutions ask what the Constitution has done for them and how it has built their capacities – they must also consider what they have done to uphold the Constitution. And what they have done to support its value system. The Constitution is ‘We, the People’ as much as ‘We, the People’ are the Constitution. 

The President said that our Constitution builds a superstructure of political, economic and social democracy. This superstructure rests on three principles or pillars: liberty, equality and fraternity. It is critical to keep this intricate and delicate balance in mind when exploring the relationship between the three branches of the state – that is, the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. They are all equal. They should all be conscious of their liberty and strive to protect their autonomy. And yet, they should be careful not to disturb the fraternity of the separation of powers by even unknowingly intruding into the domain of either of the two other branches. Sobriety and discretion in communication between the three branches is also extremely advisable. This will promote and enhance fraternity between three equal branches of the state, all of which have a certain responsibility to the Constitution. 

The President said that our fundamental commitment must continue to be to take the values of our Constitution – and the fruits of our social, economic and political development – to the very grassroots of our society. For this we must make constant efforts to raise standards of subordinate institutions and bring them at par with apex institutions in all spheres. 

The President received the first copies of books – ‘The Constitution at 67’ and ‘Indian Judiciary: Annual Report 2016-17’ from the Chief Justice of India, Mr Justice Dipak Misra.

                1.      I am happy to be here this morning on the occasion of Constitution Day, which marks the anniversary of the adoption of our Constitution on November 26, 1949. This is a moment to recall the men and women of the Constituent Assembly who completed the monumental task of drafting a Constitution for independent India. They produced a fine document, handwritten in 90,000 words, which continues to be our guiding light.

 

2.      A key role in this exercise was played by Babasaheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar, the chair of the Drafting Committee, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1990. In 2015, in honour of Dr Ambedkar’s 125thbirth anniversary, the Government of India began to observe November 26 as Constitution Day.

 

3.      Since 1979, the Supreme Court has observed this day as National Law Day. From 2016, it decided to celebrate it with a Constitution Day Lecture to be delivered each year by an eminent jurist. The first such lecture was delivered by Mr Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah. Today, we had the opportunity to hear Mr Justice R. C. Lahoti, former Chief Justice of India. I am also glad to have received the first copies of two books – The Constitution at 67 and Indian Judiciary: Annual Report 2016-17. I compliment the Supreme Court for publishing them.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen

4.      Perhaps the most remarkable feature about our Constitution is that its philosophy is everlasting – but its structure and clauses are flexible. Our Constitution framers were enlightened and far-sighted enough to give future generations the power to amend and change clauses as may be needed with the times.

 

5.      Our Constitution is not static but is a living document. The Constituent Assembly was conscious that the Constitution would need to be interwoven with new threads. In a dynamic world, this would be the best way to serve the people and the nation as a whole. As such, over the years, many amendments have been carried out to the Constitution by Parliament.

 

6.      The Constituent Assembly comprised men and women of unparalleled vision. They sought to draft a Constitution that was defined by a noble and expansive philosophy – rather than being a rigid document. The members of the Constituent Assembly ensured that there are checks and balances in the democratic system with appropriate roles for the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. This allows them to function independently but with accountability.

 

7.      As for the citizens of our country, in whom sovereignty is ultimately vested, the Constituent Assembly was of the firm belief that they have a claim to Fundamental and Constitutional Rights. And yet they also have obligations towards the nation and society, including but not limited to Fundamental Duties. 

 

8.      At the heart of the constitutional project was trust – trust in each other, trust between institutions, trust in the goodness of fellow citizens, and trust in the wisdom of future generations.

 

9.      This sense of trust is inherent in constitutional governance. When the Government trusts citizens to attest their documents themselves, it is in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution. When the Union government trusts state governments by devolving financial powers to them, and taking ahead the mission of cooperative federalism, then too we are working in the spirit of the Constitution.

 

10.  Our Constitution framers realised that a Constitution, no matter how well written and how detailed, would have little meaning without the right people to implement it and to live by its values. And in this, they placed their faith in generations that would follow.

 

11.  As Dr Ambedkar told the Assembly in his concluding speech on November 25, 1949, “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good, if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution.”

 

12.  The Constitution empowers the people as much as the people empower the Constitution. When individuals and institutions ask what the Constitution has done for them and how it has built their capacities – they must also consider what they have done to uphold the Constitution. And what they have done to support its value system.  The Constitution strengthens us, but we too strengthen the Constitution with our actions every day. To borrow the opening words of the Preamble, it could be said that the Constitution is ‘We, the People’ as much as ‘We, the People’ are the Constitution.

 

13.  Our Constitution builds a superstructure of political, economic and social democracy. This superstructure rests on three principles or pillars: liberty, equality and fraternity. Dr Ambedkar had cautioned that these principles are not to be treated as separate and unrelated. As he said, [I QUOTE] “Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things.” [UNQUOTE]

 

14.  It is critical to keep this intricate and delicate balance in mind when exploring the relationship between the three branches of the state – that is, the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. They are all equal. They should all be conscious of their liberty and strive to protect their autonomy. And yet, they should be careful not to disturb the fraternity of the separation of powers by even unknowingly intruding into the domain of either of the two other branches.

 

15.  Sobriety and discretion in communication between the three branches is also extremely advisable. This will promote and enhance fraternity between three equal branches of the state, all of which have a certain responsibility to the Constitution. It will also reassure the ordinary citizen that the Constitution is safe – and in mature hands. And that the three branches are fulfilling their obligations in accordance with the spirit of the Constituent Assembly.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen

16.  Our fundamental commitment must continue to be to take the values of our Constitution – and the fruits of our social, economic and political development – to the very grassroots of our society. For this we must make constant efforts to raise standards of subordinate institutions and bring them at par with apex institutions in all spheres.

 

17.  There should no doubt be emphasis on Ministries and Departments of the Union government – but also on how our constitutional project is being taken forward by village and block-level institutions. The legislative sanctity of Parliament is important. But so is that of every gram panchayat. And this must demand attention from each one of us.

 

18.  Perhaps the greatest challenge is before the higher judiciary. It is in its mandate to bring justice closer to the people. To cite an example I have given earlier, High Courts need to take up the task of quickly providing certified translated copies of judgements in local and regional languages. Even the hearings in court, if possible,  have to be in a language that is understandable to the ordinary litigant. The process of case disposal too has to be made faster.

 

19.  It is upon the higher judiciary to mentor and encourage the lower judiciary. In this, the cooperation of state governments is very much necessary. It is for state governments to ensure that the district and subordinate court judges are not denied their due perquisites and facilities. And it is for the High Courts to urge subordinate courts to be more efficient and conclude cases faster. I appreciate that this concern is close to the heart of the Chief Justice and the other Judges of the Supreme Court.

 

20.  I am glad to note some High Courts are taking steps in these directions. As of June 30, 2017, there were about 76,000 old cases, pending for five years or more, in sessions and district courts under the High Court of Jharkhand. The High Court has set a target of March 31, 2018, to dispose of almost half these cases. 

 

21.  In a related manner, the High Court of Chhattisgarh has set subordinate courts a deadline of April 30, 2018, for disposal of cases pending for over 10 years. And of September 30, 2018, for disposal of cases pending for between five and 10 years. The High Court of Chhattisgarh has also started to make provision for availability of Hindi versions of judgements and orders.

 

22.  I commend these initiatives. I am sure other High Courts are also moving ahead with a similar sense of public service.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen

23.  The Constitution is not just an abstract ideal. It has to be made meaningful to the lives of ordinary people in every street, every village and every mohalla of our country. It has to somehow connect with their everyday existence and make it more comfortable.

 

24.  As Mahatma Gandhi told us, in every decision we take, every measure we consider, we must ask ourselves if what we are about to do will be of use and benefit to the poorest and weakest person we have met. And in some manner restore to this person control over his or her destiny.

 

25.  To my mind that would be the greatest tribute to the Constitution that we are celebrating today.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the International Gita Mahotsava-2017 today (November 25, 2017) in Kurukshetra, Haryana.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the message of the Gita is relevant for all times to come. From an ancient society based on agriculture to a society based on commerce and industry, and now to a knowledge society – the message of the Gita has been everlasting. The Gita guides us in resolving the dilemmas and struggles between right and wrong that exist within every human being. “What is right and what is wrong?”, “What should we do and not do?” Answers to these questions emerge from the Gita.

The President also noted the efforts made by the people of Haryana to improve the child sex ratio in the state. He commended the Government of Haryana’s efforts in this regard. He pointed out that daughters of Haryana had excelled in a variety of fields, from politics to education, mountaineering to wrestling, and space travel to, to cite a recent example, beauty pageants. He stressed the need to encourage this process of women’s empowerment in the state.  

Earlier in the day, the President visited Brahma Sarovar and laid the foundation stone of the Gita Research Centre at the Gita Gyan Sansthanam in Kurukshetra.

                1.   I am happy to be among you today at the closing ceremony of the 42nd World Congress of the International Committee of Military Medicine (ICMM). I am told that all of you, that is, the delegates from 74 member states who participated, had excellent discussions during this conference. I congratulate the ICMM as well as the Indian Armed Forces Medical Services for conducting the Conference successfully.

 2.   For nearly a century now, the ICMM has been making a meaningful impact in the practice of military medicine across the world. The uniformed medical services deliver health care in the most trying circumstances. They truly work at the ‘cutting edge’ of the medical profession. This ‘edge’ does not sharpen overnight, but is achieved through years of perseverance and training.

 3.    Through its Regional and World Congress, ICMM provides a global platform for sharing and meaningful learning. You are able to duly address contemporary, real-time and relevant issues pertaining to Military Medicine, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, Mass Casualty Medicine and Infectious disease epidemiology including outbreaks, Medical Logistics and missions.

 4.      The medical service is an important pillar for any military. The Armed Forces Medical Services of India have been providing stellar service not only to the Armed Forces but have also been in the service of the nation both in peace and war. They are the most valuable first responders in times of natural and man-made calamities and crises and are in a perpetual state of readiness. The onus of promoting and delivering preventive, curative and rehabilitative medical care for the serving soldier and his family, including our esteemed veterans, has been carried out by the Armed Forces Medical Services with commendable professionalism.

 5.      In this context I am extremely heartened to observe the content of the deliberations which have occurred over the last 5 days at the 42nd Congress of ICMM here at New Delhi. The theme of this year’s World Congress has been appropriately kept as “Military Medicine in Transition”. The theme itself portraysboth the dynamic and evolving nature of medical science per se and the ever changing and volatile environment of the practice of military medicine, in particular. I am sure the word ‘Transition’ mentioned in the theme, refers to a continuously occurring positive change and learning based on prevalent situation.

 6.   I am told that the Conference held deliberations on emergency medicine, environmental medicine, lifestyle diseases, Mass Casualty management, Disease Outbreak response, rehabilitative medicine, and so forth. All these issues are very relevant for our citizens but particularly important for the men on ground, that is, our brave SOLDIERS.

 7.      A soldier of any country is a very valued and special citizen. His or her pledge to safeguard the country from any threat, at the peril of life, puts him or her at a special pedestal. A soldier undergoes a well-planned regimen, and in doing so, is often exposed to harsh alien environments that put physical and mental stress on the body. In a vast country like ours, our valiant forces too, face tough environmental conditions of high-altitude, glacial conditions, deserts, jungles, violent seas and the aerospace. I am sure the deliberations on the medical aspects related to these very military specific environments, would have been fruitful, owing to the varied exposure and experience of speakers.

 8.   Now, I wish to say something about the brave women who join the armed forces. Women have always, in some role or the other, been an important part of Armed Forces across the world. Different countries have different terms of engagement and employment of women in uniform. More and more countries are going forward to give them greater responsibilities. In India too, women have evolved as able soldiers in whichever arm or service they have served in.

 9.  In the field of combat medical care, historically, they have had a distinguished record as health care providers. The Indian Armed Forces Medical Services has had women adorn the uniform as Medical, Dental and Nursing Officers since our independence, and they have served and proved themselves even in extremely difficult situations, with great distinction. I am glad to note that a special panel discussion was slated in the programme, to discuss the role of a woman as a combat soldier.

 10.  In keeping with the present world scenario, it is important that we focus on two aspects of medicine; training and medical research. Both are progressive and mandated requirements of the medical profession, which help the organization and the individual to constantly grow and expand. I compliment the 42nd World Congress of the ICMM to have addressed both aspects of training as well as medical research. I am sure that your deliberations would immensely benefit the medical fraternity in uniform, but more importantly would bring positive benefits to the health and longevity of the soldiers from respective national armies.

 11.  I wish the ICMM World Congress all success in their future endeavors, assuring it of full cooperation and support from India. I once again compliment our Indian Armed Forces Medical Services for hosting this conclave.

 

Thank you.

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Northeast Development Summit in Imphal, Manipur, today (November 21, 2017).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Northeast is an amazing social and cultural ecosystem. Few regions of the world have such a wealth of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity packed into such a small area. This variety is an inspiration for all of us. The Northeast is home to some of the oldest indigenous communities in the world. It is one of our spiritual homelands. Whether it is the traditions of the Devi in Kamakhya or of Buddhism in Tawang and elsewhere, they make for a sacred bond that unites India with Southeast Asia. Christian missionaries have contributed to education in this region. And there is even a small but thriving Jewish community in Manipur and Mizoram.

The President said that the Northeast’s geographical location makes it the obvious gateway to India, linking the vast economies of the Indian subcontinent and of today’s ASEAN countries. This is the potential we have to tap. And this is the idea that must inspire this Summit.

The President said that central to the Government of India’s approach to the development of the Northeast is an urgent and speedy enhancement of connectivity. This is a multi-modal programme, across land, water and air. And it refers both to connectivity within India as well as to connectivity between India and its eastern and Southeast Asian neighbours.

The President emphasised that in the development of the Northeast is both the development of India – as well the true measure of the India-ASEAN partnership. He stated that the opportunity is before us and we should grab it.

Later in the day, the President graced and addressed the inaugural event of ‘Manipur Sangai Festival 2017’ in Imphal. 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that he was happy to inaugurate the Sangai Festivalwhich is the perfect showcase for the cultural diversity and richness of Manipur, comprising its various communities and beautiful social fabric.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Northeast Development Summit in Imphal, Manipur, today (November 21, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Northeast is an amazing social and cultural ecosystem. Few regions of the world have such a wealth of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity packed into such a small area. This variety is an inspiration for all of us. The Northeast is home to some of the oldest indigenous communities in the world. It is one of our spiritual homelands. Whether it is the traditions of the Devi in Kamakhya or of Buddhism in Tawang and elsewhere, they make for a sacred bond that unites India with Southeast Asia. Christian missionaries have contributed to education in this region. And there is even a small but thriving Jewish community in Manipur and Mizoram. 

The President said that the Northeast’s geographical location makes it the obvious gateway to India, linking the vast economies of the Indian subcontinent and of today’s ASEAN countries. This is the potential we have to tap. And this is the idea that must inspire this Summit. 

The President said that central to the Government of India’s approach to the development of the Northeast is an urgent and speedy enhancement of connectivity. This is a multi-modal programme, across land, water and air. And it refers both to connectivity within India as well as to connectivity between India and its eastern and Southeast Asian neighbours. 

The President emphasised that in the development of the Northeast is both the development of India – as well the true measure of the India-ASEAN partnership. He stated that the opportunity is before us and we should grab it. 

Later in the day, the President graced and addressed the inaugural event of ‘Manipur Sangai Festival 2017’ in Imphal. 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that he was happy to inaugurate the Sangai Festivalwhich is the perfect showcase for the cultural diversity and richness of Manipur, comprising its various communities and beautiful social fabric. The food and culture, adventure sports and crafts, handlooms and universally-admired dance forms of Manipur cannot find a more appropriate setting. Manipur’s cultural traditions, its social, religious and ethnic mosaic, and its history of courage and resilience are an inspiration for everybody in India. 

The President paid tributes to the martyrs of 1891 and said that these heroes will always be remembered for their contribution to the cause of our freedom and human liberty. For every Indian the great Bir Tikendrajit and his comrades are cherished icons. 

The President said that a favourite – not just his favourite; our favourite, the whole country’s favourite – is the magnificent Mary Kom, Manipur’s very own Olympic medallist. He recalled his tweet after she won the gold medal in the Asian Boxing Championship recently, “You make us prouder with every punch.”

	This is my first visit to Manipur as President of India and I am extremely happy to be inaugurating the Manipur Sangai Festival, which is the biggest festival of the state. Celebrated for 10 days every November since 2010, this is the perfect showcase for the cultural diversity and richness of Manipur, comprising its various communities and beautiful social fabric. The food and culture, adventure sports and crafts, handlooms and universally-admired dance forms of Manipur cannot find a more appropriate setting. 



	One can travel across the world but rarely come across a location as spectacular as Loktak Lake. I am told this is the largest freshwater lake in the Northeast, with the only floating National Park on our planet. It is a paradise for tourists and I am glad the Government is making efforts to promote the tourism potential of Manipur. Truly, this is a festival and this is a state that needs to be experienced at leisure! 



	Manipur’s cultural traditions, its social, religious and ethnic mosaic, and its history of courage and resilience are an inspiration for everybody in India. The war of 1891 saw the brave people of Manipur resisting the colonial powers in a manner that has few parallels. The martyrs of 1891 are heroes who will always be remembered for their contribution to the cause of our freedom and human liberty. For every Indian the great Bir Tikendrajit and his comrades are cherished icons. 



	About half a century later, Manipur was the unfortunate location of some of the most bitter fighting in World War II. Today, the War Memorial in Imphal and the War Cemetery serve as reminders of those times. And of the tests and trials that the people of this state have gone through. Ironically, those war relics today have international tourism potential and attract visitors from the West and from Japan. But in the 1940s, by taking the brunt of the war on its soil, Manipur in a sense protected the rest of India. Every citizen in our country is forever grateful. 


Ladies and Gentlemen


	Manipur is India’s window to Southeast Asia and a key player in our Government’s Act East Policy. As a result, there is a concentrated effort to quickly develop connectivity projects. The most prominent is of course the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway. In addition, an air cargo terminal complex is being planned at Imphal International Airport. Rail links are being enhanced. Jiribam is connected by a broad gauge line, and Imphal railway station has already been inaugurated. Finally, the regional connectivity scheme of the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation is giving a push to affordable air links in the region and particularly in Manipur. 



	I am confident that these efforts, and the partnership between the Union and state Governments, will bear fruit. The potential for tourism is immense. And the prospect of international trade, with Manipur linking the Indian economy to Myanmar and the rest of ASEAN, is unimaginably big. It is important that the benefits of such efforts reach local communities here, and provide new markets and jobs to Manipur’s farmers and handloom weavers. On my part, I must tell you that I will be returning to Delhi with enough quantities of Manipuri black rice. It is one of my favourites. 



	Another favourite – not just my favourite; our favourite, the whole country’s favourite – is the magnificent Mary Kom, Manipur’s very own Olympic medallist. As I tweeted after she won the gold medal in the Asian Boxing Championship recently, “You make us prouder with every punch.” 



	And how can we forget that Manipur is the heartland of Indian football. In the Under-17 World Cup hosted by India, our inexperienced but determined boys put up a fighting show – and eight of the 21 members of our World Cup team were from Manipur. This list included the captain Amarjit Singh Kiyam and the gallant goal-keeper Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem. The gutsy boys from Manipur won the hearts of all of India. We look forward to them achieving greater glory for the country. 



	Frankly, I would say Manipur is the capital of Indian sport. The traditional sport of Sagol Kangjei was the inspiration for modern polo. And here in Imphal is the oldest polo ground in the world. Huyen Langlon is a martial art that I believe deserves much greater international exposure. As does Yubi Lakpi, played with a greased coconut instead of a rugby ball. I have only mentioned a few of the many remarkable indigenous sports of Manipur. These are treasures that must be shared with the rest of the country and rest of the world. 



	In conclusion, I wish the Manipur Sangai Festival and all the participants here, as well as the Government and people of Manipur, every success. India takes great pride in Manipur’s cultural identity, its social diversity – and economic potential. Together all of us need to ensure that Manipur realises this potential. And that every Manipuri, whatever his or her background, benefits. We must succeed. And we will succeed. 


Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the closing ceremony of the Namami Barak festival in Silchar, Assam, today (November 20, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the geographical location of the Barak valley gives it the potential to become a hub for inter-state and international trade. Several connectivity-related initiatives have been taken to achieve this potential. The Northeastern part of the “East West Corridor” – which runs from Cachar in Assam to Kutch in Gujarat – starts from Silchar. A broad-gauge railway line, connecting Agartala to Delhi, passes through the Barak valley. All this will benefit business and tourism. 

Speaking on cross-border initiatives, the President said trade with Bangladesh is being promoted through the Border Trade Centre located in Karimganj district. India is being connected to Southeast Asia under the Act East Policy, taking advantage of the geographical location of the Northeast, including Assam. He emphasised that there is tremendous potential for growth of business and trade links between Southeast Asia and the Northeast region of India. He expressed confidence that with the development of infrastructure by Union and state Governments, this region would become a driver of international trade and commerce. 

Later in the day, the President attended a civic reception hosted at Guwahati University in Guwahati. Addressing the gathering, the President said Assam is the gateway to the Northeast region of India. He commended the state’s rich geographical, social and cultural diversity. Assam has developed industries such as oil and natural gas, tea, and silk. By building modern infrastructure, the prospects for Assam and the entire Northeast will be even greater. 

The President said that the tourism industry has immense scope in Assam. This state is already an important part of the tourist map due to the Kaziranga and Manas National Parks. He was confident that by facilitating the right ecosystem for tourism, the Government of Assam could multiply the economic and social benefits of the tourism industry.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed legislators at a special session of the Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly in Itanagar today (November 19, 2017).



Addressing the legislators, the President urged them to remember that they had been elected as members of the Legislative Assembly to achieve the aspirations of the people of the State and to render public service. After election, they represented all citizens of their constituency, including those who may not have voted for them. As legislators, they are guardians of public interest and trust. It is their responsibility to make laws that improve the lives of people and to resolve issues of public concern.

The President said that we are all citizens of a culturally rich and diverse country. There is such variety in food, clothing, customs and even religious traditions in India. And yet, this diversity is our strength and unites us. Whether it is Tirupati or Tarnetar or the Buddhist monastery of Tawang, it inspires every Indian and is a matter of pride for each of us.

The President said that Arunachal Pradesh’s experience of “unity in diversity” expresses our country's traditions beautifully. There are many ethnic and religious communities in the state, and they live together in harmony. This is an ideal for all Indians.

The President said that being a border state, Arunachal Pradesh offers a unique opportunity to trade and do business with neighbouring countries. He expressed hope that Arunachal Pradesh would become a driver of India’s trade and economic relations with ASEAN countries under the Act East Policy.

Earlier in the day, the President graced the valedictory function of the completion of 40 years of the Vivekananda Kendra in Itanagar.

Speaking on the occasion, the President praised the Vivekananda Kendra for commendable work in Arunachal Pradesh in the field of education. He was happy to note that the Vivekananda Kendra’s schools had kept alive the guru-shishya tradition through the Gurukul system. They have maintained Indian culture through yoga, pranayama, meditation, Sanskrit and other legacies of our past.

The President noted that the Vivekananda Kendra schools are a happy synthesis of our traditional knowledge and values and of modern science and technology.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 94th annual convocation of the University of Delhi today (November 18, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the University of Delhi is in many ways the University of India. Every state and region of our country is represented here. Each year thousands of eager young boys and girls travel to Delhi and apply to the University of Delhi or its affiliated colleges. The University is a big attraction for many young students from the Northeast. They add to the richness and vibrancy of the University campus and of the city of Delhi. 

The President said that we are entering a world where Artificial Intelligence is changing not just how our society ‘does’ but how it ‘thinks’. We are at the edge of a society of cognitive machines. As such, the challenges and the opportunities before us are immense. 

The President said that our leading institutions, such as the University of Delhi, will need to adapt as well. They will need to innovate – both in terms of academic content and mechanism of delivery. Traditional barriers between fields that were once regarded as sacrosanct are breaking down. New courses and programmes will have to be devised if our education system is to answer the needs of the next 25 or 30 years. Some of these may call for adopting a multi-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary approach. 

The President said that the capacity of physical classrooms is obviously limited. We need to explore how we can use technology to take scholarship and education further. The University of Delhi, like many other universities across the world, has taken steps to begin Massive Open Online Courses. As broadband penetration deepens in our country, the President saw great hope in the MOOC platform in the years ahead. It has an exciting potential to democratise knowledge. 

The President said that higher education serves many purposes. It prepares students for the job market. But that is only one purpose of higher education. At the end of the day, universities are truly meaningful only if they promote the adventure of learning and the exploration of knowledge. Blue-sky innovation is the test of a genuinely world-class higher education system and institution. 

The President said that it is critical to find the right balance between these different demands on our universities. Quick wins have their place, but universities cannot lose sight of the long-term goal of building a knowledge society. 

The President said he had been told that there were certain vacancies at the level of college principals and senior faculty positions. He was confident that the University authorities and college managements are taking all steps to fill these positions at the earliest.

                1.    I am happy to be here for the 94th Convocation of the University of Delhi, one of the most valued institutions of higher learning in our country. I offer my greetings to the Vice-Chancellor, faculty members and, most important, the graduating students and their family members. This is a big day and a memorable moment for all of you.



 

2.   I congratulate the degree holders and medal and prize winners present here today. There are 672 degree holders and 171 medal and prize winners among us. I understand that 112 of the medal and prize winners are girls – almost a two-thirds majority. This is in keeping with the trend in education in recent times, with girls consistently outscoring boys! It is a welcome sign in our society.

 

3.  In addition to those who are here, 125,000 students will receive their degrees in absentia. Each one of you is an achiever. Your achievement is the result of your hard work over the years. It is also the result of the dedication of your teachers and faculty members of the University of Delhi. And we must not forget that it is the outcome of the support all of you have received from your parents and family members.

 

4.     Learning is a never-ending process. This convocation is only a milestone in the journey that is education. Nevertheless, graduating from the University of Delhi has given you a firm foundation. I am sure it has empowered you to achieve more and aim higher as you walk into the world outside.

 

5. The University of Delhi was established in 1922. It had a modest beginning, with just three colleges, two disciplines and 750 students. Today, it is one of the largest universities in the world. It has 54,000 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students. The University comprises 16 disciplines – including medicine and technology – and 86 academic departments. Seventy-seven colleges and 28 centres and institutes are affiliated to it. These numbers are impressive by any standards.

 

6.    More than numbers, however, it is the University of Delhi’s reputation for scholarship and excellence that has made it a magnet for students. Students come here from all over the country, as well as other parts of the world. They come for a sweeping range of courses and academic programmes. This University offers both cutting-edge research in scientific fields as well as deep and insightful understanding of the humanities.

 

7.  The University of Delhi is constantly updating itself and keeping its academic programme meaningful for a contemporary generation. For example, in 2017, the University established the Delhi School of Journalism to offer a structured education in the practice and theory of media and mass communication. And in the academic year 2017-18, it is introducing a one-year post-graduate diploma course in cyber-security.

 

8.   These are very different learning experiences. Yet, both are relevant to our times, and to our age of communication and technology.

 

9.     Higher education is becoming increasingly competitive. New institutions and universities are offering options for students. Within the existing network of colleges and universities as well, there is strong competition to attract talent – both faculty and students. In this context, I welcome the National Institutional Ranking Framework initiative taken by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

 

10.  I have been told that under NIRF six colleges of the University of Delhi are ranked in the first 10 in our country. This is a commendable performance. It must be an inspiration to go higher. Our immediate aim should be to take the University of Delhi into the ranks of the world’s top 200 universities.

 

11.  In 2022, only five years from now, the University of Delhi will complete its centenary. It is advisable to plan that celebration by looking ahead. The centenary will be the culmination of a journey but also the beginning of a new voyage – a voyage that will take the University into the heart of the 21st century. We are a youthful nation. Sixty-five per cent of India’s citizens are below the age of 35. With this age profile, the challenge before our educational institutions will be very different in the coming years. There is also the impact of technology on how we live and work – and learn.

 

12. We are entering a world where Artificial Intelligence is changing not just how our society ‘does’ but how it ‘thinks’. We are at the edge of a society of cognitive machines. As such, the challenges and the opportunities before us – and particularly before those who are graduating today -- are immense.

 

13.  Our leading institutions, such as the University of Delhi, will need to adapt as well. They will need to innovate – both in terms of academic content and mechanism of delivery. Traditional barriers between fields that were once regarded as sacrosanct are breaking down. New courses and programmes will have to be devised if our education system is to answer the needs of the next 25 or 30 years. Some of these may call for adopting a multi-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary approach.

 

14.The capacity of physical classrooms is obviously limited. We need to explore how we can use technology to take scholarship and education further. The University of Delhi, like many other universities across the world, has taken steps to begin Massive Open Online Courses. As broadband penetration deepens in our country, I see great hope in the MOOC platform in the years ahead. It has an exciting potential to democratise knowledge.

 

15.  Higher education serves many purposes. For a start, it prepares students for different vocations and for the job market. But that is only one purpose of higher education. At the end of the day, universities are truly meaningful only if they promote the adventure of learning and the exploration of knowledge. Blue-sky innovation is the test of a genuinely world-class higher education system and institution.

 

16. It is critical to find the right balance between these different demands on our universities. Quick wins have their place, but universities cannot lose sight of the long-term goal of building a knowledge society and an innovation society. Mobilisation of the vast University of Delhi alumni network should also be encouraged. A way has to be found to allow them to easily contribute their intellect, resources and time in renewing their University or their individual colleges. And in mentoring students.

 

17. With all these responsibilities, and with the increase in both its student population and the courses on offer, the University of Delhi needs to enhance its capacities. I am told that there are certain vacancies at the level of college principals and senior faculty positions. I am confident the University authorities and college managements are taking all steps to fill these positions at the earliest, and this is what has been confirmed by the Vice Chancellor. 

 

18. The University of Delhi is in many ways the University of India. Every state and region of our country is represented here. Each year thousands of eager young boys and girls travel to Delhi and apply to the University of Delhi or its affiliated colleges. I must especially mention that the University is a big attraction for many young students from the Northeast. They add to the richness and vibrancy of the University campus and of the city of Delhi.

 

19. Here I may add that beginning tomorrow I am travelling for four days to the Northeast. It will be my first trip there as the President of India. And I am planning to go again very soon.

 

20.In conclusion I would once more like to congratulate all of you, especially the medal and prize winners. You are leaving with the stamp of one of India’s leading universities and you are going into a world buzzing with possibilities. Do well in your careers, make your alma mater proud, and value with humility the privilege of your education.

 

21.  And in whatever manner you choose, please give back to society. Help those who are marginalised and less fortunate. That is and that must always be the true test of your education and your degree.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner to the President’s Bodyguard at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (November 17, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that it gave him great pleasure to present the PBG a Silver Trumpet with his Trumpet Banner. As the President’s personal troops, the President’s Bodyguards have lived up to the highest standards of professional excellence and distinguished service to our country. The men of the PBG comprise the only regiment in the Indian Army fully trained as horsemen, paratroopers, tank-men, and in ceremonial duties. This gives them a special position in our Armed Forces. 

The President said that it is a matter of pride that warriors of the President’s Bodyguard have served with distinction during our country’s major wars, as well as with the Indian Peace-Keeping Force in Sri Lanka and on the icy heights of the Siachen Glacier. They have also been deployed overseas as part of United Nations Peace-Keeping Missions. 

The President’s Bodyguard is the oldest regiment in the Indian Army, having been raised as the Governor-General’s Bodyguard (later the Viceroy’s Bodyguard) in 1773. As the President of India’s own Guard, it has the unique distinction of being the only military unit of the Indian Army that is privileged to carry the President’s Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner. This distinction was conferred on the President’s Bodyguard in 1923 by the then Viceroy, Lord Reading, on the occasion of the Bodyguard completing 150 years of service. Each succeeding Viceroy, thereafter, presented the Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner to the Bodyguard. 

On January 27, 1950, the regiment was renamed the President’s Bodyguard. Every President has continued the practice of honouring the regiment. Rather than a coat of arms, as was the practice in the colonial era, the monogram of the President appears on the Banner. Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, presented his Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner to the President’s Bodyguard on May 14, 1957.

1.   It gives me great pleasure to present to you a Silver Trumpet with my Trumpet Banner. I congratulate you for your immaculate turnout and the impressive military bearing you have displayed today. As my personal troops, you have lived up to the highest standards of professional excellence and distinguished service to our country. You have lived up to your stirring motto, which is simply: “Bharat Mata ki Jai!”

 

2.   The President’s Bodyguard has a long history going back to 1773. Raised as the Viceroy’s Bodyguard, it is the oldest regiment in the Indian Army. It was renamed the President’s Bodyguard on January 27, 1950, the day after we became a Republic.

 

3.   You comprise the only regiment in the Indian Army that is fully trained as horsemen, paratroopers, tank-men, and in ceremonial duties. This gives you a special position in our Armed Forces. Your patriotism and valour have won you the affection and gratitude of our fellow citizens.

 

4.   It is a matter of pride that you, the warriors of my Bodyguard, have served with distinction during our country’s major wars, as well as with the Indian Peace-Keeping Force in Sri Lanka and on the icy heights of the Siachen Glacier. You have also been deployed overseas as part of United Nations Peace-Keeping Missions.

 

5.   I am delighted to have such impressive troops as my personal Bodyguard. You showcase our military might, whether on Republic Day or Beating the Retreat, at state functions or investiture ceremonies. Heads of State from other countries are very impressed by the ceremonial reception you give them.

 

6.   On this happy day, I convey my greetings to Colonel Bommanda [बोमान्डा] Dhiraj Chengappa, the Commandant of the President’s Bodyguard, and to the other Officers, JCOs and ranks. I am glad to note that former Commandants, Officers, JCOs and other ranks, who have served with the Bodyguard earlier – as well as family members of those who are serving or have served in the President’s Bodyguard – are present here today. My warm greetings and best wishes to all of you!

 

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will present the Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner to the President’s Bodyguard at a ceremony to be held at Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow (November 17, 2017).

Rather than a coat of arms, as was the practice in the colonial era, the monogram of the President appears on the Banner. Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, presented his Silver Trumpet and Trumpet Banner to the President’s Bodyguard on May 14, 1957. 

The President’s Bodyguard, as it is known today, was raised in Banaras (Varanasi) by the then Governor-General, Warren Hastings. It had an initial strength of 50 cavalry troopers, later augmented by another 50 horsemen. Today, the President’s Bodyguard is a select body of hand-picked men with special physical attributes. They are chosen after a rigorous and physically gruelling process. 

The President’s Bodyguard has seen war-time duty and a detachment currently serves on the Siachen Glacier. Its men have served with the IPKF in Sri Lanka and as part of UN Peace-Keeping Missions.

1.      This is my first visit to Punjab after taking over as President of India. I am honoured to be in a state with such a rich heritage. This is the land of sainiks and sants, of soldiers and spiritual leaders. I am especially fortunate to come here in November, a month in which we are marking the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji and the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji. I bow to those great nation builders from Punjab.

 2.      The contribution of Punjab to our armed forces, and of our armed forces to our nation, has been enormous. That is why, in my role as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, I am truly glad that my first visit to Punjab has brought me to the Air Force Station in Adampur to award Standards to the 223 Squadron and the 117 Helicopter Unit of the Indian Air Force.

 3.      Air Force Station Adampur is among the oldest and best-known bases of our Air Force. It has grown from a small airstrip to a fully operational base, hosting a variety of weapon systems. The airbase has remained operational since inception. It was the setting of great heroism during the wars of 1947, 1965 and 1971.  

 4.      Both units being honoured today have a history of professional excellence. The nation honours them with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for dedication and courage in the face of adversity. I compliment the air warriors on parade for their impeccable turnout and smart movement. 

 5.      India’s rise in the international system has many dimensions to it. But it draws heavily from the capabilities and valour of our Armed Forces. Though we remain firmly committed to peace, we are determined to use all our might to protect the sovereignty of our nation. Each time we have had to do so, our valiant men and women in uniform have risen to the occasion. Every citizen of India sleeps securely because he or she knows that you are there to protect them. Our armed forces, exemplified by the air warriors who stand before us, reflect our national resolve. And they secure the values, traditions and beliefs embodied in our democratic Constitution.

 

6.      The 223 Squadron or the Tridents was formed on May 10, 1982, right here in Adampur. It was initially equipped with MiG-23 MF aircraft. Whether flying the MiG-23 or the formidable MiG-29 upgrade aircraft today, the squadron has a remarkable operational record. This squadron is one of the few that remains alert 365 days a year. It truly lives up to its motto of Vijyaya Amogh-astraha, which means the Ultimate Weapon for Victory. 

 

7.      The 117 Helicopter Unit, or the Himalayan Dragons, was raised on February 1, 1971, at Air Force Station, Bareilly. The unit gained its initial experience in the India-Pakistan War of 1971, in the Eastern theatre. It moved to Hasimara in 1983 and flew extensive air maintenance and casualty evacuation missions in the Northeast. The unit moved to its present location, Air Force Station Sarsawa, in January 1988.

8.      In Operation Rahat, Operation Megh Rahat, and numerous other humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, the unit has worked tirelessly in helping civilians. It has an appropriate motto: Aapatsu Mitram, which means Friend in Distress. That is exactly what it is to so many of our fellow citizens.

 9.      In acknowledgement and recognition of their outstanding performance, I am pleased to award Standards to the 223 Squadron and the 117 Helicopter Unit. I compliment the personnel, veterans and families of the 223 Squadron, the 117 Helicopter Unit, and the Air Force Station Adampur for their devotion to the nation. India is proud of you. 

 

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the foundation day anniversary celebrations of Jharkhand state today (November 15, 2017) in Ranchi. He also inaugurated or laid foundation stones of various welfare and developmental projects on the occasion.



Addressing the gathering, the President congratulated the people of Jharkhand on the 17th anniversary of the formation of the State. He said that having seen and felt the enthusiasm of the people present at the foundation day celebrations, he truly appreciated the vision of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who decided to establish the state of Jharkhand.

The President paid tributes to illustrious heroes of Jharkhand, including the freedom fighter Birsa Munda, whose birth anniversary was also celebrated today, Sido-Kanhu, Chand-Bhairav, Tilka Manjhi, Nilambar-Pitambar, and Jaipal Singh Munda, 1928 Olympic hockey captain and former MP. He said they devoted their lives to the creation of a society based on equality and justice. We should all take a pledge to build a nation and build a Jharkhand, the President said, where every person will experience equality and prosperity as per the dreams of Birsa Munda.

The President said nature had blessed Jharkhand with 40 per cent of the country’s mineral resources. This provides immense opportunity for the development of industry. He expressed happiness that Jharkhand was performing well and had the second-highest growth rate among states of the country. In the field of labour reforms, it had topped the list for the past two years. From a low rank in terms of 'Ease of Doing Business' in 2014, Jharkhand is now counted as among the best states.

Earlier, the President commenced his engagements in Ranchi by paying respects before the statue of ‘Dharti Aba’ Birsa Munda.

Later in the day, the President received the first copy of the Hindi translation of Paramhansa Yogananda’s book ‘God Talks with Arjuna - The Bhagavad Gita’ in Ranchi. He received the copy from Smt Draupadi Murmu, the Governor of Jharkhand, who formally released the book.

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated Yogoda Satsanga Society and those associated with it for their commendable contribution in spreading the message of yoga all over the world. He also appreciated the service of the Society’s ashrams and meditation centres in social welfare activities.

The faculty and course members of 57th NDC course, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (November 14, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Speaking on the occasion, the President said we live in a challenging and dynamic global environment. The very concept of security and defence is changing before our eyes. No longer is it limited to territorial integrity. Today, the idea of security incorporates economic and energy security, as well as concerns about food, health and the environment. The future of security is as much about preventing nuclear proliferation as about the integrity of the Internet and of data protection.

The President said each of these areas requires specialisation and analysis. And yet, they are inter-linked. They demand an integrated approach from those responsible for our security – as well as a process of constant learning and knowledge updating.

 

The President said India and its neighbourhood – and the broader Asian continent – are the location of multiple security threats and risks that are of global significance. Terrorism and violent extremism are common challenges. These challenges are both state-based and asymmetrical. Also, with globalisation and the technology revolution, Asia has emerged as the centre of the 21st century economy. Securing this economic rise and checking attempts to destabilise it will be an important task in the years ahead. Threats will come in all domains – from the maritime space to cyberspace.

The President said this makes it important to promote a “strategic culture” in India and in all the partner countries represented at the NDC course. And he was confident that NDC alumni would contribute to strengthening an understanding of the multi-dimensional approach to security in the years to come.

                Groups of probationers from the Indian Ordnance Factories Service and the Indian Trade Service called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (November 13, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing both groups of probationers jointly, the President said that their selection was a personal achievement for them, and their career ahead was full of possibilities for public service. In their own ways, they would serve the country and its 1.3 billion people, and play a crucial role in services that helped make India strong and secure. 

The President said that our defence related challenges are immense, and we have to be prepared to meet any situation, at any time. The Indian Ordnance Factories Service contributes directly to our nation’s security. Ordnance Factories Service officers should feel proud that they will be managing our Ordnance Factories, which provide our soldiers weapons, ammunition and equipment that they need to protect our country. As managers of the Ordnance Factories, these officers would in a sense be responsible for India’s defence preparedness. The President urged them to develop a spirit of innovation so that they could take forward the much-needed modernisation of Ordnance Factories. 

The President said that the strength of a nation is assessed not only by the might of its defence forces but also by the strength of its economy. Economies today operate in an increasingly integrated world where nations compete for a share of global markets and trade. While we have done quite well in promoting trade in the past two decades, there is a lot more to be achieved. In the mid-18th century India had almost a 25 per cent share of global industrial output. It held a prominent share in global trade. Today, our country’s share in global trade is around two per cent. 

It is Indian Trade Service officers, the President said, who will play an important role in ensuring that our country regains its strong position in the global trading order. As officers their role should no longer be that of trade regulators alone, but they should emerge as trade facilitators. With their knowledge of economics and trade-related operations, they can improve our trade negotiations, suggest trade-friendly policies and initiate procedural simplifications that can facilitate trade. 

The President advised the probationers to live a life of optimism and make positive changes happen both in their work domains as well as in society at large. He also advised the probationers to stay away from any temptations, and serve the country with honesty, integrity and dedication.

                A group of officer trainees of the 69 RR (2016 Batch) of the Indian Police Service, from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (November 13, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Addressing the officer trainees, the President said the Indian Police Service is one of the pillars of our national administrative system. As members of an All-India Service, they will no doubt serve in individual states – but they will represent a national idea. Their mandate is to uphold a common concept of the rule of law and of our democratic polity. In that sense, they are guardians of not just public order and honest conduct – but of the majesty of the law. The President called upon the officers to discharge their duties without fear or favour, and without time delays. He stated that as professional civil servants, they should be unafraid to give the political executive honest and unbiased advice. Their holy book and their constant guide must be the Constitution.

The President said that technology is both a challenge and a tool for policing. While it expands avenues for crimes, technology also allows the police to do its duties with greater efficiency. It allows the citizen to interact with the police force – and even to lodge a complaint – from the comfort of his or her home and computer or mobile phone. He called upon the officer trainees to encourage this process. He stated that the ideal police system is one where the citizen gets his due service from the police without needing to visit the police station.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the 2nd convocation of the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University today (November 11, 2017) at Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the establishment of the National Tribal University in Madhya Pradesh was appropriate as the state has a 15 million strong tribal population. The University’s aim is to help tribal youth participate with greater vigour in the building of modern India by giving them the best possible opportunities in education.

The President said that a university convocation was not just a ceremony to honour students who were graduating; it was an opportunity to dedicate to society the services of an educated, equipped and disciplined cadre of youth. A convocation is not the end of education but the beginning of a responsible life.

The President called upon students to leave an imprint on society that was so meaningful that the University could be presented as a model for the entire nation.  He expressed confidence that the graduates would always keep learning and would make a significant contribution to the uplift of the underprivileged in our society, and to the progress of the nation.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the Sadguru Kabir Mahotsav in Bhopal today (November 10, 2017).

 Speaking on the occasion, the President praised the Government of Madhya Pradesh for instituting the ‘Rashtriya Kabir Samman’. He stated that this honour encourages poets who pursue the philosophical tradition of Saint Kabir. He also congratulated the award winners and appreciated their contributions.

 The President said that Sadhguru Kabir was not only a great spiritual leader but also a social reformer. He fought against social evils that prevailed in society at the time and made efforts to eradicate them. The President said that the path of equality and harmony shown by Saint Kabir remains an inspiration for our society.

 The President also received the first copy of the book ‘Madhya Pradesh Mein Kabir’ on the occasion.

 Later in the day, the President paid tributes to Rani Jhalkaribai at her statue in Bhopal.  Tomorrow, the President will address the 2nd convocation of the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University at Amarkantak.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the Dehdaniyon Ka Utsav organised by the Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti, today (November 10, 2017) in New Delhi.



Speaking on the occasion, the President said that body/organ donation is true to the ethos of our ancient civilization.  It is believed that Maharishi Dadhichi had donated his body so that the Gods could make a weapon from his bones and defeat the forces of evil. The thought that in our lifetime, or even after death, our body or body organs could be useful to or help treat another person is both humanistic and inspiring. 

The President said that an estimated 500,000 people die every year in our country due to unavailability of organs that can be transplanted. Of them, 200,000 suffer from liver diseases and 50,000 from cardiovascular diseases. In addition, approximately 150,000 people await kidney transplantation. The President appealed to doctors, educational institutions, teachers and religious leaders to spread awareness about body and organ donation. He said that due to poverty some people may be compelled to sell their body organs, and this was unacceptable. If we institute a culture of voluntary donation, then the illegal market will gradually come to an end.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, launched the Bihar Krishi Road Map 2017-2022 in Patna today (November 9, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said it was a moving and emotional experience for him to come to Bihar for the first time as President of India. He would always remember the regard and affection received from people of all sections and regions of the State during his tenure as the Governor of Bihar. 

The President stated that the centenary year of the Champaran Satyagraha is being commemorated from April 2017. As such this was the best time to introduce the new 'Agricultural Road Map' in the interests of farmers. Mahatma Gandhi had emphasised through the Satyagraha that farmers are at the centre of Indian life and policy making. And this remains true even today. 

The President said that the Government of Bihar had launched the first ‘Agricultural Road Map’ in 2008 after consulting farmers, agricultural scientists and other stakeholders. The 2017 road map is the third. It provides comprehensive and coordinated plans for the development of agriculture. All concerned Departments have been directed to design their policies keeping the welfare of farmers in mind. This is a fundamental change. The President expressed confidence that the 3rd Agricultural Road Map' released today will further energise the agricultural sector's performance in Bihar and empower the farming community.

It is an honour for me to welcome Your Majesties and the distinguished members of your delegation to India. 

Your Majesties, although this is your first State Visit, you are cherished friends in our country. 

As Crown Prince, you have visited India heading several fruitful trade Missions. You have, indeed, been a strong proponent of India-Belgium economic relations, much more than the shine of diamonds in our growing bilateral trade.   

The people of India value and appreciate your personal contribution to the excellent relations between our two nations.  

 We are grateful to you for choosing India not just for work, but for your honeymoon and to intern as a student. We cherish the close connect the Belgian Royal family has with India.   

 

Your Majesty, 

We are celebrating 70 years of our diplomatic ties this year. Your State Visit, therefore, is very special. And for you to have begun it with a trip to the Taj should make it even more so.   

I have no doubt that the agreements that have been signed today and the initiatives announced will mark the beginning of yet another chapter in our long-standing friendship. 

India and Belgium are natural partners: we share a common commitment to democracy, human rights and pluralism with a desire to achieve a just and equitable world order.

 

Your Majesty,

 We have interacted and engaged with each other much before we established formal ties. Indian soldiers fought and sacrificed in the Flanders Field to protect their Belgian brothers and sisters. 

 And in India, your people established schools and colleges. There were still others who dedicated their lives to promote our languages - Sanskrit and Hindi.

 Building on these old ties, our relations today have grown deeper. Our people-to-people engagement has expanded.  

 Your delectable chocolates are being tempered with the aroma of our spices; our scientists are gazing the stars together and our hockey players competing with each other.

 We have, indeed, entered into an exciting new world of mutual collaboration.  

    

Your Majesties, 

 It is unique that the King in Belgium is addressed as the King of the Belgians, meaning the King represents its people. Belgium is special for many other reasons.

 The world would not have been projected so accurately, if Gerardus Mercator did not invent the world-map projection. 

 Our children would have missed precious memories if Peyo did not design the comic franchise about little blue men called Smurfs, and Herge did not design the comic albums of ‘Adventures of Tintin’. 

And this Bhavan would not have been as beautiful had it not been for the Belgium glasses and crystals.

 

Your Majesty,

 The remarkable transformation of the Belgian economy following the World Wars made Belgium a key player in the intra-Europe trade and connectivity. 

It has, ever since, remained at the vanguard of Europe’s industrial progress. 

 At the present juncture, when India is engaging with the world to bring new energy to her development, we once again welcome Belgian investors to participate in our growth story. 

Our government over the last three years has championed the cause of ease of doing business. The results are there for all to see. In the recent World Bank Ease of Doing Business rankings, we have jumped 30 places, and overall 42 places since 2014. We remain committed to further improving our standing. 

Our efforts aimed at simplification of investment rules has seen FDI jump 150% to US Dollar 60 billion in 2016-17 compared to the US Dollar 24 billion received in 2013-14.  

 The implementation of our landmark reform – the Goods and Services Tax - has paved the way for a common national market, brought in greater transparency and compliance, and will make India a competitive place for manufacturing.  

 

Your Majesty, 

 Belgium, situated at the very heart of Europe, has been instrumental in the process of uniting Europe into a successful single market. Your government has consistently remained committed to the European Project. India, too, sees the European Union as a factor of stability in a changing world and sincerely wishes its people every success.

 I am confident that your State Visit will be a milestone in our efforts to enhance our cooperation and add new substance to our mutually beneficial partnership.

 With these words, I once again welcome Your Majesties and wish you a very successful and personally enjoyable visit to India. 

 May I request you, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, to join me in raising toast :-

 -     to the health and well-being of Their Majesties the King and Queen of the Belgians;

-     to the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Belgium and; 

 -     to the enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Belgium.

 

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received His Majesty King Philippe and Her Majesty Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (November 7, 2017). He also hosted a banquet in their honour.

Welcoming the King and the Queen to India, the President said he was happy to know that India holds a special place for them and for the Belgian Royal family. He said that this State Visit is even more special as India and Belgium are celebrating 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations this year.

The President said that India and Belgium enjoy warm and friendly relations. Our shared values of democracy, rule of law, pluralism and respect for human rights bind us together. World War I forms part of our shared history. Thousands of Indian soldiers fought and sacrificed for Belgium. We in India appreciate the Government of Belgium’s efforts towards recognising their valour and sacrifice.

The President said economic relations form the core of the Indo-Belgian partnership. Bilateral trade is growing but we can do a lot more together. We must see how we can replicate the success of the diamond industry in other sectors. The Indian economy is on a steady growth path. Our Make in India, Clean India, Smart Cities and other initiatives offer immense opportunities for Belgian investors. Belgium has global expertise in building and managing ports. India has an ambitious Sagarmala project to develop its port sector. We seek participation of Belgian companies in this regard.

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that the remarkable transformation of the Belgian economy following the World Wars made Belgium a key player in intra-Europe trade and connectivity. It has, ever since, remained at the vanguard of Europe’s industrial progress. He stated that at the present juncture, when India is engaging with the world to bring new energy to its development, we welcome Belgian participation in our growth story.

The President said that Belgium has been instrumental in the process of uniting Europe into a successful single market. The Government of Belgium has remained committed to the European Union project. India, too, sees the European Union as a factor of stability in a changing world and sincerely wishes its people every success.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Guru Ghasidas was a remarkable social reformer among the dispersed community of this region almost 200 years ago. He struggled against social evils and injustice, and fought for the poor and downtrodden. His message was simple: that truth and noble conduct are synonyms for God. He made efforts to eliminate the practice of untouchability, and emphasised fraternity and social harmony. He also stressed women’s rights and supported widow marriage.

The President said that the teachings of Guru Ghasidas have given direction to social reform among not only the Satnami Samaj but in entire Chhattisgarh. He expressed confidence that by imbibing the ideals of Guru Ghasidas, the people and government of Chhattisgarh would continue to work to build a society based on equality and unity.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the Chhattisgarh Rajyotsava today (November 5, 2017) in Naya Raipur.

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated people of Chhattisgarh on the 17th anniversary of the formation of the State.

The President said that Chhattisgarh has immense potential for development. The forests, rivers and minerals are priceless natural resources for the State. But the biggest assets are the honest and friendly people of Chhattisgarh.

The President said that Chhattisgarh has done many things in the field of public welfare and development that have been praised throughout the country, and from which other states have learnt a lot. Chhattisgarh is the first state in the country to enact 'Food and Nutrition Security Act'.

The President said that under the leadership of Chief Minister Dr Raman Singh commendable work has been done for STs, SCs, the underprivileged, farmers, women, youth and other sections of society. He congratulated the Chhattisgarh administration and the people for this. He stated that the development of Chhattisgarh can be an example of development for the rest of the country.

Earlier in the day, the President paid tributes at the Shahidi Smarak Sthal in Raipur. Tomorrow, he will visit the Guru Ghasidas Jaitkham and attend the bhoomi pujan for a Saamudayik Bhavan at Girodhpuri in Chhattisgarh.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the concluding ceremony of World Food India-2017, organised by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Govt. of India, today (November 5, 2017) in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the organisers for the resounding and truly historic success of the World Food India-2017. He stated that this Summit saw the participation of delegates from over 60 countries, including CEOs of 60 global companies. It has helped showcase the vast and near limitless opportunities in the food industry and in food processing in India. It has been the Kumbh Mela of Indian food.

The President said that food is culture – but food is also commerce. India’s food consumption is currently valued at US $370 billion. It is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2025, in less than a decade. There are opportunities across the entire food value chain in India – including post-harvest facilities, logistics, cold chains, and manufacturing. It is a sector with a large business appetite. The food industry can be a huge employer. And this is of utmost importance for a country such as India, which has such a large youth population. It is also noteworthy that women are deeply involved in the food sector. Especially in our rural areas, there is great potential for women to emerge as micro-entrepreneurs by setting up small food processing units.

The President said that the Government of India is conscious of the social and economic benefits of a thriving food industry. This is a major area for attracting domestic and foreign investment. 41 mega food parks and cold chains are being established in all parts of the country to enhance food production. There is an increasing stress on food safety, accurate labelling, intellectual property issues and innovation in the food processing sector – as well as on using technology as an enabler.

The President congratulated the winners of Start-up Awards and Hackathon Awards. He expressed confidence that they will go on to shape India’s food processing sector and improve quality and safety standards. He noted that one of the start-ups selected has adapted Raman Spectroscopy, the discovery of India’s very own Nobel Prize winning scientist Dr C.V. Raman, into a low-cost hand-held device that can instantly detect food adulteration. This technology can save billions in food fraud.

The President said he was confident that Indian farmers and the Indian food processing industry can produce food products for India and – given India’s competitive cost structure – for the world as well. This would insulate both farmers and consumers from price shocks, and go a long way in ensuring remunerative incomes for the agricultural community.

                1.   I am happy to be here at the concluding function of World Food India 2017 and would like to congratulate every one of the organisers for its resounding and truly historic success. This Summit saw the participation of delegates from over 60 countries, including CEOs of 60 global companies. It has helped showcase the vast and near limitless opportunities in the food industry and in food processing in India. It has been, if I may put it so, the Kumbh Mela of Indian food.

2.   A rich, complex and sophisticated food culture is part of the ethos of India. This has been true for thousands of years, ever since our ancestors planted grains in the Indus Valley. Our intellectual legacies, such as Ayurveda and yoga, place emphasis on appropriate food elements in keeping with different body systems.

3.   Across the length and breadth of this vast subcontinent, our communities have historically used diverse and nutritious grains. They have also practised traditional farming methods that are essentially organic. Ironically, these have come back to our markets today after repackaging in other countries.

4.   Food in India is as diverse as the rest of our society. Varieties of dal – the pulses or lentils that are a principal source of protein for so many of our people – change from state to state, even district to district. There are 29 states in India – and maybe 290 different recipes for biryani or of course khichri. Different soil systems are responsible for an astonishing range of agricultural produce. From taenga in Assam to sarson da saag in Punjab, from the dhokla in Gujarat to the dosa in Tamil Nadu and other states of the South, there is so much to choose from.

 5.   I would say that one human lifetime is not enough to experience the range and richness of Indian food!

 6.   Food is part of India’s global outreach and has been so for centuries. As a naturally open and trading society, we have exported as well as embraced different food items and customs. Today, from West Asia to the West Indies, Indian food is popular, and is often adapted to local tastes. Butter chicken can be found from Brazzaville in Congo to Berlin in Germany.

 

7.   Recently I travelled to Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, on my first visit abroad as President of India. In that country the principal snack is a variation of the samosa. I was told that the samosa had arrived in Djibouti from India. And in India it is believed that a version of the samosa travelled here on the trade routes from Central Asia. Truly food connects the world. Even Japan’s tempura style is said to have been inspired by the Indian fried pakora.

 

Friends,

8.   Food is culture – but food is also commerce. India’s food consumption is currently valued at US $370 billion. It is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2025, in less than a decade. There are opportunities across the entire food value chain in India – including post-harvest facilities, logistics, cold chains, and manufacturing. It is a sector with a large business appetite.

 9.   The food industry can be a huge employer. And this is of utmost importance for a country such as India, which has such a large youth population. It is also noteworthy that women are deeply involved in the food sector. Especially in our rural areas, there is great potential for women to emerge as micro-entrepreneurs and raise overall female participation in the workforce.

10.   Women can set up small enterprises to make jams and pickles by processing fruits and vegetables gathered from farms in the village. They can even use the Internet and modern communication technology to study prices and consumer trends in faraway markets. In this manner they can empower themselves, enhance the family income and contribute to nation building.

11.  A simple outcome such as this can have multiple benefits. It can go a long way in curtailing the unacceptably high crop wastage in our country. In this regard, some of the numbers are truly startling. For instance, close to 16 per cent of India’s guava crop is wasted, as are 10 per cent of our mango and apple crops. I am sure the deliberations at this conference will take us closer to preventing such regrettable wastage. A focused emphasis on modern food processing can change things. It gives the food sector the potential to become the intersection of so many of our flagship programmes – Make in India, Start-up India, Skill India, Digital India, and the resolve to double farm incomes.

 12.  The Government of India is conscious of the social and economic benefits of a thriving food industry. This is a major area for attracting domestic and foreign investment. I am happy to learn that around 50 MoUs have been signed at this event. Forty-one mega food parks and cold chains are being established in all parts of the country to enhance food production. There is an increasing stress on food safety, accurate labelling, intellectual property issues and innovation in the food processing sector – as well as on using technology as an enabler.

 13.  In this context, I would like to congratulate the winners of today’s Start-up Awards and Hackathon Awards. I am sure you will go on to shape India’s food processing sector and improve quality and safety standards. I understand that one of the start-ups selected has adapted Raman Spectroscopy, the discovery of India’s very own Nobel Prize winning scientist Dr C.V. Raman, into a low-cost hand-held device that can instantly detect food adulteration. This technology can save billions in food fraud.

 14. I am also confident that Indian farmers and the Indian food processing industry can produce food products for India and – given India’s competitive cost structure – for the world as well. This would insulate both farmers and consumers from price shocks, and go a long way in ensuring remunerative incomes for the agricultural community. I look forward to the results and agreements flowing from this conference. I am sure they will take us nearer many of our goals.

 

15.   I would once more like to appreciate the efforts of the organisers. They have put together a truly impressive event that has made many of us here – both from India and internationally – think of food issues and of the food industry in a manner that we had previously not done. In particular, it should lead to a time-bound plan to reduce if not eliminate crop wastage in our country.

 

Friends,

16.  It is not without reason that this Summit has been called World Food India. The food story in India has world-wide implications. On a global scale, the market for Indian food products is massive. It extends from 1.8 billion people in South Asia to a 30 million strong diaspora population, and to millions more in all parts of the world. As such, the opportunities in the Indian food industry should give you much to chew about. Please digest. And invest.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

Welcoming the Latvian Prime Minister to India, the President said that this visit is of historic significance as it is the first ever visit of a Latvian Prime Minister to India. It takes place as we are celebrating 25 years of establishment of our diplomatic relations. 

The President said that bilateral relations between India and Latvia are warm and friendly. We should work together to enhance our economic relations. We deeply appreciate Latvia’s participation in the World Food India 2017 event. Latvia has acquired strengths in the agro-food processing sector and the participation of Latvian companies at World Food India will benefit both sides. The President stated that the Government of India has introduced programmes like Make in India, Smart Cities, Digital India and Clean India which present opportunities for Latvian companies. Latvia can also gain from the strengths of Indian industry, particularly in the IT and pharma sectors. 

The President said that we deeply value our strong cultural ties and people-to-people connect with Latvia. He expressed happiness that the ‘Centre for India Studies and Culture’ established in the University of Latvia is promoting yoga and Hindi. He was glad that a new Centre for Baltic Culture and Studies has been opened at the Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya in Haridwar. He stated that this will further deepen cultural and academic contacts between India and the Baltic region. 

The President noted that the Latvian Prime Minister will be inaugurating the Honorary Consulate of Latvia and attending business meetings in Mumbai tomorrow. He expressed confidence that these will help in further strengthening our bilateral ties.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has sent his greetings to fellow citizens on the eve of birthday of Guru Nanak Devji.

In a message, the President has said, “On the auspicious occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, I extend my heartiest greetings to all, and especially to all the brothers and sisters of the Sikh community in India and abroad.

Guru Nanak Dev gave us an enlightened message of peace, harmony and of the unity of all human beings.  He stood against exploitation and atrocity, and dedicated himself to the service and welfare of the underprivileged.  As encapsulated in the Japji, his teachings about love and faith, truth and sacrifice, and moral conduct have eternal spiritual value.  He epitomises the quest for equality of all men and women, and universal, humanist values. 

On this day, may each one of us endeavour to use Guru Nanak’s noble teachings in our daily lives and work to strengthen the sense of oneness, fraternity and mutual goodwill in our society”.

We have had the privilege to live together with Armenian brothers and sisters in Kolkata, Chennai and other cities in India. We are extremely proud of this common heritage.

The President said that our bilateral relations are strong. However, there is much scope to enhance trade and economic relations between the two countries. The health sector is one of the promising areas of bilateral cooperation. He expressed confidence that this visit would provide a fresh impetus to India-Armenia relations.

The President expressed happiness that there is a Hindi Chair in the Yerevan State Linguistic University. He noted that the Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture and Sports is working to have a Chair in Yoga soon. He stated that these initiatives will further strengthen cultural ties between India and Armenia.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 21st World Congress of Mental Health being organised by the World Federation for Mental Health in partnership with Caring Foundation and other institutions in New Delhi today (November 2, 2017). Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the World Congress of Mental Health is taking place in India for the first time. And it has come here at an appropriate moment. Mental health issues are acquiring a serious magnitude in our country. Our National Mental Health Survey 2016 found that close to 14 per cent of India’s population required active mental health interventions.

The President noted that those living in metropolitan cities and those who are young – whether in the productive age group, or children and teenagers – are most vulnerable to mental illnesses. In India, we have a young population, with 65 per cent of our people below the age of 35. And our society is rapidly urbanising. This leaves us staring at a possible mental health epidemic.

The President said that the biggest obstacle that mental health patients have to encounter is stigma and denial. This leads to the issue being ignored or simply not discussed. We need to talk about mental health issues and treat ailments such as depression and stress as diseases that can be cured – not as guilty secrets that must be pushed under the carpet. A major gap in combating the mental health challenge is that of human resources. India is a country with 1.25 billion people but just 700,000 doctors – less than one million. In the field of mental health, the scarcity is even more acute. There are only about 5,000 psychiatrists and less than 2,000 clinical psychologists in our country.

The President said that India’s National Mental Health Programme is building 22 centres of excellence in the field of mental health. In parallel, the District Mental Health Programme has already covered 517 of the approximately 650 districts in India. It is taking the conversation about mental health to the grassroots of our society.

The President expressed happiness that the World Congress will have sessions on yoga, meditation and traditional approaches to mental health. He stated that the example of yoga is very instructive. When people talk about yoga, they generally refer to its physiological benefits. However, the mental, psychological, and cognitive benefits of yoga are equally worthy of our study. He looked forward to feedback on the deliberations of the special session planned on the role of yoga in battling anxiety and depression – and in preventing the onset of mental health problems.

·         President, World Federation for Mental Health, Dr Gabriel Ivbijaro

·         Chairpersons of the World Congress Dr Sunil Mittal and Dr N.K. Bohra

·         Distinguished Guests

·         Ladies and Gentlemen

 

1.      I am happy to be here to inaugurate the World Congress of Mental Health, being organised by the World Federation for Mental Health in partnership with Caring Foundation and other institutions. Before me are one thousand delegates participating in this conference. I would particularly like to welcome the 300 odd international delegates who are representing about 50 countries.

 2.      I understand the World Congress is taking place in India and in fact in South Asia for the first time. This is a matter of pride for all of us. Frankly, it has come here at an appropriate moment. Mental health issues are acquiring a serious magnitude in our country.

 

3.      The World Health Organisation reports that India has among the highest prevalence of mental illnesses globally. Our National Mental Health Survey 2016 found that close to 14 per cent of India’s population required active mental health interventions. About two per cent suffered from severe mental disorders. Nearly two hundred thousand Indians take their own lives each year. If one includes attempted suicides, the number goes up substantially.

 

4.      These are worrying statistics. It is also a fact that those living in metropolitan cities and those who are young – whether in the productive age group, or children and teenagers – are most vulnerable to mental illnesses. In India, both these factors are cause for concern. We have a young population, with 65 per cent of our people below the age of 35. And our society is rapidly urbanising. This leaves us staring at a possible mental health epidemic.

 

Friends

5.      Given the figures I have just outlined, it is an irony that 90 per cent of Indians in need simply don’t receive mental health care. There are several reasons for this, and I hope they will be addressed in this conference.

 

6.      The biggest obstacle that mental health patients have to encounter is stigma and denial. This leads to the issue being ignored or simply not discussed. In some cases it leads to self-diagnosis that is unsuitable or could worsen the situation. It may even lead to other extreme steps. As a society we have to fight this culture of stigma. We need to talk about mental health issues and treat ailments such as depression and stress as diseases that can be cured – not as guilty secrets that must be pushed under the carpet.

 

7.      In this context, I am glad that advocacy and awareness are important components of the Government of India’s National Mental Health Programme. This Programme is building 22 centres of excellence in the field of mental health. In parallel, the District Mental Health Programme has already covered 517 of the approximately 650 districts in India. It is taking the conversation about mental health to the grassroots of our society.

 

8.      To spread awareness, it is important to build partnerships between the public and private sectors and between the government and civil society organisations. It would also be valuable to stitch together community support networks. In some measure, these can fill the gap being created by the gradual breakdown of the traditional joint family system – especially in our big cities. Sometimes this results in young people being left with the impression that they have no one to speak to, no sounding board and no informal counsellor. This could then become the first step towards depression.

 

9.      A second major gap in combating the mental health challenge is that of human resources. India is a country with 1.25 billion people but just seven hundred thousand doctors – less than one million. In the field of mental health, the scarcity is even more acute. There are only about five thousand psychiatrists and less than two thousand clinical psychologists in our country. 

 

10.  This number is extremely inadequate and we need to act. Especially for the purpose of diagnosis of mental illnesses, it would be advisable to use physicians, psychologists who teach in colleges and educational institutions as well as Auxiliary Nurses and Midwives – who are at the frontline of our public health system across the country.

 

11.  I am told Information Technology and telemedicine are also coming of aid. Such technologies are linking doctors and counsellors in cities to mental health patients in rural areas. As Internet penetration expands in our country, this holds much potential.

 

Friends

12.  I am glad to learn that in addition to advances in neuro-sciences – as well as our understanding of the clinical causes and treatment of mental disorders – the World Congress will also have sessions on yoga, meditation and traditional approaches to mental health. It is vital to tap into our wealth of traditional knowledge and link its learning to modern research on mental health. This will promote a holistic approach to mental health-care and can combine the best of different fields of practice.

 

13.  The example of yoga is very instructive. When people talk about yoga, they generally refer to its physiological benefits. However, the mental, psychological, and cognitive benefits of yoga are equally worthy of our study. I look forward to receiving feedback on the deliberations of the special session planned on the role of yoga in battling anxiety and depression – and in preventing the onset of mental health problems.

 

14.  In conclusion, I would like to re-emphasise that India’s mental health challenge is capturing a society in multiple transitions. From traditional diseases, it is gradually non-communicable diseases that are emerging as a major threat to our people and their well-being. This is part of a worldwide trend. And many non-communicable diseases are either rooted in or associated with mental health issues.

 

15.  All of that invests this World Congress with urgency. At the end of this conference, we should be closer to a time-bound programme that will ensure the quickest possible access to mental health diagnosis and treatment services for every person in need. All of you in this hall, and I include international delegates here, are stakeholders in this effort. You will be performing a genuine nation building and humanitarian task.

 

I wish you and wish the conference all success.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

We should do everything to make it a model of bilateral cooperation, which will be noted by others in the neighbourhood.

The President said that security concerns of India and Bhutan are indivisible and mutual. He conveyed deep appreciation for the King of Bhutan’s personal involvement and guidance and the support provided by Bhutan in addressing the recent situation in the Doklam area. He added that the manner in which both India and Bhutan stood together to address the situation in the Doklam area is a clear testimony to our friendship.

                1.      I am happy to be here to inaugurate the first Global Clubfoot Conference to be held in India, and being organised by CURE International India Trust in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and other partner institutions. I welcome the 500 doctors from 29 Indian states who are attending this conference – and in particular the health specialists from approximately 20 countries who have made it here.

 2.      Clubfoot is one of the most common orthopaedic birth defects. It can cause permanent disability if not treated early. This affects the child’s mobility and confidence. Inevitably, education and schooling suffer – and the child cannot fulfil his or her potential.

3.      The irony is clubfoot is curable. It is estimated that over 50,000 children are born annually in India with clubfoot. The exact reasons for this congenital disability are not fully known. Till recently most children who suffered from clubfoot needed to be treated surgically. This was expensive for parents and traumatic for both the children and their families. Access to surgery was also difficult in rural areas. As such, many received no treatment. They were left to a lifetime of disability and stigma.

 4.      In India the burden of disability affects more than 10 million people. The differently-abled or Divyang as we call them deserve equal opportunities in all avenues of life. Mainstreaming their social and professional experience is a commitment for all of us. Having said that, many of these disabilities are preventable or curable – which is often forgotten. Prevention, treatment and mainstreaming have to go in parallel.

 5.      Let us take the example of polio, a disease that is sometimes confused with clubfoot. India is proud that we have eradicated new cases of poliomyelitis. Polio was once a serious cause of loco-motor disability, but over the past six years we have not had a single case of paralytic poliomyelitis. This has been a major milestone in the history of public health not only in India but globally. It must motivate us to work towards eliminating other disabilities and other diseases. Certainly, it must motivate us to take on and defeat the challenge of clubfoot.

 

Friends

 6.      We are indeed fortunate that a relatively recent method – the Ponseti method – has been developed to treat and correct clubfoot without surgery. This is now considered the gold standard in treating clubfoot. And it takes away the need for surgery. The question is of access. The Ponseti method and the treatment of clubfoot require that all children who suffer from it are able to get a full course of treatment. This also requires several years of follow-up. If we want to succeed, we have to treat this like a mission – as was the case with polio or earlier smallpox.

 7.      That is why I am happy to learn that public hospitals are partnering with CURE International India to reach out to as many children as possible. Such collaborative efforts between the government and civil society organisations are heartening. The programme is now active in 29 states of India, with teachers in government medical colleges and doctors in the public health system participating.

8.      The programme began in 2009. In the eight years that it has been run, it has enrolled 40,000 children for treatment. Already, it is the largest such programme in the world. I congratulate all stakeholders in this programme – especially the National Health Mission, which has helped identify a large number of children with clubfoot. State governments too are to be commended for taking up the challenge of treatment in partnership with CURE International India.

 9.      And finally, we need to appreciate the professors, doctors and health workers in medical colleges and district hospitals across the country. They are our frontline soldiers against clubfoot.

10.  Despite these successes, we cannot ignore that at the current rate only 8,000 fresh cases are brought into the ambit of treatment every year. This is a small number if one considers the 50,000 children who are born annually in India with clubfoot. In 2022, India completes 75 years of its Independence. It should be a national resolve that by then every child born with clubfoot gets access to treatment services as soon as the condition is diagnosed.  

 11.  We owe it to the next generation to defeat and remove clubfoot from our list of public health challenges. We owe it to every child who suffers, and every mother and every father who winces in agony for his or her child. Like in the case of polio, this will need a multi-pronged, multi-stakeholder approach involving public and private agencies and health-care providers, government and civil society organisations – and frankly the efforts of our entire society.

12.  I am confident this can be done. We all know the history of clubfoot. By 2022, we simply have to make clubfoot history.

 

I wish all of you and this conference the very best

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

This affects the child’s mobility and confidence. Inevitably, education and schooling suffer – and the child cannot fulfil his or her potential.

The President said that in India the burden of disability affects more than 10 million people. The differently-abled or Divyang as we call them deserve equal opportunities in all avenues of life. Mainstreaming their social and professional experience is a commitment for all of us. Having said that, many of these disabilities are preventable or curable – which is often forgotten. Prevention, treatment and mainstreaming have to go in parallel.

The President said India is proud to have eradicated new cases of poliomyelitis. Polio was once a serious cause of loco-motor disability, but over the past six years we have not had a single case of paralytic poliomyelitis. This has been a major milestone in the history of public health not only in India but globally. It must motivate us to work towards eliminating other disabilities and other diseases and take on the challenge of clubfoot.

The President said he was happy to note that public hospitals are partnering with CURE International India to reach out to as many children as possible. The programme is now active in 29 states of India. He stated that despite these successes, we cannot ignore that at the current rate only 8,000 fresh cases are brought into the ambit of treatment every year. This is a small number if one considers the 50,000 children who are born annually in India with clubfoot. In 2022, India completes 75 years of its Independence. It should be a national resolve that by then every child born with clubfoot gets access to treatment services as soon as the condition is diagnosed.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must respect, preserve and propagate mother tongues, native and indigenous languages. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Centenary Celebrations of the Assam Sahitya Sabha, here today.



 

The Vice President quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying, “A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people”. He further said that similarly, literature not only encapsulates the fertile imagination of the writers and poets, but also reflects the realities of a society. It holds a mirror to the social mores, culture, ills and all that is good in a society, he added.

 

The Vice President complimented the Sabha for having published more than 10,000 books since its formation and also for playing a key role in the publication of Assamese dictionary ‘Chandrakanta Abhidan’.

 

The Vice President expressed happiness that Asam Sahitya Sabha has taken up the initiative to set up Assam Cultural University as an ambitious project to conduct studies on the cultural traits of various communities in India and South East Asia. He complimented the Sabha for working on ‘Encyclopedia of the Writers of Assam’ and ‘Encyclopedia of Tea & Tea Communities of Assam’.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely pleased to participate in the Centenary Celebrations of Asam Sahitya Sabha, which has played and is continuing to play a pioneering role in the development of Assamese language, literature and culture. Indeed 100 years is a major milestone in the journey of this illustrious organization and I convey my heartiest congratulations to all those associated with the Sabha on this momentous occasion.

 

“A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people” said Mahatma Gandhi. Similarly, literature not only encapsulates the fertile imagination of the writers and poets, but also reflects the realities of a society. It holds a mirror to the social mores, culture, ills and all that is good in a society. In other words, literature is the lifeblood of a society.

 

I am happy to know that Asam Sahitya Sabha was constituted with the aim of developing and enriching the Assamese language and literature and to bring all the indigenous languages under one umbrella. I am told that the other objectives of the Sabha include publishing books on folklore of Assam, dictionaries and taking up research in different areas of literature, language and culture.

 

I compliment the Sabha for having published more than 10,000 books since its formation and also for playing a key role in the publication of Assamese dictionary ‘Chandrakanta Abhidan’. I am told that it had also coordinated efforts to translate several important English and Sanskrit books in Assamese and that it has already published nine volumes of the World Encyclopedia in Assamese.

 

You are continuing a grand legacy of pioneers in the ‘Orundoi’ and ‘Jonaki’ era. You are carrying forth the spirit of the publishers of Jonaki magazine, who gave the slogan “Bhashaar bikash holehe jaateer bikash ho bo” (The nation develops only when the language develops).

 

Every effort has to be made to preserve and propagate mother tongues, native and indigenous languages. As I have been stating time and again, a person can articulate and express himself better when he or she speaks in mother tongue. I am not against learning English or other languages, but mother tongue should take precedence over all other languages.

 

In fact, I have been asking all States to teach their respective mother tongues as compulsory subjects in schools. The richness and the exact meaning conveyed by a person’s native language can never be substituted by any other language. It must be noted that language acts like a bridge and creates an emotional bonding between the people.

 

I am also happy to know that Asam Sahitya Sabha has taken up the initiative to set up Assam Cultural University as an ambitious project to conduct studies on the cultural traits of various communities in India and South East Asia. I compliment the Sabha for working on ‘Encyclopedia of the Writers of Assam’ and ‘Encyclopedia of Tea & Tea Communities of Assam’.

 

It is indeed a pleasure to honor and present awards to two of the leading personalities of Assam - senior journalist Shri G.L. Agarwalla and Col. Manoranjan Goswami. As mentioned in his profile, Shri. Agarwalla is a self-made man and pioneered the development of journalism in Assam through his media house, G L Publications. Apart from providing news to the nook and corner of Assam, he is also serving the people through his social activities which include the beautification of crematoria, creating ‘Veer Jawan Kosh’ and organizing healthcare programmes.

 

The other recipient of the special centenary honor, Col. Manoranjan Goswami is a noted writer and social worker. He has written over 150 short stories. He is associated with various organizations like Rotary Club, Patriotic Forum of India and Bharat Vikash Parishad.

 

My heartiest congratulations to the two awardees and to the Asam Sahitya Sabha on its achievements over the last 100 years. I wish you many more fruitful years of service to language, culture and the creation of a healthy, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous society.

 

JAI HIND!”

	स्वाधीन भारत के प्रथम राष्ट्रपति की पुण्य स्मृति में आकाशवाणी द्वारा आयोजित इस व्याख्यान के माध्यम से 'भारत का रूपांतरण' विषय पर सुधी श्रोताओं के साथ अपने विचार साझा करने पर मुझे हर्ष हो रहा है।
	डॉ0 राजेंद्र प्रसाद आजीवन स्वर्णिम स्वतंत्र भारत के लिए समर्पित रहे। एक छात्र कार्यकर्ता से लेकर स्वाधीन भारत के राष्ट्रपति होने की यात्रा, उनकी अदम्य क्षमता, देश और समाज के प्रति उनके संकल्प और प्रतिबद्धता की महान गाथा है। यह भारतीय राजनीति में निहित लोकतांत्रिक मूल्यों को भी दर्शाती है जहाँ एक छात्र कार्यकर्ता अपने दृढ़ संकल्प और सेवा तत्परता के कारण स्वाधीन भारत का प्रथम राष्ट्रपति बन सका।
	भारत पिछले सत्तर सालों में बदल गया है और हर क्षण रूपांतरित  हो रहा है।
	श्रोताओं, केवल तुलनात्मक आंकड़ों से ही इस रूपांतरण की तस्वीर साफ नहीं हो सकेगी। समाज में रूपांतरण संख्यात्मक ही नहीं गुणात्मक भी होता है और उसे पहचानना आवश्यक है।
	मई 1952 में पहली लोकसभा के निर्वाचन के बाद, नव निर्वाचित सांसदों को पहली बार संबोधित करते हुए राजेंद्र बाबू ने देश की खाद्यान्न समस्या पर गहरी चिंता व्यक्त की थी। उस समय भारत की सकल राष्ट्रीय आय सिर्फ़ 03 लाख करोड़ रुपये थी और देश महंगे खाद्यान्न का आयात कर रहा था। उस स्थिति से आज हम कृषि खाद्यान्न में स्वावलंबी बने हैं। हरित क्रांति की सफलता के बाद, श्वेत क्रांति के माध्यम से आज भारत पूरे विश्व में दूध का सबसे बड़ा उत्पादक देश है। नीली क्रांति से मत्स्यपालन को बढ़ावा दिया जा रहा है। दलहन और तिलहन में आत्मनिर्भरता की ओर भी देश अग्रसर हैं। खाद्यान्न की उत्पादकता से  आज हम खाद्य प्रसंस्करण क्षेत्र को विकसित कर रहे हैं। आज हमारे देश की सकल राष्ट्रीय आय 120 लाख करोड़ तक पहुँच गई है।
	प्रारंभ की पंचवर्षीय योजनाओं में औद्योगिकरण तथा सरकारी उपक्रमों को स्थापित करने पर जोर दिया गया। पहले देश की अर्थव्यवस्था अंतर्मुखी थी तथा विश्व बाजार से कटी हुई थी।  औद्योगिक स्वावलंबन प्राप्त करने के उद्देश्य से आयात के विकल्प पर बल दिया गया। आज “मेक इन इंडिया” के तहत हम विदेशी निर्माताओं को देश में उद्योग लगाने के लिए आमंत्रित कर रहे हैं और विदेशी पूँजी को देश के त्वरित विकास के लिए इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं। 
	हमने कई क्षेत्रों में FDI की  सीमा 100% तक बढ़ा दी है। आज भारत विश्व अर्थव्यवस्था में अहम भूमिका निभा रहा है। हमारे पास US$370 बिलियन से अधिक विदेशी मुद्रा कोष है। भारत की अर्थव्यवस्था आज विश्व अर्थव्यवस्था का 'पावर इंजिन' के रूप में जानी जाती है। 1991 से देश की अर्थनीति में उदारीकरण के पश्चात् हमने अपनी अर्थव्यवस्था को विश्व की अर्थव्यवस्था से जोड़ने का काम किया है। यह हमारे लिए एक बड़ी चुनौती थी।
	हम आज विश्व व्यापार संगठन में बराबर के हिस्सेदार हैं। अपने हितों के संरक्षण के लिए हम विश्व व्यापार संगठन की वार्ताओं में बराबर आवाज़ उठाते हैं। हम विकसित देशों से उनकी अर्थव्यवस्था को हमारे देश के लिए खोलने का आग्रह  करते हैं। हम अपने परंपरागत ज्ञान, शिल्प और कारीगरी को बौद्धिक संपदा के रूप में प्रयोग कर रहे हैं, जिससे परंपरागत समूहों और समाज को इस संपदा का लाभ मिल सके। इसी प्रकार पर्यावरण तथा जलवायु परिवर्तन जैसी अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समझौतों पर भी हम अपनी जिम्मेदारी निभाते हुए नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा का विस्तार कर रहे हैं। परिणामस्वरूप भारत के नेतृत्व में आज अंतरराष्ट्रीय सोलर संगठन बना और उसका मुख्यालय भारत में स्थापित किया गया।
	अंतरिक्ष विज्ञान के क्षेत्र में हमारी सफलताएँ हमारे देश निर्माताओं को गौरवान्वित करती हैं। आज हम न केवल अपने बल्कि विकसित देशों के उपग्रह भी प्रक्षेपित कर रहे हैं। एक ही उड़ान में सर्वाधिक 104 उपग्रह  प्रक्षेपण का रिकार्ड ISRO की प्रशंसनीय उपलब्धि है।
	विश्व शांति के संस्कार, हमें पीढ़ियों से प्राप्त हुए हैं। हर पीढ़ी ने इस धरोहर का संरक्षण किया है। संकीर्ण  धार्मिक, राजनैतिक विश्व में भारत शांति का संदेश निरंतर देता रहा है। शांति, सद्भावना और विश्व को एक परिवार मानना हमारे सनातन संस्कृति का मूल स्तंभ रहा है। शांतिपूर्ण सहअस्तित्व के मूलभूत सिद्वांतों का पालन करते हुए हमने सदैव ही संयुक्त राष्ट्र के शांति प्रयास में अपना योगदान दिया है। हमारे लिए यह गर्व का विषय है कि 71 राष्ट्र शांति मिशन में से, लगभग 50 मिशनों में भारत की भागीदारी रही है। कम ही श्रोताओं को ज्ञात होगा कि भारत पहला देश था जिसने राष्ट्र के शांति दस्ते में महिलाओं का दस्ता भेजा था। उसके बाद अनेक देशों ने हमारा अनुसरण किया।
	इस संदर्भ में हाल की एक महत्वपूर्ण घटना का जिक्र करना चाहूँगा। हमारे देश के प्रतिनिधि न्यायमूर्ति श्री दलबीर भंडारी अंतर्राष्ट्रीय न्यायालय (International Court of Justice) में पुनर्निवाचित हुए हैं। अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय न्यायालय के 71 वर्षों के इतिहास में पहली बार ब्रिटेन का कोई प्रतिनिधि नहीं है। भारत की इस उपलब्धि को विश्व राजनीति में बदलते समीकरणों के रूप में देखा जा रहा है जिसमें भारत एक जिम्मेदार और आर्थिक एवं सामरिक रूप से शक्तिशाली राष्ट्र के तौर पर उदय हो रहा है। रूपांतरण  का इससे बड़ा उदाहरण क्या होगा कि भारत के औपनिवेशिक शासक आज भारत से मैत्री को महत्व दे रहे हैं।
	राजेंद्र बाबू तथा उनके पीढ़ी के राजनेताओं ने उपनिवेशवाद के विरुद्ध जिस यज्ञ का प्रारंभ किया था, वह सफल हो रहा है। अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर भारत आज बड़ी आर्थिक शक्ति के तौर पर उभर रहा है। इसके आर्थिक महाशक्ति बनने से दक्षिण एशियाई देशों के बीच भारत की स्थिति बड़े भाई जैसी है और इसीलिये यह दक्षिण एशियाई देशों खासकर अफ़गानिस्तान के पुनर्निर्माण, भारत-बंगला देश के बीच पानी के बँटवारे को लेकर उत्पन्न समस्या के निराकरण तथा भारत-नेपाल के बीच आर्थिक सहयोग को बढ़ावा देकर भारत दक्षिण एशियाई देशों के विकास में महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दे रहा है।
	गत कुछ वर्षों से हमने पिछले अनुभवों के आधार पर उदारीकरण को तेज और उत्तरदायी बनाने के लिए वैधानिक कदम उठाये हैं। पुराने कानूनों को निरस्त कर नये कानूनों और नीतियों को लाया जा रहा है। नयी नीतियों की कारगर समीक्षा की जा रही है। लोकतांत्रिक शासन को सुशासन बनाने की दिशा में कारगर कदम उठाये जा रहे हैं। स्वराज्य का लाभ और आनन्द सभी भारतीयों को प्राप्त हो। इस महत्वाकांक्षा से सुराज्य को सुदृढ़ करने के अनेक प्रयास हम कर रहे हैं।
	प्रिय देशवासियों, भारत के बदलाव की इस प्रक्रिया में पिछले लगभग तीन दशकों में सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी की भूमिका अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण रही है। सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी की इस क्रांति का प्रयोग केंद्र व विभिन्न राज्य सरकारों द्वारा बड़े पैमाने पर जनमानस के सामान्य जीवन को सुविधाजनक व सरल बनाने के लिए किया जा रहा है। सरकारों द्वारा नागरिकों को प्रदान की जा रही विभिन्न सेवाओं को निरंतर ई-गवर्नेंस के दायरे में लाया जा रहा है। ई-गवर्नेंस प्रदान करने की केंद्र व राज्य सरकारों की मुहिम नागरिकों को सुशासन प्रदान करने में सहायक सिद्ध होगी, ऐसी मेरी पूरी आशा है।
	इन प्रयासों में केंद्र सरकार की 'डिजिटल इंडिया' योजना उल्लेखनीय है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि आने वाले दिनों में भारत एक पूर्णत: डिजिटल समाज और राष्ट्र के रूप में विश्व पटल पर उभरेगा। अपने इस प्रयास में हमें अपने ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों की ओर विशेष ध्यान देना होगा। चूँकि हमारी जनसंख्या का एक बहुत बड़ा हिस्सा गाँवों में रहता है इसलिए डिजिटल इंडिया के हमारे सपने को तभी साकार किया जा सकता है जब हम अपने गाँवों को अपने 'डिजिटल मानचित्र' पर जल्द से जल्द ले आएँ।
	डिजिटल लेन-देन को बढ़ावा देने भारतीय प्रतिभा को विश्व के समक्ष प्रतिस्पर्द्धी बनाने के लिए शत-प्रतिशत साक्षरता का लक्ष्य प्राप्त करना होगा। आज़ादी के बाद लंबे समय तक हमने अंग्रेजों से प्राप्त अफसरशाही तथा उसी कार्यप्रणाली को बनाये रखा। बदलती जरूरतों के साथ लालफीताशाही को काटना आवश्यक था। गुड गवर्नेंस को सक्षमता, पारदर्शिता, कुशलता के मानकों पर आंका जाना अपेक्षित था। डिजिटल इंडिया तथा ई-गवर्नेंस को हर स्तर पर बड़े पैमाने पर लागू किया जा रहा है। बैंकिंग, कराधान, विदेश व्यापार, यातायात आदि अनेक क्षेत्रों में ई-प्रोसेस प्रारंभ हो गये हैं। अनेक सरकारी सेवाओं और आंकड़ों को अंकीकरण कर दिया गया है। इससे सरकारी तंत्र और जनता के बीच सम्पर्क कम हुआ  है और अधिकार का क्षेत्र कम कर, नियम आधारित सुशासन लागू किया जा रहा है। सूचना के अधिकार के माध्यम से प्रशासन में पारदर्शिता और जवाबदेही सुनिश्चित की गई है।
	लोकतांत्रिक सरकार से अपेक्षित है कि वह अंत्योदय के आदर्श पर कार्य करे। आम आदमी के रोजमर्रा के संघर्षों से लोकतांत्रिक सरकार का सरोकार होना ही चाहिए। अपने परिवेश में स्वच्छता कौन नहीं चाहता? खुले में शौच से मुक्ति महिलाओं और बालिकाओं की सुरक्षा कारणों से सरकार के स्वच्छ भारत अभियान को व्यापक जनसमर्थन मिला है। 1300 शहर खुले में शौच से मुक्त घोषित कर दिये गये हैं। शहरों में 4 लाख से अधिक निजी शौचालय बनाए गये हैं। मुझे हर्ष है कि गांवों में यह अभियान शहरों से भी अधिक सफल हुआ है। लगभग 5.5 करोड़ निजी शौचालयों का निर्माण किया गया है। लगभग 2.75 लाख ग्रामों को खुले में शौच से मुक्त  घोषित किया गया है। 'नमामि गंगे' के तहत भी 4400 गांवों को खुले में शौच से मुक्त  घोषित किया गया है। जिसमें नदियों को निर्मल करने में सहायता मिलेगी।
	लिंगानुपात महिलाओं के विकास और सशक्तिकरण की दिशा में एक अड़चन है। आज कन्या भ्रूण  हत्या कानूनी अपराध है, परंतु इस पर पूरी तरह अंकुश लगाने में हम सफल नहीं हो पाये हैं। 'बेटी बचाओ, बेटी पढ़ाओ' जैसे सकारात्मक अभियान से आज समाज का दृष्टिकोण महिलाओं के प्रति बदला है।  
	समाज और सरकार के संयुक्त प्रयासों से आज महिलाओं के प्रति एक अनुकूल वातावरण बन रहा है। हरियाणा जैसे पारंपरिक समाज में, महिलाओं का लिंगानुपात  कई वर्षों में पहली बार 900 के ऊपर हो गया है।
	Dr. Rajendra Prasad and Pandit Nehru had different views on certain issues including inauguration of the rebuilt Somnath Temple in Gujarat.
	Both Dr. Rajendra Prasad and Sardar Vallabhai Patel felt the reconstruction ought to be done quickly because it was a matter of ‘Rashtriya Swabhiman’, and with K.M. Munshi who also wanted to see Somnath Reconstructed swiftly.  In that sense Sardar Patel, Rajendra Babu and Munshi thought alike because the dilapidated condition of the Somnath Mandir troubled them no end.
	President Rajendra Prasad participated in the ceremony to re-install the Somnath Lingam on May 11, 1951. At the inaugural ceremony, Rajendra Prasad said that although monuments can be destroyed, the bond that people have with their culture and faith can never be destroyed.
	भारत युवा देश है। यहाँ 65 प्रतिशत आबादी युवाओं की है। इनमें अदम्य शक्ति और विश्वास है। उपरोक्त लक्ष्य को प्राप्त करने के लिए युवाओं में भारत भूमि, भारतीय संस्कृति, समाज तथा भारतीय जीवन मूल्यों के प्रति आस्था पैदा करना आवश्यक है। भारत को विकास के मार्ग पर प्रशस्त करने के लिए युवाओं की भूमिका महत्वपूर्ण है। यह हमारी जनसांख्यिकीय लाभांश है। विकास में इनकी भागीदारी सुनिश्चित करने के लिए इन युवाओं को कुशल बनाने पर जोर देने की दिशा में कौशल विकास की एक रूपरेखा तैयार की गयी है।  इसके अतिरिक्त, स्वरोजगार बढ़ाने के लिए मुद्रा योजना द्वारा महिला उद्यमी एवं SC/ST उद्यमी को लाभ पहुँचा है। 
	देश के युवाओं को स्वरोजगार के प्रति प्रेरित करने के लिए उनमें उद्यमिता को बढ़ाने के लिए र्स्टाट अप इंडिया जैसी योजना लागू की गई। आइडिया को इनोवेशन तक तथा इनोवेशन को इंटरप्राइसेस तक  विकसित करने में यह योजना कारगर साबित होगी। 
	कस्बों और गांवों के उद्यमियों को आसान शर्तों पर बैंक ऋण उपलब्ध कराने के लिए जनधन योजना के तहत उनको बैंकिंग व्यवस्था में शामिल किया जा रहा है। इसके अंतर्गत अब तक लगभग 30 करोड़ से अधिक नये खाते खोले गये जिनमें लगभग 68000 करोड़ रुपये की धनराशि जमा की गई है। जनसंख्या का एक बड़ा वर्ग बैंकिंग व्यवस्था में शामिल हुआ है।
	यह प्रसन्नता की बात है कि इस वर्ष विश्व बैंक की कार्य करने की सुगमता की सूची में हम 100वें स्थान पर पहुँच गए हैं। हमारा उद्देश्य  विश्व की पहली 50 अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में पहुँचना है। व्यवसाय और स्वरोजगार से ही बेरोजगारी की समस्या का निदान होगा।
	भारत देश की कर पद्वति का एक महत्वपूर्ण दूरदर्शी रूपांतरण हो रहा है जी एस टी के माध्यम से। 01 जुलाई, 2017 से देश में लागू हुई GST से 'एक देश, एक बाज़ार' का स्वप्न साकार हुआ। पहली बार राज्यों के साथ  एक नई व्यवस्था द्वारा जीएसटी काउंसिल स्थापित की गई जो जीएसटी की दरों पर निर्णय लेगी। यह व्यवस्था सहयोगी संघवाद का एक अप्रतिम उदाहरण है। नई व्यवस्था लागू करने में कठिनाइयां आना  स्वाभाविक है - कर अधिकारियों तथा कर दाताओं - दोनों के लिए। लेकिन यह देशवासियों के हित में है और भारत की आर्थिक व्यवस्था को परिपुष्ट करने के लिए उपयोगी सिद्ध हो सकती है।
	आजादी के समय हमारी अर्थव्यवस्था कृषि आधारित थी। आज भी अधिकांश जनसंख्या गावों में वास करती है। लेकिन गत दशकों में शहरीकरण तेजी से बढ़ा है। आज शहरों को 'इंजिन ऑफ ग्रोथ' के रूप में विकसित किया जा रहा है। देश की 2/3 GDP और 90% राजस्व शहरों से आता है। लेकिन शहरीकरण के साथ शहरी इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर को सशक्त करने की आवश्यकता है। स्मार्ट सिटी, अमृत, हृदय जैसी योजनायें इसी दिशा में प्रयास है।
	सबसे महत्वपूर्ण प्रयास ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों को कनेक्टिविटी प्रदान कर अर्थव्यवस्था की मूलधारा से जोड़ने के लिए किये गये हैं। आज हम 18000 गांवों का विद्युतीकरण कर रहे हैं। देश की 685 मंडियों को E-NAM के माध्यम से डिजिटली जोड़ा जा रहा है जिससे किसानों को अपने उत्पाद के लिए व्यापक बाजार उपलब्ध होगा। लगभग 1.67  लाख रिहाइशी इलाकों  को ग्रामीण सड़क योजना  के तहत जोड़ने का लक्ष्य है। 
	आज देश में 55 लाख किलोमीटर  सड़कों का जाल है जिसमें  1.14लाख किलोमीटर राष्ट्रीय राजमार्ग, 1.61 लाख किमी. राज्य राजमार्ग तथा लगभग 4 लाख किमी. ग्रामीण सड़कें हैं। 76000 गांवों को आप्टीकल फाइबर कनेक्टिविटी से जोड़ा गया है। जनधन योजना के तहत खोले गये खातों से बड़े पैमाने पर गावों का वित्तीय समावेशन हुआ है। गाँव जितने अर्थव्यवस्था से जुड़ेंगे, उतना अर्थव्यवस्था में विस्तार होगा और स्थायित्व आयेगा। आज देश में विद्युत आपूर्ति की कमी नहीं है। मार्च 2019 तक हर गाँव, हर शहर के हर घर तक सस्ते दर पर बिजली पहुँचाने का लक्ष्य है।
	मनरेगा तथा खाद्य सुरक्षा कानून के तहत कमजोर तबकों के लिए रोजगार तथा पोषण को सुनिश्चित किया जा रहा है। नि:संदेह हम अन्त्योदय के आदर्श पर नया भारत बनाने की दिशा में अग्रसर हैं। 
	हमारे लिए गर्व का विषय है कि भारत आज विश्व का सबसे बड़ा लोकतंत्र है। आज विश्व में भारत को एक आदर्श-प्रजातंत्र के रूप में देखा जा रहा है जिसने सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों को जो विभिन्न जातियों, धर्मों, समुदायों, भाषाओं से तालुक रखते हैं; एक संवैधानिक एवं लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था में पिरो कर रखा है।   संविधान में 73वें और 74वें संशोधन के माध्यम से पंचायती राज की स्थापना की गई। महिलाओं को 33% आरक्षण देकर पंचायती राज संस्थाओं को महिला के राजनैतिक सशक्तिकरण का माध्यम बनाया गया। इस अनुभव को संसद और विधान सभाओं में भी लागू करने पर विचार करना चाहिए।
	श्रोताओं, विकास का प्रवाह सतत् है, इसमें चुनौतियाँ ही अवसर प्रदान करती हैं। हमारे समक्ष भी  बहुत चुनौतियाँ हैं जैसे :


काला धन और भ्रष्टाचार - मुक्त बाजार व्यवस्था के लिए अभीष्ट और वैधानिक नियंत्रण के अभाव में, भ्रष्टाचार बढ़ा। पुराने कानूनों के स्थान पर नये विधान लाना तथा उनकी सतत् निरीक्षण जरूरी है। काला धन हमारी अर्थव्यवस्था को खोखला कर रहा है। विमुद्रीकरण के बाद से, इनकम टैक्स रिटर्न फाइलिंग  में 25% की वृद्धि तथा एडवांस टैक्स कलेक्शन में 41% की वृद्धि, काले धन के विरुद्ध विमुद्रीकरण की सफलता को इंगित करता है। देशवासियों से मेरा आग्रह है कि वे लैस-कैश इकानामी की तरफ अग्रसर हो तथा डिजिटल मोड से कारोबार करे।

कृषि और किसानों की समस्या - यद्यपि हम खाद्यान्न में आत्मनिर्भर हो गये हैं फिर भी आज कृषि सबसे जोखिम भरा व्यवसाय है। किसान आज भी मौसम और सरकार पर निर्भर है। आवश्यक है कि  कृषि में निवेश बढ़े, किसानों की मौसम पर निर्भरता कम हो, सिंचाई के साधन विकसित हों, किसान को फसल के लिए बाजार और मूल्य मिले। भूमिहीन  और छोटे किसानों में अधिकांश  को साहूकारों और अनधिकृत स्रोतों  से ही ऋण लेना पड़े। इस स्थिति को बदलना ही होगा। साथ ही ग्रामीण क्षेत्र में व्यवसायों और कृषि का विविधीकरण करके, खेती पर निर्भरता को कम करना होगा। खाद्य प्रसंस्करण पर भी अधिक ध्यान देना होगा।

आतंकवाद, नक्सलवाद, अतिवाद जैसी विभाजनकारी प्रवृतियाँ - देश गत 40 वर्षों से सीमा पार आतंकवाद, देश में पनप रहे नक्सलवाद, क्षेत्रीयवाद जैसी विभाजनकारी प्रवृत्तियों से जूझ रहा है। हमारे सुरक्षाबलों ने अदम्य साहस और कर्तव्यनिष्ठा से इन प्रवृत्तियों पर समय रहते काबू पाया है। फिर भी सीमा पार आतंकवाद को समाप्त करने के लिए वैश्विक सहमति और कार्य योजना की आवश्यकता है। देश में राजनैतिक हिंसा का विष फैल रहा है और इसे तत्काल रोका जाना चाहिए। 

आधारभूत ढाँचे का विकास -- यद्यपि विश्व बैंक की 2016 की संभारिकी-निष्पादन में भारत 36 वें स्थान पर पहुँच गया, फिर भी यदि भारत को तीव्र विकास  दर को बनाये रखना हे तो इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर डवलेपमेंट में निवेश करना होगा। इसमें भारी पूँजी निवेश और तकनीकी ज्ञान की आवश्यकता होगी।

सामाजिक क्षेत्र में निवेश -- शिक्षा, स्वास्थ्य सहित सामाजिक क्षेत्र में हमारा निवेश कुल जीडीपी का केवल 7.4% है जिसमें शिक्षा पर GDP का 3.2% और स्वास्थ्य पर मात्र 1.5% व्यय किया जाता है। यह स्थिति सुधरनी ही चाहिए।


	मुझे विश्वास है कि चुनी हुई लोकतांत्रिक सरकारों इन चुनौतियों के प्रति सजग रहें और इन चुनौतियों को विकास के अवसर में बदलें। इन चुनौतियों का सामना सब भारतवासियों को संघटित रूप से करना चाहिए। जटिल समस्याओं का समाधान ढूँढना चाहिए।
	श्रोताओं,  26 नवंबर, 1949 को संविधान सभा ने संविधान का अनुमोदन किया। इस अवसर पर अपने अध्यक्षीय उद्बोधन में डॉ0 राजेंद्र प्रसाद ने पूरे संविधान के पीछे दर्शन और संवैधानिक आस्थाओं का सटीक विश्लेषण किया जो भावी नीति-निर्माताओं और न्यायविदों के लिए मार्गदर्शक है। उन्होंने कहा :


अंतत: कोई संविधान किसी मशीन की भांति निर्जीव वस्तु ही है। यह मानवों के द्वारा जीवन अर्जित करता है जो इस पर नियंत्रण रखते हैं, और इसे प्रचालित करते हैं। भारत को आज केवल कुछ ईमानदार व्यक्तियों की आवश्यकता है जिनके लिए देश हित सर्वोपरि हो।


	2022 में स्वाधीनता के 75 वर्ष पूर्ण होंगे। विकास की यात्रा तो सतत और शाश्वत है। आवश्यक है कि हमारे प्रयास ईमानदार हों, कारगर हों तथा जनकल्याण के लिए हों। लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था के नेतृत्व की इन लक्ष्यों के प्रति प्रतिबद्धता बहुत आवश्यक है।
	हम सब एक रूपांतरित भारत देखना चाहते हैं। स्वच्छ भारत, स्वस्थ भारत, साक्षर भारत, सक्षम भारत, सशक्त भारत, समरस भारत हमारा सपना है। सब भारतवासी यही कामना कर रहे हैं। यदि मन में सुदृढ़ संकल्प, हृदय में सुहृद भावना और कार्य में दक्षता हो तो यह सपना साकार हो सकता है।
	सहयोगी संघवाद के साथ साथ प्रतियोगी संघवाद की भी आवश्यकता है। राज्यों के बीच विकास की ओर अग्रसर होने की आकांक्षा प्रबल होनी चाहिए। राज्यों के बीच में विकास की गति को बढ़ाने के लिए स्पर्धा हो तो देश की उन्नति भी गतिशीलता के साथ हो सकेगी।
	दुनिया के विचार केन्द्र में आज अर्थ, विज्ञान तथा राजनीति है। लेकिन मानवता की रक्षा सिर्फ इन तीन विचार बिन्दुओं तक सीमित नहीं हो सकती। इनके अलावा भी बहुत कुछ है जो जीवन को स्थायित्व देता है। इसके लिए भारतीय दर्शन, संस्कृति, समाज तथा जीवन मूल्यों के प्रति समझ पैदा करना जरूरी है।
	21वीं सदी भारत की सदी होगी। यह लक्ष्य भारतीय दर्शन, संस्कृति, मूल्यों तथा समाज के स्थिर स्वरूप की बुनियाद पर ही प्राप्त हो सकता है।
	03 दिसंबर को राजेंद्र बाबू की 133वीं जन्म जयंती के अवसर पर, मैं आशा करता हूँ कि भारतीय संसद और सरकार, उनकी अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप देश का रूपांतरण करने के पुण्य कार्य में आगामी वर्षों में अत्यधिक श्रद्धा और निष्ठा से जुट जाएंगे। मैं इस व्याख्यान को डॉ0 राजेंद्र प्रसाद की पुण्य स्मृति को समर्पित करता हूँ।


धन्यवाद ! जय हिंद !

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have to be strengthened to play a bigger role in the country’s economic prosperity. He was addressing the 21st International Conference on Small and Medium Enterprises, organized by the World Association for Small and Medium Enterprises (WASME), here today. The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, the Minister of Industry, Government of Bangladesh, Mr. Amir Hossain Amu, the Minister of Business, Enterprise and Co-operatives, Government of Mauritius, Mr. Soomilduth Bholah, the President of WASME, Mr. Alhaji Babale Umaru Girei and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that the SMEs contribute up to 45 per cent of India’s GDP and employs nearly 46 crore people, which is the second largest workforce in the country after the agricultural sector, and is growing at 11.5 per cent annually. The theme of the conference - “Achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization by promoting SMEs” was aptly chosen as climate change and global warming are stark realities affecting the people, fauna and flora all over the world, he added.

 The Vice President said that in sustaining this planet and ensuring a greener future for posterity, the SMEs can play a crucial role by adopting practices that will not impact the environment and harm the present and future generations. Countries will have to strengthen their capabilities and explore new ways to solve development challenges, by involving various actors, processes and types of governance, source of finance and encouraging collaboration and cooperation across stakeholders, sectors and regions, he added.

 The Vice President expressed his confidence that this global convention will serve as an important platform for various stakeholders to network, share their experiences and more importantly to highlight and emulate good practices. He further said that this conference in India has great significance for both India and other participating countries as India has achieved a remarkable improvement in “Ease of Doing Business” ranking from 130 to 100. India is also focusing on creating an ecosystem for promoting entrepreneurship SME sector, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be here to inaugurate the 21st International Conference on Small and Medium Enterprises (ICSME) organized by the World Association for Small and Medium Enterprises (WASME).

 I must take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts of WASME in having successfully organized 20 such international conferences in different countries earlier.

I am happy that this year, the prestigious global conference has returned to India. It is indeed a great platform to discuss, exchange and deliberate many key initiatives taken for SME development across the world. 

I also feel honored to have Mr. Soomilduth Bholah, Hon’ble Minister, Ministry of Business, Enterprise and Co-operatives, Government of Mauritius and Mr. Amir Hossain Amu, Hon’ble Minister, Ministry of Industry, Government of Bangladesh as Guests of Honour for this flagship annual event. 

 We know that formal SMEs contribute up to 60 per cent of total employment and up to 40 per cent of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. In India, they contribute up to 45 per cent of its GDP. The Indian SME sector employs nearly 46 crore people, which is the second largest workforce in the country after the agricultural sector, and is growing at 11.5 per cent annually.

According to estimates of the World Bank, 600 million jobs will be needed in the next 15 years to absorb the growing global workforce, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In emerging markets, most formal jobs are generated by SMEs, which also create 4 out of 5 new positions.  The SMEs represent the backbone of global economic activity and play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and ensuring inclusive economic growth. Apart from generating employment and wealth, SMEs play a critical role in equitable distribution of growth.

 Undoubtedly, they face constraints in accessing finance and taxation issues. They are also handicapped by skill gaps, poor technology, regulatory complexities and trade barriers. The challenges faced by SMEs need to be addressed to enable them realize their full potential and play a bigger role in the country’s economic prosperity.

 The theme of the conference--“Achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization by promoting SMEs” is very close to my heart. Today, climate change and global warming are stark realities affecting the people, fauna and flora all over the world. Till a few decades ago, discussions on these topics remained confined to scientific conferences as the general public either remained blissfully indifferent or were not fully aware about the disastrous consequences. But gradually people have started to realize the dangers of indiscriminate depletion of natural resources and that it cannot be business as usual. In sustaining this planet and ensuring a greener future for posterity, the SMEs can play a crucial role by adopting practices that will not impact the environment and harm the present and future generations.

I applaud WASME for this initiative as integrating the crucial agenda of SME development with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is critical in addressing the challenges faced by planet earth and in chalking out a road map for the future. It is quite apparent that the policies relating to SME development will have to be centred around sustainability. No doubt, industrial growth and creating more jobs are important, but the future cannot be jeopardized for the present.

 According to the United Nations, the global population is expected to cross 9 billion by 2050. Imagine the stress on natural resources and raw materials, which are being consumed faster than the rate at which they can be regenerated.

 The United Nations had adopted the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” in September 2015. This universal agenda has provided the base that the countries may adopt in economic, social and environmental spheres while formulating the national development strategies.

In the context of SDGs, inclusive and sustainable industrialization and SME development must be the primary development agenda of the national governments, so as to address the critical issues around economic growth, job creation, social stability, and environmental protection.

 Among 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets, there are many goals that have a bearing on SME development, especially SDG 9 that is built on three pillars–infrastructure, industry and innovation–all of which are strongly connected among themselves and share the common goal of achieving socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic development.

 Although, over the past decade, regions such as East and South Asia have made remarkable progress in achieving development goals in the areas of infrastructure, industrialization and innovation, achieving SDG9 by 2030 will require addressing a range of resource constraints, especially in the context of developing countries, vulnerable countries including the least developed countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

 Countries will have to strengthen their capabilities and explore new ways to solve development challenges, by involving various actors, processes and types of governance, source of finance and encouraging collaboration and cooperation across stakeholders, sectors and regions.

 By adopting SDG9, in particular, the global community has committed to an industrial development paradigm that is inclusive and sustainable. It is also imperative to forge linkages with all other SDGs as regards job creation, sustainable livelihoods, SME development, better health, technology and skills development as well as food security, green technologies, environmental protection, building resilient cities and climate change mitigation.

I am sure that this global convention will serve as an important platform for various stakeholders to network, share their experiences and more importantly to highlight and emulate good practices.

 I particularly feel that hosting this ICSME in India has great significance for both India and other participating countries as India has achieved a remarkable improvement in “Ease of Doing Business” ranking from 130 to 100. We are also focusing on creating an ecosystem for promoting entrepreneurship SME sector.

 Once again, I appreciate WASME for this great initiative and for being at the forefront of SME development both nationally and internationally.

 I wish WASME and ICSME all the success and I look forward to specific recommendations for pursuing an all inclusive, resource-efficient and sustainable development strategy.

 I thank all the participants from different countries for traveling to India for ICSME and hope everyone enjoys the rich culture, heritage, food and comfortable stay during the conference. 

 

Thank you for your kind attention.

 

JAI HIND!”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education is the most powerful weapon which can transform the world. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Andhra Pradesh Campus of Vellore Institute of Technology, in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh today. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Chandarababu Naidu, the Mininster for Health and Medical Education, Dr. Kamineni Srinivas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that educational institutions are the temples of learning and every student, who steps into them, must not only show respect to the Gurus, but also display complete dedication and discipline towards the entire process of learning. He further said that as per our ancient Guru-Shishya parampara, the teacher is the most venerated person by the disciple. Although modern day students get all the information they require at the click of a mouse by going to Google, it should be noted that Google can never replace a Guru, he added.

 

The Vice President said that he firmly believed that Education is for Emancipation, Enlightenment, Empowerment, Employment and Empathy. He further said that education should become a powerful tool of social, cultural and economical transformation of the country with strong moral and ethical values forming the basis of such a transformation. Technology is changing so rapidly that students not only need to anticipate the future requirements but must be able to develop the technologies of tomorrow, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India is also now in an advantageous position with 65 per cent of the population below 35 years. Higher Educational institutions and universities have a crucial role to play in unleashing their energies and realizing the demographic dividend, he added.

 

The Vice President stressed on the Four Pillars of Learning as enunciated in 1996 UNESCO Commission on Education:

1.   Learning to Know (KNOWLEDGE)

2.   Learning to do (SKILLS)

3.   Learning to be (PERSONALITY)

4.   Learning to live together (Understanding, appreciation of interdependence)

 

In a lighter note, the Vice President said that he was told that VIT stands for Vellore Institute of Technology but he wished that this AP Campus of VIT will stand for:

•     VISION

•     INNOVATION

•     TRANSFORMATION of the students entering this institute.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

"" I am extremely delighted to inaugurate the new campus of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) in Andhra Pradesh’s new capital, Amaravati, which is envisaged to be developed into an educational hub by the Andhra Pradesh Government. VIT is one of the top educational institutes in the country and has carved a niche for itself in providing quality learning to students.

 

Merely having grand and swanky buildings will not make an institution famous. It is the quality of education, the presence of good faculty, right ambience and ecosystem for students to unleash their creativity and genius are important. VIT has an impressive record on this score, I believe.

 

Educational institutions are the temples of learning and every student, who steps into them, must not only show respect to the Gurus, but also display complete dedication and discipline towards the entire process of learning.

 

As per our ancient Guru-Shishya parampara, the teacher is the most venerated person by the disciple. Although modern day students get all the information they require at the click of a mouse by going to Google, it should be noted that Google can never replace a Guru.

 

I firmly believe that Education is for


	Emancipation
	Enlightenment
	Empowerment
	Employment
	Empathy


 

As the Indian Education Commission of 1964-66, also known as the Kothari Commission, had stated that the destiny of our country is being shaped in our classrooms.

 

No doubt, the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired by students form the basis for nation building. 

 

Education should become a powerful tool of social, cultural and economical transformation of the country with strong moral and ethical values forming the basis of such a transformation. As a result of several initiatives taken by successive governments with the goal of ensuring ‘Education for All’, the country has several hundred universities. But numbers are not important, what matters is the quality.

 

There is every need for the institutions of higher learning to raise the standards, improve methods of pedagogy, enhance research activities and form greater linkages with the industry so that the students are well equipped to face the challenges of a globalised world in which digital technologies are playing a leading role. 

 

Technology is changing so rapidly that students not only need to anticipate the future requirements but must be able to develop the technologies of tomorrow.

 

Basically, the universities must produce multi-skilled students of tomorrow and for that to happen, the varsities must convert themselves into centres of excellence.  The Industries must also come forward to fund research activities in universities.

 

India has a rich and glorious tradition of learning which focussed on the development of the inner self of the student.

 

The education system developed by the British was aimed at serving them rather than benefiting the country. At the time of Independence, India had only around 20 universities and 500 affiliated colleges with a meager enrolment of less than one lakh students. The education system of those days was narrow and elitist.

 


	Today, India’s higher education system is the third largest in the world, next to only the United States and China.
	As per the latest reports available, India has around 760 Universities, 38,498 colleges and 12,276 standalone institutions with a total enrolment of around 3.4 crore students.
	The Government has taken many initiatives to transform the higher education sector with the motto of “Education for All and Quality Education”. 
	Several new institutions have been started during the last two and half year, including 6 new IITs, 7 new IIMs, 8 IIITS and other highly esteemed institutions across the country. 
	A National Ranking System (National Institutional Ranking Framework - NIRF) has been developed to promote competitive spirit among the institutes and help the students make an informed choice.
	I am told that VIT has topped the ranking consecutively for past two academic years among private engineering institutions in India as per NIRF Ranking.  My compliments to you.


 

India is today among the large economies and the country’s GDP is expected to touch 7.5 per cent in the coming years due to the reforms taken by the government.

 

India is also now in an advantageous position with 65 per cent of the population below 35 years. Higher Educational institutions and universities have a crucial role to play in unleashing their energies and realizing the demographic dividend.

 

Here, I want to stress on the Four Pillars of Learning as enunciated in 1996 UNESCO Commission on Education

 


	Learning to Know (KNOWLEDGE)
	Learning to do (SKILLS)
	Learning to be (PERSONALITY)
	Learning to live together (Understanding, appreciation of interdependence)


 

It is for these institutions and students to ensure that India earns a rightful place in the technological field and the world economy.  It is also important for every education institution to create an atmosphere which encourages innovation, new ideas and tap the talent of the young minds.

Similarly,

 


	Education is the most powerful weapon which can transform the world.  
	“We now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables.”
	And to keep up with this change, learning should not be seen as an end but as a means to achieve greater heights in life.
	You should continuously update yourself with the latest technologies, innovations and the changes that are taking place in the world
	You should become multi-skilled and dare to dream big to achieve your goals.


 

I would like to compliment Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu for inviting top education institutions from India and abroad to Amaravati with a vision to transform the State into an education and knowledge hub of global standards.   

 

In a bid to encourage innovations, universities and higher education institutions have to set up innovation clubs on their campuses.

 

Dear students, India is an old land but a young nation. It is your skill, capability and knowledge that would drive this young nation forward in the march towards development.

 

Once again, I congratulate VIT-AP on this joyous occasion and wish all the best for your future endeavours.

 

I am told that VIT stands for Vellore Institute of Technology but I wish that this AP Campus of VIT will stand for


	VISION
	INNOVATION
	TRANSFORMATION of the students entering this institute.


 

Jai Hind!""

The Union Minister for Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the future of our nation is Digital India and we must equip ourselves to meet the aspirations of the people. He further said that technology advancement should lead to online services which are free from delays and misuse. The time has come for us to go online, otherwise we will remain in line, he added. 

The Vice President said that the Government is taking up several initiatives like Stand-up India, Start-up India, Digital India, Incubation, Innovation for the unemployed youth of this country. We must make use of these programmes initiated by the Government and prove that we are not job seekers, but job givers.  The world has become smart and everyone is living in LPG - Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization, he added. 

The Vice President asked the Trainees to come out with out-of-box ideas and he has referred the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for bringing an idea to neem-coat the urea to arrest misuse of it. He further referred the government's initiatives of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), Jan Aadhar Money (JAM) which were helpful in transferring scholarships, pensions, compensations etc. without delay and pilferage. Whatever the technology advancement we have, finally that must help the humanity, he added. 

The Vice President wished the Trainees all the very best in their future.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that authors and speakers will not only dwell on the past but also discuss how to bring about change in every sphere of India. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating Times Lit Fest Delhi - 2017, here today. The CEO, Raj Group, Shri Raj Jain and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that literature is the lifeblood of a society, mirroring its inner workings, its triumphs and challenges, its anxieties and its possibilities. He further said that it is a reflection of its trials and tribulations. It provides an insight into the happenings of a society and captures its culture, traditions, ethos and all that is good and bad, he added. 

The Vice President said that from Kalidasa to Premchand, from Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore to the present day, India has always been blessed with a strong literary lineage of writers, poets, intellectuals and thinkers. They have chronicled the times, exemplified our open traditions and enriched the intellectual traditions of India with some of the finest works, he added. 

The Vice President said that the country has emerged as one of the large economic powers in the world and is increasingly becoming the favourite destination for foreign investors. He further said that India is at a historic juncture and at the cusp of a major transformation—not only in terms of economic growth, but also because it is one of the oldest civilisations with a young population. Blessed with an educated, talented and skilled young work force, India has all the potential to become a leading player in digital technologies and global knowledge hub, he added. 

The Vice President said that India always believed in pluralistic traditions and ethos and never allowed narrow and bigoted views or practices to rear their ugly heads. Dissent is agreeable but disintegration is not acceptable, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

"" I am delighted to inaugurate the Times Lit Fest Delhi- 2017. Such events not only serve to bring together leading personalities from different walks of life but more importantly provide a platform for generating and exchanging new ideas on a host of issues, both past and present. 

Literature is the lifeblood of a society, mirroring its inner workings, its triumphs and challenges, its anxieties and its possibilities. It is a reflection of its trials and tribulations. It provides an insight into the happenings of a society and captures its culture, traditions, ethos and all that is good and bad. 

Literature and its celebration are also intrinsically woven into the essential fabric of an open society and the culture of our democracy. 

From Kalidasa to Premchand, from Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore to the present day, India has always been blessed with a strong literary lineage of writers, poets, intellectuals and thinkers, who have chronicled the times, exemplified our open traditions and enriched the intellectual traditions of India with some of the finest works. Works of many Indian writers were translated into several languages because of their universal appeal. Good books like great men are immortal. 

I compliment the organizers of the Times Lit Fest Delhi, now in its third edition, for bringing to the national capital a unique Literary Festival. 

Quite appropriately, Times Lit Fest-Delhi 2017 is a celebration of New India. Today, the country has emerged as one of the large economic powers in the world and is increasingly becoming the favourite destination for foreign investors. The recent upgrading of India’s sovereign rating by the Moody’s Investors Service, India’s jump by 30 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings to be ranked 100 among 190 countries, the decision of the government to infuse Rs.2,11 lakh crore into public sector banks, demonetization and introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST)  augur well for Indian economy with the GDP growth likely to touch 7.5 per cent in the coming months. 

India is at a historic juncture and at the cusp of a major transformation—not only in terms of economic growth, but also because it is one of the oldest civilisations with a young population. This young population will be the driver of the transformation that the country will witness in the coming years. Blessed with an educated, talented and skilled young work force, India has all the potential to become a leading player in digital technologies and global knowledge hub.

 India always believed in pluralistic traditions and ethos and never allowed narrow and bigoted views or practices to rear their ugly heads. In this context, I would like to once again reiterate that while the freedom of speech is a fundamental pillar of our free society, it is not absolute and is circumscribed by reasonable restrictions. Dissent is agreeable but disintegration is not acceptable. That is the bottom line and any attempt to undermine the integrity and unity of India by forces inimical to the growth of India must be nipped in the bud. 

I am happy to see that you are celebrating the power of the written word, a celebration that has been a constant through the ages in Bharat.  I am told that some of India’s brightest minds and writers will be discussing a host of issues at the Delhi Lit Fest such as how can 21st century children relate to our ancient epics? Should the secular state also appreciate Indian dharma? Is politics lagging behind social change and does India need a new political and economic blueprint? 

Since we are celebrating new India, I hope your authors and speakers will not only dwell on the past but also discuss how to bring about change in every sphere of India: how can we move beyond the shibboleths of the past and embrace change, how do we create a society where change is positive, robust and moves us along towards an open, welcoming society in the magnificent tradition of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam? 

I am very glad that the festival is open to the public and will be engaging with the the entire spectrum of ideas from social media to scholarship, from high art to street expressions, from budding novelists, films and sport to the man on the street. 

Whether in the attitudes of the youth, the energy of civil society, fast-paced technological breakthroughs or in the dynamic interaction of the generations, there is no doubt that we are seeing a New India. We are the world's youngest country of its size, and the new intellectual churning and questioning, new ideas about society, politics, citizens' activism and youth power are exciting new features. I hope you will showcase these at Times Lit Fest Delhi 2017. 

A society must always be in conversation with itself and I hope the writers and thinkers gathered here will discuss about bringing a positive change in every sphere and make India stronger.

 

Thank you. Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India has said that the fruits of economic development must reach every section, particularly the poorest of the poor. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating All India Gandhian Constructive Workers Conference organized by Harijan Sevak Sangh in Gandhi Ashram, here today. The President of Parmarth Niketan, Rishikesh, Swami Chidandand Saraswati and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that we are all privileged that Gandhiji himself framed the constitution, rules and regulations of Harijan Sevak Sangh, which  was founded in 1932. He further said that this organization had rendered yeoman services in promoting education among the downtrodden and in fighting against social evils like untouchability. The divisive walls erected in the minds of the people in the name of caste, religion or social hierarchy will have to be removed, he added. 

The Vice President said that New India, which we are envisaging to build, has to be free of poverty with equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity. He further said that it has to be free from gender-based discrimination, atrocities on women and weaker sections, corruption, religious extremism, terrorism and regionalism. It has to be a country of people with strong ethical and moral values, who believe in ‘One Country and One People’, irrespective of religion, he added. 

The Vice President said that with about 65 per cent of the Indian population under 35 years of age, India is on the cusp of a big a transformation and the skills and the talents of the educated youth will have to be fully tapped for development of the country. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am extremely delighted to inaugurate the two-day All India Gandhian Constructive Workers Conference and also the Mahatma Gandhi Yoga Center. 

In fact, I deem it a huge honor to be associated with this great voluntary organization, which was founded by the Father of the Nation with the objective of eradicating untouchability and uplifting the poor and downtrodden. We are all privileged that Gandhiji himself framed the constitution, rules and regulations of Harijan Sevak Sangh, which  was founded in 1932. 

Since its inception, this organization had rendered yeoman services in promoting education among the downtrodden and in fighting against social evils like untouchability. Friends, it is a matter of grave concern that even 70 years after Independence and in spite of concerted efforts by the governments and voluntary bodies like yours, we come across instances of the evil practice of untouchability now and then in different parts of the country. This is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated. 

It is most paradoxical that as India marches ahead as one of the fastest growing large economies of the world,  social evils like casteism, communalism and corruption are still prevalent and negatively impacting the social fabric of the country. These three cankers affecting India’s growth narrative have to be destroyed. Measures taken to promote social inclusiveness like implementation of 25 per cent seats for the poor in private schools will have to be strictly implemented. 

Friends, the fruits of economic development must reach every section, particularly the poorest of the poor. While the governments will continue with their welfare programmes for the poor and the needy, every conscientious citizen of the country must try to make a difference to the lives of the underprivileged in every possible manner. The divisive walls erected in the minds of the people in the name of caste, religion or social hierarchy will have to be removed. 

The New India, which we are envisaging to build, has to be free of poverty with equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity. It has to be free from gender-based discrimination, atrocities on women and weaker sections, corruption, religious extremism, terrorism and regionalism. It has to be a country of people with strong ethical and moral values, who believe in ‘One Country and One People’, irrespective of religion. 

With about 65 per cent of the Indian population under 35 years of age, India is on the cusp of a big a transformation and the skills and the talents of the educated youth will have to be fully tapped for development of the country. Youth will have myriad of opportunities and they should seize them to pave the way for a brighter tomorrow for themselves and the country. 

Apart from the economic reforms being undertaken to accelerate the growth and make India the most attractive global destination for investors, some electoral reforms might also have to be considered to improve governance and make it more accountable to the people. 

This indeed is a timely conference and I am happy to know that all of you who have gathered here today are hugely contributing to the task of nation building.

Various programmes launched by the Harijan Sevak Sangh like running schools and hostels, a family counseling centre, a charitable dispensary and Prakritik Chikitsa Jeevan Kendra are excellent and laudable initiatives. All these will go a long way in uplifting and integrating the downtrodden members into the mainstream of the society. In fact, the statement of former President K R Narayanan that had there not been an Ashram School run by Harijan Sevak Sangh it would have been impossible for him to get school education is a huge testimony to the magnificent humanitarian work being rendered by this great organization.  

Finally, I would like to conclude by appealing to various philanthropists, corporates and industries to donate liberally to enable Harijan Sevak Sangh to expand its activities in serving the needy and the poor. 

JAI HIND!""

He was interacting with the members of a delegation from National Foundation of Communal Harmony, who presented him a Flag Sticker on the occasion of ‘The Communal Harmony Campaign week’, here today.

The Vice President said that we have to protect and follow the rich cultural heritage of our motherland which we have inherited from our forefathers. He further said that our culture is much ancient than many other in the world. Irrespective of caste, creed, race or religion we are all one, he added.

The Vice President said that India was once known as ‘Viswaguru’ and students from several countries used to come here and study in our universities such as Takshashila, Nalanda and other centres of learning. The situation has changed following Mughal invasions and the British colonization and now the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, he added.

The Vice President wished the students all the very best.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that character, caliber, capacity, conduct, compassion, hard work and discipline are important qualities for achieving success and realizing dreams. He was addressing the Special Convocation 2017 of SRM University, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Minister for Higher Education, Tamil Nadu, Shri K.P. Anbalagan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the vision of higher education in India is to realize the country's human resource potential to its fullest with equity and inclusion. H further said that this essentially means providing greater access to higher education for all sections, particularly the vulnerable sections of the society. Higher education in India is passing through a phase of unprecedented expansion, marked by an explosion in the volume of students, a substantial expansion in the number of institutions and a quantum jump in the level of public funding, he added. 

The Vice President said that education is the single most important element in converting our young population into national assets. If the younger generation of our nation is empowered, it will constitute a very strong and productive workforce for the coming years, he added. 

The Vice President said that India was once known as ‘Viswaguru’ and was the global center of learning as knowledge-seekers from all corners of the world used to come here and study at Takshashila, Nalanda and other centres of learning. The situation has changed following Mughal invasions and the British colonization and now the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, he added. 

The Vice President quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying “By education, I mean an all-round drawing of the best in child and man in body, mind and spirit”; “Education which does not mould character is absolutely worthless”. As the Mahatma had rightly emphasized character is the most important quality for an individual to chart out the right path, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I congratulate all students who are receiving their degrees today as they prepare to enter a new world of opportunities and challenges. 

The vision of higher education in India is to realize the country's human resource potential to its fullest with equity and inclusion. This essentially means providing greater access to higher education for all sections, particularly the vulnerable sections of the society. 

The Ministry of Human Resources Development on its part has come out with several schemes underscoring the importance of inclusive education. The budget outlay for higher education has been increased and the process of identifying universities as Centres of Excellence, which include many private universities, has begun. The Government is also keen on attracting the best talent for the teaching profession. 

Higher education in India is passing through a phase of unprecedented expansion, marked by an explosion in the volume of students, a substantial expansion in the number of institutions and a quantum jump in the level of public funding. The enormity of the challenge of providing equal opportunities for quality higher education to ever-growing number of students is also a historic opportunity for correcting sectoral and social imbalances, reinvigorating institutions, creating new benchmarks of excellence and extending the frontiers of knowledge. 

Education is the single most important element in converting our young population into national assets. If the younger generation of our nation is empowered, it will constitute a very strong and productive workforce for the coming years. 

Today, multitasking has become an essential requirement at all levels in the job market. Ability to meet the competition and adapting to quick technological changes are the traits which are expected from every individual. We need to move to digital technologies and the universities have to change their delivery modes and adopt curricula which are relevant. The teachers have to update their knowledge and learn quickly about use of ICT in every respect. 

Thanks to technological advances and digital revolution, the world is changing at an unprecedented pace and the students coming out of institutes of higher learning must be equipped to deal with the emerging situations not only in terms of technical knowledge, but also in terms of analytical skills, critical thinking, creativity and innovative ideas. 

It must be remembered that universities are preparing students of tomorrow. Wherever necessary, traditional teaching methods have to be replaced with new ways of teaching as change is the only constant for progress in any field. In fact, the entire system from the manner in which students are taught to the conduct examinations has to be evaluated and overhauled. Classrooms should become exciting, interactive centres of learning for students and not teacher-centric sermon halls. 

Similarly, the time has come to examine whether memory-based examinations are serving any meaningful purpose.  I would like every stakeholder involved in the education system-- policy-makers, vice-chancellors, experts in pedagogy, lecturers and students—to come out with new ideas and suggestions for making the curricula relevant to the requirements of the digital age. 

India was once known as ‘Viswaguru’ and was the global center of learning as knowledge-seekers from all corners of the world used to come here and study at Takshashila, Nalanda and other centres of learning. Without dwelling on how the situation has changed following Mughal invasions and the British colonization, I would like to emphasize that the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub. 

For that to happen, the seats of learning, especially the universities must totally reorient their ways of teaching, functioning and equip the students to seamlessly transit into the choice of their profession or enable them to become self-employed. Sky is the limit for exploring various vocational opportunities and imparting the right education is the most critical aspect for the country to take full advantage of the demographic dividend. 

At times, I wonder if the modern education system in the quest for specialization is failing to produce a well-rounded personality rooted in strong morals. Is mere acquisition of knowledge to get a degree certificate enough? Obviously not, but that kind of attitude has been ingrained in the minds of parents and students and this has to change. We need to come out of such compartmentalized thinking. In fact, every student coming out of the portals of a higher educational institution should be like a Renaissance Man-somebody well-versed in different fields and adept at multi-skilling. 

“By education, I mean an all-round drawing of the best in child and man in body, mind and spirit”, said the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. He also said: “Education which does not mould character is absolutely worthless”. As the Mahatma had rightly emphasized character is the most important quality for an individual to chart out the right path. Otherwise, despite having the privilege of getting educated in one of the best educational institutions, there is a danger of the individual going astray. The great Tamil poet and philosopher, Thiruvallur said: “An uneducated person is like a barren land. His life is empty and useless”. 

My dear young friends please remember that character, calibre, capacity, conduct, compassion, hard work and discipline are important qualities for achieving success and realizing your dreams. 

It is a momentous day in your lives and an occasion to plan your future. Never look at short cuts to achieve success. There is no instant success like instant coffee. Sincerity, patience, dedication and perseverance will ultimately lead to success. Dare to dream big as former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam always used to exhort. There is nothing wrong in trying unchartered territories, but you must work with passion, unflagging determination, conviction and self-belief in achieving your goals. 

Friends, India is at the cusp of emerging as a major economic power. There are myriad opportunities and all of you must seize them and contribute towards the building of a new and resurgent India—an India which will be free of corruption, poverty, casteism, parochialism, religious fundamentalism and gender discrimination. In this globalized knowledge-driven economy, India with its distinctly educated young population is at an advantage to take its pre-eminent in the comity of nations. Let us all strive to realize this goal. 

Research and innovations have become key parameters to judge the performance of a university. SRM University has carved out a name for itself among the private universities in India by providing quality education. 

I am told that the University offers scholarships worth more than 15 crore every year. This speaks about the inclination of the university management to reach out to the academically brilliant and economically deprived sections of the society. I commend the Chancellor for his social vision and magnanimity. 

Dear students, this is a proud moment for all you having graduated from a university of repute and having learnt the skills required to meet the challenges that lie ahead. Your journey should not end by acquiring a degree and you must move forward to achieve big things in life. You are taking with you today not only knowledge but a series of additional skills which this institution has provided. 

As you move on, life holds lots of possibilities and opportunities. Both, knowledge and wisdom are important. One helps you make a living, the other helps you make a life. 

Best wishes. Jai Hind.""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Selfless service to humanity was the essence of devotion. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 92nd Birthday Celebrations of Sri Satya Sai Baba, in Prashanthi Nilayam in Puttaparthi, Andhra Pradesh today.



 

The Vice President said that Sri Sathya Sai Baba, a Loving God to His devotees, a universal teacher and humanitarian to others, inspired millions of people across the globe to actively participate in service of humanity. He further said that his teachings emphasize truth, love, peace, right conduct, and non-violence. The service activities of Sri Sathya Sai Baba's organisations  that have worked in the national spirit are truly commendable, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the clarion call of Sri Sathya Sai Baba motivated devotees across the world to form service organisations in about 125 countries to serve the under privileged and needy. He further said that the Trust under the divine guidance of Sri Satya Baba has provided clean drinking water to over a million people in about 700 villages in Anantapur District of Andhra Pradesh. Such drinking water supply water projects were provided in East Godavari and West Godavari Districts of Andhra Pradesh and Medak and Mahabubnagar Districts of Telangana, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the service activities in the fields of Education, Health Care, Providing Safe Drinking Water and other free services undertaken by Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust under the guidance of Sri Sathya Sai Baba have been having great impact on the society in India and humanity worldwide.

 

The Vice President said that Sri Satya Sai Baba’s principal message was love and he was the embodiment of selfless love and his life was a saga of selfless love for the humanity. Baba served all humanity irrespective of caste, creed, race or religion and he propagated and practiced Unity of all Faiths symbolized, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely fortunate to be with all of you on the eve of the 92nd birth anniversary of SriSatya Sai Baba and the launch of the archives today.

 

Sri Sathya Sai Baba, a Loving God to His devotees, a universal teacher and humanitarian to others, inspired millions of people across the globe to actively participate in service of humanity.

 

He was a great transformational leader. He transformed the physical landscape here at Puttapathi. A small village has become a vibrant global spiritual retreat. He transformed the villagers’ lives through the provision of drinking water. He transformed and demonstrated how values can be inculcated through education and how healthcare can be delivered to the poor. He established hospitals and educational institutions which are rendering services and imparting education completely free of charge.

 

His teachings emphasize truth, love, peace, right conduct, and non-violence. The service activities of Sri Sathya Sai Baba's organisations that have worked in the national spirit are truly commendable. It is heartening to note that the clarion call of Sri Sathya Sai Baba motivated devotees across the world to form service organisations in about 125 countries to serve the under privileged and needy.

 

The Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust was set up by Him in 1972 with the objectives of extending relief to the poor, including education and healthcare and any other objects of general public utility without any discrimination of caste, creed, or religion.

 

Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust is a Public Charitable Trust and not a religious Trust. It currently operates:

 


	two Super Specialty hospitals,
	two General Hospitals and
	two Mobile Hospitals
	a four-campus deemed university described by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) as a crest jewel of the Indian university education system;
	two residential schools with Classes I to XII


 

The Trust under the divine guidance of Sri Satya Baba has provided clean drinking water to over a million people in about 700 villages in Anantapur District of Andhra Pradesh.

 

Such drinking water supply water projects were provided in East Godavari and West Godavari Districts of Andhra Pradesh and Medak and Mahabubnagar Districts of Telangana.

 

A project to modernize Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh and the canal from Kandeleru to Poondi reservoir in Tamil Nadu was taken up in order to provide drinking water supply to the city of Chennai.

 

The service activities in the fields of Education, Health Care, Providing Safe Drinking Water and other free services undertaken by Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust under the guidance of Sri Sathya Sai Baba have been having great impact on the society in India and humanity worldwide. Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust has been carrying on the service activities, which were started by Sri Sathya Sai Baba in the same spirit with which they were initiated.

 

Sri Satya Sai Baba’s principal message is love. He is the embodiment of selfless love and His life is a saga of selfless love for the humanity. Baba served all humanity irrespective of caste, creed, race or religion. Sri Satya Sai Baba propagated and practiced Unity of all Faiths symbolized by His statement: 

 

There is only one religion; the religion of Love

There is only one language; the language of the Heart

There is only caste; the caste of Humanity

There is only one Law; the Law of Duty

There is only one God, He is Omnipresent.

 

Baba always exhorted people to do selfless service.  He says, “Hands that help are holier than the lips that pray”.

 

In fact, this is in the grand Indian tradition of seeing every human being as divine and therefore, serving human beings is taken as service to God.

 

I am pleased to note that Sri Sathya Sai Seva organisation which plays a key role in many service activities undertaken by the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust is spread through the length and breadth of India having very active units in all the states of the country. I am impressed by the fact that there are 14,700 Balvikas centres where in nearly 300,000 children are given orientation in Indian culture and taught Human values.

 

The universal message of Sri Sathya Sai is being spread across the globe in 125 countries by the Sri Sathya Sai International Organisation.

 

After the Mahasamadhi of Sri Sathya Sai Baba in 2011, the Trust has continued its public welfare works with the same spirit of service.

 

I am delighted that the Trust completed a project for supply of drinking water to another 118 villages in Anantapur district, constructed 300 more houses to flood affected people of Orissa and participated in the disaster relief operations of Hudhud Cyclone and in the Chennai cyclones.

 

About 100 Sri Sathya Sai Schools in the country, set up by devotees, are being provided with financial assistance to improve their infrastructure like buildings, furniture and computer facilities to improve the quality of   education.

 

The divine inspiration provided by Sri Sathya Sai Baba continues to drive the Trust’s new initiatives.

 

Among the recent additions is a new building in Sri Sathya Sai General Hospital, PrasanthiNilayam, modernization of both the Super specialty Hospitals, advanced Research Centre of Sri Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, 2nd Mobile hospital in Chennai, a new women’s' college building and a school building in Dharwad, Karnataka and construction of new buildings at Sathya Sai Baba School, Mysuru.

 

I am extremely happy to inaugurate the Archives today.

 

In His lifetime, Sri Sathya Sai Baba had written several books, addressed devotees in thousands of forums, written letters and messages to people of all walks of life.

 

Many of these teachings and messages are available in different formats, both audio and visual. The Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust has collected these and has preserved them for posterity so that they would be available for seekers of knowledge in the years to come. There is a veritable treasure house of 7000 manuscripts, 9000 audio spools, 5,50,000 feet of films, 5000 CD / DVDs, 10,000 Video tapes of about 18,000 hours and 1, 50,000 photos. These can be used by researchers and those who wish to study the message of this great sage.

 

A state of the art Archives centre has been established as per International standards in Prasanthi  Nilayam for this purpose. The Archives centre which is one of its kind in the country is built on multiple levels with custom designed special vaults. The building has inner and outer shells, sterile corridors, illumination at 300 lux , high levels of dust control and robust security systems. I am told that this system can ensure preservation of the archived material for hundreds of years.

 

These items have been digitized and kept in the Archival building. This would facilitate content access in electronic form and help disseminate the message of Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

 

Sri Satya Sai Baba was a great spiritual leader who distilled the essence of Indian philosophical heritage and conveyed it in a very simple but effective way to the masses.

 

As the great sage Narada describes a divine person: Sa tarati lokaanstaarayati (He not only navigates the ocean of life but also helps all others to cross this ocean).

 

He used to address his devotees as “paramatma swarupullara” (embodiments of divinity). With this perspective, he said, “If you lift the hand to serve, to help, to console, to encourage another man you are lifting it for God, because in every man is God.” He had also said, “Service is worship. Each act of service is a flower placed at the feet of God.”

 

For Him, Selfless service to humanity was the essence of devotion. This echoes the conception of devotion that Narada gives us in his Bhakti Sutras:  “Saa parama prema roopa”. This unconditional, sublime love can transform human beings into devoted souls serving God through service to humanity.

That is the grand ideal set by Sri Satya Sai Baba before us and demonstrated through his speech and actions that this is really possible. It is the same spirit and the eternal flame he has kindled that is making our lives more meaningful.

 

I invoke Baba’s gracious blessings on the Trust and all of us around the world so that we can lead fulfilled lives. May we follow the path of Satya, Dharma, Prema, Shanthi that he has shown us.

 

May we commit ourselves to work, as Sri Satya Sai guided us, for the progress of humanity,  with love, compassion, right conduct and truthfulness.

 

Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said every reform must have a human face and the fruits of the reforms must reach the poorest sections of the society. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating 160th Year Celebrations of Kochi Chamber of Commerce & Industry, in Kochi, Kerala today. The Governor of Kerala, Shri P. Sathasivam, the Minister for Local Self-Governments, Welfare of Minorities, Wakf and Haj, Kerala, Dr. K.T. Jaleel, the Mayor of Kochi, Smt. Soumini Jain and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that the Chambers of Commerce play in the economic development of the country. He further said that they play a formulating role in advising the governments in enacting legislations and regulations that promote ease of doing business rather than act as strangulations. They also have a responsibility in promoting ethical corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members, he added.

 

The Vice President urged the corporate sector not to get confined to what has been stipulated by the statute and go beyond it in taking up CSR initiatives. He further said that the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry must play a pro-active role in this regard he added. As a result of the economic reforms initiated and implemented by successive governments, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world today, he added.

 

The Vice President said that known as God's Own Country, Kerala is one of the most beautiful destinations and also one of India's most progressive States in terms of social welfare and quality of life.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's addres:

 

"" I am very happy to be here this evening to participate in this celebration marking 160 Years of the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Indeed, 160 years is a long time in the history of any organization and I congratulate the Cochin Chamber for having completed this milestone in the service of trade and industry in this region. I wish the Chamber many more years of service to the business community in Kerala.

 

The Cochin Chamber of Commerce & Industry, established in the year 1857, is one of the oldest Chambers of Commerce in the country and is affiliated to the Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India, New Delhi, as one of its five Promoter Chambers.

 

I believe that Cochin Chamber of Commerce & Industry is a true representative of the corporate sector in Kerala as is the case with similar associations in other States. 

 

Friends, I would like to emphasize the important role bodies like Chambers of Commerce play in the economic development of the country. They act as a bridge between the governments and the industry in creating conducive atmosphere for the businesses to thrive and produce wealth.

 

They also play a formulating role in advising the governments in enacting legislations and regulations that promote ease of doing business rather than act as strangulations.

 

At the same time, these bodies also have a responsibility in promoting ethical corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members.

 

While organizing seminars and workshops on topical themes and issues is necessary to create awareness among its members, I would like bodies such as the Cochin Chambers of Commerce and Industry to take the lead in promoting corporate social responsibility. Here, I urge the corporate sector not to get confined to what has been stipulated by the statute and go beyond it in taking up CSR initiatives. That is the need of the hour and Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry must play a pro-active role in this regard.

 

Perhaps, the Chamber of Commerce can even identify the felt needs of a given area and assign the task for fulfilling it to an industry or a group of industries located in that region. In such a way, the corporate sector can hugely supplement the efforts of the government in taking up community-oriented projects or even developmental projects in some cases. For instance, the Chamber can take up a project to bridge the digital divide by ensuring that the poor children have access to digital literacy and good quality education. 

 

As a result of the economic reforms initiated and implemented by successive governments, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world today. However, every reform must have a human face and the fruits of the reforms must reach the poorest sections of the society. Economic prosperity is meaningless if there is no equity in wealth distribution. 

 

The initiatives taken up by the Union Government such as Jan-Dhan Yojana are aimed at empowering the poor and putting an end to their financial inclusion. Commerce and Industry bodies like yours must chip in to see that nobody is left behind in the financial inclusion initiative.

 

As mentioned earlier, today Chambers of Commerce needs to play a more significant role in the community and take on a leadership role. The Chamber can to be the centre sphere of influence in community and governance issues and provide innovative thoughts to those in power.

 

As all of you are aware, Kerala enjoys a rich and varied history.

 

From ancient times, Kerala has had trade relations with many other regions in the world and was the centre of trade and commerce with spice becoming the principal exporter.

 

Known as God's Own Country, Kerala is one of the most beautiful destinations and also one of India's most progressive States in terms of social welfare and quality of life. In contrast to the rest of India and most other low-income countries, Keralites enjoy education and health at levels on par with the developed countries. The State boasts of one of India's highest literacy rates, highest life expectancy and lowest child mortality rates. 


The literacy rate for women is one of the highest in all of Asia, which is perhaps why the women in the State enjoy a privileged status both within the family and society.


 Kerala also has top-class infrastructure and a well-trained human resources pool to meet the demand of global business needs.


It has the first and only International Container Transshipment Terminal, three international airports and the fourth one is taking wings.


With a coastline of nearly 590 km, it has a major port at Kochi and 16 smaller ports along the coast. Its rail and road connectivity is one of the best in India.
Kerala pioneered the concept of dedicated infrastructure with the setting up of Technopark – the first of its kind in the country.

 

It is also home to the second LNG regassification terminal.


Kerala offers immense prospects in the areas of agriculture, mining, fishing, quarrying, manufacturing, construction industry, hospitality and logistics.The tourism industry in Kerala is thriving and contributes 13 per cent of the State's GDP. As a result of medical tourism, Kerala is already being marketed as a health destination mainly for its Ayurveda packages.

 

Kerala also has great scope to grow in the IT sector because of the initiatives taken by the Government. Manufacturing, fishing, industry, mines and minerals sector and the rubber industry also hold huge prospects. The chemical and fertilizer manufacturing industry has grown. Construction is yet another area to be looked at.

 

 I am told that the Government of Kerala recently took the initiative to promulgate ‘The Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation Ordinance 2017’ to ensure that delays are avoided in granting various licenses, permissions, approvals and clearances required under various enactments. I feel that it will change the trajectory of industrial growth in the State. This move will ensure the Ease of Doing Business in Kerala in keeping with India’s initiatives in this regard.

 

Kerala named as one of the ""10 paradises of the world"" by National Geographic, is famous especially for its eco-tourism initiatives. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, has made it one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Beaches, warm weather, back waters, hill stations, waterfalls, wild life, Ayurveda, year-round festivals and diverse flora and fauna make Kerala a unique destination for tourists.

 

Kochi, where your Chamber of Commerce is situated, is the commercial capital of Kerala. In recent times the city has become one of the fastest-growing second-tier metro cities in India. So much so that Kochi has made it to the list of 98 cities across the country to be developed as “Smart Cities” announced by the Central Government.

 

Kerala’s potential for the future lies in the hands of its youngsters. Seize the opportunities and work towards pushing your State and city to the levels of excellence that you are capable of. The State is endowed with rich natural and human resources, favourable trade environment and has immense potential to expand its footprint in various areas.

 

Looking ahead, I believe that the future success of a Chamber of Commerce like the Cochin Chamber of Commerce & Industry will be determined by its strategic development into a major, respected, dynamic center of community influence focusing not just on traditional business issues but on the overall financial health and well-being of the community.

 

In short, tomorrow’s Chamber of Commerce will have to reinvent and reposition itself to not only promote trade and commerce effectively but also serve the larger interests of the State and nation. 

 

Thank You and Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Kochi is a cosmopolitan city with a blend of rich culture, heritage and modernization. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of Kochi Municipal Corporation, in Kochi, Kerala today. The Governor of Kerala, Shri P. Sathasivam, the Minister for Local Self-Governments, Welfare of Minorities, Wakf and Haj, Kerala, Dr. K.T. Jaleel, the Mayor of Kochi, Smt. Soumini Jain and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that Kochi has had strong ties with the Greeco-Romans, active trading relations with many South Asian and South-East Asian nations and also has been a colony of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British. He further said that it is one of the top destinations in the country for a wide range of industries – from Tourism, Shipping and Information Technology to International trade and Bio-technology. The Container Transshipment terminal at Vallarpadam,  international bunkering terminal and the CNG Terminal have developed Kochi into an economic and logistical hub, he added.

 

The Vice President said that rapid urbanization, burgeoning urban population, unplanned and haphazard growth of urban areas, inability of the civic bodies to cope with increasing demand in services, lack of adequate financial resources and functional powers are the major problems faced by corporations and other urban civic bodies. He further said that since mayors and corporators are elected by the people, they would be directly answerable to the voters.  They also need to be empowered with three Fs—funds, functions and functionaries, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely pleased to inaugurate the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Kochi Municipal Corporation, which has carved a niche for itself in the area of local self-government. I convey my warm felicitations and greetings to all the delegates present here today, especially the Mayor and the council of the Kochi Municipal Corporation.

 

I would also like to express my appreciation to all the stalwarts of the past and present, whose vision, efforts and dedication enabled the local self government to serve its people for 50 long years.

 

Friends, the Golden Jubilee Celebration of any institution is not only an event of great importance and joy, but also an occasion to introspect, recollect the achievements and chalk out an action plan for the future. Today, when I stand before you to address on this happy and solemn occasion, my thoughts go back not only to about 50 years but beyond that. 

Kochi, the commercial hub of Kerala, is a city steeped in history. It has been the part of urban history for hundreds of years having had active trading and cultural relations with almost all major trading centres across the world.

 

It has had strong ties with the Greeco-Romans, active trading relations with many South Asian and South-East Asian nations and also has been a colony of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British. Kochi was one of the first regions in the world that provided refuge to the fleeing Jewish population and this vibrant Jewish population continues to contribute immensely to the overall development of the city.

 

In 1947, when India gained independence from the British colonial rule, Kochi was the first princely State to join the Indian Union willingly.

 

On 9th July 1960, the Mattancherry council of Kochi passed a resolution—which was forwarded to the government—requesting the formation of a municipal corporation by combining the then existing municipalities of Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, and Ernakulam.

 

Based on the report of a government-appointed commission, the Kerala Legislative Assembly approved the corporation's formation and on 1st November 1967, exactly 50 years ago, the Kochi Municipal Corporation came into existence. 

 

In the last 50 years, Kochi has grown to become a vibrant metropolis with a composite culture. It is one of the top destinations in the country for a wide range of industries – from Tourism, Shipping and Information Technology to International trade and Bio-technology. 

 

It is a cosmopolitan city with a blend of rich culture, heritage and modernization. 

 

Kochi is one of the most prosperous cities in the country and contributes a major chunk of its revenue to the State’s coffers. The Container Transshipment terminal at Vallarpadam,  international bunkering terminal and the CNG Terminal have developed Kochi into an economic and logistical hub. Cochin international airport has set an example to others by becoming the first airport in the world to be completely operated on solar power, while Kochi Metro is effectively serving the commuting needs of the city’s population. 

 

In the coming years, I see Kochi to be one of the strongest and fastest growing cities in India. It is the first Indian Tier-II city to have a metro rail. It is a venue for one of the two submarine cable landings in India and is home to India’s first global hub terminal. All these potential drivers act as growth triggers for the city.

 

One of the ambitious missions of the Government of India, the Smart City mission seeks to develop cities into throbbing, sustainable, resilient, inclusive and citizen-friendly urban centres. In the first round, 20 cites were selected and I am happy Kochi was among the top five cities. I really hope that Kochi excels in the mission and is able to transform itself into an all-encompassing livable city.

 

Friends, as all of you are aware, I served as Urban Development Minister earlier and have a fairly good idea of the problems faced by municipal corporations and urban local bodies, their administrators and elected representatives.

 

Rapid urbanization, burgeoning urban population, unplanned and haphazard growth of urban areas, inability of the civic bodies to cope with increasing demand in services, lack of adequate financial resources and functional powers are the major problems faced by corporations and other urban civic bodies.

 

Firstly, outdated laws and regulations which seek to centralize powers and functions rather than decentralize them must be reworked. The top-down approach must be replaced by bottom-up approach for finding effective governance at the local level. Times have changed and so have people’s expectations.

 

The tax-paying public rightly wants corruption-free, accountable, transparent and effective governance.     

 

While availability of funds might not pose a problem under various programmes, including the ‘Smart Cities’ initiative, launched by the Union Government, the timely execution of the projects must be accorded highest priority.

 

Laws will have to be amended if they come in the way of effective functioning of municipal bodies and lead to delays in execution of projects. If necessary, the municipal corporations must be given more legislative powers and the mayors empowered with greater administrative functions to enable effective governance.

 

Since mayors and corporators are elected by the people, they would be directly answerable to the voters. Therefore, greater accountability has to be infused in the functioning of the corporations and elected representatives. However, they also need to be empowered with three Fs—funds, functions and functionaries. In case, each local body is governed by a different act, the situation must be remedied by clubbing varied acts and bringing out a single, umbrella act for ensuring uniformity in functioning and governance.

 

I would also like the Kochi Municipal Corporation to reduce the interface between the citizens and its officials to the maximum extent by providing all services online. It would not only help in promoting efficiency but also reduce corruption. 

 

Before I conclude I would like to congratulate the Kochi Municipal Corporation for transforming itself into a people-friendly institution with a high degree of transparency and efficiency. You have been successful to a great extent in carrying forward the spirit of decentralization and it is also highly commendable that you have been very responsive institution to the local needs.

 

I hope you will relentlessly work to be an institution of excellence, always alive to the current realities, agile enough to respond to changing contexts and forward-looking enough to anticipate future trends. 

 

I wish you all the very best in your endeavors to deliver high quality services to the city and its people.

 

Thank you and  Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that . He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 11th Indian Fisheries and Aquaculture Forum with the theme 'Fostering Innovations in Fisheries and Aquaculture', in Kochi, Kerala today. The Governor of Kerala, Shri P. Sathasivam, the Minister for Fisheries, Harbour Engineering & Cashew Industry, Kerala, Smt. J. Mercykutty Amma, the Minister for Local Self-Governments, Welfare of Minorities, Wakf and Haj, Kerala, Dr. K.T. Jaleel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that the Society is helping our country to realize the goals of not only providing nutritional and food security, but also creating opportunities for entrepreneurship, income generation, self-employment, trade and commerce. He further said that India contributes to about 6.3 % of global fish production which is also 1.1% of the national GDP and 5.15 % of the agricultural GDP of the country. The total fish production during 2015-16 was 10.79 million metric tons (MMT) of which 7.21MMT comes from inland aquaculture and capture fisheries and 3.58 MMT from marine capture fisheries, he added.

 

The Vice President said that our country is the 3rd largest fish producer and 2nd largest aquaculture producer in the world. The country has not only been able to meet the demand of the fish for the domestic need, it has also been able to add substantially to the foreign exchange earnings through export of fish and fisheries products, he added.

 

The Vice President said that our future outlook must focus not on increasing our fishing efforts in the seas where there is already over capacity, but on judicious use of the declining fishery resources. It is necessary that much of the economic benefits from both capture fisheries and aquaculture are reaching the primary producers, i.e. the fishers and fish farmers, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we need to focus on areas which will improve the economic condition of farmers. A number of interventions are needed like reducing the role of  middlemen, providing crop insurances, enhancing access to credit, developing cold chains and good upcountry market linkages, providing infrastructure for post-harvest storage, handling and value addition, he added.

 

The Vice President said that scientific gatherings such as the present should focus not only on sharing information on science and technologies. There should be a conscious effort to convey this knowledge to the common people, fish farmers and primary producers, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely pleased to be here amidst this distinguished gathering. I am glad that you are going to discuss and share knowledge on how fisheries and aquaculture can result in greater economic, commercial, nutritional, environmental and societal benefits to more people. Fisheries is a topic close to my heart. A great part of my public life has been entwined with activities related to the welfare of the coastal people in my home state, Andhra Pradesh. Also, Asian Fisheries Society Indian Branch (AFSIB) is an organization not new to me. Way back in 1988, this young organization had invited me in my role as the Member of Parliament from Andhra Pradesh to inaugurate the 1st National Workshop on ‘Carp Seed Production Technology’ at Eluru on 2ndSeptember, 1988, a remarkable beginning for a two year old Organisation.

 

Some of these events have definitely played a significant role in transforming Andhra Pradesh as the largest producer of farmed fish in India. Today, I am happy to note that the Society is helping our country to realize the goals of not only providing nutritional and food security, but also creating opportunities for entrepreneurship, income generation, self-employment, trade and commerce and a host of fish related activities for betterment of people.

 

Across the Asian region, fisheries and aquaculture are important economic activities. As you know, Asia is the largest fish producer in the world. In India, only after the independence in 1947 fisheries were recognized as a growth opportunity. Mechanization commenced in the 1950s which has revolutionized the harvest and post-harvest fisheries sectors. Aquaculture became an important agriculture production activity in almost all states of the country. Other than farming finfish in the farms on main land, our fish farmers are engaged now in farming of several species of shrimps, crabs, mussels, oysters and seaweeds in seawater in farms and in cages in open seas. India contributes to about 6.3 % of global fish production which is also 1.1% of the national GDP and 5.15 % of the agricultural GDP of the country.

 

As per the Govt. of India estimates, the total fish production during 2015-16 was 10.79 million metric tons of which 7.21MMT comes from inland aquaculture and capture fisheries and 3.58 MMT from marine capture fisheries. The vibrancy of the sector can be visualized by over 14-fold increase in fish production in just six and half decades. The dependence of over 14.5 million people on fisheries activities for their livelihood is a testimony of the importance that the sector holds today. 

 

It is heartening to note that today our country is the 3rd largest fish producer and 2nd largest aquaculture producer in the world. The country has not only been able to meet the demand of the fish for the domestic need, it has also been able to add substantially to the foreign exchange earnings through export of fish and fisheries products.

 

Riding on a robust demand for its frozen shrimp and frozen fish in international markets, India exported over 1.1MMT of seafood worth an all-time high of US$ 5.78 billion (Rs 37,871 crores) in 2016-17, as against 0.95 MMT and US$ 4.69 billion dollars a year earlier. Fish and fish products have contributing nearly 20% of the agricultural exports.

 

More than 50 different types of fish and shellfish products are exported from India to 75 countries around the world.

 

That being said, what is our outlook for future? Most Asian countries are focusing on increasing the fish production through advanced technological interventions, as there is a general understanding that production from marine capture fisheries do not promise much future in terms of quantity. Studies have shown that catches from wild capture fisheries have actually been declining since peak global catches in the mid-1990s.

 

Nevertheless, our future outlook must focus not on increasing our fishing efforts in the seas where there is already over capacity, but on judicious use of the declining fishery resources. We need to focus on reducing losses and value addition and supplementing the ever-increasing need for fish through modern aquaculture technologies and diversification of the products.

 

On the one hand, we must focus on ensuring the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF). On the other hand, we must have a more regulated and well-managed fishing environment through global marine capture fisheries policy and governance. We must also address marine conservation concerns. 

 

It is necessary that much of the economic benefits from both capture fisheries and aquaculture are reaching the primary producers, i.e. the fishers and fish farmers.

 

We are doing exceedingly well in aquaculture, especially freshwater aquaculture sector, and achieving an unparalleled annual growth rate of 6-7% since last three decades. I urge the scientists to lay greater emphasis on the issues of diversification, water requirement and disease problems.

 

The Government of India has set for itself a goal of doubling farmers’ income. Currently, much of the economic benefits from capture fisheries and aquaculture are not going to the farmers. We need to focus on areas which will improve the economic condition of farmers. A number of interventions are needed. We must, for example, reduce the role of  middlemen, provide crop insurances, enhance access to credit,  develop cold chains and good upcountry market linkages, provide infrastructure for post-harvest storage, handling and value addition.

 

I am aware that all essential technological support is being provided by the eight Fisheries Research Institutes under Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), several other mandated organizations like the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and numerous NGOs such as the Asian Fisheries Society Indian Branch (AFSIB). However, much more needs to be done to spread awareness and provide services to the farmers.

 

Fisheries and Aquaculture are multidisciplinary subjects where scientists and technologists have to work as teams. Scientific gatherings such as the present should focus not only on sharing information on science and technologies. There should be a conscious effort to convey this knowledge to the common people, fish farmers and primary producers.

 

I am happy to note that there are Special Sessions on Gender Justice and Equity, Farmers’-Scientists’ interactions and also an extensive exhibition of products and services available for entrepreneurs.

 

The future would be brighter and the fish farmers would be happier when all the technologies developed by you are made use of by them.

 

I hope your knowledge will enhance their economic returns and transform the lives of fishing population in Asia.

 

I am happy to declare the 11th Indian Fisheries and Aquaculture Forum open.

 

Thank you. JAI HIND.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India has put 'Dharma' at the centre of governance. He was addressing the Members of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana Advocates Associations, in Hyderabad today. The Acting Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh & Teleangana, Justice Ramesh Ranganathan, Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that Dharma is for the stability of society, the maintenance of social order and the general well-being and progress of human kind. Whatever conduces to the fulfillment of these objects is Dharma, he added.

 

The Vice President said that upholding Dharma means sustaining our civilization and if we follow the rule of law, our human society will survive and this is why we say: “Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitaha”. He quoted Chanakya as saying “Law and morality sustain the world”. We all have a stake and a role to play in making this happen in our lives, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the implementation of the laws and the dispensation of justice need to be much more effective, speedy and perceived to be fair and just. He further said that the conduct of lawyers, judges and the courts has a deep impact on the civilian life in this country. Dynamism of the lawyers is the foundation for “Judicial Activism”, he added.

 

The Vice President said that justice Dispensation System, as an institution, is now at crossroads and faced with many challenges. He further said that the general decline in ethical and moral values, has affected the Justice Dispensation System as well. Lawyers must equip themselves with the changing trends and assist the Judiciary with proper input, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

"" I am pleased to be with all of you this evening as it brings many pleasant memories of my association with the legal fraternity before and after completing my law degree from Andhra University. Though I had enrolled here as an Advocate long time ago, I didn’t have an opportunity to be in the legal profession for long. I joined the political arena and practiced law in another form. I joined the fraternity of ‘law makers’.

 

I am glad to meet many of my old friends as well as new entrants practicing this noble profession in this high court.

 

High Court of Andhra Pradesh which celebrated its golden jubilee in the year 2006  has passed from one stage of evolution to another carving out a place of distinction for itself not only in the judicial history of the State but in its public life as well.

 

This High Court has the proud distinction of having contributed many jurists and judges to the Supreme Court of India: Justice Koka Subbarao, Justice Jayachandra Reddy, Justice Chinnapa Reddy, Justice Jeevan Reddy, Justice Ramaswamy, Justice Jagannadha Rao, Justice Sudarshan Reddy, Justice Jasti Chalameswar, Justice N. V. Ramana and Justice L Nageswara Rao, the last three Hon’ble judges are now serving.

 

This Court also has the distinction of producing a galaxy of eminent lawyers and judges at the High Court level. We remember Justice P.A Choudary whose judgement in Saritha’s case has been internationally acclaimed to say that the ‘Fundamental Rights’ will walk into the bedroom of the person as well, reaffirming the salutary principle of Liberty that “over his body and mind, an individual is sovereign”.

 

We also remember Justice Jagannadha Rao for defining a new scale for calculating compensation for the victims of motor vehicle accidents.

 

This High Court houses some interesting historical documents like the Shri Kishan’s first Public Interest Litigation in this Court opposing formation of State of Andhra Pradesh in 1957.

 

I am told that the handwritten copies of the petition, in original, are still available in the Registry of this Court and its judgment has been reported in Shri Kishan Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh in All India Reporter in the year 1957.

 

There are many stalwarts from this Bar. Shi DuvvuriNarasa Raju, Sri K. Pratap Reddy and Sri Padmanabha Reddy, Sri Venkat Reddy, Sri Movva Chandrasekhar Rao, Sri Ananta Babu, Sri B.V Subbaiah to remember only a few.

 

Some Advocates from this Bar have even made it to Supreme Court of India. To remember some stalwarts – Sri P.P. Rao (Padma Bhushan awardee), Sri V.R. Reddy who had also served as Solicitor General, and as Chairman of the Bar Council of India, Sri L. Nageswara Rao has the distinction of serving as Additional Solicitor General for 3 terms in different party regimes and eventually got elevated as Judge of Supreme Court.  Sri P.S. Narasimha is currently serving as Additional Solicitor General.

 

List of the stalwarts from this Bar will not be complete without making a reference to Dr P.C. Rao(Padma Bhushan awardee), who had served as Law Secretary, Union of India and later had a long stint as Judge, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

 

Reference to these stalwarts is sufficient to indicate the richness and diversity of the Bar. This Court has achieved so much of name and fame only because of the great quality of the lawyers of this Court.

 

My salutations to each one of those great men and women who have served this august institution as advocates, judges and jurists.

 

Dear brothers and sisters, as you well know, we have solemnly resolved through our constitution, to secure, to all our citizens, social, economic and political justice.

 

In fact, India has put ‘’Dharma’’ at the centre of governance.

 

Let me remind ourselves what Mahabharata says:

 

“Dharma is for the stability of society, the maintenance of social order and the general well-being and progress of human kind. Whatever conduces to the fulfillment of these objects is Dharma.”

 

Upholding Dharma means sustaining our civilization. If we follow the rule of law, our human society will survive.

 

This is why we say: “Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitaha”.

 

As Chanakya had also said “Law and morality sustain the world”.

 

We all have a stake and a role to play in making this happen in our lives.

 

The citizens are looking up to the institutions of governance like the legislature, judiciary and the executive. The expectations are that these deliver ‘SURAJYA’ and contribute to improvement in the quality of life. The trust and confidence that an average Indian places in these institutions is getting eroded.

 

The implementation of the laws and the dispensation of justice need to be much more effective, speedy and perceived to be fair and just.

 

The conduct of lawyers, judges and the courts has a deep impact on the civilian life in this country. Dynamism of the lawyers is the foundation for “Judicial Activism”.

 

We have given to ourselves the democratic form of governance with the bedrock principles of ‘Rule of Law’ and ‘Separation of Powers’. The role that the lawyers of this country play in safeguarding these constitutional values has a primary place in the legal history of this country from the days of freedom struggle till date.

 

Bar and the Bench, the two sides of the same coin, have a big responsibility and should look upon their work not merely as another profession but as an ethical and moral glue that keeps our national edifice together.

 

Courts render justice but that justice is rendered only with the able assistance of the lawyers.

 

Service rendered by lawyers to the litigants is a public service. Litigant reposes trust in his lawyer as an infant child reposes blind-trust on his mother. Lawyers should always stand up to the trust that the litigants repose in them.

 

Justice Dispensation System, as an institution, is now at crossroads and faced with many challenges. Public confidence is the cornerstone of Justice Dispensation System. This Institution cannot betray the confidence that the public repose on it.

 

The general decline in ethical and moral values, has affected the Justice Dispensation System as well. Being an optimist, I repose confidence on the members of the Bar to reclaim and achieve those highest moral and ethical values.

 

There is a huge backlog of cases, partly because of unfilled vacancies. According to Prison Statistics in India, 2015 report released by the National Crime Records Bureau, 67 per cent of the prisoners in Indian jails are under trials. According to the Law Ministry, there are 18 judges per million population, while the Law Commission has recommended 50 judges per million.

 

There are also complaints that lawyers tend to delay the progress in the disposal of cases. This should be avoided to restore people’s trust in the system. After all, we know, Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied. Lawyers may not strike work, for it affects the rights of the litigants. Striking of work by lawyers is also one of the causes of delay in disposal of cases.

 

Deviance and crime in the Society have assumed new and complex forms. While the social benefits of advancement in science and technology cannot be ignored, it has also opened up a floodgate for commission of crimes and economic offences in more complex manner which our traditional crime investigation bureaus and the prosecutors should handle. Lawyers must equip themselves with the changing trends and assist the Judiciary with proper input.

 

Armed Forces are guarding our borders and keeping us safe, while the lawyers are the guardians of human rights, civil liberties, transparency in administration, Rule of Law and in maintaining checks and balances between the three organs of the State which is conceptually called as the ‘Separation of Powers’.

 

The lawyers have been champions protecting the fragile environment and in curbing pollution. I urge all of you to keep up this sharp focus on public welfare and public interest.

 

We who occupy important positions and wield power have another major responsibility.

 

For instance, the judges and advocates have to model good behavior. Purity of thought, courtesy in speech and commitment to the constitution of our great country can inspire our youth. Any slip or casual utterance can be detrimental. Any corrupt thought or action can be an assault on country’s collective consciousness. Let us steer clear of these avoidable paths.

 


	
		
			 
		
	


Friends, as you all know laws are meant to improve the lives of people and enable them to lead a dignified life. The Indian judiciary has always remained independent and played a stellar role in strengthening democracy and in ensuring socio-economic justice to the common man.

 

The World Justice Report ranked India at 66th position in its Rule of Index 2016. Denmark, Norway and Finland were the top three countries, while Afghanistan, Cambodia and Venezuela were at the bottom India has vast scope to improve its ranking if concerted effort is made by all the stakeholders.

 

In a developing country like ours, lawyers and jurists will have to play a crucial role by ensuring that nobody is denied access to justice and the poor and illiterate in particular are not deprived of their legitimate rights.

 

Lawyers should act as conscience-keepers of the society and take advantage of the mechanisms like Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to serve the needy and the poor.

 

Lawyers must be well-versed in the laws they are specializing in and constantly acquire knowledge to be updated on the latest developments.  A strong and well equipped Bar will result in having a strong judiciary because judges are picked up from the Bar itself. Therefore there is every need that the products that come out of our law schools should simply be the best in the world. It is not difficult to achieve this target in a decade’s time if the members of the Bar Councils show their commitment.

 

The legal system in the country is a good indicator of country’s governance. A people- friendly, people centric, objective, non-corrupt, inclusive administration of justice can considerably enhance the ‘ease of living’. 

 

Like judges, lawyers should also observe self-imposed restrictions and also usher-in practising moral and ethical values in their professional and personal life. A lawyer has to be an ‘Officer of the Court’ and a ‘Gentleman’ in the society. Bar members shall always desist from unruly behaviour, both inside and outside the court, and set an example to the public of being a gentleman.

 

Every lawyer should do public service by accepting cases of poor litigants ‘pro bono’ and render Free Legal Aid to the needy litigants. Please do keep in mind the salutary principle that no litigant should go helpless merely because of his inability to pay the lawyer’s fee.

 

This is the reorientation I am looking forward to as we, as a nation, have set our sights very high.

 

Lastly, I would like you all to remember the illustrious legacy you have inherited from legal luminaries of the yester years. They had put country first and ‘’social, economic and political justice to all, especially those who are marginalized” as the sacred duty towards nation building. I am sure you will do your best to add to the glory of this noble profession and keep in mind the following words from the Mahabharata: “The State can only be preserved by Dharma, under the rule of law”.Let us create a new Bharat that not only has some of the world’s best, inclusive thoughts but also demonstrate that we can live our daily lives and take action along those lines. 

 

My good wishes to you in your endeavours.

 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that language can help good governance because information and knowledge can create an enlightened citizenry. He was addressing the 16th Annual Convocation of Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali, the Vice President of Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, Chennai, Shri H. Hanumantappa, the President of Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana, Shri B. Obaiah and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Hindi has played a historic role in the development of India's unity, integrity and linguistic goodwill. For the unification of the nation there is no element more powerful than the language spoken by most of Indians, he added.

The Vice President said that in the year 1936, the office of Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha was established in Vijaywada and as the Presidents of this Sabha, freedom fighters such as Shri Konda Venkapapayya Pantulu, Andhra Kesari Shri Tungturi Prakasham Pantulu, Shri Bejawada Gopalreddy, Swami Ramanand Tirtha did a great work. It is heartening to know that Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha has not only promoted Hindi but also prepared a large number of Hindi teachers, translators and publicists, he added.

 The Vice President said that the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha of Andhra and Telangana is celebrating its 16th Annual Convocation and he reminded the audience of Gandhiji's view that no country is independent in the true sense, until and unless it speaks in its own language.

 The Vice President congratulated all the students who received the degrees of Rashtra Bhasha Visharad and Rashtra Bhasha Praveen in Hindi.

 Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

हिंदी प्रचार सभा पूज्य महात्मा गांधी द्वारा स्थापित राष्ट्रीय महत्व की संस्था है। हिंदी ने भारत की एकता अखंडता और भाषाई सद्भावना के विकास में ऐतिहासिक भूमिका निभाई है। राष्ट्र के एकीकरण के लिए सर्वमान्य भाषा से अधिक बलशाली कोई तत्व नहीं है। वास्तव में दक्षिण भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा की स्थापना इसी महान उद्देश्य की पूर्ति के लिए हुई। तब से लेकर आज तक निरंतर साधानारत है। सभा लंबे समय से भारत की सांस्कृतिक धरोहर और सामाजिक संस्कृति को सुरक्षित रखते हुए हिंदी भाषा के माध्यम से राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर शिक्षा और शिक्षण के दायित्व को बखूबी निभाने में निरंतर कार्यरत हैं।

वर्ष 1936 में दक्षिण भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा का कार्यालय विजयवाड़ा में स्थापित हुआ और इस सभा के अध्यक्ष के रूप में स्वतंत्रता संग्राम सेनानी कोंडा वेंकटप्पय्या पंतुलू,  आंध्र केसरी श्री टंगटूरि प्रकाशम पंतुलु, श्री बेजवाड गोपालरेड्डी, स्वामी रामानंद तीर्थ आदि ने महान कार्य किये। आज इस संस्था से प्रत्येक वर्ष दो लाख से भी अधिक छात्रों को हिंदी परीक्षा का देने सुनहरा मौका प्राप्त हो रहा है। जिससे लाखों छात्र लाभान्वित हो रहे हैं।

हिंदी धीरे-धीरे शक्ति संचय कर रही है दक्षिण में भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा द्वारा हिंदी का शंखनाद पूरे देश में गूंज रहा है। यह जानकर हर्ष हो रहा है कि हिंदी प्रचार सभा ने हिंदी का प्रचार-प्रसार ही नहीं किया बल्कि बड़ी संख्या में हिंदी अध्यापकों, अनुवादकों एवं प्रचारकों को तैयार किया है। हिंदी की रोशनी दक्षिण के हर कोने को आलोकित कर रही है।

दक्षिण भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा की यह उपलब्धि निस्संदेह प्रशंसनीय है। राष्ट्रीय भावना के संदर्भ में हिंदी और अंग्रेजी के बीच टकराव की बात कुछ हद तक समझी भी जा सकती है। किंतु अन्य प्रादेशिक भाषाओं और हिंदी के बीच टकराव नहीं बल्कि सहयोग की भावना बननी चाहिए, जिसके कारण सभी भाषाएँ एक दूसरे का सहयोग करते हुए समृद्धशाली हो। दक्षिण भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा गैर हिंदी भाषा भाषियों के बीच हिंदी को लोकप्रिय बनाने का कार्य स्वेच्छा से कर रही है। विश्व के इतिहास को देखा जाये, तो एक बात स्पष्ट हो जाती है कि अच्छे शासन के लिए सदैव शासक और शासित के बीच मधुर संबंधों की आवश्यकता है। दोनों के बीच यह संबंध भाषा के द्वारा स्थापित होता है। हिंदी समझने वाले व्यक्ति हमारे देश में बहुत ज्यादा हैं। इसलिए जनमानस तक पहुंचने के लिए हिंदी एक सशक्त माध्यम है।

आज दक्षिण भारत हिंदी प्रचार सभा आंध्र एवं तेलंगाना राज्य स्तर का 16वाँ विशारद पदवी दान समारोह है तथा स्वयं को आप सब के बीच पाकर मुझे हार्दिक प्रसन्नता हो रही है। इस जगह पर खडे होकर मुझे बापूजी की वो पंक्तियाँ याद आ रही है जिसमें उन्होंने कहा था कि कोई भी देश सच्चे अर्थों में तब तक स्वतंत्र नहीं हे, तब तक वह अपनी भाषा में नहीं बोलता है। भारत के विभिन्न राज्यों की भाषा वहां की राजभाषा भले ही रहें, किंतु राष्ट्र और राष्ट्रीयता के परिप्रेक्ष्य में केवल हिंदी आधारशिला है।

भारत की राजभाषा हिंदी में राष्ट्रभाषा विशारद एवं राष्ट्रभाषा प्रवीण होकर उपाधि प्राप्त करने आये जो छात्र-छात्राएं यहां उपस्थित हैं उन्हें मैं शत-शत बधाइयाँ देता हूं। सभा के उद्देश्य में आपका उद्देश्य निहित हो यही मेरी शुभकामना है।

अंत में इस पुनीत अवसर पर मैं, उन सभी को स्मरण करना चाहूँगा जिन्होंने दक्षिण भारत में हिंदी के प्रचार-प्रसार को प्रारंभ कर उसे आज की इस समृद्ध स्थितियों तक पहुंचाने में अभूतपूर्व योगदान दिया है।

मैं एक बार पुन: उपधिधारी छात्र-छात्राओं को शुभकामनाएँ देते हुए उनके उज्जवल भविष्य की कामना करता हूं।

जय हिंद।""

He was addressing the Eighth Convocation of Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM), in Hyderabad today. The Minister for Irrigation, Marketing & Legislative Affairs, Shri T. Harish Rao, the Chancellor of GITAM University, Prof. K. Ramakrishna Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President congratulated the students for acquiring the coveted degrees, prizes and medals and also congratulated the teachers for sharing and imparting invaluable knowledge to mould the young minds in different disciplines.

 

The Vice President has expressed his happiness that the University has established Centralized Research Laboratories in key thrust areas, such as Water Quality, Nano-Technology, Medical Bio-Technology and Advanced Materials & Processing. He also commended for setting up of research centers in the areas of Cancer, Urban & Sustainable Development, Integrated Rural Development, Climate Change & Disaster Management.

 

The Vice President said that India is on the threshold of emerging as a major economic power and we are an old civilization with a young population which is a great demographic advantage of country.

 

The Vice President said that we must prepare ourselves to cope with the emerging dramatic changes and  we must be pro-active rather than be reactive. We must be agile and ride the waves of change, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the Government of India is fully aware of the changing environment and is relentlessly orienting itself towards innovation.  He further said that it has taken many measures to transform the country into a digitally empowered knowledge economy and these include a number of flagship schemes and programs like ‘Make in India’, ‘Start up India’ & ‘Stand up India’ to give a huge fillip to manufacturing and entrepreneurship. The ‘Digital India’ program aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to be here today at the Eighth Convocation of Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management. This institution, we all know as GITAM, has been contributing immensely to the cause of quality education in our country.  It is preparing a large number of our young boys and girls to achieve their potential in academics and contribute to the society and economy of the country.

 

As the Indian Education Commission of 1964-66 had stated in the opening paragraph of its Report – “The destiny of our country is being shaped in our classrooms.” The knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired by students form the basis for nation building.

 

On this momentous occasion, I would like to congratulate the students for acquiring the coveted degrees, prizes and medals.  I also congratulate the esteemed teachers for sharing and imparting invaluable knowledge to mould the young minds in different disciplines. I consider that the faculty have nurtured and enriched the human resources of our country and commend them for their endeavours.

 

I am happy to learn that this institution is offering quality higher education for over 37 years.  I am extremely delighted to note that GITAM has today three picturesque campuses in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.  With a multi-disciplinary approach, it is currently offering 144 UG, PG and Doctoral programs in diverse subjects and has over 20,000 regular full-time students, 1,200 research scholars and well over 60,000 students in distance mode.

 

I am told that the University is among the few universities that took lead in implementing Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) which provides flexibility in learning beyond the core discipline and pursue career of one’s choice.

 

 I am happy to note that it has established Centralized Research Laboratories in key thrust areas, such as Water Quality, Nano-Technology, Medical Bio-Technology and Advanced Materials & Processing. Setting up of research centers in the areas of Cancer, Urban & Sustainable Development, Integrated Rural Development, Climate Change & Disaster Management is also commendable.

 

I am glad to note that GITAM has taken the lead, with great foresight, to introduce the state of the art courses in many disciplines. I am told that GITAM is the first university to establish a FinTech Academy, and offer academic programs in Block-chain technology.

 

It has also taken the initiative to provide its students a world class learning experience.  In this context, it has signed MoUs with a number of world ranking global universities for collaborative research and also tied up with Stanford University to develop the stream of ‘advanced biotechnology and life sciences’ and create a  Centre of Excellence.

 

Today, universities are expected to excel not only in providing quality education, but more importantly in developing global citizens.

 

The world is shrinking into a global village because of information technology resources.  The universities of today have to build the competencies required for functioning effectively in a globalised world.  This calls for an attitudinal change and learning how to learn.  Students should know how to access, absorb, adopt and adapt new knowledge. They should know how to collaborate, coordinate and compete in different contexts. They should aim for excellence and efficiency and not settle for mediocrity or business-as-usual approach.

 

As all of you are aware, India is on the threshold of emerging as a major economic power. My dear students, we are an old civilization with a young population. No other country is having this kind of demographic advantage. 

 

My earnest appeal and advice to you, dear students, is to dream big and set your sights high.  This world is full of opportunities. You must seize them. As Swami Vivekananda exhorted a hundred years ago- “ Awake,  arise and stop not till your goal is reached”. Keep learning from the best around the world. Use the knowledge and skills you acquire to grow further, transform your world and the world of people around you. Today’s world is a world of unprecedented changes in many spheres of human life.  Innovative technologies and creative disruption are changing the way we live our lives. Some of the changes are for our good but some are creating new challenges.

 

Dear students, you must develop the abilities to separate the wheat from the chaff, the good from the bad and be bold enough, wise enough to choose the option that contributes to making our planet a better place to live.

 

The nature of our economy and the very concept of ‘work’ are also changing.  This Fourth Industrial Revolution and the advances in digital technology and robotics will together make certain types of jobs obsolete and also create many new jobs.

 

We must prepare ourselves to cope with the emerging dramatic changes. We must be pro-active rather than be reactive. We must be agile and ride the waves of change.

 

The Government of India is fully aware of the changing environment and is relentlessly orienting itself towards innovation.  The Government has taken many measures to transform the country into a digitally empowered knowledge economy and these include a number of flagship schemes and programs.

 

For example, ‘Make in India’ ‘Start up India’ and ‘Stand up India’ programs seek to give a huge fillip to manufacturing and entrepreneurship, while the ‘Digital India’ program aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.

 

Dear students, India is at the cusp of a massive transformation in all spheres.  You will be entering this exciting world of infinite opportunities after your graduation.

 

Keep your eyes open. Keep your ears to the ground and carve out your future in an area of your choice.

 I am happy that Sri T. Harish Rao, Minister for Irrigation, Marketing & Legislative Affairs, Telangana is also with us here. The industrial policy brought out by the Telangana Government has made Telangana an attractive   destination for both international and domestic entrepreneurs.

 I am happy that Hyderabad is also hub to IT, Biotechnology and Pharma industries. Hyderabad is the second largest exporter of IT products in India with about Rs. 67,000 crores of exports. In tune with Govt. of India’s commitment towards building a skilled India, the government established a T-Hub, to attract the best start-ups and entrepreneur organizations from across the world to Hyderabad. Major IT giants like Microsoft, Infosys and Wipro are already functioning from Hyderabad.

Therefore, dear students, you have a number of opportunities right here.  But do not restrict your vision. If you have a firm knowledge base, the right skill sets and a positive attitude, you can scale new heights you may not even be able to visualize today.

 

Before concluding, I wish to underscore the great role the faculty can play in shaping the universities into crucibles of positive change in society.  By paying attention to not only ‘what’ is taught but also to ‘how’ it is taught, you can transform the destiny of our great nation.

 

I would like to point out that economic growth of a country is highly dependent on “the creativity of human resources and innovation through research and development”.  The faculty must devote some time to relevant research. This will improve the intellectual stature of the Universities and make them the powerhouses of knowledge. They can potentially be the think tanks for national policy development.

 

Our country is facing a number of challenges like global warming, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, urban migration, increasing demand for energy, shortage of drinking water, polluted air, lack of safe waste disposal mechanisms and fuel-inefficient transportation. Universities should equip students with multi-disciplinary knowledge and inter-disciplinary skills to study these problems and look for solutions to meet the challenges.

 

I would like to commend GITAM for introducing such inter-disciplinary courses like Cyber Forensics and Information Security, Fin Tech, Pharma Chemistry, Food Science and Technology   and a host of other programs needed for today and tomorrow.  A multi disciplinary approach as is being followed by GITAM is the way forward.

 

There is also a strong need to set up technology incubation centres in universities to develop entrepreneurial skills among students and I am told that GITAM University has already established two incubation centres to train students in entrepreneurial skills and enabled them to establish more than 24 start-ups.

 

Friends, I have no doubt that you will always remain proud alumni of this great institution and dedicate a part of your time and resources to maintain the pre-eminence of your alma mater and bring glory to the university and our great nation. 

 

I would like to thank the university authorities for inviting me to this function and providing the opportunity to meet the young and dynamic graduates.

 

I once again offer my hearty wishes to all those who are receiving degrees, prizes, medals and honorary doctorates. 

 

My dear young students, today you got your degrees.  These are, I sincerely hope, likely to be passports to a brilliant future and excellent life.  Think of them also as a badge of honour, a decree of responsibility to live up to the University’s expectation and nation’s hopes. I do hope you will continue to learn, earn and yearn to serve with a clear vision, pure heart and strong shoulders. We need leaders who will walk the talk and be bold enough to tread untrodden paths. 

 

I congratulate the management of the University, the Vice Chancellor, his team of academic leaders and the entire staff of the University for setting a high benchmark and relentlessly trying to achieve excellence.

 

My best wishes to you all. JAI HIND.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we cannot create a developed India if there are glaring inequalities based on caste, creed, religion and sex. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book “Social Exclusion and Justice in India”, authored by Shri P.S. Krishnan, here today. The Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that over the last seven decades, the author has been a relentless champion of social justice for deprived social classes and has delved deep into roots of discrimination in Indian society. He further said that the book is a testimony to his grasp and in depth knowledge of the issues of the deprived social classes, the Dalits, the Adivasis and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, and practical and effective ways of resolving them, based on his long experience in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and in the country as a whole.

 

The Vice President said that the author has traced the dialogues between the founding fathers of our Constitution, especially Gandhiji and Dr. Ambedkar, and traced the confluence of diverse thoughts of these two great men in the final version of India’s Constitution. He further said that Dr. Ambedkar joining the first Cabinet of independent India as Minister of Law and thereafter as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly were, as the author points out, decisive steps that forged a national convergence on social justice and inclusion.

 

The Vice President said that the book is not only a piece of analytical research and synthesis but also a book which provides practical insights into how the Constitutional provisions have been translated into legislations and other programmatic interventions. Only through the empowerment of the Dalits and Adivasis and also the More, Most and Extremely Backward castes of the SEdBCs our nation can progress optimally, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the author examined the implementation of various constitutional provisions related to the identification of SCs, STs and Socially and Educationally Backward classes, political reservation, reservation in public employment and education, reservation in promotion, prohibition of bonded labour and the unique provision for development of STs. He further said that he fully endorse the author’s view that these articles in the constitution must be sincerely and holistically implemented. There is no better tribute we can pay to the founding fathers than to breathe life into these articles which are an eloquent expression of a world view that has social inclusion and social justice as the cardinal overarching principles, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we have taken the solemn resolve to deepen our democracy by caring for those who have been left out of the democratic process and SabkaSath, SabkaVikas has become our national goal. He further said that Antyodaya is taken as the non-negotiable approach. However, we have unpleasant realities to confront and that is the biggest challenge before us today, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we knew what we should do but are not doing it and we are not getting our act together. He further said that all of us to take note of this “action deficit”. There should be a national debate on sub-categorisation of Social groups to reach the un-reached, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely happy to launch Shri P.S. Krishnan’s scholarly work entitled “Social Exclusion and Justice in India”, by Routledge Publication.

 

I have known Shri P.S. Krishnan for a very long time and have been an admirer of his tremendous commitment to the cause of social justice and inclusion.  Over the last seven decades, he has been a relentless champion of social justice for deprived social classes and has delved deep into roots of discrimination in Indian society.

 

He has not only produced many well researched erudite publications but also contributed significantly to India’s policy making and legislative processes and executive action.

 

This book is yet another of his invaluable contributions to the national discourse on social exclusion and justice. It is a testimony to his grasp and in depth knowledge of the issues of the deprived social classes, the Dalits, the Adivasis and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, and practical and effective ways of resolving them, based on his long experience in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and in the country as a whole.

 

This volume closely examines the evolution of the caste system and its socio-economic ramifications and related concepts such as untouchability, atrocities, reservation in jobs, educational institutions and legislatures.

 

The author very rightly observes that “Since caste was the instrument of deprivation/exclusion, caste automatically became the instrument of mobilization. It was also the natural result of the unnatural but long and deeply entrenched institution of the caste system.” The shape of this mobilization took different forms in different parts of the country in the 19th and the 20th Centuries. Led by Mahatma Phule, Sri Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, Periyar E.V. Ramasamy with valuable support and contributions from ChhatrapatiShahu of Kolhapur, Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaekwad of Baroda these movements served to heighten the consciousness about the pernicious social evils that were stubbornly persisting.

 

The author has traced the dialogues between the founding fathers of our Constitution, especially Gandhiji and Dr. Ambedkar, and traced the confluence of diverse thoughts of these two great men in the final version of India’s Constitution. Dr. Ambedkar joining the first Cabinet of independent India as Minister of Law and thereafter as the chairman of the drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly were, as the author points out, decisive steps that forged a national convergence on social justice and inclusion.

 

A reading of the chapter on a comparison of our Constitution with the American Constitution with respect to the concepts of “social justice” and “affirmative action” fills us with a sense of quiet pride. We can’t but be impressed by the wisdom and commitment of our country’s great visionary leaders who shaped this extraordinary testament of faith and hope.

 

The book is not only a piece of analytical research and synthesis. It is also a book which provides practical insights into how the Constitutional provisions have been translated into legislations and other programmatic interventions. The author traces the progress made so far and the long road yet to be traversed to establish social equality in a holistic manner.

 

He ends the book with two very important thoughtful chapters that lay out very clearly the critical elements that are needed to move forward faster on the unfinished national agenda. He provides a Road-Map of action programmes, legislative as well as schematic, for resolving the existential conditions of continuing deprivations and disadvantages of Dalits, Advasis and SEdBCs and for bringing about their empowerment. As rightly emphasized by him, only through the empowerment of the Dalits and Adivasis and also the More, Most and Extremely Backward castes of the SEdBCs our nation can progress optimally.

 

The Constitution of our country lays the foundation for the integrated, harmonious and egalitarian society. The author calls it a “sublime edifice having a direct bearing on SC, ST and BCs that imparts to the Indian Constitution its moral flavor, unique among the constitutions of the world.”

How far has the country progressed in translating this grand vision into a reality?

 

The author acknowledges the progress, however slow, of the enactment of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989 and Amendment Act in 2015. However, as the author clearly details in Chapter 6, there have been inordinate delays and a big gap between constitutional mandates and laws and executive actions.

 

He examines the implementation of various constitutional provisions related to the identification of SCs, STs andSocially and Educationally Backward classes, political reservation, reservation in public employment and education, reservation in promotion, prohibition of bonded labour and the unique provision for development of STs. I fully endorse the author’s view that these articles in the constitution must be sincerely and holistically implemented. There is no better tribute we can pay to the founding fathers than to breathe life into these articles which are an eloquent expression of a world view that has social inclusion and social justice as the cardinal overarching principles.

 

I compliment the author for his painstaking research and meticulous eye for detail. His suggestions for remedying the current situation where the laws for SCs and STs have been “hampered by lacunae of content, casual implementation and indifference at the top”. His analysis of the history of implementation of a number of laws like Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes POA Act, 1989, Tribal land regulations and Bonded Labour System (Abolition)Act, 1976 and his suggestions for further strengthening the provisions of the laws as well as more effective implementation are worth following up.  I hope all the legislative bodies of the center and the states will take serious note of these suggestions and move expeditiously to consider amendments to the existing lawsand enactment of new lawsin the next few months.

 

The author also examines the current schemes for economic improvement and educational advancement of SCs and STs and various instruments for allocating resources like the Special Component Plan for Schedule Castes (SCP) and the Tribal sub-Plan (TSP)

 

While all the legislations and schemes suggested by him in his Road Map are important, I want to emphasize one of these legislations and one of these schemes as crucially importantat present.

 

One is the “SCP and TsP and SC and ST Development Authorities” legislation, at the level of the Center as well as States. The other is the scheme for rapid and total elimination of Dalit landlessness, and along with it the landlessness of other rural landless agricultural labor families through the Task Force method, and provision of group minor irrigation for all lands of SCs and STs.

 

It should be remembered that these are solemn national commitments made expressly by the President of India in his Address to the joint session of the Parliament in 2004. I am hopeful that the government will expeditiously consider moving forward and take the next steps.

 

The author concludes that “the total liberation, full empowerment of SCs and STs is a goal so near and yet so far. It is so near because what is required to be done is well-known and what is to be done is entirely within the competence of India’s financial, governance and administrative resources. It is so far because the inner fire of patriotism and determination required to achieve this goal is very much in deficit.”

 

I would like all of us to take note of this “action deficit”, as it were and gain inspiration from the illustrious heritage of our ancient land. Ours was a land that gave the world a universal vision of inclusion and justice. Ours is the land that saw the whole world as one family. Ours is the land that prayed for welfare of all creatures living and non-living. “SarveJanaahSukhinoBhavantu”. Ours is the land which reverberated to the music of Annamacharya in the 15th century who spoke of the same divine spirit in in all human beings irrespective of which caste one belonged to. Ours is the glorious land where Basaveswara in Karnataka and Sankaradeb in Assam led social movements in the 12th and the 15th centuries. These well springs of our civilization have somehow dried up sometime and we have come to tolerate injustice and exclusion. This cannot continue any longer.

 

We have taken the solemn resolve to deepen our democracy by caring for those who have been left out of the democratic process. SabkaSath, SabkaVikas has become our national goal. Antyodaya is taken as the non-negotiable approach. However, we have unpleasant realities to confront. That is the biggest challenge before us today.

 

As the author said, we know what we should do but are not doing it. We are not getting our act together. Arjuna was in a similar plight in the Bhagavadgita. Krishna, his divine mentor tells him:”kshudram hridaya daurbalyam tyaktvottishtha parantapa”(This weak heart will not get you anywhere. Get over this despondent attitude and inaction and stand up). In the same spirit, I would urge upon all governments and executive authorities and institutions at every level to scrupulously and meticulously implement every provision of every law and scheme for the SCs, STs and SEdBCs.

 

I would like to remind this august gathering that Swami Vivekananda had said: “In India, there are two great evils: trampling on the women and grinding the poor through caste restrictions”.

 

We cannot create a developed India if there are glaring inequalities based on caste, creed, religion and sex. The evil of caste we have inherited casts a shadow on our rich culture. It is a blot on the universal, humanistic philosophy we have espoused.

 

We must as a nation take the resolve to implement the constitutional provisions pertaining to SCs, STs and SEdBCs.  We must get inspired by the noble thoughts from the past, commit ourselves to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and take swift, decisive action. As we say, to again use a phrase from our culture, let us have “tri-karana- shuddhi” which means we must implement with a clear mind, pleasant expression, and effective action.

 

Let us take a cue from the analysis contained in this book and take this challenge headlong. Let us hear the voices of those we are trying to serve- the depressed, oppressed and suppressed. Let us create a climate of trust, mutual respect and harmonious co-existence. Let us leave no one behind as we build a new India that is sustainable, developed and deeply caring about social justice and inclusion. There should be a national debate on sub-categorisation of Social groups to reach the un-reached.

 

Jai Hind!”

The Vice President said that the author has made an excellent analysis and more such studies can help focus nation’s attention to important areas like matrimonial laws, property laws, laws relating to inheritance, succession, guardianship as well as NRI marriages and issues of sexual violence. He hoped that this book will inspire many more experts to focus on women’s issues in the next few years.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the tribal development is an important component to achieve the object of inclusive development (Sabka Vikas). He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the “Aadi Mahotsav”, a Mega fortnight long National Tribal festival with the theme: ‘A celebration of the spirit of Tribal culture, cuisine & commerce’, here today. The Union Minister for Tribal Affairs, Shri Jual Oram, the Minister of State for Tribal Affairs, Shri Sudarshan Bhagat, the Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ms. Leena Nair, the Managing Director, TRIFED, Shri Pravir Krishna and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



 

The Vice President said that this festival will prove very useful to introduce this wonderful cultural heritage to all over India and the world. He further said that another advantage through this festival can be that the objects and artifacts made by tribals will have an opportunity to sell them and get financial benefits. Their efficiency will be rewarded in the form of economic prosperity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals. He further said that the tribes must be drawn to the mainstream, but at the same time it is important to ensure that their culture remains intact. Adivasis are the aboriginals and their way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Government seeks to promote interaction between the tribal artisans and the mainstream designers from reputed design organizations. He further said that events such as this Adimahotsav are very important in this regard.  The Government has formed the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (Trifed) for achieving this, he added.

 

The Vice President congratulated the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED organizers of this Adimahotsav. He invited the tribal artisans to make the best use of this opportunity to forge links with other artisans and market drivers.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“Today, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the tribal brothers on the auspicious occasion of Adi Mahotsav. Tribals are very dear, heartwarming people of Bharat Mata. Adivasi brothers and sisters have favored the life of our country with their melodious and joyful music, joy of pleasure, unique handicrafts.

 

This festival will prove very useful to introduce this wonderful cultural heritage to all over India and the world. Another advantage through this festival can be that the objects and artifacts you make will have an opportunity to sell them and you will also be able to get financial benefits. Your efficiency will be rewarded in the form of economic prosperity.

 

I hope that all of you will be able to take full advantage of this opportunity. I urge you to continue the effort that way so far you have preserved your cultural heritage. This is an invaluable heritage. It is very important to promote, disseminate and increase it. In this endeavor, the government is supporting and will give tribute to artistic creative enthusiasm, giving special attention to it.

 

The tribes constitute over 8% of the country’s population. This is a very significant number. In real terms it corresponds to over 10 crore Indians.  The national object of inclusive development (Sabka Vikas) includes the development of tribes as an important component. Our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals.

 

The Government has always treated the tribes with a special concern.  However, there are unique challenges in the field of tribal development.  This is because the tribes must be drawn to the mainstream, but at the same time it is important to ensure that their culture remains intact.

 

The attitude of urban mainstream towards the tribes is often characterized by a belief that we have a lot to teach the tribes to help them to develop. What we generally tend to forget is that in fact the tribes have a lot to teach urban India.  When we deal with the tribes, we must always keep an open mind.  We must maintain our humility.

 

What is special about the tribes? As the name of this event suggests, it is the ‘adi’ factor that is important about them. Adivasis are the aboriginals. Their way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity. The greatness of the tribes lies in this that they have managed to retain the primal skills and their natural simplicity. Their creations have a timeless appeal. The crudest tribal handicraft instantly touches a chord in all of us. This is also particularly true of tribal music and dance.

 

The tribes of India have a wide range of handicrafts. These include hand-woven cotton, wool and silk fabrics, woodcrafts, metal craft, terracotta, bead-work, masques and other objects. They also produce compelling paintings.

 

Government has rightly recognized the need to channel the artistic talents towards income generation. It is for this reason that the Government seeks to promote interaction between the tribal artisans and the mainstream designers from reputed design organizations. The idea is to expand the product range and designs. The synergy between these two can generate marketable products of art and handicraft for the top-end global market.

 

Single items of bell-metal produced by the late Jaideo Baghel of Kondagaon in Bastar sold for as much as five lacs of rupees! This only points to the fact that on the one hand there are skills in the tribal pockets of India, and on the other hand there is high-end demand in our cities and in the international market.

 

The need is to put two and two together for a win-win result. Events such as this Adimahotsav are very important in this regard.  The Government has formed the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (Trifed) for achieving this.

 

I am happy that Trifed is doing significant work in this direction and have now embraced e-commerce and digital platforms to take the business forward.

 

Apart from handicrafts, the tribes gather from the forests a range of forest produces. These include various tree-borne products like flowers, fruits, seeds, barks and leaves; and various insect produces like honey.  All these are completely organic products.

 

We know that organic food products command a premium price. Trifed must tap this premium market which is a niche market. And, more importantly, Trifed must ensure that the benefit of higher prices accrues to the tribal. I understand that the scheme of minimum support price for forest produces has been expanded to cover all states and twenty four key products. The scheme now needs to be implemented in full earnestness.

 

I congratulate the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED organizers of this Adimahotsav. I invite the tribal artisans gathered here to make the best use of this opportunity to forge links with other artisans and market drivers. I am happy to see the enthusiasm here and the colourful festive atmosphere. I hope in the times to come we will see more of such events.

 

Jai Hind!”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that present day journalists should follow core values of accuracy, fairness, objectivity, news worthiness and independence. He was addressing the Valedictory of Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Press Council of India, on the occasion of the National Press Day, here today. The Union Minister for Textiles and Information & Broadcasting, Smt. Smriti Irani and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that when the struggle to gain independence from the British began gathering momentum, the press became an important vehicle to inspire the people and voice their aspirations. He further said that several newspapers and journals, particularly the vernacular ones, played a crusading role in the freedom movement. The press was the main source of propaganda for the freedom fighters even as the British rulers tried to suppress it at every conceivable opportunity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the nationalist role played by the newspapers and journals contributed in no small measure to influencing and moulding the public opinion during the freedom struggle. He further said that the following Independence, the press in India continued to play the role of watchdog and held a mirror to people’s problems and their aspirations. It remained one of the main pillars in protecting and strengthening democracy in the country, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the contours of journalism have changed over the years. He further said that Watergate scandal in the USA was a memorable example of how a free and fearless press can cause the downfall even a powerful President. In India too, we have had an instance in which a Chief Minister had to resign after the press highlighted a scandal relating to cement industry, he added.

 

The Vice President said that deliberate slanting of news, providing disproportionate coverage to issues, organizations or personalities, while relegating hard news to single columns or fillers or giving prominence to a non-issue that creates more tensions among people are some of the dangerous trends that have crept into the newsrooms of both the print and electronic media. He further said that the haste to beat your rivals or competitors should not lead to inaccurate reportage. Journalism is a noble profession and all of you as flag-bearers of this vocation must ensure that people are correctly informed and not become captive receivers of biased and partisan information, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“First let me convey my hearty congratulations to all the winners of national awards for excellence in journalism.

 

The press in India has a long and illustrious history ever since the first newspaper, ‘Bengal Gazette’ was started by James Augustus Hickey in 1780.

 

When the struggle to gain independence from the British began gathering momentum, the press became an important vehicle to inspire the people and voice their aspirations. Several newspapers and journals, particularly the vernacular ones, played a crusading role in the freedom movement. The press was the main source of propaganda for the freedom fighters even as the British rulers tried to suppress it at every conceivable opportunity.

 

Several journals and newspapers rose to the occasion, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy’s Sambad-Kaumudi in Bengali in 1821, Mirat-ul-Akbar in Persian in 1822, Kesari, Mahratta, The Hindu, Amrita Bazar Patrika, Bande Mataram, Al-Balagh and Al-Hilal, Young India and Hindustan Times.

 

Undaunted by the ironclad restrictions imposed by the British, the press remained fearless and the same indomitable spirit continued to be a prominent feature of the Indian media ever since, barring a temporary aberration during the infamous Emergency when the press behaved like the handmaiden of the government. Of course, there were a few exceptions like the ‘Indian Express’, The Statesman and ‘The Mainstream’.

 

The nationalist role played by the newspapers and journals contributed in no small measure to influencing and moulding the public opinion during the freedom struggle. In fact, the press during those times was the main instrument of bringing together people from different backgrounds to fight for the noble cause of attaining independence. It indeed was the biggest mission for journalists, who left no stone unturned in propagating the cause of freeing India from the clutches of British yoke.

 

Following Independence, the press in India continued to play the role of watchdog and held a mirror to people’s problems and their aspirations. It remained one of the main pillars in protecting and strengthening democracy in the country, except during the period I mentioned earlier. Today, the media landscape is dotted with thousands of journals and newspapers, hundreds of TV channels and scores of radio stations. Of course, you also have social media, which has become one of the main drivers of information in the Digital Age.

 

Friends, I am sure you all will agree that the contours of journalism have changed over the years, although it continues to cast a huge influence in moulding public opinion and decision-making by the governments, especially in democracies. Watergate scandal in the USA is a memorable example of how a free and fearless press can cause the downfall even a powerful President.

 

In India too, we have had an instance in which a Chief Minister had to resign after the press highlighted a scandal relating to cement industry.

 

I have cited these examples just to highlight the crusading role a free press can play in a democracy.

 

However, over the years, it appears that the core values which guided journalism in the past are not being observed and news is being increasingly coloured with views which are consistent with the line taken by the management of the news organization. Is this a healthy trend for a democracy? I don’t think so and all of you, who have gathered here today on National Press Day must do a serious introspection.

 

Deliberate slanting of news, providing disproportionate coverage to issues, organizations or personalities, while relegating hard news to single columns or fillers or giving prominence to a non-issue that creates more tensions among people are some of the dangerous trends that have crept into the newsrooms of both the print and electronic media. This needs to be curbed so that the pristine role played by the press earlier is restored.  Commercial interests alone should not become the motive for running a newspaper or news channel. I am not asking newspapers and TV channels to become charitable organizations overnight but some balance needs to be struck between societal obligations and business endeavors. 

 

I feel the present-day journalists should return to the core values of accuracy, fairness, objectivity, news worthiness and independence. The haste to beat your rivals or competitors should not lead to inaccurate reportage.

 

In these days of sting operations, under-cover journalism and rapid expansion of social media platforms, I think there is a need to bring all media organizations under a single watchdog body with a new nomenclature. 

 

Of course, the Press Council of India has been playing a major role in promoting responsible journalism in the country. With the changing contours of journalism, I feel that the time has come for prescribing a minimum educational qualification for aspiring journalists. This is absolutely necessary to ensure that the standards and ethics of journalism are maintained and not compromised.

 

Friends, journalism is a noble profession and all of you as flag-bearers of this vocation must ensure that people are correctly informed and not become captive receivers of biased and partisan information.

 

Thank You and Jai Hind!”

He further said that a number of Indian states have developed productive partnership with Singapore. We believe in cooperative and competitive federalism and states are focussing on socio-economic development in a concerted manner, he added. 

The Vice President said that that both India and Singapore are important to each other’s progress and prosperity. He further said that Singapore is an important partner in India’s development priorities. India is at the cusp of a major transformation an all spheres including the ease of doing business, he added. 

The Vice President expressed his happiness that a Singapore consortium has started developing the start-up area in the new capital city Amaravati of Andhra Pradesh. This can very well develop as a future model for new projects all over India.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that combine Agricultural Technology with Information Technology to improve Agricultural Sector in the country. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating AP AgTech Summit 2017, in Vizag, Andhra Pradesh today. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu, the Minister for Agriculture, Horticulture, Sericulture and Agri-Processing, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, the Minister for Human Resources Development, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Ganta Srinivasa Rao, the Minister for Endowments, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Pydikondala Manikyala Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry contributes around 17 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 2016-17 at 2011-12 prices, he added. 

The Vice President said that we have formidable challenges confronting us and we have set for ourselves a very ambitious target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. If we have to achieve this, the progress in various sources of growth has to be accelerated by 33 percent, he added. 

The Vice President said that business as usual will not do and we have to innovate, work with farmers to infuse knowledge and technology.  We must use technology to enhance productivity and see that the economic benefits of increased production reach all the farmers, he added. 

The Vice President said that growing needs of our country’s increasing population require us to evolve our own home grown food security strategy. He further said that increased production and efficient distribution of food grains can move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all. The AP AgTech Summit 2017 is an excellent opportunity for global leaders, start-up founders and technology experts to discuss innovative ideas for agricultural transformation in Andhra Pradesh as well as in the rest of India, he added. 

The Vice President said that technology can help improve farmers’ lives in a number of ways - to know the health of the soil and help him choose from a variety of crops that can be grown on the land; forecasting the seasonal conditions in advance; intensification and diversification of farming in order to increase productivity and farmers’ incomes; diversify towards other allied occupations as well like dairy and forestry; conservation of water, rain water harvesting, construction of check dams, drip and sprinkler irrigation; infrastructure like rural roads, dependable quality power, godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards; food processing; timely credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies and the market. We need to work collaboratively and strategically to make a difference in the lives of our farmers and tap into the nature’s bounty, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am happy to be with all of you at the inaugural session of AP AgTech Summit 2017. 

Ours is a country with a vast agro-ecological diversity and where 64 percent of the total workforce in the rural areas is engaged in agriculture and contributes 39 percent of total rural net domestic product. 

Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry contributes around 17 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 2016-17 at 2011-12 prices. 

The last seventy years after independence have been years of significant growth. The country’s food grain production increased by 8.7 per cent and reached a record high of 273.83 million tonnes in 2016-17. 

As the Food and Agriculture Organization acknowledged: 

“India is the world's largest producer of milk, pulses and jute, and ranks as the second largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruit and cotton. From 50 million tons in 1950, India's food grain production rose more than five times, to over 257 million tons in 2014-15. India is the world's largest milk producer, producing over 130 million tons annually. The dairy sector is also one of the largest employers of rural people, especially women. With an annual production of over 10 million tons, India ranks second in global fish production and aquaculture, next only to China.” 

Yet, we have formidable challenges confronting us. 

We have set for ourselves a very ambitious target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. According to one estimate, if we have to achieve this, the progress in various sources of growth has to be accelerated by 33 percent”. 

Clearly, business as usual will not do. We have to innovate. We have to work with farmers to infuse knowledge and technology.  We must use technology to enhance productivity and see that the economic benefits of increased production reach all the farmers. Combine Agricultural Technology with Information Technology to improve Agricultural Sector. Workforce in agriculture sector is declining at the rate of approximately 2 percent every year. There is a general perception that agriculture is not a good economic proposition. This perception and trend must be reversed. 

It is obvious that a concerted, coordinated focused action is required on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector. 

We cannot be complacent about the food security situation as it exists today. The growing needs of our country’s increasing population require us to evolve our own home grown food security strategy. Increased production and efficient distribution of food grains can move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all. 

The AP AgTech Summit 2017 is an excellent opportunity for global leaders, start-up founders and technology experts to discuss innovative ideas for agricultural transformation in Andhra Pradesh as well as in the rest of India. I am glad that there is a competition among innovators to come up with solutions to small farmers’ problems and afterwards, the state government intends to actually roll out viable solutions across the state. I am pleased that the focus is not only on generating new ideas but also on translating good ideas into programmes. In fact, this is the need of the hour. We must learn from the best minds around the world and adapt the knowledge and skills to transform our farmers’ lives. 

Technology can help improve farmers’ lives in a number of ways. Let me mention five crucial areas that I think are very important. 

Technology can enable a farmer to know the health of the soil and help him choose from a variety of crops that can be grown on the land. This is already being done through the Soil Health Cards. We must go beyond this by effectively transferring information and knowledge to the farmers. 

First, we have to bring in a major shift in Indian agriculture moving it from a low-productivity stage to a high productive level and at the same time ensure that it is sustainable and equitable. The productivity of most of the crops in the country is below world average mainly because of poor access to irrigation and improved technology.  

Forecasting the seasonal conditions in advance, testing the soil and water availability scientists must work with the government’s extension machinery like Krishi Vignan Kendras to advise the farmers on the cropping patterns and post-harvest processes and food processing technologies. 

We must focus on intensification and diversification of farming in order to increase productivity and farmers’ incomes.  Productivity will go up through use of high yielding varieties of seeds and efficient use of land and water. Today, high yielding varieties cover only 69 percent of the total area under cereal crops. This coverage should be expanded. Equally important is that more crops must be grown on the same land. 

The farmers’ incomes can be improved if, through technology, we can advise them on not only the best cropping pattern but also suggest diversification. Farmers must be encouraged to diversify and take up high value crops like fruits, vegetables, fibre, condiments, pulses, spices and sugarcane. 

There is also a tremendous potential to diversify towards other allied occupations as well like dairy and forestry. Similarly, we need to encourage farmers to take up agro-forestry and forestry, Irrigation is of course the most crucial factor in which technology can greatly help. Not only should we use technology to increase the availability of water, but we should also advise the farmers on the optimum utilization of available water. Conservation of water, rain water harvesting, construction of check dams, drip and sprinkler irrigation are areas in which technological inputs will be valuable. “It is seen that even districts at same level of irrigation show large difference in aggregate productivity”. Every drop of this scarce resource must be made use of optimally. As Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay said, give work to every hand and water to every land to improve the agricultural sector. 

Second, in addition to irrigation, we need to focus on infrastructure like rural roads, dependable quality power, godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards. 

A major thrust must be given to food processing. Technology plays a very important role in encouraging farmers to take up entrepreneurial ventures and agro-based industries. The farmers have to be given to the latest know-how and trained in the do-how as well. 

The third area in which technology can support the transformation we are envisaging is Marketing. 

Selling agricultural produce and getting a fair return is a big challenge for most farmers. The farmers still rely on local markets and have to resort, very often, to distress sale. Reliable, real time information is key. I am glad that a new initiative called E-NAM seeks to remedy this situation by adopting an e-trading platform for agricultural commodities. 

The farmers will gain if we can enable them to tap into the export markets as well. Technologies can help in making this transition from mere sellers in the domestic market to exporters of surplus produce. 

The fourth and the fifth important building blocks of a robust ecosystem are timely credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies. Both these can be made more transparent and farmer-friendly if the power of digital technologies can be harnessed. These encourage farmers to invest in better, income-generating crops and agricultural practices and increase their incomes. The insurance cover shields the farmers against unforeseen climatic and natural disasters.  The kisan credit cards and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are steps in the right direction and need to be universalized.  

I am glad that this event is taking place in the sunrise state and in Vishakhapatnam, the smart city in the making. Government should give top priority to Agriculture. Linking rivers is the best solution for improving agricultural sector in the country. 

Andhra Pradesh is one of the major producers of a number of crops in India. One of the leading producers of food grains and oilseeds, the state is also the top producer of mango, chillies and turmeric. With Horticulture growing at 16.8% and Fishing and Aquaculture at 30.1% in 2016-17, there is a significant push to augment agricultural incomes from the Hon’ble Chief Minister. The untapped potential for aquaculture and fisheries in Andhra Pradesh is immense because of its 974 Km of coastline. 

The bye line you have adopted for this summit is also apt. 

In the new India we are looking forward to, we definitely need progressive farmers who adopt smart farming practices. 

We need to work collaboratively and strategically to make a difference in the lives of our farmers and tap into the nature’s bounty. 

I hope the scientists, technology experts and policy makers as well as the programme implementers will come up with a strategy that will bring in significant, sustainable change in the agriculture landscape of Andhra Pradesh and India. 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Lifestyle changes and preventive public health should be prioritized. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the ‘India State-level Disease Burden Report and Technical Paper’, an initiative by the Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with Public Health Foundation of India and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (University of Washington, Seattle), here today. The Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Shri J.P. Nadda, the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Smt. Anupriya Patel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that achieving good health for all of India’s population is an important goal of the government of India as a foundation for further social and economic development. He further said that the gap between the highest life expectancy in an Indian state and the lowest life expectancy currently is 11 years, and the difference between the state with the highest infant mortality rate and lowest rate is 4 fold.

 

The Vice President said that many health indicators in India continue to be poorer than some other countries at a similar level of development.  He further said that this implies that while significant health improvements have happened in India, we could do better. India has had important national surveys and data from other sources that indicate significant differences in the burden of some diseases between different parts of the country, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the report by the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative released today provides these comprehensive estimates for each state from 1990 to 2016 for the first time in India.  He further said that this report, along with the technical scientific paper and the open-access visualization tool that are also released today, together provide systematic insights in to the health status of each state and the health inequalities between the states of India. High disease burden caused by malnutrition in India must be tackled soon to enable the next generation of Indians to reach their full potential in their personal development as well as the nation’s development, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""India is home to almost one-fifth of the world’s population. People living in different parts of the country and states differ in their ethnic origin, culture and in various other ways that influence their health status.

 

Achieving good health for all of India’s population is an important goal of the government of India as a foundation for further social and economic development.

 

Health is wealth. If we have it, we can acquire wealth, but there is no guarantee that you can get health with health. We are living in a global village and the world has become small. We should reaffirm our commitment to give our children a healthy future and a better place to live. Medical professionals should adopt a humanitarian way in treating patients. A responsive performing healthcare delivery system with people cantered reforms can transform the health landscape of the country. Lifestyle changes and preventive public health should be prioritized.

 

The health status of Indians has been improving since Independence.  For example, the life expectancy of a person born in India in 1960 was 40 years, which has increased to about 70years now.  Of every 1000 live children born in India in 1960, about 160 died in the first year, but now this death rate of infants is about a fourth of that level. 

 

These broad improving trends however mask major inequalities between states and between socioeconomic strata. 

 

To highlight this, the gap between the highest life expectancy in an Indian state and the lowest life expectancy currently is 11 years, and the difference between the state with the highest infant mortality rate and lowest rate is 4 fold. 

 

When compared internationally, many health indicators in India continue to be poorer than some other countries at a similar level of development.  This implies that while significant health improvements have happened in India, we could do better.

 

In order to do better, several things need to happen in parallel.  These include higher priority for health in the country’s policy making and enhanced resources for preventive and public health measures. There should be adequate mechanisms at the ground level for keeping Indians healthy and for suitable healthcare when they fall sick. We should also have a solid knowledge system that enables comprehensive tracking of the health and disease burden trends in every part of the country.

 

It is on this last aspect that the work of the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative is crucial for health progress in India.

 

India has had important national surveys and data from other sources that indicate significant differences in the burden of some diseases between different parts of the country.

 

But ours is a vast and diverse country. What we require is a more detailed state wise picture for taking appropriate action. Till now, we have not had this systematic and complete compilation of the burden of all diseases and the risk factors behind them for every state of the country in a single framework. This gap is now being filled by the current initiative.

 

The report by the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative released today provides these comprehensive estimates for each state from 1990 to 2016 for the first time in India.  This report, along with the technical scientific paper and the open-access visualization tool that are also released today, together provide systematic insights in to the health status of each state and the health inequalities between the states of India. 

 

The findings show that the overall disease burden per person in some states of India is almost twice as much as in some other states, and the burden rate due to the leading diseases ranges five to ten times between the states.  These inequalities must be addressed.

 

The specific disease burden trends for each state in this report provide a reference for planning interventions that are needed to address the major disease problems in each state. Such evidence-based health planning in each state would result in health improvements in every state, reduce the health inequalities between the states, and help make more rapid progress towards achieving the overall health targets for India. 

 

One particular point in the findings released today that needs to be addressed as one of the highest priorities is the continuing very high disease burden caused by malnutrition in India.  This must be tackled soon to enable the next generation of Indians to reach their full potential in their personal development as well as the nation’s development. We cannot be complacent about this critical aspect of human development as we try to build a new resurgent India.

 

It is encouraging that the work leading to this report was done by a network of collaborators including many leading health scientists and stakeholders in India representing over one hundred institutions.

 

The guidance of the Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, and her close engagement with this work over the past two years has been crucial for the success of this work.

 

I congratulate Director General ICMR and all the collaborating individuals and institutions for completing this excellent work. You all have contributed to enhancing the knowledge base. This will be helpful in designing specific targeted approaches for improving the healthcare in our country. I hope to see this national initiative being continued and further enriched in the years to come. I wish you all the best in your endeavours.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education is a key instrument in developing social infrastructure - for it breaks the vicious cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. He was addressing the East West Cultural Festival in commemoration of the 121st birth anniversary of Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder and Acharya of ISKCON, here today.



 The Vice President said that for millenniums, India has served as the seat of knowledge, combined with its deep and rich culture, it has taught countless people the righteous path of life. He further said that India has also been the land of Maha-purushas who dedicated their lives to serve humanity.

 The Vice President said that due to globalization and technology, the world has become interconnected and multi-culturalism is common. He further said that much before all of these began, Swami Prabhupada had already built a bridge between the East and the West and that bridge was a cultural bridge. It allowed the west to experience the rich heritage of India, he added.

 The Vice President said that we meet at a very peculiar time where on one hand the world is making rapid advancement in various fields; yet on the other hand many challenges in the form of terrorism, environmental degradation, drug addiction, hatred, hunger & poverty continue to stare at us. He further said that culture, on the other hand, is the life-sustaining force of social infrastructure. It enlivens ethical and moral values that seem to be eroding in our modern lives, he added.

 Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""In many ways it is astonishing that a person who is seventy years old did all of this, sleeping just three-four hours a day and produced so many books which have been translated into 82 world languages.

 But, we meet at a very peculiar time where on one hand the world is making rapid advancement in various fields; yet on the other hand many challenges in the form of terrorism, environmental degradation, drug addiction, hatred, hunger & poverty continue to stare at us.

 It is in challenging times like these that I find the message of Swami Prabhupada very relevant. The beauty of his teachings lay in the fact that he united everyone under the banner of devotion and service without making any distinctions of race, gender, caste, religion or social status. He and his movement are equally accessible to anyone and everyone.

 This is the teaching of this land that we see everyone as one family without any bias or distinction – Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

 It is natural that when we see the world as one family, our care and concern extends to everyone. This was witnessed in the life of Swami Prabhupada. He not only provided spiritual teachings but equally cared for the wellbeing of others.

 Community welfare too is at the very heart of the social infrastructure that dominated our Indian civilization for millennia. It is our great civilization that gave the world the famous slogan:

 

lokah samasta sukhino bhavantu

sarve janah sukhino bhavantu

sarva jiva jantu sukhino bhavantu

 

“May the whole world be happy and peaceful. May all the people in the world be happy and peaceful. May all forms of life be happy and peaceful.”

 I’m happy to learn that the project he started as the Hare Krishna Food For Life is today the world’s largest food relief program. Under the Annamrita program, ISKCON members daily feed 12 lakh government school students free meals. Under the tribal care initiative the organization is providing education, health care in remote parts of Assam, Tripura, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. All these initiatives are highly commendable.

Education is a key instrument in developing social infrastructure -  for it breaks the vicious cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.

 

Culture, on the other hand, is the life-sustaining force of social infrastructure. It enlivens ethical and moral values that seem to be eroding in our modern lives.

But to me – Swamy Prabhupada’s greatest achievement was that he was an exemplary ambassador of India’s ancient civilization. He carried the same traditional values that you, his followers, are now promoting from inside and outside the shores of India.

And he was so remarkably successful in doing this, that today we see hundreds of thousands of westerners who are exceptionally Indian in their outlook and remarkably Vedic in their lifestyles.

This fits in well with one of the seven purposes of ISKCON  “…. to educate all people in the techniques of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance of values in life and to achieve real unity and peace in the world.”

Movements like ISKCON, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, are helping the youth of India who are our future to lead a compassionate, service oriented life free of vices.

The 15th century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu enjoins all Indians to do paropakara or welfare activity for humankind. This is what our scriptures have also said – “Paropakaararthamidam Shariram” (This body of ours becomes useful if it serves others). This is a direct order that Swami Prabhupada, who comes in the lineage of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, took to heart when he travelled worldwide and promoted the true glory of India.

He spread Krishna consciousness around the globe. It is a consciousness which promotes love, harmony and enables each human being to realize the divine forces lying latent within us.

Once again, I thank you for inviting me to be here amidst all of you for this nice festival. I wish you all success in your future endeavors to serve the society.

Thank you very much. 

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that nonviolence is the path to which a healthy society can be created. He was addressing the Ahimsa Diwas Function organized by Ahimsa Vishwa Bharti on its 13th Foundation Day, in New Delhi today. The Founder of Ahimsa Vishwa Bharti, Acharya Dr. Lokesh Muni and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.



The Vice President said that establishing nonviolence, peace and goodwill in society, nation and all over the world has been the purpose behind the establishment of Vishwa Bharti Institute. He further said that by associating religion with social service, we can make it a means of eradicating social evils and linking religion to spirituality.

The Vice Presidnet said that there is a need for peace and a harmonious environment in the society for development. He further said that nonviolence is also important because violence does not solve any problem and violence leads to repetition of violence. Through dialogue, every problem can be solved through nonviolent style, by negotiation, he added.

The Vice President said that many great men in our country like Lord Mahavir, Lord Buddha gave a lot of emphasis on nonviolence. He further said that Mahatma Gandhi had liberated India with the weapons of nonviolence. Nonviolence does not mean cowardice, he added.

The Vice President said that Indian culture is pluralistic and unity in diversity is its fundamental characteristic. Sarvadharm harmony is its original mantra and this is where the nonviolence, peace and goodwill start, he added.

The Vice President expressed his hope that the Ahimsa Vishva Bharti Institution will play an important role in building society and nation building by connecting the work of service in the society, especially by connecting the younger generation to the path of nonviolence.

 


Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

“परम पूज्य आचार्य डॉ. लोकेश मुनि जी, श्री रजत शर्मा जी, श्रीमती किरण चोपड़ा जी, डॉ. अजीत गुप्ता जी, श्री मनीष शाह जी, उपस्थित बंधुओं एवं बहिनों।

आज अहिंसा विश्व भारती संस्था की स्थापना के गौरवशाली बारह वर्ष पूर्ण होने पर स्थापना दिवस (Foundation Day) “अहिंसा दिवस” के रूप में मनाया जा रहा है। यह सभी के लिए हर्ष का विषय है। भारतीय परंपरा में 12 वर्ष का विशिष्ठ महत्व है। सनातन परंपरा में 12 वर्ष में महाकुम्भ का आयोजन होता है। जैन परंपरा में श्रमण बेलगोला में 12 वर्ष में महा मस्तकाभिषेक का आयोजन होता है। कालचक्र के अनुसार 12 वर्षों का काल खंड एक युग कहलाता है, उस दृष्टि से अहिंसा विश्व भारती संस्था द्वितीय युग में प्रवेश कर रही है। मैं इस अवसर पर संस्था के संस्थापक आचार्य डॉ. लोकेश मुनि जी को व आप सभी कार्यकर्ताओं को हार्दिक बधाई व शुभकामनायें देता हूं।

अहिंसा विश्व भारती संस्था की स्थापना के पीछे विशेष उद्देश्य रहा है। समाज, राष्ट्र व पूरे विश्व में अहिंसा, शांति व सद्भावना की स्थापना करना। धर्म को समाज सेवा से जोड़कर, उसे सामाजिक बुराईयों के मिटाने का माध्यम बनाना तथा धर्म को अध्यात्म से जोड़ना। आचार्य डॉ. लोकेश मुनि जी ने इन 12 वर्षों में मानवीय मूल्यों के उत्थान के लिए, नैतिक व चारित्रिक मूल्यों के प्रचार-प्रसार के लिए, देश व दुनिया में घूम-घूम कर जो प्रयास किया है, वह उल्लेखनीय है, सराहनीय है। यही कारण है कि इसी विज्ञान भवन में भारत सरकार ने उन्हें वर्ष 2010 के राष्ट्रीय सांप्रदायिक सद्भावना पुरस्कार से सम्मानित किया। संयोग से उस राष्ट्रीय पुरस्कार की चयन समिति के अध्यक्ष उपराष्ट्रपति होते हैं। आज उसी विज्ञान भवन में एक बार पुन: मैं उनके मानव कल्याणकारी कार्यों के लिए अभिनंदन करता हूं।

बंधुओं आज अहिंसा दिवस समारोह का आयोजन इसीलिए महत्वपूर्ण है कि अहिंसा के अभाव में समाज में शांति व सद्भावना नहीं हो सकती। हमारे देश के प्रधानमंत्री विकास पर बल देते हैं। विकास के लिए समाज में शांति व सद्भावनापूर्ण वातावरण की जरूरत होती है। अहिंसा दिवस इसलिए भी महत्वपूर्ण है क्योंकि हिंसा से किसी समस्या का समाधान नहीं होता है। हिंसा प्रतिहिंसा को जन्म देती है। संवाद के द्वारा, वार्ता के द्वारा, अहिंसात्मक शैली से हर समस्या को सुलझाया जा सकता है। यही कारण है कि पिछले दिनों भारत सरकार ने कश्मीर में शांति व अमन के लिए संवाद को माध्यम बनाने की घोषणा की।

हमारे देश में अनेक महापुरुषों ने भगवान महावीर, भगवान बुद्ध ने अहिंसा पर बहुत बल दिया। महात्मा गांधी ने अहिंसा के अस्त्र से भारत को आजाद कराया था। अहिंसा का अर्थ कायरता नहीं है। अहिंसा ही वह मार्ग है जिस पर चलकर स्वस्थ समाज का निर्माण हो सकता है। अहिंसा के मार्ग से ही विश्व शांति व विश्‍व का कल्याण संभव है।

भारतीय संस्कृति बहुलतावादी संस्कृति है। अनेकता में एकता उसकी मौलिक विशेषता है। सर्वधर्म सद्भाव इसका मूल मंत्र है। यहीं से अहिंसा, शांति और सद्भावना का शुभारंभ होता है। हम सभी विकास चाहते हैं, समृद्धि चाहते हैं। सामाजिक जीवन में शांति, बंधुत्व, प्रेम, अहिंसा एवं समतामूलक विकास के पक्षधर हैं। विकास व शांति का गहरा संबंध है। धर्मगुरु, राजनेता व समाज के विभिन्न क्षेत्रों के प्रमुख जब एक मंच से अहिंसा, शांति व सद्भावना का संदेश देंगे तो निश्चित रूप से इसका प्रभाव होगा।

जिस प्रकार आचार्य लोकेश के मार्गदर्शन में अहिंसा विश्व भारती संस्था भारत में ही नहीं अपितु विश्व में अहिंसा, शांति एवं सद्भावना की स्थापना, मानवीय मूल्यों के उत्थान, राष्ट्रीय चरित्र निर्माण के लिए निरंतर प्रयत्नशील है। संस्था समाज में नशाखोरी, कन्याभ्रूण हत्या, पर्यावरण प्रदूषण आदि सामाजिक बुराइयों के विरोध में राष्ट्रव्यापी आन्दोलन चला रही है उसकी जितनी सराहना की जाये वो कम है।

मुझे आशा है कि अहिंसा विश्व भारती संस्था इस द्वितीय युग में इसी तरह समाज में सेवा के कार्यों को आगे बढ़ाते हुए खासकर युवा पीढ़ी को अहिंसा के मार्ग से जोड़कर समाज व राष्ट्र निर्माण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभायेगी। एक बार पुन: अहिंसा विश्व भारती से जुड़े आप सभी कार्यकर्ताओं को स्थापना दिवस पर बहुत-बहुत बधाई।

 

जय हिन्द!”

He was delivering the 13th Annual Convocation of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology University, in Bhubaneswar, Odisha today. The Governor of Odisha, Shri S.C. Jamir and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that education occurs in the classrooms, the sports fields, at home, through internet and the media and multiple daily interactions with people around us. He further said that all formal, non-formal and informal channels contribute to making us educated. Learning new skills and acquiring new knowledge is vital in today’s knowledge economy, he added.

 The Vice President said that upgrading our competence, updating our knowledge and adapting to a rapidly changing work environment is the need of the hour. He advised the students to think outside the box and collect as well as connect facts. He further said that you must acquire and utilize vast resources that are now more readily available than before: information and knowledge and you must strive to be the best in whatever field you choose, he added.

 The Vice President said that accessing, adopting, adapting and assimilation of new ideas has been India’s strength. He further said that we must revive and adopt this inclusive, welcoming world view. That is the best way to grow and bring back the lost glow on the face of our motherland, he added.

 Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""I am indeed privileged to address the bright young generation of this great country.

 I would like to thank KIIT University and its founder Dr. Achyuta Samanta for creating such a wonderful University and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS).

 I am told that KIIT is a Grade ‘A’ university which has been nurturing talents over the last twelve years.

 Convocation is always a special day for students, parents and the faculty members. Students look back at the years they have spent at the University, learning new things, making new friends and gaining new insights on the world. They also look forward to the graduation and beyond. The faculty members feel proud of the students’ achievements and so do the student’s parents.

 It is a moment of celebration. It is a moment of glory and satisfaction. It is a moment of looking forward to a hopeful future.

 I congratulate each one of the students and the faculty members as well as their parents.  Education occurs in the classrooms, the sports fields, at home, through internet and the media and multiple daily interactions with people around us. All formal, non-formal and informal channels contribute to making us educated. Teachers play a pivotal role in educating the society. Google can't replace Guru.

 Dear students, you are fortunate to be a part of the educated India. You are among the 25% of our country’s youth who are enrolled in institutions of higher education. I compliment you on successful completion of the courses you have pursued in the University. I hope you will continue to learn even after you leave the University.

 Learning new skills and acquiring new knowledge is vital in today’s knowledge economy. Upgrading our competence, updating our knowledge and adapting to a rapidly changing work environment is the need of the hour.  To do this, you must keep your eyes, ears, minds and hearts open. You must learn to discover and innovate. You must know how to think outside the box and collect as well as connect facts. You must acquire and utilize vast resources that are now more readily available than before : information and knowledge. You must strive to be the best in whatever field you choose.

 You are the inheritors of a great culture, an ancient culture, a culture that valued learning and knowledge, a culture that emphasized inclusion, truth, righteousness and welfare of all.  I can only echo the wise advice given by Upanisadic teachers:

                         “Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara,

                        Swaadhyayaanna Pramadah”

 “Speak the truth, practice virtue, don’t give up learning”

 Seers have also said “Adopt good practices, do not neglect welfare”.

 Accessing, adopting, adapting and assimilation of new ideas has been India’s strength.

 We must revive and adopt this inclusive, welcoming world view. 

 That is the best way to grow and bring back the lost glow on the face of our motherland. We cannot be a Vishwguru if we do not connect with Vishwam and contribute to the welfare and well being of our countrymen and the people on this beautiful planet.

 Your university is located in the historic land of Utkala that transformed one of India’s greatest emperors – Ashoka - from being a ferocious king to a pious, development oriented monarch.  We need this kind of transformation today – from needless wars to blissful harmony between people.  Education, in its broadest sense, should foster this transformation. “Education is that which liberates” according to our ancient visionaries. It should liberate us from narrow, tunnel vision. It should liberate us from prejudices, hatred, intolerance. “Vidya dadaati Vinayam”, Education should make us humble, should make us patient and make us good listeners.

 I thought I should share some thoughts on this happy occasion as you move on to shape your lives.

 Once again, my felicitations to Dr. Samanta who has set up this excellent centre of learning. My sincerest congratulations to the faculty members for their tireless commitment to the noblest of causes.  My affectionate greetings and good wishes to all my young friends who are graduating today and to many more who are studying in this University.

 May the Lord Tribhuvaneswara guide all of us towards energetic action with enlightened minds and enthusiastic hearts.

 

Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Entrepreneurship development is an integral part of farming process to increase the profitability of farming. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 9th 'Agrovision' Workshops, National Expo & Conference, in Nagpur, Maharashtra today. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari, the Minister of Energy, New and Renewable Energy, Maharashtra, Shri Chandrashekhar Bawankule, the Minister of Agriculture and Horticulture, Maharashtra, Shri Pandurang Fundkar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that unless we create a value chain involving the producer till consumer the profitability of farming shall not improve. He further said that in the last few years there has been an agrarian crisis and the profitability of farm sector has declined. This is mainly because farmers have medium to small holdings, and poor market access and also too much dependence on few crops and very little diversification, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Agrovision has now emerged as the Central India’s Largest Agri Summit and is strengthening the confidence of farmers to make agriculture an economically viable and a sustainable profession. The prosperity of the nation is linked to the betterment of farming community and naturally they need to be enlightened on the use of modern technologies for achieving sustainability and profitability, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the farmers of this country made the nation self sufficient in food milk, vegetables, fruits, cotton sugar and many other agricultural produce through a series of revolutions like green, white and blue revolutions. Unfortunately the increased production has not resulted in proportional increase in the farmers’ income, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the vision of our founding fathers was to have an India that is prosperous, peaceful and progressive. He further said that the Agrovision carries a similar vision to drive its mission forward and in order to move towards home grown food security, we have to create an effective agricultural eco-system. Knowledge sharing and encouraging adoption of new technologies is an integral and key part of this eco-system, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely happy to participate in this mega exhibition organized by Agrovision.

 

I understand that this has been an annual feature and lakhs of farmers visit this event and gain knowledge from the exhibition, workshops and conferences organized along with the exhibition of modern technology.

 

It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that you educate the farmers by arranging free workshops on diverse areas of agriculture so that they can improve their living from the farm sector. Another activity that is praise worthy is arranging special conferences on topical issues that attract agri-entrepreneurs in this region.

 

I firmly believe that unless we create a value chain involving the producer till consumer the profitability of farming shall not improve. Therefore, events like this can play a major role in transforming the current agricultural situation.

 

Vidarbha and surrounding regions are mainly dependent on rain with very little irrigation. However, the area is endowed with fertile soil, good sunshine and hard working peasants.

 

In the last few years there has been an agrarian crisis. The profitability of farm sector has declined. This is mainly because farmers have medium to small holdings, and poor market access. Another reason for the distress is too much dependence on few crops and very little diversification.

 

Farmers have to move to horticulture, animal husbandry, processing and several such allied sectors if their incomes have to be improved.

 

Realizing the need to diversify agriculture and to create value chain, visionary leader and chief Patron of Agrovision Shri Nitin Gadkariji, recognized the need for a platform to educate, innovate and encourage the farmers of this region nearly a decade ago. Today’s 9th edition of this event is a testimony of its success.

 

I am glad that through Agrovision, special efforts are being made to educate farmers about the modern farm practices and new technologies. Here farmers, researchers, entrepreneurs, policy makers & other stake holders connected with agriculture come face to face to deliberate & discuss about various developments as well as current challenges in agriculture.

 

Agrovision has now emerged as the Central India’s Largest Agri Summit and is strengthening the confidence of farmers to make agriculture an economically viable and a sustainable profession. I am happy to learn that many farmers from other states like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan will participate in this event along with farmers from adjoining states like AP, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

 

Agriculture is the culture of this great country and around 52% people are directly dependent for their survival on agriculture. The prosperity of the nation is linked to the betterment of farming community and naturally they need to be enlightened on the use of modern technologies for achieving sustainability and profitability. The efforts of Agrovision are highly commendable and need to be replicated all over the country.

 

The farmers of this country made the nation self sufficient in food milk, vegetables, fruits, cotton sugar and many other agricultural produce through a series of revolutions like green, white and blue revolutions.

 

Unfortunately the increased production has not resulted in proportional increase in the farmers’ income.

 

This is mainly because of the emphasis on primary produce and not linking it to market and secondary process product development.

 

The next revolution shall come through development of the value chain and sharing the profit with primary producer, the farmer.

 

Entrepreneurship development, therefore, is an integral part of farming process to increase the profitability of farming. I am told that AGROVISION emphasizes linking the produce to processing and marketing and therefore has invited several entrepreneurs to participate in this event along with farmers.

 

I congratulate all those involved in organization of this mega event.

 

In the past, Vidarbha was known for the crops of Cotton, Soybean and Oranges but in recent years other crops like Sugarcane, Rice, Pulses, Pomegranate, Turmeric, Ginger have seen a remarkable production here.

 

The real impact of this event can be gauged from the fact that many farmers are now planting pomegranate, custard apple, amla, dragon fruit and other dry land fruit crops and getting huge benefits from farming. A current evaluation of impact has shown that in the last five years, pomegranate cultivation which was just 100 acres in this region in 2010-11 has now reached 5000 acres in all the western Vidarbha districts. Milk production has shown an upward trend.  Sugarcane cultivation and sugar production have improved the quality of life of the farmers.

 

Agrovision has achieved its goal of creating awareness about diversification of farming. Farmers are moving away from cotton- soyabean, millet and making a shift to Dairy, Horticulture, Sericulture, Bee Keeping, Floriculture and Polyhouse farming.

 

The vision of our founding fathers was to have an India that is prosperous, peaceful and progressive. Agrovision carries a similar vision to drive its mission forward. In order to move towards home grown food security, we have to create an effective agricultural eco-system.

 

Knowledge sharing and encouraging adoption of new technologies is an integral and key part of this eco-system. I congratulate Gadkariji who pioneered this initiative and the organizers of this event for revitalizing Indian agriculture.

 

Intensification and diversification as well as end-to-end processing hold the key to improving the lives of farmers.

 

Successive governments have been taking up a number of reform measures to strengthen the ecosystem but I think more time-bound, systematic and systemic efforts are called for. Irrigation is of course the most crucial factor.

 

In addition to irrigation, the government is rightly focusing on infrastructure like rural roads, dependable quality power, godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards.

Two other important building blocks of a robust ecosystem are timely credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies. These allow for farmers to invest in better, income-generating crops and agricultural practices and increase their incomes. The insurance cover shields the farmers against unforeseen climatic and natural disasters.  The kisan credit cards and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are steps in the right direction and need to be universalized. 

 

Marketing of agricultural produce and getting a fair return is a big challenge for most farmers. A new initiative called E-NAM seeks to remedy this situation by adopting an e-trading platform for agricultural produce.

 

The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act is also being proposed to be amended by introducing single-point levy of market fee across a State and a united single trading licence.

I see Agro-vision is an important step in enhancing awareness and transforming Indian agriculture to make it more productive.

 

I hope to see more such initiatives in many more states in our country in the months to come.

 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Kashmir is an inalienable and integral part of India. He was interacting with the Members of British Parliament, Mr. Dan Carden, Ms. Anna McMorrin, Ms. Preet Gill and Ms. Sarah Champion, who called on him, in New Delhi today. The Foreign Secretary of India, Dr. S Jaishankar was also present on the occasion.  

 

The Vice President conveyed his strong concerns that there was considerable misinformation about Kashmir. He said that it was purely a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. He further said that radicalization and terror are global issues to which we have to find an effective strategy to combat it at various levels.

 

The Vice President said that the bilateral cooperation between India and UK has reached a new high in the areas of economics and commerce, science and technology, defence, education, cyber policy, counter terrorism, sharing of intelligence. He further said that our bilateral trade at just about US$ 12.19 billion has a large potential for growth. India is the 3rd largest investor in the UK and the 2nd largest international job creator in the UK, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Indian government over the last three years has championed the cause of ease of doing business. He further said that India has just jumped an unprecedented 30 ranks and are placed at No. 100 in the World Bank Rankings on Ease of Doing Business. India’s flagship initiatives such as the Make in India, Digital India, 100 Smart Cities program and Housing for All by 2022 (Urban Transformation Schemes), Digital India, Start-up India, Clean India and other programmes offer unlimited business opportunities to British companies, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India is committed to a fair implementation of the Paris Agreement based on the principles laid down in the Convention – UNFCCC – especially equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibility. He further said that an initiative of note is the International Solar Alliance, which was launched by India in partnership with France in 2015 to develop and promote solar energy. He encouraged the UK to sign and ratify the Framework Agreement of the ISA and join us for the Founding Conference as a Founding Member early next year.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that fostering Grampreneurship can transform aspirational rural India. He was addressing the International Mentoring Summit with the theme ‘Mentoring Young Grampreneurs for Inclusive Growth’, on the occasion of Silver Jubilee of Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), here today. His Royal Highness Prince Charles and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that rural India is rapidly changing and the rural youth too are well informed, are eager to learn, have an entrepreneurial spirit, and quite often even global aspirations. He further said that the present Government has been tirelessly working to promote inclusive growth, to make India as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Policies like Start-up India and Atal Innovation Mission are geared to support the start-up environment, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the aim of the National Urban Livelihoods Mission was to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. He further said that the core belief is that the poor are entrepreneurial and have innate desire to come out of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful and sustainable livelihoods, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the constraints like access to credit, advantages of technology, marketing support need to be addressed and the BYST model of mentoring can play a significant role in the growth of entrepreneurial culture. He further said that the challenge is to encourage more youth to make the choice of becoming entrepreneurs, rather than be job-seekers. Many more opportunities for decent livelihoods must be created rapidly in the rural areas, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It is my pleasure to join you for the International Mentoring Summit on Mentoring Young GrampreneursTM for Inclusive Growth’ on the occasion of BYST’s Silver Jubilee and to address, especially, the grass root entrepreneurs who have joined us from all over the country, industry mentors and all other supporters of the entrepreneurial eco-system.  

I was delighted to learn that HRH was the inspiration to Ms. Lakshmi to start the youth entrepreneurship programme in India for the underprivileged youth. This program seems to have been modelled after the Prince’s Trust programme in UK. We appreciate the fact that HRH has been playing a stellar role and keeping abreast of the progress made by BYST as is evident from the fact that this is his fifth visit to BYST during the last 25 years. 

I had the pleasure of attending, earlier this year, the Inaugural International Mentoring Summit conducted by BYST at Rashtrapati Bhavan and to unveil the logo of the flagship programme of BYST – Mentoring India™. 

In today’s conference, it is heartening to see a ""meeting of the minds"" of young people, particularly those from underserved communities and the experienced and experts in business - sharing experiences and exchanging valuable lessons.   

I understand, BYST provides a facilitative environment to our rural youth, who have received limited education, have started working early in life and are struggling on the poverty line.

Rural India is rapidly changing. The rural youth too are well informed, are eager to learn, have an entrepreneurial spirit, and quite often even global aspirations.   

Creating a facilitative eco-system for rural entrepreneurship is very important. Mentoring is a crucial part of this eco-system. 

The present Govt. has been tirelessly working to promote inclusive growth, to make India as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Policies like Start-up India and Atal Innovation Mission are geared to support the start-up environment.

During my earlier tenure as Minister of Urban Development, we had modified the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM). The aim was to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. The core belief of National Urban Livelihoods Mission is that the poor are entrepreneurial and have innate desire to come out of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful and sustainable livelihoods.

The constraints like access to credit, advantages of technology, marketing support need to be addressed and I think BYST model of mentoring can play a significant role in the growth of entrepreneurial culture.

Over the last twenty five years, BYST has given wings to rural youth and enabled them to become entrepreneurs. This is the group with greater aspirations but limited opportunities. They are a group that needs guidance and encouragement. 

I am delighted to know that BYST is playing a unique and important role by providing mentoring to the entrepreneurs whether they are competing with the industry giants in the metros or difficult rural hinterland of Assam, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.   

When I hear that BYST entrepreneurs have been winning national and international awards, I can see that they have broken through a whole range of barriers. They are making a tremendous success of their business primarily due to the steady support of their mentors. 

I congratulate the winning entrepreneurs and mentors of the BYST Silver Jubilee Awards today.

These are truly  excellent examples of the efficacy of mentoring.   

Encouraging entrepreneurship in young people is an important way of harnessing their enthusiasm, energy and ambition to contribute to economic development. Fostering Grampreneurship can transform aspirational rural India.   

The challenge is to encourage more youth to make the choice of becoming entrepreneurs, rather than be job-seekers. Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST) is a successful example of this paradigm. Many more opportunities for decent livelihoods must be created rapidly in the rural areas. 

Lakhs of youth emerge from various Govt. Sponsored Entrepreneurship Development Programmes or EDP. However, for them to apply their skills, develop further and fulfil their potential, they need sustained support, guidance, counselling and timely advice. In short, they require “Mentoring”.

In the absence of quality mentoring, the youth find themselves lacking focus and direction to channel their skills and become successful entrepreneurs. The nurturing and follow up support provided by mentors during the crucial first years of operation of a new business is critical. This support can often make the difference between abject failure and spectacular success.  

This is where Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST) has excelled with its proven model of mentoring 'bottom of the pyramid' entrepreneurs, and provide the vital link in the entire chain of entrepreneur support system. The theme of today’s summit is, therefore, very aptly titled “mentoring young grampreneurs for inclusive growth”. 

Both the public and private sectors have to play a catalytic role in further developing such an eco-system. I can see immense scope and possible intervention of Corporate Social Responsibility funding to support the unique mentor movement in order to create successful entrepreneurs.  

Finally, I congratulate BYST for completing 25 years in the service of youth entrepreneurship development through mentoring and handholding support.   I wish this organization many more years of excellent work in creating a new generation of rural entrepreneurs.

 

Thank you. Jai Hind.”

                Calls on His Majesty, The King Philippe of Belgium 
 

 The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that terrorism is a global concern that demands global attention and requires global cooperation. He was interacting with His Majesty, The King Philippe of Belgium, in New Delhi today. Senior officials from both sides were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President drew the attention of growing menace of terror across the globe. His Majesty agreed that this was a major global challenge and appreciated India’s support to Belgium in the hour of crisis when terrorism stuck their country. The Vice President suggested that India believes in an early conclusion of negotiation and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International terrorism at the United Nations. His Majesty the King of Belgium expressed support to India’s view in this regard. 

The Vice President said that India and Belgium today are two vibrant democracies and share several ideals and principles. He further said that democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech, independent judiciary, free press and protection of human rights are fundamental values through which our societies are held together. Belgian academicians have made notable contribution to the advancement of Indian language studies, particularly Hindi and Sanskrit, in India and Belgium, he added. 

The Vice President said that more than 1,30,000 Indian soldiers fought in the battle fields of Belgium during the First World War, and more than 9,000 made the supreme sacrifice. He expressed his happiness that the King would inaugurate the exhibition on contribution of Indian soldiers in the First World War and also release a coffee table publication, “India in Flanders Fields”. This indeed is a tribute to the heroism and sacrifice of Indian soldiers, he added. 

The Vice President said that India today is an attractive business destination for Belgian businesses and would encourage Belgium Small and Medium Enterprises to explore tie-ups with Indian Start Ups. He further said that India’s 100 Smart Cities initiative is aimed at harnessing the economic potential of urban centres. Belgian companies with expertise in urban transportation solutions, energy efficient technologies, smart citizen services, sanitation and waste management will find many business opportunities in India, he added. 

A high level delegation was accompanying the King of Belgium.

The Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Shri E.S.L. Narasimham, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu, the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Chinarajappa and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that there is a need for raising the standards of education and increasing the professional competence of teachers. He further said that India was once known as 'Vishwaguru' and Indians, irrespective of caste and creed, were blessed with lot of talent and intelligence and those qualities have to be fully tapped to make students acquire knowledge and face contemporary challenges.

The Vice President said teachers must transfer the world of learning. He further said that they should be friendly mentors and act as role models in behavior and attitude. Students can't be made to learn by force and must be taught with love and affection.

The Vice President said that the education is not merely to get employment and the purpose of education to enlighten and empower an individual. He further said that education must build character, caliber and capacity besides promoting good conduct. While we are enhancing access to higher education, there is a general feeling that quality of courses and the teaching processes needs to be considerably improved, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has cautioned people against falling prey to illnesses caused by modern and sedentary lifestyles. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating a Mega Health Camp at Swarna Bharat Trust, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh today. The Minister for Health and Medical Education, Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Kamineni Srinivas, the Minister for Water Resources Management, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Devineni Uma Maheswara Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President expressed concern that lack of physical activity and modern dietary habits were causing lifestyle diseases. He further said that people should take physical activities like walking, jogging, cycling and practicing Yoga to lead a healthy life. 

The Vice President appealed the medical fraternity to educate and create awareness on the dangers of modern lifestyle diseases and the need to adopt preventive measures. Expressing his concern at the lack of adequate health infrastructure in rural areas, he pointed out that the governments alone cannot meet the growing healthcare demands and wanted the private sector and NGOs to supplement the efforts of the government. He urged the Centre and State governments to focus on improving healthcare services in rural and backward areas. 

The Vice President lamented that innovative functioning of some government hospitals was forcing the people to get treated at private hospitals. He further said that as against the WHO norm of one doctor per 1,000, there is one doctor per 1,700 population in India. To overcome the shortage of medical professionals in the country, a high-level committee of Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) has recommended the setting up of 187 more medical colleges by 2022, headed. 

The Vice President visited the Medical Camp and interacted with the patients undergoing treatment.

                Addresses function ‘Building a New India’ organized by FICCI Ladies Organization 
 



The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we need to extend reservations for women in Parliament and Assemblies on the lines of Panchayats. He was addressing the function ‘Building a New India’ being organized by the FICCI Ladies Organization, in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that India today is on the threshold of transforming into a major economic power. For this all Indians will have to work with renewed passion and commitment towards building the New India and the India of the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and several other freedom fighters, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the New India will be fully literate, free of corruption with shelter to every family, provide power on demand, best healthcare, meet the employment aspirations of the youth, empower women, double farmers’ income and convert India into an economic powerhouse with IT, Agriculture and Industrial sectors contributing significantly to its economic growth.

 

The Vice President said that our ethos and values always respected women and it is unfortunate that abhorrent tendencies of atrocities are taking place in modern times. It needs no reiteration that the most stringent action has to be taken against perpetrators of atrocities on women, he added.

 

The Vice President said that educating a woman means educating an entire family. He further said that ending gender disparity, ensuring safety, healthcare, imparting job skills, creating more job opportunities and ensuring safe work places are all aimed at empowering women. The Vice President quoted UN report, saying for every one additional year of education for women in reproductive age, child mortality is reduced by a huge 9.50 per cent. The Government has launched various schemes, including ‘Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao’ which seeks to reverse the trend of decline in Child Sex Ratio, he added.           

 

The Vice President also interacted with the Members of the FICCI Ladies Organization. Responding to a question on what needs to be done for the women empowerment, the Vice President said that education is very important for the empowerment of women. He further said that financial security is also an important factor for women empowerment. They should be given equal opportunities, equal rights and health facilities, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am happy to share my thoughts on the building of a ‘New India’ with you all, who are working towards women’s empowerment and trying to be change agents.  I am glad to know that FICCI Ladies Organization is working on its own and also partnering with the Government of Telangana on various initiatives to empower women, especially those from the marginalized sections.

India today is on the threshold of transforming into a major economic power. For quickening this process of transformation, all Indians will have to work with renewed passion and commitment towards building the New India and the India of the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and several other freedom fighters.

Friends, we cannot any longer adopt a “chaltha hai” attitude or accept things with a ‘destined-to-happen’ shrug and remain indifferent to the happenings around us. As the Father of the Nation famously said:  “Be the change you wish to see”—to start with let everyone work at his/ her own individual level—be it a housewife, a budding entrepreneur or an employee must actively fight against social evils like gender discrimination, atrocities on women, infanticide, malnourishment, corruption, casteism, communalism and illiteracy. Terrorism is the biggest threat to India’s unity and integrity

Somehow over the years, we Indians have developed a rather strange attitude or belief that every problem has to be solved by the Government and the individual or the society at large need not do anything. “Sab kuch sarkaar karega, hum bekar baitegaa” - this premise must change and every citizen must contribute in making India unleash its full potential.

For this to happen and the envisioned New India to take shape, all sections, particularly youth and women, who constitute almost half the country’s population will have to be in the forefront. 

The New India will be fully literate, free of corruption with shelter to every family, provide power on demand, best healthcare, meet the employment aspirations of the youth, empower women, double farmers’ income and convert India into an economic powerhouse with IT, Agriculture and Industrial sectors contributing significantly to its economic growth. Of course, politicians and political parties need to be exemplary in their conduct.

From times immemorial and in our scriptures women have been accorded positions of power and leadership. Our ethos and values always respected women and it is unfortunate that abhorrent tendencies of atrocities are taking place in modern times. It needs no reiteration that the most stringent action has to be taken against perpetrators of atrocities on women. Here I would like to recall what Swami Vivekananda had said: “The best thermometer to the progress of nation is its treatment of women”. Our scriptures have said “Yatra Naryastu Pujyante, Ramanta Tatra Devata”, meaning where women are respected, Gods will dwell there.

While women achieved tremendous success in different fields from space to sports, political empowerment is the most critical aspect in the overall empowerment of women. I hope that more and more women would be seen in various bodies—from panchayats to Parliament in the years ahead. It is also necessary to remove all hurdles that come in the way of socio-economic empowerment of women. We need to extend reservations for women in Parliament and Assemblies on the lines of Panchayats.

Needless to say that education forms the foundation for empowering girls and women. As had been most aptly said educating a woman means educating an entire family. Ending gender disparity, ensuring safety, healthcare, imparting job skills, creating more job opportunities and ensuring safe work places are all aimed at empowering women. On the advantages of educating women, a UN report based on data from 219 countries, said that for every one additional year of education for women in reproductive age, child mortality is reduced by a huge 9.50 per cent.

The Government has launched various schemes, including ‘Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao’ which seeks to reverse the trend of decline in Child Sex Ratio.

I am happy to know that FICCI Ladies Organization (FLO), Hyderabad chapter has taken up various programmes to empower and uplift women, particularly from the weaker sections. I compliment FLO for acting as a facilitator to impart training for women to become drivers, tailors and security personnel in schools.

FLO’s Swayam, a consultancy and mentorship cell for women entrepreneurs is also a laudable initiative.

Finally, I would like to conclude by calling upon every citizen to strive for building New India where the aspirations and dreams of every Indian are fulfilled and where nobody is left behind.

Thank You and Jai Hind!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that there has to be an increased focus on planning and design for sustainable and clean urban mobility. He was addressing the Inaugural Session of 10th Urban Mobility India Conference & Exhibition, 2017 and CODATU XVII Conference, in Hyderabad today. The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, the Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali, the President CODATU, France, Mr. Dominique BUSSEREAU, the Ambassador of France to India, Mr. Alexandre Ziegler and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 The Vice President said that urbanisation is one of the realities of the 21st Century, which is called as urban century. He further said that the 2011 Census has clearly shown that urbanization in India is gaining momentum where every third person is living in urban areas. The current urbanization patterns are causing unprecedented challenges to urban mobility systems, he added.

 The Vice President said that urban transport accounts for about 25% of the greenhouse gases worldwide. He further said that it is also the major cause of local air and noise pollution in cities which cause ill health. The traffic congestion created by the transportation systems is responsible for significant economic and productivity costs for commuters and transporters, he added.

The Vice President said that increased motorisation in the Indian cities have caused an ever increasing trend of congestion, pollution, increased travel time, thus producing negative externalities. He quoted Lewis Mamfort, the great American urban architect and historian, as saying, “Building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.”

The Vice President said that India has made huge strides in provision of public transport systems in many cities. He further said that Metro rail has seen a rapid growth in many cities with Delhi taking the lead and Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) has also seen a phenomenal growth with around 250 kms operational and around 250 kilometers under construction in various cities. He quoted Mr. Enrique Penelosa, the present mayor of Bogota, as saying, “A developed country is not where the poor use cars but where the rich use public transport.”

The Vice President said that promoting Non-Motorized Transport infrastructure for walking and bicycle not only acts as last mile connectivity for well-established public transport systems but also has a positive impact on health.  He further said that in the pursuit of sustainable mobility, promoting walking and cycling is very important. Need for more pedestrian paths and bicycle tracks to promote healthy lifestyle, combat diabetes & obesity and reduction pollution, he added.

 The Vice President congratulated the Government of Telangana for the implementation of the Hyderabad Metro Rail Project which, on completion, will become the World’s largest Metro Rail Project to be implemented in Public Private Partnership mode. He conveyed his best wishes to all in their efforts to create better mobility systems for better quality of life in urban centres.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""I am delighted to be with you today at the inaugural session of the 10th Urban Mobility India Conference and Exhibition. It is heartening to know that this event is being organized by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India in partnership with the Government of Telangana. CODATU, an organization based in Paris, France, and involved in urban mobility, is also holding its 17th conference in conjunction with this conference.

This is a flagship annual event of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Government of India and has played a significant role in churning of ideas and exchange of knowledge in the field of urban mobility over the years.

Urbanisation is one of the  realities of the 21st Century, which is called as urban century. The 2011 Census has clearly shown that urbanization in India is gaining momentum where every third person is living in urban areas. Urban sector’s share of country’s GDP is expected to increase from its current 66 percent to 75 percent by 2031.   The current urbanization patterns are causing unprecedented challenges to urban mobility systems.

Despite the increasing level of urban mobility infrastructure worldwide, access to places/activities and services has become increasingly difficult in the urban areas. For decades, most of the countries have experienced rapid urban growth coupled with increase in use of motor vehicles. Unplanned urbanization has, in many cases, led to urban sprawl and thus generating even higher demand for motorized travel. This has resulted in a range of economic, social and environmental challenges.

Urban transport accounts for about 25% of the greenhouse gases worldwide. It is also the major cause of local air and noise pollution in cities which cause ill health. The traffic congestion created by the transportation systems is responsible for significant economic and productivity costs for commuters and transporters. These challenges are more pronounced in cities of developing countries. These get further compounded by the fact that in the coming decades 90 % of the global population growth will take place in the cities of these countries. These cities are already struggling to meet the increasing demand for investment in transport systems.

 In many cities of the world, the mistake of drawing a similarity between mobility and transportation has fostered a tendency towards increasing motorization and a propensity to extend the network of urban roads.

India has also seen a similar situation.  Increased motorisation in the cities have caused an ever increasing trend of congestion, pollution, increased travel time, thus producing negative externalities.  With regard to increasing the road length, I am reminded of a famous quote by Lewis Mamfort, the great American urban architect and historian, who said, “Building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.”

Needless to say, there has to be an increased focus on planning and design for sustainable and clean urban mobility.  Mobility is not only a matter of developing transport infrastructure and services. It is also about overcoming the social, economic, political and physical constraints of movements. Recognizing mobility as an entitlement implies a focus on people, and removing the obstacles preventing people from reaching destinations.

 Public Transport: While private motorisation cannot be wished away completely, providing an affordable, comfortable, reliable and safe public transport can reduce the demand of private motorised vehicles. Global statistics demonstrate that the trips to work made in the world are around 30% on public transport.  In India, the average share of public transport in 2011 was 30%. This will probably reduce to 22% by 2021. The lack of affordable and accessible public transport systems has led to the proliferation of informal operators, such as private minibus and microbus services. In some cities, informal carriers are the only forms of public transport available.

 High capacity public transport systems are needed to reduce the negative externalities like air and noise pollution, accidents and greenhouse gas emissions. They also provide inclusive access to low income groups.

It is heartening to note that India has made huge strides in provision of public transport systems in many cities. Metro rail has seen a rapid growth in many cities with Delhi taking the lead. Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) has also seen a phenomenal growth with around 250 kms operational and around 250 kilometers under construction in various cities. I would like to share with you a quote by Mr. Enrique Penelosa, the present mayor of Bogota, who said that “A developed country is not where the poor use cars but where the rich use public transport.”

Last Mile Connectivity: For high capacity public transport to become popular, it is important to provide the last mile connectivity. If the commuter does not get comfortable mode for reaching the metro station or the bus stop, he is likely to use his personal vehicle.

 Non-Motorised Transport:  Promoting Non- Motorized Transport infrastructure for walking and bicycle not only acts as last mile connectivity for well-established public transport systems but also has a positive impact on health.  In the pursuit of sustainable mobility, promoting walking and cycling is very important.  Development of pedestrian pathways and dedicated cycle tracks will go a long way in not only promoting sustainable urban transport but also improving the overall ecosystem of the public transport in the city. Need for more pedestrian paths and bicycle tracks to promote healthy lifestyle, combat diabetes & obesity and reduction pollution.

 Intermodal Integration: Integration between various modes of transport provides seamless connectivity for the commuters.  This may include joint (transfer) stations, coordinated scheduling, joint fares, single ticket or common mobility card and combined public information activities. Basically integration can occur at three levels namely physical, operational and fare integration. Physical integration allows for close proximity of stations facilitating direct connection from one mode to another usually including transfer facility at stations.  Cities in Western Europe have taken the lead in facilitating inter modal integration especially between public and non-motorised transport. Kochi metro has introduced a common mobility card which can be used in the metro, bus as well as in the water transport system. Other metro systems like Bangalore metro, Nagpur Metro &Lucknow metro are also adopting similar common mobility card.

 Integration of Land Use and Transport Planning: Development of a sustainable transportation system starts with the organization of the urban space with the main objective of reducing the need for travel and the length of travel distance. Neglecting the connection between land use and mobility has created the urban sprawl as can be seen in many cities.  An integrated planning approach will yield positive results. One strategy for achieving this can be through Transit Oriented Development (TOD).

Transit Oriented Development (TOD): Transit Oriented Development is a concept which emphasizes mixed and dense development around the high capacity public transport stations. By concentrating a mix of pedestrian oriented development around the metro or BRT stations, residents are more likely to catch a metro or a bus for out-of-neigbourhood trips and walk or bicycle for within the neighbourhood trips. Integrating public transport systems and the built environment makes both the public transport system and the city successful.   I am glad to note that Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs have formulated a National Transit Oriented Development Policy which can be used to formulate city specific TOD policy. With the increasing metro rail and BRT systems, cities should be encouraged to adopt the TOD policy.

 Innovative Financing and Land Value Capture: Investment requirements in high capacity Public Transport Systems can be huge due to the large gap in demand and capacity. Therefore it is important to explore the possibility of innovative means of financing. Issuance of bonds and financing of one corridor through land value capture by Bangalore metro is an example how agencies are trying to leverage on the innovative means of financing. The Land Value Capture Policy recently issued by the Government of India can be adopted by various agencies with help and facilitation by the respective city and state governments.

Public Private Partnership: In  recent times, more and more cities have chosen the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for development and implementation of urban transport projects, to leverage both public and private resources and expertise. Some of the cities which have tried the PPP model in some form or the other in either provisioning of the metro rail or other high capacity public transport systems are Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, Hong Kong, and London.

 I would like to congratulate the Government of Telangana for the speedy implementation of the Hyderabad Metro Rail Project which, on completion, will become the World’s largest Metro Rail Project to be implemented in Public Private Partnership mode.

 A holistic and integrated approach to urban land use and transport planning and investment is needed if urban areas are to become socially, environmentally and economically sustainable.

Many of the environmental challenges in the urban transport sector are rooted in its reliance on the non-renewable fossil fuel to propel private motor vehicles. There is a need to initiating a shift to clean fuels, retiring old polluting vehicles, strengthening mass transportation, and promoting use of electric vehicles, ensuring parking spaces before registering a car at-least in large metro cities.

Better urban planning and a modal shift to public transport along with long-term transport plans are necessary to facilitate the growth of cities in a manner that does not damage the environment.  Technical, fiscal and policy actions are needed to direct transport growth towards the path of sustainability. Urban mobility is finely woven into the spatial, social, economic, political and environmental fabric of cities.

I would reiterate that urban transport is one of the key elements of urban infrastructure that calls for urgent action. The future of transportation in lies in sustainable smart mobility and eco-friendly alternatives. The planners, city authorities and civil society have all to join the mission to make our cities a better place to live in.

Urban Mobility India Conference provides such a forum for stakeholder participation in understanding various contemporary issues of urban transport, benefit from the experiences of international and domestic experts, get knowledge about the best practices globally and interact with the peer groups from different organizations.

I convey my best wishes to all of you in your efforts to create better mobility systems for better quality of life in urban centres.

 

Thank you! Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that when we pay attention towards environment, there won't be any tension about the future of mankind. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the International Conference on Environment - 2017, organized by the National Green Tribunal, here today. The Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak Misra, the Minister of Science & Technology, Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the Chairperson of the National Green Tribunal, Shri Swatanter Kumar, Justice of the National High Court of Brazil & Secretary General of the UN Environment International Advisory Council of Environmental Justice, Justice Antonio Herman Benjamin, the Attorney General for India, Shri K.K. Venugopal and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the GDP is important but it is even more important to improve human lives. He further said that quality of life is the ultimate test of all our development efforts. Development has very little meaning if it doesn’t lead to health, happiness and harmony, he added. 

The Vice President said that he has often confronted this question of what takes priority - environment protection or development. He further said that he can say confidently that there is no intrinsic contradiction between the two; all that is needed is to check over exploitation. 

The Vice President said that each wing of our polity has a distinct role to play. He further said that the legislatures frame laws that address the concerns of the people, the executive effectively implements and delivers. The judiciary ensures that the laws are interpreted and implemented both in letter and spirit, he added. 

The Vice President said that rapid economic growth and intensified industrialization has also led to increasingly unhealthy, polluting and carbon-intensive lifestyles. He further said that we have to adopt a better way of measuring growth, which is more holistic and reveals a truer picture of progress and quality of life and not merely economic growth. We have to invent and innovate methods to maintain economic growth and bring holistic prosperity without adverse impacts on the environment, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""It gives me great pleasure to be a part of this august gathering. I must take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts of the National Green Tribunal (India’s foremost Environmental Justice Court), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Asian Development Bank, the Ministry of Environment Forests & Climate Change and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation in successfully organising such events in the past at International and National levels and for the present event- World Conference on Environment, November 2017. 

These events serve as forums for discussion on wide ranging environmental issues of universal concern. This is the second International Conference on the subject this year and fourth International Conference on Environment being organised under the aegis of NGT. 

Brothers & sisters, we have had decades of deliberations on international environmental consciousness, jurisprudence and laws. We have progressed from denial to acceptance of global warming. We have moved from non-voluntary non mandatory contributions to voluntary commitments to mitigate the threat of climate change. Many countries have started taking proactive measures for protecting the environment. 

We all are realizing a little slowly, a little painfully that we have been recklessly damaging our environment. Wisdom is slowly dawning upon all countries that our existence is at stake and we have to act fast to avoid a catastrophe. 

At this point, I am reminded of the words of Mahatma Gandhi. He stated: 

“The earth, the air, the land and the water are not an inheritance from our fore fathers but on loan from our children. So we have to handover to them at least as it was handed over to us”. These times call for collective intervention by the international community for pushing the environmental agenda and working on a meticulously charted sustainable development path of keeping global warming well below 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. 

Economic Growth should not be seen as independent of environment. What nations needs to work together for, is sustainable economic growth. 

Many countries around the world call our planet the Mother Earth. Many religions have given us a rich heritage of thoughts and ideas on living harmoniously with nature. In India too, we have a rich repertory of hymns and practices that celebrate, worship and preserve nature. For instance, Bhu-Suktam in Atharva Veda written almost 20 centuries ago, celebrates nature and seeks to see it protected and preserved. 

“O Mother Earth, may your hills and snow clad mountains spread their coolness, may your forests spread delight. On your firm foundation which is unconquered, unslayed and unbroken, I stand firm.” Destruction of trees is frowned upon. As Prophet Mohammed said “He who cuts a lote-tree, Allah will send him to Hellfire”. In the Hindu tradition, all trees are sacred, all living and non-living creatures are valued and treasured. The seers have said “Ishavasyam Idam Sarvam” (The whole universe is divine and sacred). 

These well-springs of our collective heritage need to be revived. We must not only recollect some of the best thoughts from our past but also shape our present in line with those noble ideals. Or else, our future might turn to be dark and bleak. 

The signs of a catastrophic future are already actually here for us to experience. We do not have clean air and clean water in many cities. Our quality of life is constantly declining. 

GDP is important but it is even more important to improve human lives. Quality of life is the ultimate test of all our development efforts. Development has very little meaning if it doesn’t lead to health, happiness and harmony. When we pay attention towards environment, there won't be any tension about the future of mankind

Having served in the Government of India for nearly four decades, I have often confronted this question of what takes priority- environment protection or development. I can say confidently that there is no intrinsic contradiction between the two; all that is needed is to check over exploitation. As Gandhiji had said, Nature provides enough to meet our needs but cannot provide for our greed. The challenge is huge. However, if we have the political will, the legal frame work and an able Judiciary, we can achieve results. 

Each wing of our polity has a distinct role to play. The legislatures frame laws that address the concerns of the people, the executive effectively implements and delivers. The judiciary ensures that the laws are interpreted and implemented both in letter and spirit. 

I do hope each of us in each of these spheres of responsibility, act in unison with a common objective but within the clearly defined parameters delineated by the Constitution. 

The environmental change is occurring at a much faster rate than previously thought. These threats are population growth, rapid urbanization, rising levels of consumption, desertification, land degradation and climate change have combined to leave countries suffering from severe water scarcity. These highly disturbing trends are also making it increasingly hard for the world to feed itself. 

To speak of Asia Pacific region, the rapid and much desired economic growth has left very huge impact on the natural resources and ecosystems. Worsening air quality, extreme water scarcity and humungous waste generation are threatening human and environmental health. 

The region continues to be the world’s most disaster prone region having a 41% share of all natural disasters reported over the last two decades, which also accounted for 91% of the world’s deaths attributable to natural disasters in the last century. 

In Southeast Asia, the average area deforested annually is more than 1 million hectares, resulting in the release of hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide every year between 2005 and 2015. 

The contamination of water sources by human and industrial waste, including pharmaceutical and personal care products, is a major problem in the region. 

It is estimated that about 30% of the population uses contaminated drinking water. Water-related diseases and unsafe water contribute to 1.8 million deaths annually in the region. Unsafe sanitation, disposal of untreated wastewater and runoff of agrochemicals are responsible for a rise in water-borne diseases, especially in Asia’s population-dense urban areas. 

Uncontrolled dumping, which is still the main waste disposal method in the region, is also a major source of disease. In Mumbai, for example, about 12% of total municipal solid waste is burned either openly on the streets or in landfills. 

Rapid economic growth and intensified industrialization has also led to increasingly unhealthy, polluting and carbon-intensive lifestyles. 

Global Warming is not merely a concern due to increased temperatures. It is displacing people out of their homes, where their ancestors and forefathers have dwelled for centuries, in search of livelihood, food and shelter due to altered geographic and climatic conditions. 

According to WHO, approximately 12.6 million deaths are attributable to unhealthy environments, i.e. nearly 1 in every 4 death recorded globally. Out of this 8.2 million deaths have resulted from non communicable diseases like cancers, strokes, heart problems, chronic respiratory diseases, etc. Regionally, the low and middle income countries in South-East Asia and Western Pacific Region are the worst hit. 

Distinguished speakers and audience, I would like all of us to reflect on certain key issues and seek solutions to our current predicament. 

1. Is it time for the World to formally adopt a better way of measuring growth, which is more holistic and reveals a truer picture of progress and quality of life and not merely economic growth? 

2. Can we move beyond the boundaries of countries and adopt a regime of Global Civics and World Governance, in matters which are of great concern to the entire humanity? 

3. Is it time to move towards an eco centric approach, where the role of human race is not merely that of stewardship, but that of Earth Trusteeship? 

4. Can we discover, invent and innovate methods to maintain economic growth and bring holistic prosperity without adverse impacts on the environment? 

We must find answers to these questions; and initiate swift action. 

Let us not wait for the disaster to strike. 

We have to combine knowledge and wisdom with concrete action. 

We must define our roles and be watchful trustees of our natural wealth. 

We must enhance awareness and proactively involve all sections of the population. 

The agenda of the Conference is quite timely. I look forward to your fruitful deliberations and eagerly await your implementable recommendations. 

I wish you all a successful conference! 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President and the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that he salute the brave security personnel who have sacrificed their lives to save our lives and protect our democracy in the attack on Parliament in December 2009. He was addressing the Cultural Event organized by Rajya Sabha Secretariat Employees Recreation Club, here today. 

The Vice President said that he is extremely happy to be present with all employees of Rajya Sabha Secretariat and touched by the warm welcome extended to him. 

The Vice President said that the ex-officio position of Chairman, Rajya Sabha is a unique constitutional arrangement. He further said that it is a very important function to preside over the Rajya Sabha and guide the course of its proceedings. With his long association with the Rajya Sabha in different capacities, he had certain vision about the Rajya Sabha and its Secretariat, he added. 

The Vice President said that let us make an assessment of the areas where improvement can be made both in terms of functioning of the House and the Secretariat and identify the areas, which will require focused attention. He further said that it is a matter of great pride for all of us to be part of this august institution and serving the supreme representative body of the world’s largest democracy. Our Parliament represents the hopes and aspirations of over a billion people, he added. 

The Vice President said that we have witnessed the splendid performance of Smt. Malini Awasthi, who performed live. He further said that Music doesn’t need a language and relaxation through music and dance actually soothes our mind and elevates our spirit and helps us to perform better in a more productive way. This enchanting cultural evening has rejuvenated all of us, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I am happy to be here with you all this evening. I am touched by the warm welcome extended to me. After assuming the Office of Chairman, Rajya Sabha, this is for the first time I am meeting you all in such a programme. I am thankful to the Secretary-General, Rajya Sabha, for his kind and gracious words. Indeed, it is my pleasure to come to this function and spend some time with you in this enlivening ambience. 

I still remember that unfortunate day in December 2009, where our ordinary security employees of Rajya Sabha saved our Parliament from the deadly terror attack. I salute those brave people who have sacrificed their lives to save our lives and our democracy from the terror attack on Parliament. 

My compliments to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat Employees Recreation Club for organizing this cultural evening and providing me a delightful opportunity to listen to Smt. Malini Awasthi live. I am sure, all of you are equally swayed by her magical rendition. 

Friends, for the Vice-President, the ex-officio position of Chairman, Rajya Sabha is a unique constitutional arrangement. Personally for me, it is a very important function to preside over the Rajya Sabha and guide the course of its proceedings. With my long association with the Rajya Sabha in different capacities, I do have certain vision about the Rajya Sabha and its Secretariat. 

I have had a couple of meetings with the senior officers of the Secretariat. During my interactions, I had outlined my priorities to make Rajya Sabha a well-functioning House, contributing to the task of nation building. I am sure each one of you, whatever position of responsibility you are in, will strive to contribute to your full potential for the productivity and growth of the institution. 

Let us make an assessment of the areas where improvement can be made both in terms of functioning of the House and the Secretariat and identify the areas, which will require focused attention. I am sure, with the support and cooperation of all of you, we will find enduring solutions to all our concerns. 

It is a matter of great pride for all of us to be part of this august institution and serving the supreme representative body of the world’s largest democracy. Our Parliament represents the hopes and aspirations of over a billion people. The legislations, policies and programmes deliberated in the Chambers of Parliament and also in the Committees shape the destiny of our people and our country. In the functioning of the Rajya Sabha, needless to say, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat has been rendering an invaluable service since its inception. 

I have observed that the officers and staff of the Secretariat have always risen to the occasion and responded to the call of duty with sincerity and commitment. It is my sincere hope that you will maintain the high level of efficiency and continue to set new benchmarks of excellence in your work and output. 

This evening, we witnessed the splendid performance of Smt. Malini Awasthi. In fact, I always enjoy such evenings. Music doesn’t need language. Relaxation through music and dance actually soothes our mind and elevates our spirit and helps us to perform better in a more productive way. I am sure, this enchanting cultural evening will rejuvenate us. 

With these words, I once again thank the Secretary-General and the officers and staff of the Secretariat for organizing this beautiful cultural evening. 

Thank you. Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India is witnessing a high-growth trajectory and set to become the third-largest aviation market in the world in terms of passengers by 2026. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 2nd Aero Expo India 2017, here today. The Union Minister for Civil Aviation, Shri Ashok Gajapathi Raju Pusapati, the Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 

The Vice President said that the aviation sector not only plays a key role in promoting connectivity and creating jobs but is also an important driver of the economy. He further said that the aviation is the backbone of the global transport system. It indeed is the most vital sector for linking businesses, bringing people together and promoting tourism worldwide, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India became the world’s fastest growing domestic travel market for the 22nd time in a row recording a 26.6 per cent year-on-year growth in January 2017, according to IATA. He further said that while there is a downward trend in accidents, there cannot be any complacency and safety will have to remain the topmost priority of aviation authorities and experts.

 

The Vice President expressed his happiness on UDAN scheme seeks to promote regional connectivity by serving the un-served and under-served airports. Connecting Tier-II cities, pilgrim towns and historic places with the wider air routes is important for boosting tourism and business travel, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely pleased to inaugurate 2nd ‘Aero Expo India-2017’ and extend a warm welcome to all participants and stakeholders from the aviation industry.

 

Friends, as you all know the aviation sector not only plays a key role in promoting connectivity and creating jobs but is also an important driver of the economy. As the backbone of the global transport system, it indeed is the most vital sector for linking businesses, bringing people together and promoting tourism worldwide.

 

According to International Air Transport Association (IATA), one per cent of the global GDP is expected to be spent on air transport in 2017, totaling $ 776 billion. IATA’s semi-annual report says that governments gain substantially from $ 124 billion of tax revenues this year and from over 69 million supply chain jobs.

 

I have mentioned the figures to underline the catalytic role aviation sector can play in driving the global economy.

 

In the coming years, India is expected to witness rapid growth in the aviation sector.

 

India became the world’s fastest growing domestic travel market for the 22nd time in a row recording a 26.6 per cent year-on-year growth in January 2017, according to IATA. India is witnessing a high-growth trajectory and set to become the third-largest aviation market in the world in terms of passengers by 2026. India’s air cargo is estimated to grow at 9 per cent over the next few years.

 

IATA also expects the air passengers to double from 3.8 billion air passengers in 2016 to 7.2 billion by 2035.

 

All this augurs well for India and its growing domestic passengers. In fact, India replaced Japan to become the largest domestic aviation market globally.  India recorded a total of 100 million domestic flyers in 2016 as compared to 97 million people who travelled by air in Japan during the same period.

 

Recognizing the growing importance of the aviation sector, the Government has taken a series of measures to improve infrastructure and regional air connectivity in the country.

 

Apart from initiating new projects, the most crucial aspects that need special attention are safety and security. There cannot be any compromise on these two counts and the most stringent norms have to be adopted for ensuring safe and secure air travel.

 

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has mentioned in its 2017 edition that accident statistics over the last five years in the world show a decrease in both the number of accidents as well as accident rate.

 

In 2016, the downward trend continued with 75 accidents reported, representing an 18 per cent decrease from 2015. It was mentioned that reduction in accident rate of 2.1 per million departures is the lowest ever.

 

While the downward trend in accidents is good news, there cannot be any complacency and safety will have to remain the topmost priority of aviation authorities and experts.

 

With increasing disposable incomes and a burgeoning middle class, air travel will witness further spurt in the years ahead. I am glad that UDAN scheme seeks to promote regional connectivity by serving the un-served and under-served airports. Connecting Tier-II cities, pilgrim towns and historic places with the wider air routes is important for boosting tourism and business travel.

 

Among others, developing no frills and Greenfield airports, augmenting existing capacities, creating synergy between scheduled and non-scheduled airlines for better penetration and connectivity through collaborative efforts of the State and Central Governments is needed.

 

I compliment the organizers of Aero Expo India 2017. I do hope there will be a good exchange of information and knowledge resulting in an all-round growth of aviation industry in India.

 

I am also glad to know that PHD Chamber has also introduced a first ever HELI EXPO INDIA this year to give a wider platform to helicopter industry and tap into its huge potential. In the coming years, the use of civil helicopters for various roles, including tourism, medical services, law enforcement and disaster management is expected to grow significantly.

 

I am sure India will soon emerge as an aviation hub not only in terms of increased air connectivity but also in terms of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities and setting up of ancillary units.

 

THANK YOU! JAI HIND!”

“India is proud of Mirabai Chanu, who has won a gold at the World Weightlifting Championship. Congratulations and best wishes for her future endeavours.”, the Prime Minister said.

                We are happy to host the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in partnership with the Government of the United States of America.   

The Summit is being held in South Asia for the first time. It brings together leading investors, entrepreneurs, academicians, think-tanks and other stakeholders to propel the global entrepreneurship ecosystem.

This event not only connects the Silicon Valley with Hyderabad but also show-cases the close ties between the United States of America and India. It underlines our shared commitment towards encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation.

The topics picked for this year’s summit include healthcare and life sciences; digital economy and financial technology; energy and infrastructure; and media and entertainment. These are all important issues, relevant to the well-being and prosperity of mankind. 

The theme “Women First, Prosperity for All” makes this edition of GES stand out. In Indian mythology, woman is an incarnation of Shakti - the Goddess of power. We believe women empowerment is vital to our development.  

Our history has references to women of remarkable talent and determination. Gargi, an ancient philosopher, around the seventh century BC, challenged a male sage to a philosophical discourse - something unheard of in those times. Our warrior queens like Rani Ahilyabai Holkar and Rani Lakshmibai fought bravely to defend their kingdoms. Our freedom struggle too is replete with such inspirational instances.

Indian women continue to lead in different walks of life. Our space programmes, including the Mars Orbiter Mission, have had immense contribution from our women scientists. Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams, both of Indian origin, have been part of US space missions.

Three out of four oldest High Courts in India are now headed by women judges. Our sportswomen have done the country proud. This very city of Hyderabad is home to Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, and Sania Mirza, who have brought laurels to India.

In India, we have provided for not less than one third of women representation in rural and urban local bodies, ensuring women’s participation in grass-root level decision-making.

More than sixty percent of workers in our agriculture and allied sectors are women. Our milk co-operatives in Gujarat and the Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad, are examples of highly successful and globally acclaimed women-led co-operative movements.

Friends

Here at the GES, more than 50 percent of the delegates are women. Over the next two days, you will meet many women who have dared to be different, in their own walks of life. They now inspire a new generation of women entrepreneurs. I hope the deliberations in the summit would focus on how women entrepreneurship can be further supported.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

India has been an incubator for innovations and entrepreneurship over the ages. The ancient Indian treatise, Charaka Samhita, introduced the world to Ayurveda. Yoga is another ancient Indian innovation. The entire world now comes together, to celebrate Yoga Day on 21st June every year. Many entrepreneurs are involved in promoting Yoga, spirituality, and traditional Ayurvedic products.

The digital world we live in today is based on the binary system. The invention of zero, foundation of this binary system happened with Aryabhatta’s work in India. Similarly, many nuances of modern day economic policy, taxation system, and public finance policies are outlined in our ancient treatise Arthashastra by Kautilya.

Ancient India’s expertise in metallurgy is also well known. Our many ports and harbours and the world’s oldest dockyard at Lothal bear evidence to vibrant trade linkages. The tales of Indian voyagers travelling to foreign lands reflect the entrepreneurial character and spirit of our forefathers.

What are the core qualities that distinguish an entrepreneur?

An entrepreneur uses knowledge and skills to fulfil a motive. Entrepreneurs see opportunity in adversity. They try to meet felt needs by making processes more convenient and comfortable for the end user. They are patient and determined. Swami Vivekananda had said Each work has to pass through three stages – ridicule, opposition, and then acceptance. Those who think ahead of their time are sure to be misunderstood. Most entrepreneurs would be familiar with this.

The power to think differently and ahead of the times for the betterment of mankind is what sets entrepreneurs apart. I see that power in India's young generation today. I see 800 million potential entrepreneurs who can work towards making the world a better place.

The number of smartphone users in India is projected to grow to over 500 million by 2018. This offers immense potential for the growth of any venture, in terms of outreach and job creation.

Our Start-Up India programme is a comprehensive action plan to foster entrepreneurship and promote innovation. It aims to minimize the regulatory burden and provide support to startups. Over 1200 redundant laws have been scrapped, 87 rules for FDI have been eased in 21 sectors, and several government processes have been taken online. 

Our government has taken several steps to improve the business environment. The jump in India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report, from 142 to 100, in three years, is a result of this. 

We have improved on indicators like dealing with construction permits, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency.

The process is not yet complete. This is an area where we are not satisfied with 100th rank. We would strivetowards 50th rank.  

We have launched the MUDRA scheme to provide easy finance of upto one million rupees to entrepreneurs. Since its launch in 2015, over 90 million loans worth 4.28 trillion rupees have been sanctioned.  Of these, more than 70 million loans have been sanctioned to women entrepreneurs.  

My government has launched the “Atal Innovation Mission”. We are opening Tinkering Labs in more than 900 schools to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship among children. Our “Mentor India” initiative engages leaders to guide and mentor students through these tinkering labs. In addition, 19 incubation centers have been created in various universities and research institutions. These will nurture innovative start-up businesses to become scalable and sustainable.

We have created Aadhaar - the world’s largest biometric based digital database. This currently covers over 1.15 billion people and digitally authenticates over 40 million transactions daily. We now digitally provide monetary benefits of various government schemes to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer using Aadhaar.

Almost 300 million bank accounts with deposits of over 685 billion rupees, or over 10 billion dollars, have been opened through the Jan Dhan Yojana. These bring previously un-banked sections of society into the formal financial system. Of these, 53 per cent accounts are of women.

We are steadily working towards a less cash economy and have launched a Unified Payment Interface App called BHIM. In less than a year, this platform is processing almost 280 thousand transactions daily.

Having almost completed our programme to connect all villages with electricity, we have launched the Saubhagya scheme. This will provide electricity connections to all families by December 2018.

We have launched a programme to provide high-speed broad-band internet to all rural areas by March 2019.

Under our clean energy programme, in just 3 years, we have doubled the renewables capacity from 30 thousand Megawatts to about 60 thousand Megawatts. Solar energy generation has increased over 80 percent in the last year. We are working on developing a national gas grid.  A comprehensive national energy policy is also in the pipeline.

Our Swachh Bharat Mission to improve sanitation and cleanliness, and the rural and urban housing missions underline our commitment towards dignity of life.

Our infrastructure and connectivity programmes like Sagarmala and Bharatmala offer entrepreneurs many business opportunities for investment.

Our recent World Food India initiative helped us engage with entrepreneurs in the food processing industry and agricultural waste sectors.

My government understands that an environment of transparent policies and a rule of law providing a level-playing field are necessary for entrepreneurship to flourish.

A historic overhaul of the taxation system has been recently undertaken, bringing in the Goods and Services Tax across the country. Our Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code introduced in 2016 is a step towards ensuring timely resolution for stressed ventures. We have recently improved this further, preventing wilful defaulters from bidding for stressed assets.

Tough measures have been adopted to tackle the parallel economy, check tax evasion and control black money.

Our efforts have been recognized by Moody’s recent upgrade of India’s government bond ratings. This upgrade comes after a gap of almost 14 years.

India has improved its rank from 54 in 2014 to 35 in 2016 on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index. This signifies the relative ease and efficiency with which products can be moved into and from a country.

An investment-friendly environment needs to be stable from the macro-economic perspective. We have succeeded in containing the fiscal and current account deficits, and curbing inflation. Our foreign exchange reserves have crossed 400 billion dollars, and we continue to attract large foreign capital flows.

To my young entrepreneur friends from India, I would like to say: each of you has something valuable to contribute towards creating a New India by 2022. You are vehicles of change and instruments of India’s transformation.

To my entrepreneur friends from across the globe, I would like to say: Come, Make in India, Invest in India - for India, and for the world. I invite each one of you to become a partner in India’s growth story. And once again assure you of our whole-hearted support.

I am informed that President Trump has declared November 2017 as National Entrepreneurship Month. America has also observed National Entrepreneurs’ Day on November 21st. This summit will certainly resonatewith those themes. Let me conclude by wishing you fruitful, engaging and rewarding deliberations at this summit.

Thank you.

My relation with HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj was a special one. The time I spent with him was memorable. I am fortunate to have been blessed by him. Here is what I had spoken about him in Sarangpur last year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azaYIrMsx5g “, the Prime Minister said.

Chauhan, Vice Chairman of Niti Aaayog, Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Minister of State for Law and Justice, Shri P.P. Choudhary and all other dignitaries present in this hall.

Brothers and sisters,

This day today is as important for the Indian democracy as it is sacred. If there is anything called the spirit of our democratic institutions it is our Constitution. The adoption of this written text 68 years ago was a historic moment. On that day, we as a nation decided the directives and rules that would lead us in future. Each and every word of those rules, of the Constitution is holy and sacred for us.

Today is also an occasion to bow down to our Constitution makers. After independence when crores of people dreamed of moving ahead with new hopes and their spirit was high despite adverse conditions prevailing at that time it was not an easy task to give a Constitution acceptable to all. In a country which has more than a dozen religions, which has more than a hundred languages and more than 1,700 dialects, where people who have been living even in forests besides in cities and towns with their own faiths it was not an easy task to bring all of them on one platform and prepare this historic document that respects their faiths.

Every person sitting in this hall is witness to the fact that our Constitution cleared all the tests that came up from time to time. Our Constitution has proved all those people wrong who used to say that our Constitution will not be able to provide solutions to all the problems that our country would face in the days to come.

There is not a single subject that has not been explained, on which direction and guidelines have not been given in our Constitution. Keeping this feature of our Constitution in mind the interim Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Shri Sachchidanand Sinha Ji had said: “If any manmade document can be called immortal then it is the Constitution of India.”

Our Constitution is as alive as it is sensitive. It is equally capable as well as accountable. Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar himself had said about the Constitution that it was workable and flexible and it was capable of keeping the country together in the times of war and peace.’ Baba Saheb also said that if any wrong is committed keeping the provisions of the Constitution in mind then it will not be the Constitution but institution implementing the provisions of the Constitution will be at fault.

Brothers and sisters, in these past 68 years this Constitution has guided us like a guardian to follow the righteous path. As a guardian our constitution has maintained us on the path of democracy, it has prevented us from wandering on the wrong path. And as a part of the family of this guardian we all are present here in this hall. Government, judiciary and bureaucracy we all are like a member of this family.

Friends, today the Constitution day has posed an important question to us. As the members of a family, have we been following those values which have been expected of us by our guardian, by our Constitution? Have we been working to cooperate with each other to strengthen each other like the members of a family?

Brothers and sisters, today this question is not only before the people of judiciary or before the government but it is before all those institutions which have been looked up at by millions and millions of people for realisation of their hopes. Every step, every decision of these institutions impacts the lives of people. The question is that whether these institutions have been cooperating, supporting and strengthening each other while understanding the requirements of the country for the development, while understanding the aspirations of people?

I don’t exactly remember it but I would like to share a small story with you. There is a lot of discussion over what is the difference between the hell and heaven. And those wise people used to explain it in their own way. They used to tell that some people once decided to show what is hell and what is heaven to some curious ones. They were shown both the hell and heaven. There were heaps of grains and happiness and prosperity in both the hell and heaven. The occupants of the heaven were very happy but the occupants of the hell were in a very bad situation. And it was the situation of people there that they had very long spoons tied to their hands. The spoon extended from their shoulder to beyond their hands so that they could not bend their hands. Hands of both the occupants of hell and heaven were tied in the same manner. However, those people who were in the hell when they tried to eat food then the meal used to fall behind their back and that’s why they were starving to death. Everything was there but they were occupied only with this thing. However, the situation of heaven was different. Their hands were also tied in a bamboo strap in the same manner so that it cannot bend. But they have found a way, they used to lift the food and offer it to the person sitting in front of them. The other person used to lift food and offer it to the person feeding him. All the stores were brimming with the food grain but those people who adopted the path of strengthening others made it heaven for themselves and those who followed the path of strengthening themselves have made it hell for themselves.

Brothers and sisters, 75 years ago when in 1942 Gandhi Ji had made an appeal for the quit India movement the the nation found a new energy. This energy was properly channelized in every village, every lane, every city and every town and as a result of it we got the independence after five years. Now, when we will celebrate the 75 years of our independence after five years then we will have to work together to realise the dream of our freedom fighters. And for this purpose, every institution that obtains power from constitution will have to channelise its energy and will have to devote itself only for one purpose to realise the dream of a New India.

Friends, today this thing is very important as after several decades this kind of strong sentiments of public have been witnessed in our country. Today, India is the youngest country of the world. And every constitutional body of the country is required to work collectively in order to provide direction to this young energy. We have missed out on this opportunity in the 20th century. And in order to take India to new heights in the 21st century, in order to make it a New India all of us will have to make a pledge. The pledge of working together. The pledge to strengthen each other.

Brothers and sisters, in one of the debates of the Constituent Assembly, in order to meet the challenges before the country Dr. Rajendra Prasad had thoroughly explained the importance of coming together. He said: “We assure everyone that we will work relentlessly to eradicate poverty, to remove filth, to end hunger and disease, to abolish discrimination and exploitation and to ensure better living conditions. We are out on a big mission. We hope, we will get everybody’s cooperation and sympathy in this move and get support of every section of the society.”

Brothers and sisters, because of this thinking of those great souls associated with the making of the constitution our constitution is being considered a social document. This is just not a book of law but it also has a social vision. 14 August 1947, it means this thing which was said by Rajendra Babu just moments before the independence is equally relevant today. Eventually the goal of all of us is to make the life of common man of the country better and set him free from poverty-filth, set him free from hunger and disease. To provide him equal opportunity, to provide him his rights. And these things can only be done by restoring a balance in every institution and by making a pledge.

In the same meeting, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishan made another important submission. He said: “Till the time we eradicate corruption in high offices, uproot nepotism, remove the greed for power, profiteering and black marketing neither will we be able to increase efficiency in administration nor be able to easily provide the things people need in their day to day lives.”

Friends, these things were just moments before the independence. 14 August 1947, there was a sense of responsibility and along with the sense of an internal weakness of the country there was also a sense of how to overcome these weaknesses. It’s unfortunate that so many years after the independence these internal weaknesses have not been removed. That is why it is essential to deliberate this issue at all the three levels of executive, judiciary and legislature as how to move ahead in these changed circumstances. We don’t have to declare others as right or wrong. We all know our weakness and strengths.

Brothers and sisters, this time is like a golden period for the country. This kind of feeling of self confidence in the country has been generated after several years. Certainly, the will power of 1.25 billion Indians have been working as a basis for this thing. And we have to move forward to realise the dream of a New India on the basis of this positive atmosphere. There is no dearth of capability and resources but we must keep the time in our minds. If we think that we have enough time, if we believe that everything will be done by future generations, every risk will be taken by them then the history will never forgive us. Whatever we are required to do, we have to do it now, do it in this period only. We can’t stop by believing that we will not be there by the time results will be visible.

Friends, we may or may not be alive but the country will remain. The systems that we will leave behind should be such that would create a safe, confident and self-reliant India. A system that will make people’s lives easier, that increases their ease of living.

Friends, I have always believed that the government’s role should be more of a facilitator than a regulator. Today, even you will be experiencing this thing that how soon your passport is made. Maximum two to three days. Otherwise, it used to take a month or two. For the last two-three times you did not have to wait for months for getting the income tax refund. You must be aware that the system has acquired a speed. And this pace is not only making your life easier but it is also making the lives of middle class, poor people, all the people of the country easier.

Just imagine how much time and money of the youth have been saved by removing the requirement of an interview for the vacancies of group C and D. Earlier they were required to get the documents attested from a gazetted officer, now it is no longer required. And due to this thing they don’t have to run from pillar to the post. They don’t have to call four people to find out whether anyone of them knows a gazetted officer, whether anyone of them knows an MP or MLA.

Friends, you will be surprised to know that in our country 27,000 crore rupees were lying unclaimed. This money was deposited by workers, by laborers in their PF accounts and later it was not claimed due to the change of employer. Once someone has left a city then who is able to go back, who has time to make efforts for this thing. This was a big problem for our workers, our middle class. It was solved by this government by creating Universal Account Number. Now an employee no matter where he or she works he or she will have UAN number and can withdraw his or her provident fund with the help of this UAN number.

Friends, it has been said in Brihdaranyak Upnishad:

Tadetat – Kshatrasya Kshatram Yad Dharmah,

Tasmad Dharmat Param Nasti,

Atho Abaleeyan Baleeyam Sama Sanshate Dharmen,

Yatha Ragya Evam.

It means law is the emperor of emperors and there is nothing above it. The power of an emperor lies in the rule of law and it is the rule of law that empowers, that gives the poor, the weak the courage to fight with the mighty. Our government has tried to increase the ease of living by following the formula of repealing the old laws and creating new laws.

In the last three and three and a half years more than 1,200 old laws have been repealed. As Sardar Patel had unified the country similarly the work of unifying the country in a common thread has been performed through GST. The dream of one nation-one tax has been realised after decades. Similarly, be it the amendment in the law for the disabled persons, be it making the ST/SC law more stringent or be it RERA for curbing the arbitrariness of builders, all these things have been done so that the problems faced by the common man in their routine life can be minimized.

Friends, everyone present in this hall is aware that despite a direction from the Supreme Court the constitution of a SIT on black money was delayed by three years and it was constituted within three days of formation of this government. This decision was equally important for common man as much as it was against black money and corruption. Every corruption, every transaction of black money in the country deprives poor of their rights in some or some other way, it creates problem in poor’s life.

Brothers and sisters, we have taken a lot of small and big decisions but they were taken while keeping in the mind the problems faced by the public. Our decisions were not only appropriate but they also reflected the sensitiveness of the government. Friends, the unprecedented improvement in the ease of doing business ranking of the country is the direct outcome of focusing on the ease of living. While we were at the 142nd spot in terms of ease of doing business ranking before 2014, now we have reached to the 100th position. I’m happy that several steps have been taken by our judiciary in this direction. I’ve been told that this year 18 lakh pre-litigation and 22 lakh pending cases have been solved only through the Lok Adalats conducted at the national level.

Brothers and sisters, this data is also proof of the fact that such kind of disputes that can be solved through mediation and mutual discussion have also been agitated before our courts in large numbers. I don’t know that these cases were stuck for how many years. But resolution of these disputes have certainly reduced the burden on our courts. It has also enhanced the respect for Lok Adalats in our country. I feel that these Lok Adalats can play an important role in solving those millions and millions of pending cases in our country.

I’ve been told that in September this year the Chief Justice of India has also written letters to all the judges of the high courts about the pending cases. He has considered the delays in the hearings of appeals as a weakness of our Criminal Justice System. I also liked this suggestion very much that special benches can hear some cases even on Saturdays. In order to reduce the pendency of cases states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have been experimenting with evening courts. This kind of experiments can be repeated in other states as well.

Friends, increasing use of technology in the judicial system will also be helpful in making the people’s lives easier, in enhancing the ease of living. The more we expand e-Courts, the more we expand National Judicial Data Grid, the more it will reduce the problems faced by the people in courts. When the courts of the country will be connected through video conferencing then it will increase the convenience of both the courts and jail administration. I’ve been informed that in the last two years nearly five hundred courts have been connected with jails through video conferencing. I’ve also been told about the Tele Law Scheme through which legal advice has been given to poor people living in villages, living in far flung areas. The more this scheme will be expanded the more it will benefit public. I also very much liked one innovative idea of justice clock. This clock has recently been installed in the Department of Justice and the information about Top Performing District Courts is being obtained through this clock. Plans are afoot for installation of this kind of justice clocks in the courts throughout the country. Justice Clock, in a way this is a mechanism for conducting a ranking of courts.

As a kind of competition is being started among the cities following the start of cleanliness ranking, as a feeling of competition has been instilled in the colleges after the start of their ranking similarly this expansion of Justice Clock system and if necessary after making some modifications it can be used for bringing about some kind of professional competition among the courts. It’s my experience that as soon as this feeling of competition is there then systems pick up the pace and we can see more improvement in less time. I’m not an expert of law but I feel that competition among the courts will also improve ease of access to justice and ease of living. Yesterday, respected Mr. President has expressed concern over the fact that the poor had been afraid of knocking the doors of the courts to get justice. Friends, the objective of all our efforts should be that poor people are no longer afraid of courts, they should get timely justice and his expenses on legal processes of courts should come down.

Friends, today on the occasion of constitution day I’d like to particularly wish those youth who are going to get the right to vote from the 1st of January 2018. These are those youth who have been born in the 21st century and just after a few months they will vote in the elections for the first time. The responsibility of making the 21st century a century of India lies on the shoulders of these youth. And it’s the responsibility of all of us to provide this kind of system to these youth that empowers them, that strengthens them.

In this context, I’d like to raise an extremely important issue before you intellectuals. This is the issue of conducting simultaneous elections in both the centre and states. A debate on the issue has been started in recent times. Some political parties have also expressed concerns over the burden, over the resources of the country that are needed for conducting elections at the interval of every 4-6 months.

For example, if we talk about the expenses of conducting general elections in 2009 then it was almost Rs. 1,100 crore whereas nearly Rs. 4,000 crores were spent on conducting the general election in 2014. And the money spent by candidates was in addition to this figure. The requirement to deploy thousands of employees for every election and the movement of lakhs of security force personnel create pressure upon the system. And once the model code of conduct has been imposed then it is difficult for government to take decision. On the contrary to this situation there are several countries in the world where there is a fixed date for the election and people know when the elections will be conducted in their country. The benefit of this system is that these countries are not in the election mode all the time. And their policy planning process and its implementation becomes more efficient and it does not pose any burden on their resources either. India already has experience in conducting the simultaneous elections and that experience was a positive one. However, due to our shortcomings that process was broken. Today, on the auspicious occasion of constitution day I will urge you to take this discussion forward.

Brothers and sisters, when there are no restraint on any individual, government or institution then it’s certain that they will face problem some day. It’s the strength of our system that we improvise ourselves from time to time and move ahead in a disciplined manner. If we talk about the people’s representatives and political parties then they have accepted several restraints over themselves, they have accepted those restraints in the interest of country and society.

For example, a lot of people would not be aware that the model code of conduct that is being imposed during the election time is not based on any law but political parties have voluntarily accepted it. Similarly, there are so many laws that have been passed by the politicians themselves to keep the political system under some limit. Efforts have been made to ensure probity and transparency in the politics. Be it any institution, the more powerful system of self regulation and checks and balances it has the more strong it will become and also the other organs associated with it will become more strong.

Today, when the balance of powers between the three fundamental units of our constitution is being discussed then we will have to also keep in mind that this balance between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive has been the backbone of our constitution. And due to this balance our country was able to ward off any attempt to derail it from the path of democracy during the emergency.

Friends, at that time the Supreme Court in a historic judgement has said:  “Under the basic structure of the Constitution, the three Constitutionally separated organs cannot tresspass into each other’s boundaries as established by the Constitution. This is the logical and natural meaning of the principle of sovereignty of the Constitution.” Baba Saheb considered the constitution as a fundamental document due to these strengths of the constitution. A document that defines the position and powers of the executive, the judiciary and the legislature.

Dr. Ambedkar had said: “The objective of the Constitution is not only limited to creation of three organs of the Union but also to define the limits of their powers. And it is also essential because if the limits are not defined the institutions will become autocratic and start exploitation. Therefore, the legislature should be free to enact any law, the executive should be free to take any decision and the Supreme Court should be free to interpret the laws.” Today, we have reached here by following these teachings of Baba Saheb and celebrating this constitution day with pride. The Supreme Court has emphasised on this feature of the constitution, on this balance between the three institutions related to the basic structure of the constitution in several of its judgements. In 1967, the Supreme Court has said in one of its verdicts: “Our Constitution has very minutely established the boundaries of the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. The Constitution expects them to exercise their inherent powers without overstepping their boundaries.

Brothers and sisters, today, when we have been making every possible effort to realise the dream of a New India then these teachings of the constitution becomes even more relevant. We have to fulfill the expectations and desires of people while being within our limits. Today, the entire world is looking up at India with a lot of hopes. Those countries have been looking up at India for finding the solutions of so many challenges. Several countries want to walk with India shoulder to shoulder for her development. In such a situation, all of them – the legislature, the executive and the judiciary will have to move forward while keeping in the mind the limits set by the constitution.

Friends, I congratulate the law commission and Niti Aayog for organising this event. All three organs of the constitution have candidly expressed their opinions on this occasion. Several experts, intellectuals have expressed their views. And everyone’s views have their own importance. This kind of dialogues are extremely essential in order to strengthen the democracy. It shows our maturity. We should collectively take forward all the actionable points obtained through this event. We should also think over how to make this process of dialogue a constant feature.

Brothers and sisters, today the time demands that all of us should strengthen each other, one institution should be able to understand the requirement of the other and also understand the challenges faced by it. When these three institutions will focus on their duties enshrined in the constitution only then they will be able to rightfully tell the citizens of the country: “Please follow your duties and think of society and country by shedding the mentality of why should I bother.”

Friends, in the dispute over rights there is an apprehension that duties will take a back seat and the country cannot move ahead if we shirk our duties.

Once again I convey to all of you, to all my fellow countrymen the best wishes of the Constitution Day.

I thank all of you very much and wish that may we move ahead with a new enthusiasm, with a new pledge and with a new capability towards 2022, towards the 75th year of our independence.

Thank you very much.

Jai Hind.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the valedictory session of the function to mark National Law Day – 2017, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. 

He described the Constitution as the very soul of our democratic structure. He said the Day is an occasion to pay homage to the makers of the Constitution. He said the Constitution has stood the test of time, and proved the naysayers wrong.  

The Prime Minister quoted extensively from leaders including Dr. B.R Ambedkar, Dr. Sachidanand Sinha, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, during his address. These quotations were used to highlight several important facets of the Constitution, and governance. These themes included the longevity (or immortality) of the Constitution, its workability and flexibility.

The Prime Minister said that the Constitution has been a guardian for us. He emphasized that we, the people, must also work as per the expectations that our guardian – the Constitution – has from us. He said that keeping in mind the needs of the country and the challenges facing it, the various institutions of governance should support and strengthen each other. He said that in the next five years, we should channelize our energies to build the New India – the nation that our freedom fighters dreamt of.

The Prime Minister said that the Constitution has also been described as a social document. He said it is indeed unfortunate that the weaknesses that had been identified in our country at the dawn of independence, have still not been entirely eradicated. He said the current time can be described as a golden period when India is full of self-confidence. He said this constructive atmosphere should be used to move swiftly towards the creation of New India.

Emphasizing the importance of ""Ease of Living,"" the Prime Minister said that the role of the Government should be one of a facilitator, more than a regulator. The Prime Minister gave several examples of ""Ease of Living"" that have been brought about in the last three years, such as quicker income tax refunds, quicker passport delivery etc. He said these initiatives have had a positive impact on all sections of the society. He said about 1200 archaic laws have been repealed. He said ease of living has also had a positive impact on ""ease of doing business."" He said Lok Adalats can play a key role in reducing pendency of cases in the judiciary. He outlined several other steps that are being taken to improve ""ease of access to justice."" 

Mentioning the massive expenditure that has to be borne by exchequer on account of frequent elections, and other related issues such as diversion of security forces and civil staff, and impact on development programmes, the Prime Minister called for a constructive discussion on the possibility of holding simultaneous elections for the Union and State Governments.  

The Prime Minister emphasized that balance between the executive, legislature and judiciary has been the backbone of the Constitution. In this context, the Prime Minister also quoted from judgements of the Supreme Court.

                देश के मुख्य न्यायधीश जस्टिस श्री दीपक मिश्रा, मंत्रिमंडल के मेरे सहयोगी विधि और न्याय मंत्री श्री रविशंकर प्रसाद, लॉ कमीशन के चेयरमैन डॉ जस्टिस बी. एस. चौहान, नीति आयोग के वाइस चेयरमैन डॉक्टर राजीव कुमार, विधि और न्याय राज्यमंत्री श्री पी. पी. चौधरी, इस सभागार में उपस्थित अन्य महानुभाव, भाइयों और बहनों,

भारतीय लोकतंत्र में आज का दिन जितना पावन है, उतना ही महत्वपूर्ण भी। हमारी लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्थाओं की आत्मा अगर किसी को कहा जा सकता है तो वो हमारा संविधान है। इस आत्मा को, इस लिखित ग्रंथ को 68 वर्ष पहले स्वीकार किया जाना बहुत ऐतिसाहिक पल था। इस दिन एक राष्ट्र के तौर पर हमने तय किया था कि अब आगे हमारी दिशा किन निर्देशों पर होगी, किन नियमों के तहत होगी। वो नियम, वो संविधान जिसका एक-एक शब्द हमारे लिए पवित्र है, पूजनीय है।

आज का दिन देश के संविधान निर्माताओं को नमन करने का भी दिन है। स्वतंत्रता के बाद जब करोड़ों लोग नई उम्मीदों के साथ आगे बढ़ने का सपना देख रहे हों, जब विपरीत परिस्थितियों के बावजूद हौसले बुलंद हों, तो उस समय देश के सामने एक ऐसा संविधान प्रस्तुत करना, जो सभी को स्वीकार्य हो, बहुत आसान काम नहीं था। जिस देश में एक दर्जन से ज्यादा पंथ हों, सौ से ज्यादा भाषाएं हों, सत्रह सौ से ज्यादा बोलियां हों, शहर-गांव-कस्बों और जंगलों तक में लोग रहते हों, उनकी अपनी आस्थाएं हों, उन्हें एक मंच पर लाना, सबकी आस्थाओं का सम्मान करने के बाद ये ऐतिहासिक दस्तावेज तैयार करना आसान नहीं था।

इस हॉल में बैठा हर व्यक्ति इस बात का गवाह है कि समय के साथ हमारे संविधान ने हर परीक्षा को पार किया है। हमारे संविधान ने उन लोगों की हर उस आशंका को गलत साबित किया है, जो कहते थे कि समय के साथ जो चुनौतियां देश के सामने आएंगी, उनका समाधान हमारा संविधान नहीं दे पाएगा।

ऐसा कोई विषय नहीं, जिसकी व्याख्या, जिस पर दिशा-निर्देश हमें भारतीय संविधान में ना मिलते हों। संविधान की इसी शक्ति को समझते हुए संविधान सभा के अंतरिम चेयरमैन श्री सचिदानंद सिन्हा जी ने कहा था-

“मानव द्वारा रचित अगर किसी रचना को अमर कहा जा सकता है तो वो भारत का संविधान है”।

हमारा संविधान जितना जीवंत है, उतना ही संवेदनशील भी। हमारा संविधान जितना जवाबदेह है, उतना ही सक्षम भी। खुद बाबा साहेब भीम राव अंबेडकर ने संविधान के बारे में कहा था कि – “ये workable है, ये flexible है और शांति हो या युद्ध का समय, इसमें देश को एकजुट रखने की ताकत है”। बाबा साहेब ने ये भी कहा था कि- “संविधान के सामने रखकर अगर कुछ गलत होता भी है, तो उसमें गलती संविधान की नहीं, बल्कि संविधान का पालन करवा रही संस्था की होगी”।

भाइयों और बहनों, इन 68 वर्षों में संविधान ने एक अभिभावक की तरह हमें सही रास्ते पर चलना सिखाया है। एक अभिभावक की तरह हमारे संविधान ने देश को लोकतंत्र के रास्ते पर बनाए रखा है, उसे भटकने से रोका है। इसी अभिभावक के परिवार के सदस्य के तौर पर हम सभी इस सभागार में उपस्थित हैं। गवर्नमेंट, ज्यूडिशियरी, ब्यूरोक्रेसी हम सभी इस परिवार के सदस्य ही तो हैं।

 साथियों, आज संविधान दिवस हमारे लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रश्न लेकर आया है। क्या एक परिवार के सदस्य के तौर पर हम उन मर्यादाओं का पालन कर रहे हैं, जिसकी उम्मीद हमारा अभिभावक, हमारा संविधान हमसे करता है? क्या एक ही परिवार के सदस्य के तौर पर हम एक दूसरे को मजबूत करने के लिए, एक दूसरे का सहयोग करने के लिए काम कर रहे हैं?

भाइयों और बहनों, ये सवाल सिर्फ ज्यूडिशयरी या सरकार में बैठे लोगों के सामने नहीं, बल्कि देश के हर उस स्तंभ, हर उस पिलर, हर उस संस्था के सामने है, जिस पर आज करोड़ों लोगों की उम्मीदें टिकी हुई हैं। इन संस्थाओं का एक एक फैसला, एक एक कदम लोगों के जीवन को प्रभावित करता है। सवाल ये है कि क्या ये संस्थाएं देश के विकास के लिए, देश की आवश्यकताओं को समझते हुए, देश के समक्ष चुनौतियों को समझते हुए, देश के लोगों की आशाओं-आकांक्षाओं को समझते हुए, एक दूसरे का सहयोग कर रही हैं? एक दूसरे को Support, एक दूसरे को strengthen कर रही हैं?

मुझे बहुत ठीक से तो याद नहीं लेकिन एक छोटी सी कहानी सुनाना चाहता हूं।

बड़ी चर्चा होती थी स्‍वर्ग और नरक में अंतर क्‍या है और कुछ जो बड़े विद्वान लोग थे उसको अपने तरीके से समझाते थे। वो कहते थे कि ऐसे जिज्ञासु जनों को एक बार कुछ लोगों ने स्‍वर्ग और नरक दिखाने का कार्यक्रम बना लिया। उन्‍हें स्‍वर्ग भी दिखाया, नरक भी दिखाया। स्‍वर्ग में भी अन्‍न के भंडार थे, सुख-वैभव था। नरक में भी अन्‍न के भंडार थे, सुख-वैभव था। स्‍वर्ग में जो लोग थे उनकी हालत बहुत खुशनुमा थी, नरक में जो लोग थे उनकी हालत बड़ी खस्‍ता थी। और वहां की स्थिति ऐसी थी कि जो लोग वहां थे, उनके हाथों में एक बड़े-बडे लम्‍बे चम्‍मच बंधे हुए थे। कंधे से लेकर हाथ तक और आगे फिर चम्‍मच होता है और इससे हाथ मोड़  नहीं सकता था। स्‍वर्ग में जो लोग थे उनके हाथ भी ऐसे बंधे हुए थे, नरक में जो थे उनके हाथ भी ऐसे बंधे हुए थे। लेकिन जो लोग नरक में थे वे ले करके ऐसे खाने की कोशिश करते थे तो उधर पीछे जा करके गिरता था और इसलिए वो भूखे मर रहे थे। सब कुछ था लेकिन बस इसी में लगे थे। और स्‍वर्ग की हालत कुछ और थी। उनको भी वैसे ही bamboo के पट्टे बंधे हुए थे, उनका भी हाथ मुड़ नहीं सकता था। लेकिन उन्‍होंने तरीका ढूंढा था, कि वो लेते थे और सामने वाले को खिलाते थे। वो लेता था इसको खिलाता था। सारे अन्‍न के भंडार भरे पड़े थे। जिन्‍होंने दूसरों को strengthen करने का रास्‍ता अपनाया था वहां स्‍वर्ग था, जिन्‍होंने अपने को strengthen बनाने की कोशिश की थी वहां नरक फैला हुआ था।

भाइयों और बहनों, 75 वर्ष पहले जब 1942 में गांधी जी ने भारत छोड़ो आंदोलन का आह्वान किया था, तो देश एक नई ऊर्जा से भर गया था। हर गांव, हर गली, हर शहर, हर कस्बे में ये ऊर्जा सही तरीके से channelise होती रही और इसी का परिणाम था हमें पाँच वर्ष बाद आजादी मिली, हम स्वतंत्र हुए।

अब आज से पाँच साल बाद हम सब स्वतंत्रता के 75 वर्ष का पर्व मनाएंगे। इन पाँच वर्षों में, हमें एकजुट होकर उस भारत का सपना पूरा करना है, जिस भारत का सपना हमारे स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों ने देखा था। इसके लिए संविधान से ऊर्जा लेने वाली हर संस्था को अपनी ऊर्जा channelise करनी होगी, उसे सिर्फ और सिर्फ न्यू इंडिया का सपना पूरा करने में लगाना होगा।

साथियों, ये बात आज इसलिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है क्योंकि जनभावनाओं की ऐसी प्रबलता हमारे देश में दशकों के बाद दिखाई दे रही है। भारत आज दुनिया का सबसे नौजवान देश है। इस नौजवान ऊर्जा को दिशा देने के लिए देश की हर संवैधानिक संस्था को मिलकर काम करने की आवश्यकता है।

20वीं सदी में हम एक बार ये अवसर चूक चुके हैं। अब 21वीं सदी में भारत को नई ऊँचाई पर ले जाने के लिए, न्यू इंडिया बनाने के लिए, हम सभी को संकल्प लेना होगा। संकल्प साथ मिलकर काम करने का, संकल्प एक दूसरे को मजबूत करने का।

भाइयों और बहनों, देश के समक्ष मौजूद चुनौतियों से निपटने के लिए एकजुट होने का महत्व डॉक्टर राजेंद्र प्रसाद ने संविधान सभा की एक चर्चा के दौरान विस्तार से समझाया था। उन्होंने कहा था-

“हम सभी को ये विश्वास दिलाते हैं कि देश से गरीबी मिटाने के लिए, गंदगी मिटाने के लिए, भूख और बीमारी खत्म करने के लिए, भेदभाव समाप्त करने के लिए, शोषण खत्म करने के लिए, और जीने का बेहतर माहौल सुनिश्चित करने के लिए हम हमेशा प्रयासरत रहेंगे। हम एक बहुत बड़े मिशन पर निकल रहे हैं। हमें उम्मीद है कि इस प्रयास में हमें सभी लोगों का सहयोग मिलेगा, सहानुभूति मिलेगी और समाज के हर वर्ग से समर्थन प्राप्त होगा”।

भाइयों और बहनों, संविधान निर्माण से जुड़े महान व्यक्तियों के इसी चिंतन की वजह से हमारे संविधान को एक “Social Document” माना जाता है। ये सिर्फ कानून की एक किताब नहीं, बल्कि इसमें एक सामाजिक दर्शन भी है। 14 अगस्त 1947, यानि स्वतंत्रता से कुछ ही पल पहले कही गई राजेंद्र बाबू की ये बात आज भी उतनी ही relevent है। हम सभी का ध्येय तो आखिरकार देश के आम नागरिक के जीवन को बेहतर बनाना है, उसे गरीबी-गंदगी,भूख-बीमारी से मुक्त करना है। उसे समान अवसर देना है, उसे इंसाफ देना है, उसे उसके अधिकार देना है। ये कार्य हर संस्था में एक संतुलन बनाकर, एक संकल्प तय करके ही पूरे किए जा सकते हैं।

इसी बैठक में डॉक्टर सर्वपल्ली राधाकृष्णन ने एक और महत्वपूर्ण विचार रखा था। उन्होंने कहा था- “जब तक हम ऊंचे पदों पर मौजूद भ्रष्टाचार को खत्म नहीं करेंगे, भाई-भतीजावाद को जड़ से नहीं मिटाएंगे, सत्ता के लालच, मुनाफाखोरी और कालाबाजारी को नहीं हटाएंगे तब तक हम ना तो प्रशासन में efficiency बढ़ा पाएंगे और ना ही जो चीजें जीवन से जुड़ी हैं, उन्हें आसानी से लोगों तक पहुंचा पाएंगे”।

साथियों, ये बातें स्वतंत्रता के कुछ पल पहले की थीं। 14 अगस्त 1947, एक जिम्मेदारी का भाव था, देश की आंतरिक कमजोरियों का ऐहसास होने के साथ ही, ये ऐहसास भी था कि उन कमजोरियों को दूर कैसे किया जाना है। दुर्भाग्य से, स्वतंत्रता के इतने वर्षों बाद भी ये आंतरिक कमजोरियां दूर नहीं हुई हैं। इसलिए कार्यपालिका, न्यायपालिका और विधायिका, तीनों ही स्तर पर इसे लेकर मंथन किए जाने की जरूरत है कि अब बदले हुए हालात में कैसे आगे बढ़ा जाए। हमें किसी को सही, किसी को गलत नहीं ठहराना है। अपनी-अपनी कमजोरियां हम जानते हैं, अपनी-अपनी शक्तियों को भी पहचानते हैं।

 भाइयों और बहनों, ये समय तो भारत के लिए Golden Period की तरह है। देश में आत्मविश्वास का ऐसा माहौल बरसों के बाद बना है। निश्चित तौर पर इसके पीछे सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों की इच्छाशक्ति काम कर रही है। इसी सकारात्मक माहौल को आधार बनाकर हमें न्यू इंडिया के रास्ते पर आगे बढ़ते चलना है। सामर्थ्य और संसाधन की हमारे पास कमी नहीं है। बस हमें समय का जरूर ध्यान रखना है।

हम ये मानकर चलेंगे कि हमारे पास बहुत समय है, हम ये मानकर चलेंगे कि आने वाली पीढ़ियां ही सब करेंगी, सारे रिस्क उठाएंगी, तो इतिहास हमें कभी माफ नहीं करेगा। जो करना है हमें अभी करना है, इसी दौर में करना है। हम ये सोचकर नहीं रुक सकते कि इसके परिणाम आते-आते तो हम नहीं रहेंगे।

मेरे साथियों, हम भले ना रहें लेकिन ये देश तो रहेगा। हम भले ना रहें, लेकिन जो व्यवस्था हम देश को देकर जाएं वो सुरक्षित-स्वाभिमानी और स्वावलंबी भारत की व्यवस्था होनी चाहिए। एक ऐसी व्यवस्था, जो लोगों की जिंदगी को आसान बनाने वाली हो, Ease of Living बढ़ाने वाली हो।

साथियों, मेरा हमेशा से मानना रहा है कि सरकार की भूमिका Regulator से ज्यादा Facilitator की होनी चाहिए। आज आप भी ये महसूस करते होंगे कि अब पासपोर्ट आपको कितनी जल्दी मिल जाता है। ज्यादा से ज्यादा दो दिन, नहीं तो तीन दिन। वरना यही पासपोर्ट आपको पहले एक महीने-दो महीने में मिलता था। पिछली दो-तीन बार से आपको इनकम टैक्स रीफंड के लिए भी महीनों इंतजार नहीं करना पड़ता है।

आप देख रहे होंगे कि सिस्टम में एक तेजी आ रही है, गति आ रही है। और ये गति सिर्फ आप लोग ही नहीं, देश के मध्यम वर्ग, गरीब, सभी की जिंदगी को आसान बना रही है।

अब सोचिए, ग्रुप सी और डी की नौकरी में इंटरव्यू खत्म होने से युवाओं का कितना समय बचा है, कितना पैसा बचा है। दस्तावेजों को जो पहले गजटेड ऑफीसर से अटेस्ड कराना जरूरी था, वो भी अब उन्हें नहीं कराना पड़ता। इससे भी उन्हें बेवजह इधर-उधर भागना दौड़ना नहीं पड़ता। चार लोगों को फोन नहीं करना पड़ता कि भाई, किसी गजटेड ऑफीसर को जानते हो क्या? किसी सांसद-विधायक को जानते हो क्या?

साथियों, आप जानकर हैरान रह जाएंगे कि हमारे देश में 27 हजार करोड़ रुपए ऐसे थे, जिन पर किसी का क्लेम नहीं था। ये पैसे श्रमिकों ने, कर्मचारियों ने अपने PF अकाउंट में जमा कराए थे और बाद में जगह बदलने की वजह से उन्होंने अपने पैसे क्लेम नहीं किए थे। एक बार शहर छूट गया, तो अब कौन वापस जाए, कहां भागे-दौड़ें।

ये हमारे श्रमिक और मध्यम वर्ग की बहुत बड़ी समस्या थी, जिसे इस सरकार ने Universal Account Number बनाकर हल किया। अब कर्मचारी कहीं भी नौकरी करे, उसके पास UAN नंबर होता है। UAN नंबर से वो अपने PF का पैसा कहीं से भी निकाल सकता है।

साथियों, बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद में कहा गया है-

तदेतत् – क्षत्रस्‍य क्षत्रं यद्धर्म:

तस्‍माद्धर्मात् परं नास्ति

अथो अबलीयान् बलीयांसमाशंसते धर्मेण

यथा राज्ञा एवम्  

यानि कानून सम्राटों का सम्राट है। कानून से ऊपर कुछ नहीं। कानून में ही राजा की शक्ति निहित है और कानून ही गरीबों को-कमजोरों को ताकतवर से लड़ने का हौसला देता है, उन्हें सक्षम बनाता है। इसी मंत्र पर चलते हुए हमारी सरकार ने भी नए कानून बनाकर और पुराने कानून खत्म करके Ease of Living को बढ़ाने का काम किया है।

पिछले तीन-साढ़े तीन साल में लगभग 1200 पुराने कानून खत्म किए जा चुके हैं। जैसे सरदार पटेल ने देश का एकीकरण किया था, वैसे ही देश को एकता के सूत्र में पिरोने वाला काम GST के माध्यम से हुआ है। दशकों बाद One Nation-One Tax का सपना साकार हुआ है।

इसी तरह चाहे दिव्यांगों के लिए कानून में बदलाव का फैसला हो, ST/SC कानून को और सख्त करने का फैसला हो, या फिर बिल्डरों की मनमानी रोकने के लिए RERA, ये सभी इसलिए लिए गए ताकि आम नागरिक को रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में होने वाली दिक्कत कम हो।

 साथियों, यहां इस हॉल में मौजूद हर व्यक्ति को पता है कि सुप्रीम कोर्ट के आदेश के बावजूद कालेधन के खिलाफ जो SIT तीन साल तक टलती रही थी, उसका गठन इस सरकार ने शपथ लेने के तीन दिन के भीतर कर दिया था। ये फैसला भी जितना कालेधन और भ्रष्टाचार के खिलाफ था, उतना ही आम नागरिक से जुड़ा हुआ था। देश में होने वाला हर भ्रष्टाचार, कालेधन का हर लेन-देन कहीं ना कहीं किसी गरीब का अधिकार छीनता है, उसकी जिंदगी में परेशानी खड़ी करता है।

भाइयों और बहनों, हमने छोटे-बड़े, बहुत से फैसले लिए, लेकिन जनता की समस्याओं को समझते हुए लिए। हमारे फैसले सटीक ही नहीं बल्कि संवेदनशील भी रहे। साथियों, Ease of Living पर ध्यान देने का सीधा असर ये हुआ कि देश की Ease of Doing Business की रैकिंग में भी अभूतपूर्व सुधार हो गया है। 2014 के पहले जहां हम Ease of Doing Business की रैकिंग में 142वें नंबर पर थे, अब 100वें नंबर पर पहुंच चुके हैं।

मुझे खुशी है कि हमारे ज्यूडिशियल सिस्टम में भी इस दिशा में बहुत से कदम उठाए जा रहे हैं। मुझे बताया गया है कि इस वर्ष राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर हुई लोक अदालतों में ही 18 लाख Pre-litigation और 22 लाख Pending केसों का निपटारा किया गया है।

भाइयों और बहनों, ये आंकड़ा इस बात का भी सबूत है कि ऐसे विवाद जो आपसी बातचीत या किसी की मध्यस्तता से सुलझ सकते हैं, वो भी बड़ी संख्या में हमारी अदालतों में पहुंच रहे हैं। मुझे मालूम नहीं कि ये Cases कितने वर्षों से अटके हुए थे। लेकिन निश्चित तौर पर इन मामलों के सुलझने से हमारी अदालतों का  बोझ थोड़ा कम हुआ है। इससे लोक अदालतों के प्रति भी हमारे देश में श्रद्धा बढ़ी है। मुझे लगता है कि करोड़ों pending cases को सुलझाने में ऐसी लोक अदालतों की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका हो सकती है।

 मुझे बताया गया है अभी सितंबर में ही चीफ जस्टिस ने Pending Cases को लेकर सभी हाई कोर्ट के जजों को चिट्ठी भी लिखी है। अपीलों की सुनवाई में देरी को उन्होंने हमारी न्याय व्यवस्था और विशेषकर हमारे Criminal Justice System की कमजोरी माना है। मुझे ये सुझाव भी बहुत अच्छा लगा कि कुछ मामलों की सुनवाई के लिए शनिवार को Special Benches भी बैठ सकती है। Pending Cases को कम करने के लिए तमिलनाडु और गुजरात जैसे राज्यों में Evening Court का भी प्रयोग किया जा रहा है। इस तरह के प्रयोग बाकी राज्यों में भी किए जा सकते हैं।

साथियों, ज्यूडिशियल सिस्टम में तकनीक का बढ़ता इस्तेमाल भी लोगों की जिंदगी को आसान बनाने, Ease of Living को आसान बनाने में मददगार साबित होगा। e-Courts का जितना विस्तार होगा, National Judicial Data Grid का जितना विस्तार होगा, उतना ही लोगों को अदालतों में होने वाली परेशानी कम होगी। जब वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंसिंग के माध्यम से देश की अदालतें जेल से जुड़ जाएगी, तो कोर्ट और जेल प्रशासन दोनों की सहूलियत बढ़ेगी।

मुझे जानकारी दी गई है कि पिछले दो वर्ष में लगभग 500 अदालतें वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंसिंग के जरिए जेलों से connect की गई हैं।

मुझे Tele Law Scheme के बारे में भी बताया गया है जिसकी मदद से देश के दूर-दराज में रहने वाले लोगों को, गांव में रहने वाले गरीबों को कानूनी सलाह दी जा रही है। इस स्कीम का दायरा जितना बढ़ेगा, उतना ही लोगों को फायदा होगा।

एक और innovative idea मुझे बहुत अच्छा लगा Justice Clock का। ये Clock अभी Department of Justice में लगाई गई है और इससे Top Performing District Courts के बारे में जानकारी मिलती है। तैयारी है कि भविष्य में ऐसी Justice Clock देश भर की अदालतों में लगाई जाए। Justice Clock, एक तरह से अदालतों को रैंकिंग देने वाली बात हुई।

जैसे स्वच्छता की रैंकिंग शुरू करने के बाद शहरों में एक कंपटीशन शुरू हुआ, कॉलेजों में रैकिंग शुरू करने के बाद इस क्षेत्र में भी कंपटीशन का भाव आया, वैसे ही अगर Justice Clock का विस्तार करके, कुछ सुधार की आवश्यकता हो तो उसमें सुधार करके अदालतों में भी प्रोफेशनल कंपटीशन हो सकता है। ये मेरा अनुभव है कि कंपटीशन का भाव आते ही व्यवस्थाओं में गति आती है, कम समय में ज्यादा सुधार देखने को मिलता है। मैं कानून का जानकार नहीं हूं, लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि कोर्ट में कंपटीशन भी Ease of access to Justice और Ease of Living को बढ़ाएगा।

कल माननीय राष्ट्रपति जी ने भी इस पर चिंता व्यक्त की थी कि गरीब न्याय के लिए कोर्ट तक आने में घबराता है। साथियों, हमारे सारे प्रयासों का परिणाम ये होना चाहिए कि गरीब कोर्ट से डरे नहीं, उसे समय पर न्याय मिले और कोर्ट की प्रक्रियाओं में उसका खर्च भी कम हो।

साथियों, आज संविधान दिवस के अवसर पर मैं उन युवाओं को भी विशेष शुभकामनाएं देना चाहता हूं जिन्हें एक जनवरी, 2018 से वोट देने का अधिकार मिलने जा रहा है। ये वो युवा हैं जो 21वीं सदी में जन्में हैं और कुछ महीनों बाद चुनावों में पहली बार वोट डालेंगे। 21वीं शताब्दी को भारत की शताब्दी बनाने की जिम्मेदारी इन्हीं नौजवान युवाओं पर है। वहीं हम सभी की जिम्मेदारी इन युवाओं को ऐसी व्यवस्था देकर जाने की है, जो उन्हें और मजबूत करे, उनकी शक्ति बढ़ाए।

इसी कड़ी में एक बहुत महत्वपूर्ण विषय मैं आप सभी विद्वानों के सामने रखना चाहता हूं। ये विषय है केंद्र और राज्य में एक साथ चुनाव कराने का। बीते कुछ समय से इस पर देश में चर्चा शुरू हुई है। कुछ राजनीतिक दलों ने भी हर 4-6 महीने पर होने वाले चुनाव की वजह से देश पर जो आर्थिक बोझ पड़ता है, संसाधनों पर दबाव पड़ता है, उस पर चिंता जताई थी। अब जैसे 2009 के लोकसभा चुनाव की ही बात करें तो उस साल चुनाव कराने में लगभग 1100 करोड़ का खर्च आया था। वहीं 2014 के लोकसभा चुनाव का खर्च लगभग 4 हजार करोड़ रुपए आया था। इसके अलावा उम्मीदवारों का खर्च अलग से। एक-एक चुनाव में हजारों कर्मचारियों की तैनाती, लाखों सुरक्षाबलों का इधर से उधर होना भी व्यवस्था पर दबाव बनाता है। जब आचार संहिता लागू हो जाती है, तो सरकार उतनी आसानी से फैसले भी नहीं ले पाती।

वहीं इसके ठीक उलट दुनिया के कई देश हैं जहां पर चुनाव की तारीख Fix रहती है। लोगो को पता रहता है कि उनके देश में कब चुनाव होगा, किस महीने चुनाव होगा। इसका फायदा ये होता है कि देश हमेशा चुनाव के मोड में नहीं रहता, Policy Planning Process और उनका implimentation ज्यादा efficient रहता है और देश के संसाधनों पर अनावश्यक बोझ भी नहीं पड़ता।

एक साथ चुनाव का भारत पहले भी अनुभव कर चुका है और वो अनुभव सुखद रहा था। लेकिन हमारी ही कमियों की वजह से ये व्यवस्था भी टूट गई। मैं आज संविधान दिवस के इस शुभ अवसर पर इस चर्चा को आगे बढ़ाने का आग्रह करूंगा।

भाइयों और बहनों, जब स्वयं पर बंधन नहीं होता तो व्यक्ति हो या कोई भी सरकार या संस्था, उस पर किसी ना किसी दिन संकट आना तय होता है। हमारे यहां ये व्यवस्था की मजबूती है कि समय-समय पर हम खुद को परिष्कृत करते चलते हैं, खुद पर ही बंधन स्वीकार करते चलते हैं। विशेषकर जनप्रतिनिधियों और राजनीतिक दलों की बात करें तो उन्होंने स्वयं के लिए अनेक बंधन स्वीकारे। देश के हित में, समाज के हित में स्वीकारे।

जैसे आज बहुत से लोगों को पता ही नहीं होगा कि चुनाव के समय जो आचार संहिता लागू होती है, वो किसी कानून द्वारा नहीं लागू की जाती, बल्कि वो आचार संहिता खुद राजनीतिक दलों ने अपनी स्वेच्छा से स्वीकार की है।

इसी तरह संसद में कितने ही कानून पास करके नेताओं ने राजनीतिक व्यवस्था को दायरे में रखने के लिए कदम उठाएं हैं। राजनीति में शुचिता आए, स्वच्छता आए, इसके लिए प्रयास किए गए हैं और किए जा रहे हैं। संस्था कोई भी हो, उसमें Self Regulation, Check और Balance की व्यवस्था जितनी मजबूत होगी, उतना ही संस्था और उससे जुड़े अंग भी मजबूत होंगे।

आज जब इस अवसर पर संविधान की तीन आधारभूत इकाइयों के बीच संतुलन की चर्चा हो रही है, तो हमें ये ध्यान रखना होगा कि न्यायपालिका, विधायिका और कार्यपालिका के बीच संतुलन हमारे संविधान की BackBone रहा है। इसी संतुलन की वजह से हमारा देश इमरजेंसी के दौरान लोकतंत्र की राह से भटकाए जाने की तमाम कोशिशों को खारिज कर सका था।

साथियों, उस समय अपने ऐतिहासिक फैसले में सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने कहा था-

“संविधान के बुनियादी स्वरूप के अंतर्गत, संवैधानिक तौर पर अलग तीनों अंग, संविधान द्वारा तय की गई सीमाओं को पार करके, एक दूसरे की सीमा में नहीं जा सकते। ये संविधान के प्रभुत्व के सिद्धांत का तार्किक और प्राकृतिक अर्थ है”।

संविधान की इन शक्तियों की वजह से बाबा साहेब उसे Fundamental Document मानते थे। एक ऐसा दस्तावेज जो Executive, Judiciary और Legislature की स्थिति और शक्तियों को परिभाषित करता है।

डॉक्टर अंबेडकर ने कहा था-

“संविधान का मकसद सिर्फ संघ के तीन अंगों का निर्माण करना ही नहीं है बल्कि उनके अधिकार की सीमाएं भी तय करना है। ऐसा इसलिए आवश्यक है क्योंकि अगर सीमाएं नहीं तय होंगी तो संस्थाओं में निरंकुशता आ जाएगी और वो उत्पीड़न करने लगेंगी। इसलिए Legislature को कोई भी कानून बनाने की स्वतंत्रता होनी चाहिए, Executive को कोई भी फैसला लेने की स्वतंत्रता होनी चाहिए और सुप्रीम कोर्ट को कानून की व्याख्या करने की स्वतंत्रता होनी चाहिए”।

बाबा साहेब की कही इन बातों पर चलकर ही हम आज यहां तक पहुंचे हैं और गर्व के साथ संविधान दिवस मना रहे हैं। संविधान की इस खूबी पर, संविधान के मौलिक ढांचे से जुड़ी तीन संस्थाओं के बीच संतुलन पर सुपीमकोर्ट ने भी अपने कई फैसलों में जोर दिया है। 1967 में एक फैसले के दौरान सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने कहा था-

“हमारे संविधान ने Legislature, Executive और Judiciary की सीमाएं बहुत बारीकी से तय की हैं। संविधान उनसे उम्मीद करता है कि वो अपनी निहित शक्तियों का बिना अपनी सीमा लांघें इस्तेमाल करें”।

भाइयों और बहनों, आज जब हम न्यू इंडिया के सपने को पूरा करने के लिए हर संभव प्रयास कर रहे हैं, तो संविधान की सिखाई इन बातों की प्रासंगिकता और बढ़ गई है। अपने सीमित दायरे में रहते हुए हमें जनता की आशाओं-आकांक्षाओं को पूरा करना है।

 आज पूरा विश्व भारत की ओर बहुत उम्मीदों से देख रहा है। कितनी ही चुनौतियों का हल उन देशों को भारत में ही दिख रहा है। कितने ही देश भारत के विकास में कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर चलना चाहते हैं। ऐसे में Legislature, Executive और Judiciary, सभी को संविधान द्वारा तय की मर्यादाओं को ध्यान में रखते हुए ही आगे बढ़ना होगा।

साथियों, मैं लॉ कमीशन और नीति आयोग को इस आयोजन के लिए बधाई देता हूं। संविधान की तीनों इकाइयों ने इस आयोजन में खुलकर अपनी बात रखी है। बहुत से जानकारों, विद्वानों ने अपनी राय दी है। सबकी राय का अपना-अपना महत्व है। लोकतंत्र की मजबूती के लिए इस तरह के संवाद बहुत आवश्यक हैं। ये हमारी Maturity को दिखाता है। इस कार्यक्रम से जो भी actionable points निकले हैं, उन्हें हम सभी को मिलकर आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए। संवाद की प्रक्रिया निरंतर जारी रहे, इस बारे में भी सोचा जाना चाहिए।

भाइयों और बहनों, आज समय की मांग है कि हम एक दूसरे को सशक्त करें, एक संस्था दूसरे की आवश्यकताओं को समझे, वो संस्था जिन चुनौतियों का सामना कर रही है, उन्हें समझे। जब ये तीनों संस्थाएं संविधान में लिखित अपने कर्तव्यों पर ध्यान देंगी, तभी देश के नागरिकों को भी अधिकार से कह पाएंगी कि “आप भी अपने कर्तव्यों का पालन करिए, मेरा क्या-मुझे क्या की सोच को छोड़कर समाज और देश के बारे में सोचिए”।

साथियों, अधिकार-अधिकार के संघर्ष में कर्तव्यों के पीछे छूटने का अंदेशा रहता है और अपने कर्तव्यों से पीछे हटकर देश आगे नहीं बढ़ सकता।

मैं एक बार फिर आप सभी को, देशवासियों को संविधान दिवस की बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।

आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद करता हूं और 2022, आजादी के 75 साल, नया उमंग, नया संकल्‍प, नए सामर्थ्‍य के साथ हम आगे बढ़ें।

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

जय हिंद !!!

                My dear countrymen, namaskar! A while ago, I had a chance to have an indirect dialogue, with young friends from Karnataka. The Times Group Newspaper “Vijaya Karnataka” started a new initiative urging the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country. And, then they published some selected letters. I read those letters and liked the initiative. Even these little children are conversant with problems confronting the nation; aware of the deliberations going on in the country. Kirti Hegde from North Kannada had appreciated Digital India and Smart City schemes and she put forth a suggestion that we need to transform our education system and said that the present-day children do not like classroom reading, they love to know more and more about nature. And if we impart knowledge about nature to our children then in future they may prove very useful in protecting the environment. 

A child Reeda Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of an army man and feels proud of being so. Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers? And, you being a soldier’ daughter should naturally take pride in that. Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that her school is 5 Kilometres away from her village and she has to start early in the morning and it gets quite late in the evening by the time she returns home. She says that as such she does not find time to spend with her friends and has suggested that there should be a school nearby. But, my countrymen, I liked this initiative taken by a newspaper that helped these letters reach me and I got an opportunity to go through these. This was a very good experience for me. 

My dear countrymen, today is 26/11. The 26th of November is our Constitution Day. The Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on this day in the year nineteen forty-nine. Our constitution was implemented on the 26th of January, 1950 which we celebrate as our Republic Day. The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy. This is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly. They all worked hard for about three years to draft the Constitution. And, whoever reads that debate will feel proud about what actually the vision of a life dedicated to the nation is. Can you imagine how hard their task would have been to frame the Constitution of our country which has such big diversities? They must have shown a great sense of understanding and farsightedness and that too at a juncture when the country was getting rid of the bondage of slavery. Now, this is the responsibility of all of us to make a New India in the light of the thinking of the makers of our Constitution. Our Constitution is all encompassing. There probably is no area, no aspect of nature which remained untouched. 

Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the unique characteristic of our Constitution. It guarantees fundamental rights to each & every citizen, whether underprivileged or oppressed, backward or deprived, a tribal or a woman. It protects their fundamental rights and safeguards their interests. It is our duty that we abide by our Constitution in letter and spirit. Citizens and administrators alike must move ahead in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution. The message that our Constitution conveys is that no one should be harmed in any way. It is but natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today. Seventeen separate committees were constituted by the Constituent Assembly on various important issues. One of most significant of these was the drafting committee and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this drafting committee. He was playing a pivotal role in it. The Constitution of India, which we feel so very proud of, bears an indelible stamp of his able leadership. He ensured the welfare of every section of society. We remember him and bow before him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas on 6th of December. Babasaheb’s contribution in making the country prosperous and strong can never be forgotten. 15th of December is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Sardar Patel rose from being a farmer’s son to be known as the Iron Man of the country, undertaking the extraordinary task of uniting India into one nation. Sardar Saheb was also a member of the constituent Assembly. He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on fundamental rights, minorities and tribals. 

26/11 is our Constitution Day but how can the nation forget that on this very day nine years ago, terrorists had launched an attack on Mumbai. The country remembers and bows to those brave citizens, policemen, security men and each one who lost their lives then. This country can never forget their sacrifice. Terrorism has taken an ugly shape and has become a global threat almost as a daily routine. We, in India, are facing to lot for the last 40 years on account of terrorism. Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives. But, a few years ago, when India used to talk about the severe threats of terrorism many people in the world were not ready to take it seriously, Now that, terrorism is knocking at their doors, every Government in the world, those who believe in humanity, Governments having faith in democracy are seeing this as one of the biggest challenges. Terrorism has threatened humanity across the globe. Terrorism has challenged humanity. It is bent upon destroying the humanitarian forces. So, not only India but all humanitarian forces will have to keep fighting unitedly to defeat the menace of terrorism. Lord Budha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi – this is the land which gave the message of love and non-violence to the world. 

Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social fabric. That is why, the need of the hour is that humanitarian forces should become more alert and cautious. 

My dear countrymen, we shall observe Navy Day on the 4th of December. Indian Navy secures and protects our maritime boundaries. I congratulate all those who belong to the Navy. All of you must be knowing that our civilization developed along river banks. Be it the Indus, the Ganges, the Yamuna or the Saraswati – our rivers and seas are both economically and strategically important. These are our gateway to the whole world. This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with oceans. And as we peep into our history, we come to know that about 800 to 900 (eight to nine hundred) years ago, during the rule of the Cholas, the Chola Navy was considered one of the strongest navies. This navy had a big role in the expansion of the Chola-rule and in making it an economic super power. Numerous references of voyages and expeditions of the Chola-Navy are found even today in “Sangam - literature”. Very few people might be aware that most navies of the world allowed women on their warships pretty later. But in the Chola Navy, a large number of women played leading roles and that too about eight to nine hundred years ago; to the extent that women actively took part in battles. The Chola rulers possessed a very rich and sound knowledge of ship building. When we talk of navy, who can ignore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the capabilities & might of his navy. Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharaj’s realm. Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea. The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy. There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy. His naval forces were very efficient and skilled in attacking the enemy and in defending their attacks. And how can we refer to the Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Aangre! He took the Maratha Navy to newer heights and established Maratha Naval Bases at a number of places. After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions; be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war. When we talk of the Navy, we see only war but the Indian Navy has come forward in humanitarian ventures as well. In June this year when Cyclone Mora hit Bangladesh and Myanmar, our naval ship INS SUMITRA rendered a big help in rescue operations; many fishermen were rescued from the sea and handed over to Bangladesh. 

In May-June this year when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there. In September, during the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS GHADIYAL delivered humanitarian assistance there. The Government of Papua New Guinea sent an SOS-message to us in June and our navy rendered help in saving the fishermen of a fishing boat. On 21st November, during an incident of piracy in a merchant vessel in the Western Gulf, our naval ship INS TRIKAND reached there to help them. Carrying medical services to FIJI, sending urgent relief, or delivering humanitarian aid during crisis to a neighbouring country – our navy has always rendered glorious service. We Indians, always nurture a feeling of pride and respect towards our security forces- be it the army, the navy or the air force and every countryman salutes the courage, bravery, valour, chivalry and sacrifice of our soldiers. They sacrifice their youth for the country so that 125 crore countrymen may live in peace. We observe ARMED FORCES FLAG DAY every year on 7th December. This is a day to feel proud of and show respect to our country’s armed forces. 

I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from December 1 to December 7 during which they will reach out to the people of the country to disseminate information about our ARMED FORCES and to make them aware. Throughout the week every one, old or young, should wear the flag. A movement to instill respect for our forces will come into being in the country. We can distribute ARMED FORCES FLAGS on this occasion. Experiences and acts of valour of those from the armed forces who are our neighbours or acquaintances and related videos and pictures can be posted on hash-tag armed forces flag day (#armedforcesflagday). People from the forces could be invited to schools and colleges to share information about the forces. Our new generation can get a good opportunity to get information about the forces. This is also an occasion to collect funds for the welfare of the jawans of our armed forces. This amount is spent through the Sainik Kalyan Board on the dependents of those who lost their lives and also for those who got injured during wars, for their rehabilitation. More information about sending in monetary contributions can be had on ksb.gov.in. You can also make cashless payment for this. Come, let us do something on this occasion which may raise the morale of our armed forces. We should also contribute towards their welfare. 

My dear countrymen, World Soil Day is on the 5th of December. I want to tell something to my farmer brothers and sisters. An important component of the Earth is “soil”. Whatever we eat is linked only to this soil. In a way, the complete food chain is connected to soil. Just imagine, what will happen if there is no fertile soil in the world? The very thought is dreadful. There will be no soil, no plants and trees will grow; how will human life be possible? How will animals and birds survive? This concern was touched upon a long time ago in our culture and that is why we are aware of the significance of soil since ancient times. In our culture, there has been efforts to foster a feeling of devotion and gratitude towards our farms, our soil among the people and at the same time scientific farming methods and techniques have been adopted which provide nutrients to the soil. In the life of the farmer of this country both aspects have been important- reverence to his soil and preserving & nurturing it scientifically. We all feel proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are rooted to traditions and also take interest in modern science, they keep trying and resolve. I had heard about the farmers, of Tohoo village in Bhoranj block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh. 

Farmers here were earlier using chemical fertilizers indiscriminately which deteriorated the soil-health. Produce reduced which resulted in lower income and gradually the productivity of the soil also was going down. Some enlightened and alert farmers in the village noticed and understood the gravity of the situation, and after that got their soil tested on time and followed the advice about the quantity of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers to be used. And, you will be surprised to know about the results achieved after the farmers received the information and guidelines about soil health. In the Rabi season of 2016-17, wheat production per acre increased three to four times and their income also increased by four to six thousand rupees per acre. Besides, the soil quality also improved. Cut in fertilizer usage resulted in monetary saving. I am very glad to see that my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions made in the soil health card and as better results are showing, they are getting more and more inspired. And, now the farmer also realizes that proper soil care is needed if production is to be increased and that if we take care of our soil, it will also care for all of us. 

Our farmers across the country have got more than 10 crore soil health cards made so that they may understand their soil better and accordingly sow the crop. 

We worship mother Earth but have we ever thought as to how much damage is caused to the health of our mother- Earth because of the usage of fertilizers like Urea? This has been proved by all scientific methods that a serious damage is caused because of an excessive use of urea. The Farmer is the son of the soil, how can a farmer see the mother Earth falling sick? The need of the hour is to revive the mother-son relationship. Can our farmers, the sons of our soil make a resolve that by the year 2022, when we complete 75 year of our independence, they will cut down the urea usage to half of what is being used presently? If this son of the soil, my farmer brother once make this resolve then we will see the health of mother Earth improve and production will increase. A transformation shall start to usher into the life of the farmer. 

All of us are experiencing Global warming, climate change now. There was a time when winter would set in even before Diwali. And now, December is knocking on our doors, yet winter is advancing at a leisurely pace. But the moment winter sets in, we all have experienced that we don’t like coming out of our quilts one bit. Despite such inclement weather there are some extraordinarily aware people who deliver results that are exemplary and inspiring for all of us. You will be amazed to learn that Tushar, an eight year old differently - abled, divyang lad from Madhya Pradesh had taken a firm resolve to make his village Open defecation free. It was a young boy vis-à-vis an enormous task at hand. But his grit and determination were exponentially greater and mightier. The eight year old is speech impaired, but he used a whistle as an armament. He would wake up at 5 in the morning, visit households one by one, awaken them and used gesticulations to wean them away from Open defecation. Covering 30 to 40 homes everyday, spreading the message of cleanliness, this boy transformed the village into Open defecation free. Promoting the virtues of cleanliness, this little lad has done inspiring work. This proves that cleanliness suffers from no barriers of age; there are no boundaries. A child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, everyone needs cleanliness. And everyone should contribute towards the cause of cleanliness. Our Divyang brothers and sisters are firm in their resolve; they are competent, capable, courageous and determined. 

We get to learn something or the other every moment. They are performing well in every walk of life. Whether it be the field of sports, any kind of competition or a social initiative, our Divyang brethren are second to none. You must be aware that our Divyang sportspersons won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics through their stellar performances. They also emerged champions in the T-20 Cricket World Cup for the Visually Challenged. Myriad competitions take place all over the country. Recently, the 17th National Para-Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur. Divyang brothers & sisters from different parts of the country participated & displayed their stellar skills. One of them happens to be 19 year old Jigar Thakkar from Gujarat, whose body suffers from 80% muscle atrophy. 

Just look at his fortitude, resolve & perseverance. Despite his 80% muscle atrophy, the 19 year old Jigar Thakkar won 11 medals in the National Para Swimming Competition. It is on account of this feat that he has been chosen as one of the 32 Para Swimmers for the 20-20 Paralympics by the Sports Authority of India. They will be imparted training at the Centre for excellence at Gandhinagar in Gujarat. I salute the spirit of the young Jigar Thakkar & wish him the best. These days special emphasis is being laid on accessibilities & opportunities for persons with disabilities, our Divyang brethren. Our endeavour is to ensure that each & every person in the country is empowered. Let the essence of ‘Sama’ & ‘Mama’, that is a confluence of collective & the individual, foster a sense of syncretic harmony in our society; let us move forward with each other, together. 

A few days from now, the pious occasion of Id-e-milad-un-nabi will be observed. Paighambar Hazrat Mohammad Sahab was born on this day. I extend best wishes to all countrymen. And I hope that this holy occasion of Id gives us new inspiration, fresh energy and the strength to resolve anew, to foster peace & communal amity. 

(Phone call) 

'Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh calling from Kanpur. I request you that out of the entire gamut of your thoughts reflected during the programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ throughout the year, if you could share ten of your best thoughts, so that we all remember these opinions and we get to learn something from them. Thank you 

(End of phone call) 

You are quite right that 2017 is near completion, and the year 2018 is knocking on the door. And you have given some sound advice. But continuing from your point of view I feel like adding something more to it and modifying it a bit. And as in our villages, our elders, the old people of the village are always reminding us - forget the sorrow but also do not forget the joy. You too forget your sorrow and also do not forget the joy. I think we should propagate this wisdom. We must usher in the auspicious in 2018, enter the New Year with the resolution of the auspicious 

We know that in our part of the world, and probably all around the world around the ending of the year we take a stock, contemplate, and draw plans for the next year. In our media many interesting events of the year gone by are broadcast again to reflect on the previous year. The previous year is both a mixture of both positive and negative memories. But don’t you think that we should enter into the year 2018, remembering the positive events, to do some good? 

I suggest to all of you that of all the 5-10 positive things that you might have heard, seen or would have had experienced were to be disseminated, so that other people would get to know of them and this would lead to a spirit of benevolence. Can we not contribute in this endeavour? Can’t we share 5 of our positive life experiences of the past year? Whether they be conveyed through photographs, in the form of a small story, or as a small video, I invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a benefic atmosphere, with positive memories, with positive thinking and with positive tidings. 

Come, let us share our positive experiences with #PositiveIndia (Hashtag Positive India) on the Narendra Modi App or MyGov portal. Remember to recollect the incidents that inspire others. If you remember positive events, then you will be in a mood to do good around you. Positive events provide energy to do good. Positive thoughts beget positive resolve, positive resolve takes you forward towards auspicious results. 

Let all of us together witness the strength of this collective momentum and its impact. And I will definitely share the positive thoughts that arrive on #positiveindia (hashtag positive India) with the rest of our denizens in the next episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ 

My dear countrymen, I will be back amidst you next month, with another episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ We will have another opportunity to talk a lot. Many - Many thanks!

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार। कुछ समय पहले, मुझे कर्नाटक के बालमित्रों के साथ परोक्ष संवाद का अवसर मिला। Times Group के ‘विजय कर्नाटका’ अख़बार ने बाल दिवस पर एक पहल की, जिसमें उन्होंने बच्चों से आग्रह किया कि वे देश के प्रधानमंत्री को पत्र लिखें। और फिर उन्होंने उसमें से कुछ selected पत्रों को छापा। मैंने उन पत्रों को पढ़ा, मुझे काफ़ी अच्छा लगा। ये नन्हें-मुन्हें बालक भी, देश की समस्याओं से परिचित हैं, देश में चल रही चर्चाओं से भी परिचित हैं। कई विषयों पर इन बच्चों ने लिखा। उत्तर कन्नड़ की, कीर्ति हेगड़े ने, Digital India और Smart City योजना की सराहना करते हुए उन्होंने सुझाव दिया कि हमें अपनी शिक्षा-व्यवस्था में बदलाव की ज़रूरत है और उन्होंने ये भी कहा कि आजकल बच्चे classroom reading करना पसंद नहीं करते, उन्हें प्रकृति के बारे में जानना अच्छा लगता है। और अगर, हम बच्चों को प्रकृति की जानकारियाँ देंगे तो शायद पर्यावरण की रक्षा में, वो आगे चल करके काम आ सकते हैं। 

लक्ष्मेश्वरा से रीडा नदाफ़, उस बच्चे ने लिखा है कि वो एक फौज़ी की बेटी है और उन्हें इस बात का गर्व है। कौन हिन्दुस्तानी होगा जिसको फौज़ी पर गर्व न हो! और आप तो फौज़ी की बेटी हो, आपको गर्व होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है। कलबुर्गी से इरफ़ाना बेग़म, उन्होंने लिखा है कि उनका स्कूल उनके गाँव से 5 किलोमीटर की दूरी पर स्थित है, जिसकी वजह से उन्हें घर से जल्दी निकलना पड़ता है और घर वापस आने में भी बहुत देर रात हो जाती है। और, उसमें उन्होंने कहा कि मैं अपने दोस्तों के साथ समय भी नहीं बिता पाती हूँ। और उन्होंने सुझाव दिया है कि नज़दीक में कोई स्कूल होना चाहिए। लेकिन देशवासियो, मुझे अच्छा लगा कि एक अख़बार ने initiative लिया और मुझ तक ये पत्र पहुँचे और मुझे उन पत्रों को पढ़ने का अवसर मिला। मेरे लिए भी ये एक अच्छा अनुभव था। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आज 26/11 है। 26 नवम्बर, ये हमारा संविधान दिवस है। उन्नीस सौ उनचास में,1949 में आज ही के दिन, संविधान-सभा ने भारत के संविधान को स्वीकार किया था। 26 जनवरी 1950 को, संविधान लागू हुआ और इसलिए तो हम, उसको गणतंत्र दिवस के रूप में मनाते हैं। भारत का संविधान, हमारे लोकतंत्र की आत्मा है। आज का दिन, संविधान-सभा के सदस्यों के स्मरण करने का दिन है। उन्होंने भारत का संविधान बनाने के लिए लगभग तीन वर्षों तक परिश्रम किया। और जो भी उस debate को पढ़ता है, हमें गर्व होता है कि राष्ट्र को समर्पित जीवन की सोच क्या होती है! क्या आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं कि विविधताओं से भरे अपने देश का संविधान बनाने के लिए उन्होंने कितना कठोर परिश्रम किया होगा? सूझ-बू, दूर-दर्शिता के दर्शन कराए होंगे और वो भी उस समय, जब देश ग़ुलामी की जंज़ीरों से मुक्त हो रहा था। इसी संविधान के प्रकाश में संविधान-निर्माताओं , उन महापुरुषों के विचारों के प्रकाश में नया भारत बनाना,ये हम सब का दायित्व है। हमारा संविधान बहुत व्यापक है। शायद जीवन का कोई ऐसा क्षेत्र नहीं है, प्रकृति का कोई ऐसा विषय नहीं है जो उससे अछूता रह गया हो। सभी के लिए समानता और सभी के प्रति संवेदनशीलता, हमारे संविधान की पहचान है। यह हर नागरिक, ग़रीब हो या दलित, पिछड़ा हो या वंचित, आदिवासी, महिला सभी के मूलभूत अधिकारों की रक्षा करता है और उनके हितों को सुरक्षित रखता है। हमारा कर्तव्य है कि हम संविधान का अक्षरशः पालन करें। नागरिक हों या प्रशासक,संविधान की भावना के अनुरूप आगे बढ़ें। किसी को किसी भी तरह से क्षति ना पहुँचे - यही तो संविधान का संदेश है। आज, संविधान-दिवस के अवसर पर डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर की याद आना तो बहुत स्वाभाविक है। इस संविधान-सभा में महत्वपूर्ण विषयों पर 17 अलग-अलग समितियों का गठन हुआ था। इनमें से सर्वाधिक महत्वपूर्ण समितियों में से एक, drafting committee थी। और डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर, संविधान की उस drafting committee के अध्यक्ष थे। एक बहुत बड़ी महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका का वो निर्वाह कर रहे थे। आज हम भारत के जिस संविधान पर गौरव का अनुभव करते हैं, उसके निर्माण में बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर के कुशल नेतृत्व की अमिट छाप है। उन्होंने ये सुनिश्चित किया कि समाज के हर तबके का कल्याण हो। 6 दिसम्बर को उनके महापरिनिर्वाण दिवस के अवसर पर, हम हमेशा की तरह उन्हें स्मरण और नमन करते हैं। देश को समृद्ध और शक्तिशाली बनाने में बाबासाहेब का योगदान अविस्मरणीय है। 15 दिसम्बर को सरदार वल्लभभाई पटेल की पुण्यतिथि है। किसान-पुत्र से देश के लौह-पुरुष बने सरदार पटेल ने, देश को एक सूत्र में बाँधने का बहुत असाधारण कार्य किया था। सरदार साहब भी संविधान सभा के सदस्य रहे थे। वे मूलभूत अधिकारों, fundamental rights, अल्प-संख्यकों और आदिवासियों पर बनी advisory committee के भी अध्यक्ष थे। 

26/11 हमारा संविधान-दिवस है लेकिन ये देश कैसे भूल सकता हैं कि नौ साल पहले 26/11 को, आतंकवादियों ने मुंबई पर हमला बोल दिया था। देश उन बहादुर नागरिकों, पुलिसकर्मी, सुरक्षाकर्मी, उन हर किसी का स्मरण करता है, उनको नमन करता है जिन्होंने अपनी जान गंवाई। यह देश कभी उनके बलिदान को नहीं भूल सकता। आतंकवाद आज विश्व के हर भू-भाग में और एक प्रकार से प्रतिदिन होने वाली घटना का, एक अति-भयंकर रूप बन गई है। हम, भारत में तो गत 40 वर्ष से आतंकवाद के कारण बहुत कुछ झेल रहे हैं। हज़ारों हमारे निर्दोष लोगों ने अपनी जान गंवाई है। लेकिन कुछ वर्ष पहले, भारत जब दुनिया के सामने आतंकवाद की चर्चा करता था, आतंकवाद से भयंकर संकट की चर्चा करता था तो दुनिया के बहुत लोग थे, जो इसको गंभीरता से लेने के लिए तैयार नहीं थे। लेकिन जब आज, आतंकवाद उनके अपने दरवाज़ों पर दस्तक दे रहा है तब, दुनिया की हर सरकार, मानवतावाद में विश्वास करने वाले, लोकतंत्र में भरोसा करने वाली सरकारें, आतंकवाद को एक बहुत बड़ी चुनौती के रूप में देख रहे हैं। आतंकवाद ने विश्व की मानवता को ललकारा है। आतंकवाद ने मानवतावाद को चुनौती दी है। वो मानवीय शक्तियों को नष्ट करने पर तुला हुआ है। और इसलिए, सिर्फ़ भारत ही नहीं, विश्व की सभी मानवतावादी शक्तियों को एकजुट होकर, आतंकवाद को पराजित करके ही रहना होगा। भगवान बुद्ध, भगवान महावीर, गुरु नानक, महात्मा गांधी, ये ही तो ये धरती है जिसने अहिंसा और प्रेम का संदेश दुनिया को दिया है। आतंकवाद और उग्रवाद, हमारी सामाजिक संरचना को कमज़ोर कर, उन्हें छिन्न-भिन्न करने का नापाक प्रयास करते हैं। और इसलिए, मानवतावादी शक्तियों का अधिक जागरूक होना समय की मांग है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, 4 दिसम्बर को हम सब Navy Day, नौ-सेना दिवस मनाएंगें। भारतीय नौ-सेना, हमारे समुद्र-तटों की रक्षा और सुरक्षा प्रदान करती है। मैं, नौ-सेना से जुड़े सभी लोगों का अभिनंदन करता हूँ। आप जानते ही होंगे कि हमारी सभ्यता का विकास नदियों के किनारे हुआ है। चाहे वो सिन्धु हो, गंगा हो, यमुना हो, सरस्वती हो - हमारी नदियाँ और समुद्र, आर्थिक और सामरिक strategic, दोनों purpose के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं। ये पूरे विश्व के लिए हमारा gateway है। इस देश का, हमारी इस भूमि का महासागरों के साथ अटूट संबंध रहा है। और जब हम, इतिहास की ओर नज़र करते हैं तो 800-900 साल पहले चोल-वंश के समय, चोल-नेवी (Chola Navy) को सबसे शक्तिशाली नौ-सेनाओं में से एक माना जाता था। चोल-साम्राज्य के विस्तार में, उसे अपने समय का economic super power बनाने में उनकी नेवी का बहुत बड़ा हिस्सा था। चोल-नेवी की मुहीम, खोज-यात्राओं के ढ़ेरों उदाहरण, संगम-साहित्य में आज भी उपलब्ध हैं। बहुत कम लोगों को पता होगा कि विश्व में ज़्यादातर नौ-सेनाओं ने बहुत देर के बाद युद्ध-पोतों पर महिलाओं को allow किया था। लेकिन चोल-नेवी में और वो भी 800-900 साल पहले, बहुत बड़ी संख्या में महिलाओं ने प्रमुख भूमिका निभाई थी। और यहाँ तक कि महिलाएँ, लड़ाई में भी शामिल होती थीं। चोल-शासकों के पास ship building, जहाजों के निर्माण के बारे में बहुत ही समृद्ध ज्ञान था। जब हम नौ-सेना की बात करते हैं तो छत्रपति शिवाजी महाराज और नौ-सेना के उनके सामर्थ्य को कौन भूल सकता है! कोंकण तट-क्षेत्र, जहाँ समुद्र की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका है, शिवाजी महाराज के राज्य के अंतर्गत आता था। शिवाजी महाराज से जुड़े कई क़िले जैसे सिंधु दुर्ग, मुरुड जंजिरा,स्वर्ण दुर्ग आदि या तो समुद्र तटों पर स्थित थे या तो समुद्र से घिरे हुए थे। इन क़िलों के सुरक्षा की ज़िम्मेदारी मराठा नौ-सेना करती थी। मराठा Navy में बड़े-बड़े जहाज़ों और छोटी-छोटी नौकाओं का combination था। उनके नौसैनिक किसी भी दुश्मन पर हमला करने और उनसे बचाव करने में अत्यंत कुशल थे। और हम मराठा नेवी की चर्चा करें और कान्होजी आंग्रे को याद न करें, ये कैसे हो सकता है! उन्होंने मराठा नौ-सेना को एक नए स्तर पर पहुँचाया और कई स्थानों पर मराठा नौ-सैनिकों के अड्डे स्थापित किए। स्वतंत्रता के बाद हमारी भारतीय नौ-सेना ने विभिन्न अवसरों पर अपना पराक्रम दिखाया - चाहे वो गोवा के मुक्ति-संग्राम हो या 1971 का भारत-पाक युद्ध हो। जब हम नौ-सेना की बात करते हैं तो सिर्फ हमें युद्ध ही नज़र आता है लेकिन भारत की नौ-सेना, मानवता के काम में भी उतनी ही बढ़-चढ़ कर के आगे आई है। इस वर्ष जून महीने में बांग्लादेश और म्यांमार में Cyclone Mora का संकट आया था, तब हमारी नौ-सेना की Ship, INS Sumitra ने तत्काल rescue के लिए मदद की थी और कई मछुआरों को पानी से बाहर सुरक्षित बचाकर बांग्‍लादेश को सौंपा था। इस वर्ष मई-जून में जब श्रीलंका में बाढ़ का भयंकर संकट आया था तब हमारी नौ-सेना के तीन जहाज़ों ने तत्काल ही वहाँ पहुँच करके वहाँ की सरकार और वहाँ की जनता को मदद पहुंचाई थी। बांग्लादेश में सितम्बर महीने में रोहिंग्या के मामले में हमारी नौ-सेना की Ship, Ins Ghadiyal (घड़ियाल) ने मानवीय सहायता पहुंचाई थी। जून महीने में Papua New Guinea (पापुआ न्यू गिनी) की सरकार ने हमें SoS सन्देश दिया था और उनके fishing boat के मछुआरों को बचाने में हमारी नौ-सेना ने सहायता की थी। 21 नवंबर को पश्चिम Gulf में एक merchant vessel में Piracy की घटना में भी, हमारा नौ-सेना जहाज़ INS Trikand (त्रिकंड) सहायता के लिए पहुँच गया था। Fiji तक आरोग्य सेवाएँ पहुंचानी हो, तत्काल राहत पहुँचानी हो, पड़ोसी देश को संकट के समय मानवीय मदद पहुंचानी हो, हमारी नौ-सेना हमेशा गौरवपूर्ण कार्य करती रही है। हम भारतवासी, हमारे सुरक्षा-बलों के प्रति हमेशा गौरव और आदर का भाव रखते हैं - चाहे वो Army हो, Navy हो, Air Force हो, हमारे जवानों का साहस, वीरता, शौर्य, पराक्रम, बलिदान हर देशवासी उनको सलाम करता है। सौ करोड़ देशवासी सुख-चैन की ज़िन्दगी जी सकें इसलिए वो अपनी जवानी, देश के लिए क़ुर्बान कर देता है। हर वर्ष 7 दिसम्बर को Armed Forces Flag Day मनाता है। यह देश के Armed Forces के प्रति गर्व करने और सम्मान प्रकट करने का दिन है। मुझे खुशी है, इस बार रक्षा-मंत्रालय ने 1 से 7 दिसम्बर तक अभियान चलाने का निर्णय किया है - देश के नागरिकों के पास पहुँच करके Armed Forces के संबंध में लोगों को जानकारी देना, लोगों को जागरूक करना। पूरे सप्ताह-भर बच्चे-बड़े, हर कोई flag लगाएं। देश में सेना के प्रति सम्मान का एक आंदोलन खड़ा हो जाए। इस अवसर पर हम Armed Forces Flags distribute कर सकते हैं। अपने आस-पास में, अपनी जान-पहचान में जो Armed Forces से जुड़े हैं, उनके experiences को, उनके courageous act को, उससे जुड़े videos और pictures, #armedforcesflagday (hashtag Armed Forces Flag Day) पर post कर सकते हैं। स्कूलों में, कॉलेज में, फ़ौज के लोगों को बुला करके, उनसे फ़ौज के विषय में जानकारियाँ ले सकते हैं। हमारी नई पीढ़ी को फ़ौज के संबंध में जानकारियाँ पाने का एक अच्छा अवसर बन सकता है। यह अवसर हमारे Armed Forces के सभी जवानों के कल्याण के लिए धनराशि संग्रह करने का होता है। यह राशि, सैनिक कल्याण बोर्ड के माध्यम से युद्ध में शहीद हुए सैनिकों के परिवारजनों को, घायल सैनिकों के कल्याण के लिए उनके पुनर्वास पर खर्च की जाती है। आर्थिक योगदान देने के लिए आप विभिन्न भुगतान के बारे में जानकारी ksb.gov.in से ले सकते हैं। आप इसके लिए cashless पेमेंट भी कर सकते हैं। आइए, इस अवसर पर हम भी कुछ ऐसा करें, जिससे हमारे सशस्त्र बलों का मनोबल बढ़े। हम भी उनके कल्याण की दिशा में अपना योगदान दें। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, 5 दिसम्बर को ‘World Soil Day’ है। मैं अपने किसान भाई-बहनों से भी कुछ बाते करना चाहता हूँ। पृथ्वी का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा है- मिट्टी। हम जो कुछ भी खाते हैं वो इस मिट्टी से ही तो जुड़ा हुआ है। एक तरह से पूरा food chain, मिट्टी soil से जुड़ा हुआ है। ज़रा कल्पना कीजिए , अगर इस विश्व में कही भी उपजाऊ मिट्टी न हो तो क्या होगा? सोचकर के भी डर लगता है। न मिट्टी होगी, न पेड़-पौधें उगेंगे, मानव-जीवन कहाँ संभव होगा? जीव-जंतु कहाँ संभव होगा? हमारी संस्कृति में इस पर बहुत पहले चिंता कर ली गई और यही कारण है कि हम मिट्टी के महत्व को लेकर, प्राचीन समय से जागरुक रहे हैं। हमारी संस्कृति में एक ओर खेतों के प्रति, मिट्टी के प्रति, भक्ति और आभार-भाव, लोगों में बना रहे ऐसा सहज प्रयास है तो दूसरी ओर ऐसी वैज्ञानिक पद्दतियाँ, जीवन का हिस्सा रहीं कि इस मिट्टी का पोषण होता रहा। इस देश के किसान के जीवन में, दोनों ही बातों का महत्व रहा है - अपनी मिट्टी के प्रति भक्ति और साथ-साथ वैज्ञानिक-रूप से मिट्टी को सहेजना – संवारना। हम सबको इस बात का गर्व है कि हमारे देश के किसान, परंपरा से भी जुड़े रहते हैं और आधुनिक विज्ञान की तरफ भी रूचि रखते हैं, प्रयास करते हैं, संकल्प करते हैं। मैं हिमाचल प्रदेश के हमीरपुर ज़िले के टोहू गाँव, भोरंज ब्लॉक और वहां के किसानों के बारे में मैंने सुना था। यहाँ किसान पहले असंतुलित ढंग से रासायनिक उर्वरकों, fertilizer का उपयोग कर रहे थे और जिसके कारण उस धरती की सेहत बिगड़ती गई। उपज कम होती गई और उपज कम होने से आय भी कम हो गई और मिट्टी की भी उत्पादकता धीरे-धीरे-धीरे घटती जा रही थी। गाँव के कुछ जागरुक किसानों ने इस परिस्थिति की गंभीरता को समझा और इसके बाद गाँव के किसानो ने समय पर अपनी मिट्टी की जाँच करायी और जितने fertilizer, उर्वरकों, micro-nutrient और जैविक खाद का उपयोग करने के लिए उन्हें कहा गया, उन्होंने उस advice को माना, उस सलाह को माना। और आप यह परिणाम सुनकर के चौंक जाएँगे कि soil health के द्वारा किसानों को जो जानकारी मिली और उससे उनको को मार्गदर्शन मिला,उसको लागू करने का परिणाम क्या आया? रबी 2016-17 में गेंहू के उत्पादन में प्रति एकड़ तीन से चार गुना की वृद्धि हुई और आय में भी प्रति एकड़ चार हज़ार से लेकर के छह(6) हज़ार रूपये तक की वृद्धि हुई। इसके साथ-साथ मिट्टी की quality में भी सुधार आया। fertilizer का उपयोग कम होने के कारण आर्थिक बचत भी हुई। मुझे यह देख कर काफी ख़ुशी है कि मेरे किसान भाई soil health card, मृदा–स्वास्थ्य कार्ड में दी गई सलाह पर अमल करने के लिए आगे आए हैं और जैसे-जैसे परिणाम मिल रहे हैं, उनका उत्साह भी बढ़ता जा रहा है। और अब किसान को भी लग रहा है कि अगर फसल की चिंता करनी है तो पहले धरती-माँ का ख्याल रखना होगा और अगर धरती-माँ का ख्याल हम रखेंगे तो धरती-माँ, हम सब का ख्याल रखेंगी। देश-भर में हमारे किसानों ने 10 करोड़ से अधिक soil health card बनवा लिए हैं ताकि वे अपनी मिट्टी को बेहतर ढंग से समझ सकें और उस अनुरुप, फसल भी बो सकें। हम धरती-माता की भक्ति करते हैं पर धरती-माता को यूरिया जैसे उर्वरक fertiliser से धरती-माँ के स्वास्थ्य को कितनी हानि होती है, कभी सोचा है? हर प्रकार के वैज्ञानिक तरीक़ों से यह सिद्ध हो चुका है कि धरती-माँ को आवश्यकता से अधिक यूरिया के उपयोग से गंभीर नुक़सान पहुँचता है। किसान तो धरती का पुत्र है, किसान धरती-माँ को बीमार कैसे देख सकता है? समय की माँग है, इस माँ-बेटे के संबंधों को फिर से एक बार जागृत करने की। क्या हमारे किसान, हमारे धरती के पुत्र, हमारे धरती के संतान ये संकल्प कर सकते हैं क्या कि आज वो अपने खेत में जितना यूरिया का उपयोग करता है, 2022, जब आज़ादी के 75 साल होंगे, आधा उपयोग बंद कर देगा ? एक बार अगर माँ-धरती का पुत्र, मेरा किसान भाई, ये संकल्प कर ले तो देखिए कि धरती-माँ की सेहत सुधर जाएगी, उत्पादन बढ़ जाएगा। किसान की ज़िन्दगी में बदलाव आना शुरू हो जाएगा। 

Global warming, Climate change अब हम सब लोग अनुभव करने लगे हैं। वो भी एक वक़्त था कि दीवाली के पहले सर्दी आ जाती थी। अब दिसम्बर दस्तक दे रहा है और सर्दी बहुत धीरे-धीरे-धीरे कदम बढ़ा रही है। लेकिन जैसे ही सर्दी शुरू हो जाती है, हम सब का अनुभव है कि रज़ाई से बाहर निकलना ज़रा अच्छा नहीं लगता है। लेकिन, ऐसे मौसम में भी सतत-जागरूक रहने वाले लोग कैसा परिणाम लाते हैं और ये उदाहरण हम सब के लिए प्रेरणा देते हैं। आपको भी सुन करके आश्चर्य होगा कि मध्यप्रदेश के एक 8 वर्षीय दिव्यांग बालक तुषार, उसने अपने गाँव को खुले में शौच से मुक्त कराने का बीड़ा उठा लिया। इतने व्यापक स्तर का काम और इतना छोटा बालक! लेकिन जज़्बा और संकल्प, उससे कई गुना बड़े थे, बृहत् थे और ताक़तवर थे। 8 वर्षीय बालक बोल नहीं सकता लेकिन उसने सीटी को अपना हथियार बनाया और सुबह 5 बजे उठ कर, अपने गाँव में घर-घर जा कर लोगों को सीटी से जगा करके, हाथ के action से खुले में शौच न करने के लिए शिक्षा देने लगा। हर दिन 30-40 घरों में जा करके स्वच्छता की सीख देने वाले इस बालक की बदौलत कुम्हारी गाँव, खुले में शौच से मुक्त हो गया। स्वच्छता को बढ़ावा देने की दिशा में उस नन्हे बालक तुषार ने प्रेरक काम किया। ये दिखाता है कि स्वच्छता की न कोई उम्र होती है, न कोई सीमा। बच्चा हो या बुज़ुर्ग, महिला हो या पुरुष, स्वच्छता सभी के लिए ज़रुरी है और स्वच्छता के लिए हर किसी को कुछ-न-कुछ करने की भी ज़रुरत है। हमारे दिव्यांग भाई-बहन दृढ़-निश्चयी हैं, सामर्थ्यवान हैं ,साहसिक और संकल्पवान हैं। हर पल हमें कुछ-न-कुछ सीखने को मिलता है। आज वे हर-एक क्षेत्र में अच्छा कर रहे हैं। चाहे खेल का क्षेत्र हो, कोई competition का हो, कोई सामाजिक पहल हो- हमारे दिव्यांग-जन भी किसी से पीछे नहीं रहते हैं। आप सब को याद होगा हमारे दिव्यांग खिलाड़ियों ने Rio Olympic में बेहतरीन प्रदर्शन करते हुए 4 पदक जीते थे और Blind T-20 Cricket World Cup में भी champion बने थे। देशभर में अलग-अलग तरह की प्रतियोगिताएँ होती रहती हैं। पिछले दिनों उदयपुर में 17वीं National Para-swimming प्रतियोगिता आयोजित हुई। देशभर के विभिन्न हिस्सों से आए हुए हमारे युवा दिव्यांग भाई-बहनों ने इसमें भाग लिया और अपने कौशल का परिचय दिया। उन्हीं में से एक हैं गुजरात के 19 साल के जिगर ठक्कर, उनके शरीर के 80% हिस्से में मांसपेशी नहीं है लेकिन उनका साहस, संकल्प और उनकी मेहनत को देखिए! National Para-swimming प्रतियोगिता में 19 साल के जिगर ठक्कर जिसके शरीर में 80 % मांसपेशी न हो और 11 Medal जीत जाए! 70वीं National Para-swimming प्रतियोगिता में भी उन्होंने gold जीता। उनके इसी कौशल का परिणाम है कि वो भारत के Sports Authority of India द्वारा 20-20 Paralympics के लिए चुने गए, 32 para तैराकों में से एक हैं जिन्हें गुजरात के गांधी नगर में Center for Excellence में training दी जाएगी। मैं युवा जिगर ठक्कर के जज़्बे को सलाम करता हूँ और उन्हें अपनी शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ। आज दिव्यांगजनों के लिए accessibility और opportunity पर विशेष ध्यान दिया जा रहा है। हमारा प्रयास है कि देश का हर एक व्यक्ति सशक्त हो। एक समावेशी समाज का निर्माण हो। ‘सम’ और ‘मम’ के भाव से समाज में समरसता बढ़े और सब, एक साथ मिल करके आगे बढ़ें।

कुछ दिन बाद ‘ईद-ए-मिलाद-उन-नबी’ का पर्व मनाया जाएगा। इस दिन पैगम्बर हज़रत मोहम्मद साहब का जन्म हुआ था। मैं सभी देशवासियों को हार्दिक शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ और मुझे आशा है कि ईद का ये पर्व, समाज में शांति और सद्भावना को बढ़ाने के लिए हम सबको नयी प्रेरणा दे, नयी ऊर्जा दे, नया संकल्प करने का सामर्थ्य दे। 

(फ़ोन-कॉल) 

‘नमस्ते प्रधानमंत्री जी, मैं कानपुर से नीरजा सिंह बोल रही हूँ। मेरी आपसे एक request है कि इस पूरे साल में जो आपने अपनी ‘मन की बात’ में जो बातें कही हैं, उनमें से जो दस सबसे अच्छी बातें हैं उनको आप हमसे दोबारा share करें। जिससे कि हमसब को पुनः उन बातों का स्मरण हो और हमें कुछ सीखने को मिले। धन्यवाद। 

(फ़ोन-कॉल समाप्त) 

आपकी बात सही है कि 2017 पूर्ण हो रहा है, 2018 दरवाज़े पर दस्तक दे रहा है। लेकिन आपने अच्छा सुझाव दिया है। लेकिन आप ही की बात से मुझे, कुछ और उसमें जोड़ने का और परिवर्तन का मन करता है। और हमारे यहाँ तो गाँव के अंदर जो हमारे वरिष्ठ लोग होते हैं, गाँव के जो बूढ़े लोग होते हैं, बड़े-बूढ़े हमेशा कहा करते हैं- दुख को भूलो और सुख को भूलने मत दो। दुख को भूलें, सुख को भूलने न दें। मुझे लगता है, इस बात को हमे प्रचारित करना चाहिए। हम भी 2018 में शुभ का स्मरण करते हुए, शुभ का संकल्प करते हुए प्रवेश करें। हम जानते हैं कि हमारे यहाँ तो, शायद दुनिया-भर में होता है कि वर्ष के अंत में जब लेखा-जोखा करते हैं, चिंतन-मनन करते हैं, मंथन करते हैं और अगले वर्ष के लिए योजनाएँ बनाते हैं। हमारे यहाँ media में तो, बीते हुए साल की कई रोचक घटनाओं को फिर से एक बार पुनः स्मरण कराने का प्रयास होता है। उसमें positive भी होती हैं, negative भी होती हैं। लेकिन क्या आपको नहीं लगता है कि 2018 में हम प्रवेश, अच्छी चीज़ों को याद करके करें, अच्छा करने के लिए करें? मैं आप सबको एक सुझाव देता हूँ कि आप सब 5-10 अच्छी positive बातें जो आपने सुनी हों, आपने देखी हों, आपने अनुभव की हों और जिसको अगर और लोग जाने तो उनको भी एक शुभ-भाव पैदा हो। क्या आप इसमें योगदान दे सकते हैं? क्या इस बार हम इस वर्ष के अपने जीवन के 5 positive experience share कर सकते हैं? चाहे वो फ़ोटो के माध्यम से हो, छोटी-सी कोई कहानी के रूप में हो, story के रूप में हो, छोटे से video के रूप में हो, मैं निमंत्रित करता हूँ कि 2018 का स्वागत हमें एक शुभ-वातावरण में करना है। शुभ-स्मृतियों के साथ करना है। Positive thinking के साथ करना है। Positive बातों को याद करके करना है। 

आइए, NarendraModi App पर, MyGov पर या social media पर #PositiveIndia (हैशटैग Positive India) के साथ सकारात्मक बातों को share करें। औरों को प्रेरणा देने वाली घटनाओं का स्मरण करें। अच्छी बातों को याद करेंगे तो अच्छा करने का mood बनेगा। अच्छी चीजें, अच्छा करने के लिए ऊर्जा दे देती हैं। शुभ-भाव, शुभ-संकल्प का कारण बनता है। शुभ-संकल्प, शुभ-परिणाम के लिए आगे ले जाता है। 

आइए, इस बार प्रयास करें #PositiveIndia (हैशटैग Positive India) देखिये, हम सब मिलकर के क्या ज़बरदस्त positive vibe generate करके, आने वाले साल का स्वागत करेंगे। इस collective momentum की ताक़त और इसका impact हम सब मिल करके देखेंगे। और मैं जरुर अगले ‘मन की बात’ में आपके इन #PositiveIndia (हैशटैग Positive India) पर आई हुई चीज़ों को देशवासियों के बीच पहुँचाने का प्रयास करूँगा। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, अगले महीने, अगली ‘मन की बात’ के लिए फिर आपके बीच आऊँगा। ढ़ेर सारी बातें करने का अवसर मिलेगा। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Friday reviewed the progress and efforts being made to prevent and reduce under-nutrition and related problems in India. The high level review meeting was attended by officials from PMO, NITI Aayog and other Ministries. 

The current status of malnutrition, stunting and related problems was reviewed. Successful nutrition initiatives in some other developing countries came up for discussion. 

The Prime Minister stressed on the need to work towards concrete objectives to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, low birth weight, and anaemia. He emphasized that visible and measurable results should be seen by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. 

Towards this end, real-time monitoring towards progress of nutrition outcomes was discussed, especially in the worst performing districts. 

Senior officials repeatedly emphasized that initiatives of the Union Government such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Mission Indradhanush, Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao, and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana etc, are having a positive impact on nutrition. In this context, the Prime Minister called for convergence among all schemes of Union and State Governments, which directly or indirectly have an impact on nutrition outcomes. 

He said raising social awareness towards the importance of nutrition is necessary, to achieve the desired results. He stressed on the importance of using informal channels to generate this awareness.

Ministers from India and abroad 
Secretary General of ITU, 
Other distinguished dignitaries 
Delegates from over 120 countries 
Students, 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 

I welcome you to New Delhi, for the Global Conference on Cyber Space. I also welcome all those who are joining this event remotely from across the world, over the internet. 

Friends. 

We all know how cyberspace has transformed the world over the last few decades. The senior generation among the gathering here, would recall the bulky mainframe computer systems of the seventies and eighties. A lot has changed since then. Email and personal computers brought about a new revolution in the nineties. This was followed by the advent of social media, and the mobile phone as an important vehicle of data storage and communication. Expressions such as the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, have now become commonplace. These indicate that change continues, perhaps at an even faster pace now. 

These rapid developments in the digital domain have mirrored immense change in India as well. Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide. Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally. 

Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler. It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance. It is improving access, in domains from education to health. And it is helping to shape the future of business and economy. Through each of these ways, it provides the less privileged sections of society, a more level playing field. On a macro-scale, it has contributed to emergence of a flat world, where a developing nation like India can compete on a level footing with developed nations. 

Friends. 

Technology breaks barriers. We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" - the world is one family. This expression reflects our ancient, inclusive traditions. Through technology, we are able to give meaning to this expression, and indeed to the best of democratic values. 

We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.” Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to. ""Digital India"" is the world's largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services. We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens. 

I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person. We have used this identity to liberate our people from queues and cumbersome processes. Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption. We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity. Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far. 

Let me share a few examples of how digital technology is becoming a great facilitator for ""ease of living."" 

Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button. Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes. 

A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government. As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government. This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money. 

Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life. Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort. 

Women form a significant part of the IT workforce. Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women. In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment. 

Citizens of India are increasingly adopting cashless transactions. For this, we created the Bharat Interface for Money – or BHIM App. This App is helping the movement towards a less cash and corruption free society. 

These examples show the power of technology in improving governance. 

Friends. 

We are using the digital domain to facilitate participative governance, or Jan Bhagidari. When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation. It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights. 

Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov. This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues. In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions. Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov. In fact, even the official app for the Prime Minister's Office, is the result of a competition floated on MyGov, which received brilliant responses from youngsters. MyGov is a prime example of how technology strengthens democracy. 

Let me turn to another example. On assuming office, I realized that important government projects and initiatives often suffer on account of unnecessary silos in government functioning, and the lack of focused decision-making. Therefore, we devised a cyberspace based platform, called PRAGATI or Proactive Governance for Timely Implementation. PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress. 

On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session. Technology breaks silos. Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues. I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation. PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape. 

I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App. This App deepens my connect with citizens. The suggestions I get through the App are very useful. 

Today, we launched the UMANG Mobile App, which will provide over a hundred citizen-centric services. At the back-end, these services will be catered for by many different departments of the Union and State Governments. This integrated approach will add an automatic layer of ""peer performance pressure"", in the working of these departments. 

Friends, 

We shall be happy to share our experiences and success stories with the global community. On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology. We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled. Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries. We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices. We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together. 

Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation. Our startups today, are looking to provide solutions to common everyday problems, and improving the lives of people. I am confident that the global investor community, will recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped from India’s startup pool. I invite you to invest in this space, and be a part of the unfolding story of Indian startups. 

Friends. 

The internet, by nature, is inclusive and not exclusive. It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity. Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers. Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all. News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media. This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world. The internet has become the ideal platform for youngsters to showcase their creativity, capability and capacity - be it an insightful blog, a beautiful musical rendition, artwork, or theatre… the sky is the limit. 

Friends. 

The theme of the Conference: ""Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development"" also highlights the importance of securing this vital asset for mankind. The global community needs to approach the issue of cyber-security with confidence, as much as with resolve. Cyberspace technologies must remain an enabler for our people. 

The quest for an open and accessible internet often leads to vulnerability. Stories of hacking and defacement of websites are the tip of an iceberg. They suggest that cyber attacks are a significant threat, especially in the democratic world. We need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals. Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life. 

One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats. Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks. The term ""hacking"" may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone. We need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth. 

On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization. Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape. 

Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other. Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other. 

Friends. 

Emerging digital technologies could impact our future in ways that we cannot yet foresee. Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed. Digital technology serves to empower mankind. We must ensure that it continues to stay that way. 

The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received. Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework. This will enable a secure cyberspace which improves quality of life. 

Friends. 

This conference is perhaps the biggest ever such event in terms of numbers. I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally. I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience. 

I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes. I once again welcome you, and wish the conference all success. 



Thank you.

                His Excellency Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka 
Ministers from India and abroad 
Secretary General of ITU, 
Other distinguished dignitaries 
Delegates from over 120 countries 
Students, 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 

I welcome you to New Delhi, for the Global Conference on Cyber Space. I also welcome all those who are joining this event remotely from across the world, over the internet. 

Friends. 

We all know how cyberspace has transformed the world over the last few decades. The senior generation among the gathering here, would recall the bulky mainframe computer systems of the seventies and eighties. A lot has changed since then. Email and personal computers brought about a new revolution in the nineties. This was followed by the advent of social media, and the mobile phone as an important vehicle of data storage and communication. Expressions such as the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, have now become commonplace. These indicate that change continues, perhaps at an even faster pace now. 

These rapid developments in the digital domain have mirrored immense change in India as well. Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide. Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally. 

Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler. It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance. It is improving access, in domains from education to health. And it is helping to shape the future of business and economy. Through each of these ways, it provides the less privileged sections of society, a more level playing field. On a macro-scale, it has contributed to emergence of a flat world, where a developing nation like India can compete on a level footing with developed nations. 

Friends. 

Technology breaks barriers. We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" - the world is one family. This expression reflects our ancient, inclusive traditions. Through technology, we are able to give meaning to this expression, and indeed to the best of democratic values. 

We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.” Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to. ""Digital India"" is the world's largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services. We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens. 

I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person. We have used this identity to liberate our people from queues and cumbersome processes. Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption. We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity. Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far. 

Let me share a few examples of how digital technology is becoming a great facilitator for ""ease of living."" 

Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button. Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes. 

A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government. As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government. This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money. 

Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life. Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort. 

Women form a significant part of the IT workforce. Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women. In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment. 

Citizens of India are increasingly adopting cashless transactions. For this, we created the Bharat Interface for Money – or BHIM App. This App is helping the movement towards a less cash and corruption free society. 

These examples show the power of technology in improving governance. 

Friends. 

We are using the digital domain to facilitate participative governance, or Jan Bhagidari. When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation. It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights. 

Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov. This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues. In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions. Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov. In fact, even the official app for the Prime Minister's Office, is the result of a competition floated on MyGov, which received brilliant responses from youngsters. MyGov is a prime example of how technology strengthens democracy. 

Let me turn to another example. On assuming office, I realized that important government projects and initiatives often suffer on account of unnecessary silos in government functioning, and the lack of focused decision-making. Therefore, we devised a cyberspace based platform, called PRAGATI or Proactive Governance for Timely Implementation. PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress. 

On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session. Technology breaks silos. Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues. I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation. PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape. 

I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App. This App deepens my connect with citizens. The suggestions I get through the App are very useful. 

Today, we launched the UMANG Mobile App, which will provide over a hundred citizen-centric services. At the back-end, these services will be catered for by many different departments of the Union and State Governments. This integrated approach will add an automatic layer of ""peer performance pressure"", in the working of these departments. 

Friends, 

We shall be happy to share our experiences and success stories with the global community. On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology. We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled. Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries. We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices. We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together. 

Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation. Our startups today, are looking to provide solutions to common everyday problems, and improving the lives of people. I am confident that the global investor community, will recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped from India’s startup pool. I invite you to invest in this space, and be a part of the unfolding story of Indian startups. 

Friends. 

The internet, by nature, is inclusive and not exclusive. It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity. Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers. Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all. News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media. This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world. The internet has become the ideal platform for youngsters to showcase their creativity, capability and capacity - be it an insightful blog, a beautiful musical rendition, artwork, or theatre… the sky is the limit. 

Friends. 

The theme of the Conference: ""Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development"" also highlights the importance of securing this vital asset for mankind. The global community needs to approach the issue of cyber-security with confidence, as much as with resolve. Cyberspace technologies must remain an enabler for our people. 

The quest for an open and accessible internet often leads to vulnerability. Stories of hacking and defacement of websites are the tip of an iceberg. They suggest that cyber attacks are a significant threat, especially in the democratic world. We need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals. Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life. 

One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats. Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks. The term ""hacking"" may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone. We need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth. 

On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization. Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape. 

Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other. Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other. 

Friends. 

Emerging digital technologies could impact our future in ways that we cannot yet foresee. Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed. Digital technology serves to empower mankind. We must ensure that it continues to stay that way. 

The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received. Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework. This will enable a secure cyberspace which improves quality of life. 

Friends. 

This conference is perhaps the biggest ever such event in terms of numbers. I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally. I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience. 

I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes. I once again welcome you, and wish the conference all success. 



Thank you.

Today, in the twenty-third meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to consumers. The Prime Minister was briefed on the action taken to ensure speedy and effective disposal of consumer grievances. Expressing concern over the large number of grievances, the Prime Minister emphasized on the need for improvement in the administrative arrangements, so that consumers can be benefited. 

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of nine infrastructure projects in the railway, road, power, and renewable energy sectors, spread over several states including Uttarakhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Assam, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. These projects are cumulatively worth over 30,000 crore rupees.  

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress in implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY). He said that funds accruing to the District Mineral Foundations (DMFs) should be utilized to strategically focus upon and eliminate major development issues or deficits that these districts currently face. He said this should be done in a focused way, so as to achieve the greatest possible, tangible results by 2022, which marks 75 years of independence.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Thursday reviewed progress of key infrastructure sectors including PMGSY, housing, coal and power. The review meeting, which lasted for about two and a half hours, was attended by top officials from PMO, NITI Aayog and infrastructure Ministries of the Government of India. 

In course of the presentation made by CEO NITI Aayog, it was noted that remarkable progress has been made in several areas. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, 81 per cent of the targeted habitations numbering about 1.45 lakh have so far been connected. Officials said progress is being made towards connecting all the remaining unconnected habitations within a defined timeframe. The Prime Minister observed that resources available for this work should be used optimally throughout the year. He also hoped that the advancement of the Union Budget date would lead to further improvement in performance. The Prime Minister was informed of the expeditious resolution of complaints received on the Meri Sadak App. He called for detailed analysis of the complaints, so that timely remedial measures are initiated wherever required. 

Reviewing progress towards the roadmap to deliver 1 crore houses in the rural areas by 2019, the Prime Minister said that the positive impact of housing on the lives of the beneficiaries should be suitably examined, and the focus should be on improving their quality of life. 

Reviewing the coal sector, the Prime Minister called for renewed efforts towards underground mining and coal gasification, through infusion of latest technology inputs. The Prime Minister was also informed about progressing towards the targets for rural electrification and household electrification.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the media persons on National Press Day.

“My greetings to all friends in the media on National Press Day. I appreciate the hardwork of our media, especially the reporters and camerapersons, who tirelessly work on the ground and bring forth various news that shapes national as well as global discourse. 

The role of the media in giving voice to the voiceless is commendable. Over the last three years, the media has added great strength to ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and effectively furthered the message of cleanliness. 

In this day and age we are seeing the rise of social media and news being consumed through mobile phones. I am sure these advancements will further the reach of the media and make the media space even more democratic and participative. 

A free press is the cornerstone of a vibrant democracy. We are fully committed to upholding freedom of press and expression in all forms. May our media space be used more and more to showcase the skills, strengths and creativity of 125 crore Indians”, the Prime Minister said.

                Your Excellency President Duterte,

Excellencies,

Mr. President,

I am delighted to be on my first visit to Manila in this landmark 50th year of ASEAN’s establishment. 

We are also celebrating 25 years of ASEAN – India dialogue partnership.

I compliment the Philippines for its able stewardship of ASEAN during this significant year and thank you, Mr. President, for the excellent arrangements made for this Summit.

I also thank the honourable Prime Minister of Vietnam for Vietnam’s contribution as Country Coordinator to further strengthen the ASEAN-India partnership.

Excellencies, 

ASEAN’s remarkable journey is indeed worthy of reflection as much as it is of celebration.

On this historic occasion, I am confident that ASEAN will further resolve to work together with one vision, one identity and as one independent community.

India’s Act East Policy is shaped around the ASEAN, and its centrality in the regional security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region is evident.

Our wide-ranging agenda of cooperation under the 3rd ASEAN-India Plan of Action has progressed well covering the three crucial pillars of politico-security, economic and cultural partnership.

Excellencies, 

Maritime links established thousands of years ago between India and ASEAN countries have enabled our trade relations in the past and we have to work closely to further strengthen them.

India assures the ASEAN of its steady support towards achieving a rules-based regional security architecture that best attests to the region’s interests and its peaceful development.

We have individually strived very hard to fight terrorism and violent extremism. It is time that we jointly address this challenge by intensifying cooperation in this crucial area.


Excellencies,

The befitting theme of ‘Shared Values, Common Destiny’ for our 25th anniversary celebrations has been jointly celebrated with a number of commemorative activities.

I look forward to a befitting culmination of the commemorative year and receiving you at the India-ASEAN Special Commemorative Summit on 25 January 2018 in New Delhi.

The 1.25 billion people of India are keen to welcome the ASEAN Leaders as our Chief Guests at India’s 69th Republic Day Celebrations.

I am committed to working with you to realize our common destiny.

Thank you.

                Greetings,

My visit would have been incomplete had I gone back without meeting you people. You people have come from different places by taking out your time. You have come here despite today being a working day. This is the result of your love, your affection towards India because of which today we have gathered under this roof. At the outset, I would like to specially thank you people because wherever I go outside India then I certainly try to meet Indian community there. But I would like to congratulate you people for the discipline that you have showed today. This in itself is a very big strength otherwise such a huge crowd and I’m easily able to meet all of you, this thing in itself is a big reasonfor happiness for me, and all of you deserve regards and congratulations for this thing.

This is my first visit to this country but this region is extremely important for India and since the time you people have given me responsibility to work as Prime Minister then from the beginning we have emphasized upon the Act East Policy. Because, in a way, we feel a lot of affinity with these countries. We have a natural affinity for them. Due to some or some other reasons, due to some legacies there is some kind of emotional bonding is there between us in some measure. There will be hardly any country in this region which will not be familiar with the lord Ram or Ramayana; there will be hardly any country which will not have respect for Lord Buddha. This in itself is a great legacy and the Indian community that inhabits in this region can very well shoulder the responsibility of nurturing and glorifying this legacy. An ordinary Indian can contribute several times more than what can be done by the embassy. And I have experienced that today every Indian in the world speaks about himself being an Indian with a pride and confidence. It’s a big thing for any country. For centuries, Indian Diaspora all over the world and Indians have a tendency of globetrotting, our ancestors left our shores hundreds of years ago and India has this uniqueness that wherever we settled we opted that place as our own. It’s not a small thing to adopt everyone while preserving your uniqueness and it becomes possible when people have a very strong self-confidence. And wherever you people went, you showed your strong self-confidence there. Irrespective of wherever you have settled, irrespective of the number of years, number of generations you have been staying outside India, it’s possible that the language connection might too have broken down but you are not able to sleep well if something goes wrong in India. And you take pride if something good happens. And that is why this is the effort the present government to take the country to those heights of development so that we can get parity with the world and once we achieve the capability to have parity with them then I don’t think anybody can stop India from going forward. Whatever difficulties are there, they are there only till the time achieve parity and once we cross those hurdles then we get a level playing field. And Indians have that kind of capabilities in their arms, their brains and hearts that no one can stop them from marching ahead. And that is why in the last three and three and a half years the government has made a consistent effort that whatever strength the country has, whatever capabilities of 1.25 billion people it has, whatever natural resources it has and whatever cultural heritage it has and the people of India in any period, you take any period be it 100 years, ago, 500 years ago or thousand years ago or be it 5,000 years ago, there will not be a single event in the history when we have caused any harm to anyone.

Whenever I meet people of any country of the world, and when I tell them that during the first and second world wars we did not capture anybody’s land, we did not have to hoist our flag anywhere, neither did we had any intention to capture the world but more than 1.5 lakh soldiers from our country had sacrificed their lives in search of peace. We did not desire or seek anything for us in the first and second world wars, however, 1.5 lakh Indians embraced martyrdom in search of peace and any Indian can say this thing with pride that we are the people who provide to the world, we are not the ones who seek something from it and we are certainly not the ones who snatch away from others.

Today, any Indian can take pride in India’s association with the peace keeping force of United Nations that if there is strife anywhere in the world then through the United Nations the peace keeping forces play their role in maintaining the peace at those strife torn places. And if there is anyone in the entire world making the maximum contribution to the peace keeping forces then these are Indian soldiers. And even today, Indian soldiers are deployed in several strife-torn places of the world. The land of Buddha and Gandhi spreads peace – these are not mere words. We are those people who have demonstrated this thing in our lives, who have assimilated the peace, peace is in our veins and that is why our ancestors gave us this formula of VasudhaivaKutumbkam (The world is a family), the formula that we have demonstrated through our lives. However, the world acknowledges the strength of all these things only when India is strong, when India is capable and it is moving forward to scale new heights in every field of the life only then the world acknowledges these things. Irrespective of the level of one’s knowledge about the substances of life, irrespective of a glorious history, irrespective of the greatness of your legacy, the world acknowledges all these things only when the present is also equally bright, and is full of energy and strong. And that is why it is our duty to make the 21st century a century of India if it is considered the century of Asia, it is as important as studying and taking inspiration from our past. And I don’t think it’s difficult. After the experience of last three and three and a half years I can say this thing that this is possible. You might have seen in the past some time as for as the government of India is concerned positive news are being reported about it. Now there is no apprehension that there will be some negative news and what people will ask us when we go to our office. Now whenever you step outside your house you have that confidence – No, only good news will come from India. It’s a country of 1.25 billion people, its main theme, the main theme of the government and the society is only revolving around the positivity alone. Every time the decisions are taken only in the interest of the country while keeping the development in the mind. It’s a country of 1.25 billion people and how the economy will function if 30 crore families are outside the banking system even 70 years after the independence.

We took this task upon ourselves, we started Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Scheme and banks were feeling uneasy as they were required to open accounts even cases of zero balance. And everyone knows that entire banking world is here in Manila. And banks argued with them: Sir, at least please allow us to charge them for the stationary. I told them that this was the right of the poor people of the country; they should have a respectable access to the banks. That poor fellow used to think that whether he can enter into that air-conditioned bank or not as there were armed guard outside the banks. And then that poor fellow was forced to visit to a money lender and all of us know that what these moneylenders do. The bank accounts of 30 crore countrymen were opened under the zero balance scheme. And sometimes you people have seen the rich community. I have seen both the rich people and small heartedness of those rich people. You must have seen the poor people as well but I have seen the richness, the large heartedness of poor people. We have opened zero balance bank accounts but today I can say this thing with pride that these poor people have developed a habit of saving in those Jan Dhan Accounts. Earlier they used to stash their money in the wheat stored in the house, they used to keep it under their bed, and mothers used to be apprehensive that if their husbands had bad habits then he would spend it somewhere else. But you will be happy to note that in such a short span of time 67,000 crore rupees have been deposited in Jan-Dhan accounts. The poor people have become active participant in the mainstream of the country’s economy. It’s not a small change, the person who was outside the system, who didn’t have the power and capability, today, the same person has come at the centre of the system.

There are several initiatives that were never discussed, people did not even think about them. Some people even wondered whether these things were feasible? We have accepted that our country will continue to run the way it is. Why it will be like this only? If Singapore can be clean, Philippines can be clean, Manila can be clean then why cannot India be clean? Which resident of the country would prefer living in filth? No one wants that. But someone has to take initiative, someone has to take the responsibility, someone has to take up the work without worrying about success or failure. We have tried to take it forward from where Mahatma Gandhi left it.And I tell you that today more than 2.25 lakh villages in India have now become open defecation free. So what a big change it has brought to the quality of life of a common man of our society.

Now in our country, those of you who have visited India in the last 20, 25, 30 yearsor those of you who are still in touch with India, must be knowing thatgettinga gas cylinder, getting a gas connection in a household was considered to be a big thing. and if one would get a gas connection in the house, if agas cylinder came to the house, then the atmosphere in the neighborhood used to be such thatsomebody had got a Mercedes car, meaning it was considered a very big achievement that we have got a gas connection in our house. Gas connection used to be such a big thing in our country that Members of Parliament used to get 25 coupons in a year so that they can oblige 25 families in their constituencies. What they used to do I don’t want to say that, it used to come in newspapers, means connection for gas cylinder. You must remember that when elections were held in 2014, BJP was at one end and Congress party was on the otherend. Bharatiya Janata Party gave me the responsibility to lead that election. A meeting was held in Congress Party and the whole country was waiting to know under whose leadership they will fight elections. After the meeting a press conference of Congress party was held in the evening. What was said in that press conference, it was said that if we win the elections in 2014, then we will give 12 cylinders in a year instead of the 9 cylinders that we give right now.We will give 12 cylinders, do you remember it or not, meaning 12 cylinders instead of 9 cylinders, Congress was fighting election on this issue. Till 2014 this was the scope of thinking, it is not a thing of too far from now and the country was also applauding:‘Great!We will get 12 cylinders instead of 9.’

Giving gas cylinders and gas connection to five crore families, to those mothers who cook food by burning wood-sticks in stoves. Now tell me how would you feel on hearing that on one side the scope of thinking is to increase gas cylinders from9 to 12, and on the other side there is a person who says that in three years he will provide gas cylinders to five crore families and he will give these connections for free.

A mother who is poor, when she cooks food on a stove by burning woodsticks, scientists say that in one day, smoke of four hundred cigarettes goes into the body of that mother. What’s her crime? Who will worry about her health, and the children who play there, they cannot remain untouched fromthat, what would be their condition?Should there be a change in their lives or not? And bringing thewoodsticks and if those are soggy, then how painful it would be to use them in cooking, how difficult it would be. Should they be freed from that problem after 70 years of freedom or not, and some people have this approach. The basic thing which I want to tell you is that sometimes the poorness of thoughts can create very big problems.

Once from Red Fort, I requested the people of India, I said that brothers, if you can afford then why you do need gas subsidy? What interest do you have in 800, 1000 or 1200 rupees in a year, just give it up , I had said just this much, and you will take pride in it that 1.25 crore families of my country, - 1.25 crore households, it’s not a small number,they voluntarily gave up the gas subsidy and Modi did not put it in the government coffers.

Modi decided that we will give that to the poor people and we successfully moved forward in the direction of providing free gas connection to 3 crore families.We have already provided gas connections to 3 crore families. My promise is for 5 crore families. There are total 25 crore families in India, from 25 crore families I have made promise for 5 crore families and we have already provided it to 3 crore families. There is a surprise in this also, since you all are from our own family so I can tell you something.When government subsidy was given, it seemed that people would be benefitting from it. So what did I do,I linked it with Aadhar, bio metric identification, and because of this it was discovered that gas subsidy was being paid in the name of such people thatwere never born.I mean to say where it would have gone? Tell me, where it could go? It would have been goingin somebody’s pocket or not, now I have brushed it and it has stopped. I Just did this much that this kind of subsidy is given to the right people, it should not be given to those people who are ghosts and lying and who have never been born, I just did this much, and it is not a big thing and do you know what are the results, we saved 57 thousand crore rupees. And we have not saved this amount just once, every year 57 thousand crore rupees were spent, now tell me where did it use to go? Now the people in whose pocket it used to go, what would they think about Modi, would they ever come to take a photo? Would they come? Would they like Modi? Tell me if we should work or not? Should there be a change in the country or not? Harsh decisions should be taken or not? Should we take the nation forward or not?

By coming here you people have blessed me and I can assure you that I will leave no stone unturned to fulfill the purpose which has been given to me by the country. What were the news that used to come before 2014, how much was siphoned off in the coal, or in 2G, this used to be the news or not? After 2014, what is asked from Modi, Modi Ji please tell how much money came? See, this is the change. There was a time when the country was worried about how much went and today the time is such when people are eagerly asking, Modi Ji please tell how much has come?

Friends, there is no dearth in our country, our country has all the possibilities to move ahead, we have every capability,keeping that in mind we are marching ahead with many important policies. The country is scaling new heights of development and we are moving forward with public participation. We are moving ahead taking the most common people with us and its results will be so good that you too would not like to live abroad for a long time. It felt good to me that you people came in such a big number and blessed me.

Many many Thanks.

The Prime Minister said that the ASEAN region is very important for India. He spoke of the long shared heritage and emotional bonding that India has with the ASEAN region. In particular, he mentioned the Buddha and the Ramayana. He said the Indian diaspora in the region has a key role to play in nurturing this heritage. 

The Prime Minister said India has never harmed another country. He spoke of the sacrifice of one and a half lakh Indian soldiers, who laid down their lives in distant lands during World Wars 1 and 2. 

He said that India's present too, must be equally bright, and radiant. He said we should do everything possible to ensure that the 21st century, which is termed ""Asia's century"" becomes ""India's century."" 

The Prime Minister spoke of initiatives such as Jandhan Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana, taken by the Government for empowering the poor. He also mentioned the gains made through Aadhaar linking of subsidy.

                Mr. Joey Concepcion

Chairman, ASEAN Business Advisory Council;

Excellencies;

Ladies and Gentlemen!

At the onset, I apologise for the delay. In business, like in politics, both time and timing are very important. But sometimes despite our best efforts we cannot help it. I am delighted to be here in Manila, on my very first visit to the Philippines.

There is a lot that India and the Philippines share in common:


• We are both pluralistic societies and vibrant democracies. 

• Our economies are among the fastest growing economies in the world.

• We have large, young and aspiring populations that are innovative and enterprising. 

• The Philippines is a services power house just as India is.  

And, just as in India, here in Philippines also, the government wants to see change, bring about inclusive growth, Develop infrastructure, and fight corruption. No wonder so many of our top IT companies have invested here. They are creating thousands of jobs and promoting the Philippines services sector world-wide.


Friends,

This morning we witnessed a brilliant performance of the dance drama 'Rama Hari' based on the Ramayana at the Opening Ceremony of the ASEAN Summit. It depicts the way historically the people of India and ASEAN have been bound together. These are not only historical bonds. This is a living shared heritage. The Act East policy of my government puts this region at the centre of our engagement. We have exceptionally good political and people-to-people relations with each and every country in the ASEAN region. We wish to bring our economic and business relations up to the same level.

Friends,

The task of transforming India is proceeding on an unprcedented scale. We are working day and night to ensure Good Governance which includes easy, effective and transparent Governance.

To give you an example: we have started open auction for natural resources including telecom spectrum, coal mines and other minerals and even private radio channels. This has together contributed about 75 billion US dollars in revenue. Using technology, we are enhancing responsibility and reducing discretion and corruption. We are using our Unique ID system in financial transactions and taxation for this purpose and the results are already visible. These steps, coupled with demonetization of high value notes has resulted in formalizing a large part of our economy. The number of new tax payers filing income tax returns has more than doubled. Digital transactions have increased by 34 per cent in one year, as we march towards a less-cash economy. We have used technology to reach out to people. An online citizen engagement platform, MyGov has harnessed ideas, suggestions and inputs on policies and programmes from 2 million pro-active citizens.

We have also introduced a new frame-work called PRAGATI – Pro-active Governance and Timely Implemntation under which I am able to review project implemntation and redress public grievances through video conference with officials across the country. In keeping with our emphasis on minimum government and maximum governance, 1200 out-dated laws have been repealed in three years.


New laws and institutions for Bankruptcy and Insolvency as well as IPR and Arbitration are now in place. 36 white industries have been taken out from the requirement of environmental clearance. Incorporating a company is now just a one day affair. We have simplified industrial licensing, and introduced online application process for environmental and forest clearances. All these have made opening a new business very easy. The results are obvious . 

India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year. It is the biggest jump by any country this year and a recognition of India's long term reform trajectory.


And, the world is taking notice:
- We have moved up 32 places in the last two years in the Global Competi- -tiveness Index of the World Economic Forum;
- We have also moved up 21 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
- We have moved 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank;

Friends,

Most of the sectors of our economy are now open for FDI. More than 90 per cent FDI sectors are on automatic approval route.India has emerged as a front-runner in attracting foreign direct investment. Compared to last three years, we have received 67 per cent more FDI in this year. Now, we are a globally integrated economy. Moreover, these mile-stones have been achieved even before some of the major recent reforms.

This year in July, we have implemented the highly complex task of migrating to a uniform Goods and Services Tax for the whole country. This has done away with a vast range of State level and central level taxes through-out India. This is no small achievement given the vastness and diversity of our country and the federal nature of our polity. At the same time, we strongly believe that this is not enough.

Friends, A very large part of India’s population had no access to banking services. This deprived them of the opportunities for savings as well as access to institutional credit. With the Jan Dhan Yojana, within a matter of months, the lives of millions of Indians were transformed. 197 million bank accounts were opened in one year.

Till August this year, 290 million such accounts have been opened in Indian banks. Nearly 200 million Ru-pay cards were issued for easy cash-less transactions. Access to banking services by the poor has also played a major role in tackling corruption in government. Now, subsidies meant for the poor get directly deposited into their accounts in the form of direct benefit transfers, eliminating leakages and possibility of any discrimination. More than 146 million people are receiving direct cash subsidies through bank accounts on cooking gas alone. Today, the government is using Direct Benefit Transfers for 59 different schemes. Subsidies worth nearly 10 billion US dollars are being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the intended beneficiaries.

Friends,

One of the major themes of this summit is entrepreneur--ship We have launched a campaign called Make in India. Through this initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain. We want to make India a global manufacturing hub. At the same time, we want our youth to be job creators; not just job seekers. For this purpose, we have launched drives called Start up India and Stand up India.A major constraint in freeing up the entreprsing energy of small entrepreneurs is lack of collateral for finance. For the first time in India, collateral-free loans have been dis-bursed to more than 90 million small entrepreneurs under the Mudra scheme. Very near to the population of Philippines. This is a recognition of the contribution of small entrepreneurs in the economy and to empower a person who has a work-able business idea but no collateral. I see the importance being given to entrepreneur- -ship in the Philippines and in ASEAN region. The ASEAN Mentor-ship for Entrepreneurs launched at this Summit is a commendable initiative that addresses another felt need of entrepreneurs. Indeed, for the near future, South and South East Asia will be the growth engine of the world. Hence, building connectivity with ASEAN is a key objective for India. We wish to build land, sea and air connectivity to this dynamic region. Work is already on in the construction of the tri-lateral highway through Myanmar and Thailand to connect to other countries in South East Asia.

We are working on the early conclusion of the Agreement on Maritime Transport between India and ASEAN and are exploring coastal shipping services with countries that are our immediate maritime neighbours.In the area of air connectivity, ASEAN countries enjoy the facility to operate a daily service to the four metro cities in India and to eighteen other destinations.We have taken steps such as electronic visa system to boost tourism to India. Out-bound tourism from India is growing at one of the fastest rates in the world. Given the primacy of connectivity, India is organising an ASEAN – India Connectivity Summit in New Delhi next month with Ministers, officials and business representativs from all ASEAN countries participating.Just as India sees business opportunities in the region, I am sure that the ASEAN business community recognises the potential for business in India. While some of you are already deeply involved in India, others are just discovering the possibilities that remain to be tapped. To co-incide with the ASEAN –India Comme--morative Summit of ASEAN leaders in January next year, we are also organising the ASEAN-India Business and Investment Meet and Expo. I invite you all to attend it.It will be the biggest ASEAN focussed business event India has ever organised. India wishes to participate in your growth story and we invite all of ASEAN to participate in ours.

माबूहाय! 
मरामिंग सलामात! 
Thank you!

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Philippines.

“I will be in Manila on a three-day visit starting 12th November. This will be my first bilateral visit to the Philippines where I will also participate in the ASEAN-India and East Asia Summits. My participation in them symbolises India's commitment to continue deepening relationship with ASEAN Member States, in particular, and with the Indo-Pacific region, in general, within the framework of my Government's Act East Policy.

Besides these Summits, I would also participate in Special Celebrations of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Leaders' Meeting and ASEAN Business and Investment Summit.

The ASEAN Business and Investment Summit will boost our close cooperation to further enhance our trade ties with ASEAN member-states, which constitutes a significant 10.85% of our overall trade.

During my first visit to the Philippines, I look forward to have a bilateral meeting with President of the Philippines HE Mr. Rodrigo Duterte. I will also have interactions with other ASEAN and East Asia Summit Leaders.

I also look forward to connecting with the Indian community in Philippines. During my stay in Manila, I shall also visit the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and Mahavir Philippines Foundation Inc. (MPFI).

International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) through Scientific Research and Development has developed better quality of rice seed and helped the global community in addressing food scarcity issues. A large number of Indian scientists are working in IRRI and contributing to R&D in this field. My cabinet approved on 12 July 2017 a proposal for IRRI to set up its South Asia Regional Centre at Varanasi. This will be the first Research Centre by IRRI outside its headquarters in the Philippines. The Varanasi Centre would help increase farmers' income by enhancing and supporting rice productivity, reducing cost of production, value addition, diversification and enhancement of farmers' skills.

My visit to Mahavir Philippines Foundation Inc. (MPFI) will demonstrate India's support for its activities in distributing free prosthesis ""Jaipur Foot"" among the needy amputees. Since its establishment in 1989, MPFI has fitted nearly 15,000 amputees in the Philippines with Jaipur Foot making them capable of living a new life. Government of India is making a modest contribution to the Foundation to support its noble humanitarian activities.

I am confident that my visit to Manila will give a new boost to India's bilateral relations with the Philippines and also further strengthen the politico-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars of our engagement with ASEAN.”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Ms. Mamata Banerjee, today jointly inaugurated a series of connectivity projects between the two countries. 

These include, the second Bhairab and Titas Railway Bridges; and the International Rail Passenger Terminus at Chitpur in Kolkata. The dignitaries also flagged off the inaugural run of the Bandhan Express between Kolkata and Khulna. 

External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj, also joined the event from New Delhi. 

Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion: 

“इस प्रसारण से जुड़े सभी लोगों को, और विशेषकर बांग्लादेश में रहने वाले सभी भाइयों और बहनों को नमस्कार।

कुछ दिन पहले दोनों देशों में दीपावली, दुर्गा पूजा और काली पूजा के महोत्सव मनाए गए। 

मैं दोनों देशवासियों को इस festival season की शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ।

मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि video conference के माध्यम से आपसे एक बार फ़िर मिलने का अवसर मिला।

आपके स्वास्थ्य के लिए हमारी शुभकामनाएं आपके साथ हैं।

मेरा शुरू से ही मानना रहा है कि पड़ोसी देशों के leaders के साथ सही मायने में पड़ौसियों जैसे संबंध होने चाहिए। 

जब मन किया तो बात होनी चाहिए, visits होने चाहिए। 

इस सबमें हमें protocol के बंधन में नहीं रहना चाहिए।

कुछ समय पहले हमने South Asia Satellite के launch के समय इसी प्रकार video conference की थी।

पिछले वर्ष हमने मिल कर Petrapole ICP का उद्घाटन भी इसी प्रकार किया था।

और मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि आज हमारी connectivity को मज़बूत करने वाले महत्वपूर्ण projects का उद्घाटन हमने video conference के माध्यम से किया।

Connectivity का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण आयाम है हमारी people-to-people connectivity. 

और आज international passenger terminus के उद्घाटन से कोलकाता-ढाका मैत्री express और आज शुरू हुई कोलकाता-खुलना बंधन express के यात्रियों को काफी सुविधा होगी।

इससे उन्हें न सिर्फ़ customs और immigration में आसानी होगी, बल्कि उनकी यात्रा के समय में भी 3 घंटे की बचत होगी।

मैत्री और बंधन, इन दोनों rail सुविधाओं के नाम भी हमारे shared vision के अनुरूप हैं।

जब भी हम connectivity की बात करते हैं, तो मुझे हमेशा आपके pre-1965 connectivity बहाल करने के vision का ख़याल आता है।

मुझे बहुत ख़ुशी है कि हम इस दिशा में क़दम-दर-क़दम निरंतर आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

आज हमने दो rail पुलों का भी उद्घाटन किया है। लगभग 100 million dollars की लागत से बने ये पुल बांग्लादेश के rail network को मजबूत करने में सहायक होंगे।

बांग्लादेश के विकास कार्यों में विश्वस्त साझेदार होना भारत के लिए गर्व का विषय है। 

मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि हमारे 8 billion dollars के concessional (कनसे-शनल) finance के commitment के अंतर्गत projects पर अच्छी प्रगति हो रही है।

Development और Connectivity दोनों एक साथ जुड़े हुए हैं, और हम दोनों देशों के बीच जो सदियों पुराने एतिहासिक links हैं, विशेष रूप से पश्चिम बंगाल और बांग्लादेश के लोगों के बीच, उन्हें मजबूत करने की दिशा में आज हमने कुछ और क़दम उठाए हैं।

मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि जैसे-जैसे हम अपने संबंध बढ़ाएंगे और लोगों के बीच रिश्ते मज़बूत करेंगे, वैसे वैसे हम विकास और समृद्धि के नए आसमान भी छूएंगे।

इस काम में सहयोग के लिए मैं प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना जी का, और मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी जी का हृदय से आभार प्रकट करता हूं।

धन्यवाद।

                At the outset, I express my condolences and sympathies to the families of all those, who have lost their loved ones, or faced immense hardship in the recent incidents of heavy rain and floods in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu. I have assured the State Government of all possible support. I also express grief at the passing away of senior journalist, Thiru R. Mohan. 

The Dina Thanthi has completed seventy five glorious years. I commend the contributions of Thiru S.P. Adithanar, Thiru S.T. Adithanar, and Thiru Balasubramanian ji, for the successful journey so far. Their stellar efforts over the last seven and a half decades, have made Thanthi one of the biggest media brands. Not just in the State of Tamil Nadu, but in the entire country. I also compliment the management and staff of the Thanthi group for this success. 

24 hour news channels are now available to millions of Indians. Yet, for many, the day still begins with a cup of tea or coffee in one hand, and a newspaper in the other. I am told that the Dina Thanthi offers this option today, through seventeen editions, not only in Tamil Nadu but also in Bengaluru, Mumbai and even in Dubai. This remarkable expansion over seventy five years, is a tribute to the visionary leadership of Thiru S.P. Adithanar, who began this newspaper in 1942. Newsprint was a rare commodity in those days. But he began the newspaper by printing on paper made by hand, from straw. 

The font size, simple language and easy to understand narrative made Dina Thanthi popular among the people. In those times, it brought them political awareness and information. People used to throng the tea-shops to read this newspaper. Thus began the voyage, that continues till today, when its balanced coverage makes the Dina Thanthi popular, from a daily wage earner, to the highest political functionary in the State. 

I came to know that Thanthi means telegram. Dina Thanthi means “daily telegram”. Over the last seventy five years, the traditional telegram, delivered by the postal department, has become obsolete, and gone out of existence. But this telegram, continues to grow every day. Such is the power of a noble idea, backed by hard work and commitment. 

I am happy to learn that the Thanthi group has instituted awards for promoting Tamil Literature in the name of its founder Thiru Adithanar. I whole-heartedly congratulate the awardees: Thiru. Tamilanban, Dr. Irai Anbu and Thiru. V.G. Santhosham. I am sure, this recognition will be a motivating factor for those who have taken to writing as a noble profession. 

Ladies and Gentlemen. 

Mankind's quest for knowledge is as old as our history itself. Journalism helps quench this thirst. Today, newspapers do not just give news. They can also mould our thinking and open a window to the world. In a broader context, media is a means of transforming society. That is why, we refer to the media, as the fourth pillar of democracy. I am fortunate today, to be among those who demonstrate the power of the pen, and show how it can be the vital life-force and conscience of society. 

During the dark days of colonialism, publications such as the Sambad Kaumudi of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the Kesari of Lokmanya Tilak, and the Navjeevan of Mahatma Gandhi, lit a beacon, and inspired the freedom struggle. Across the country, there were pioneers in journalism, who often gave up a life of comfort. They helped create a mass consciousness and awakening, through their newspapers. Perhaps it is because of the high ideals of those founding pioneers, that so many newspapers established in the days of the British Raj, continue to flourish today. 

Friends, 

We must never forget that successive generations performed the duties required of them, towards society, and the nation. That is how we achieved freedom. After independence, the rights of citizens gained importance in public discourse. Unfortunately, over time we seem to have neglected our individual and collective sense of duty. This has in some way contributed to several ills that plague our society today. The need of the hour is to create a mass awakening towards ""engaged, responsible, and aware citizens."" The civic sense of “entitlement” must be suitably balanced by a civic sense of “responsible engagement.” This should happen, of course, through our education system, and the conduct of our political leaders. But the media too, has a key role to play here. 

Ladies and Gentlemen. 

Many of the newspapers that shaped the discourse for freedom, were vernacular newspapers. In fact, the then British Government was fearful of the Indian Vernacular Press. It was to muzzle vernacular newspapers, that the Vernacular Press Act was enacted in 1878. 

In our diverse nation, the role of vernacular newspapers - newspapers published in regional languages - remains as important today, as it was then. They carry content in a language that is easily understood by people. Very often, they cater to vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups. Their strength, their impact, and thus, their responsibility, can never be under-estimated. They are the messengers of the intent and policies of the Government, in far-flung areas. Equally, they are the torch-bearers of the thoughts, feelings and emotions of our people. 

In this context, it is indeed heartening to note that today, among our vibrant print media, some of the largest selling newspapers, are published in the regional languages. The Dina Thanthi, is of course, one among them. 

Friends. 

I have often heard people wonder, as to how the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. 

On a serious note, we are all aware, that there is just too much that happens in the world everyday. It is the editors who select and decide what is important. They decide what should be given space on the first page, what should be given more space and what should be ignored. This, of course, casts upon them, a great responsibility. Editorial freedom must be used wisely, in public interest. Equally so, the freedom to write, and to decide what is to be written, does not include the freedom to be ""less than accurate,"" or ""factually incorrect."" As Mahatma Gandhi himself told us: “The press is called the Fourth Estate. It is definitely a power, but, to misuse that power is criminal.” 

Even though media may be owned by private individuals, it serves a public purpose. As scholars say, it is an instrument to produce reform through peace, rather than by force. Hence, it has as much social accountability as the elected government or the judiciary. And its conduct must be equally, above board. To recall the words of the great saint Thiruvalluvar, “There is nothing in this world except ethics, which would bring both reputation and wealth together”. 

Friends. 

Technology has brought about great change in the media. There was a time, when the headlines of the day, written on a village blackboard, carried immense credibility. Today, our media spans the entire range, from that village blackboard, to online bulletin boards. 

Just as education now focuses a lot more on learning outcomes, our attitude towards consumption of content has changed. Today, every citizen analyses, discusses, and attempts to cross-check and verify the news that comes to him, through multiple sources. Media, therefore, must make an extra effort, to maintain credibility. Healthy competition among credible media platforms is also good for the health of our democracy. 

Renewed emphasis on credibility, brings us to the subject of introspection. I firmly believe that reform in the media, whenever required, can only come from within, through introspection. Indeed, we have seen this process of introspection happen on some occasions, such as the analysis of the reportage of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack. Perhaps, it should happen more often. 

Friends. 

I recall a quote our beloved former President, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam: “We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why?” 

I observe, that a lot of the media discourse today revolves around politics. It is only fair that politics be discussed at length, in a democracy. However, India is more than just us politicians. It is the 125 crore Indians, which make India what it is. I would be happy to see media focus a lot more, on their stories, and their achievements. 

In this endeavour, every citizen with a mobile phone is your ally. Citizen reporting can be an important tool in the sharing and dissemination of success stories of individuals. It can also be of immense help in directing relief and rescue efforts in times of crisis, or natural disasters. 

Let me also add, that during times of natural disasters, media usually does its best to cover various aspects of the incident. Natural calamities seem to be occurring with increasing frequency and intensity across the world. Climate change is a challenge for each one of us. Can media take a lead in the battle against it? Can media devote just a little space, or a fixed time daily, to report, discuss, or increase awareness about what we can do to combat climate change? 

I take this opportunity, to appreciate the media's response to the Swachh Bharat Mission. As we strive to achieve Swachh Bharat by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, I am touched by the constructive role that media has played, both in generating awareness and mass consciousness towards cleanliness. They have also pointed out the work that remains to be done, before we can claim to have achieved our goal. 

Ladies and Gentlemen. 

There is another key area, where media can play an important role. This is the initiative of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat. Let me explain this with one example. 

Can a newspaper, devote just a few column inches of space, each day for one year, to this cause? Every day, they can write one simple sentence in their language of publication, along with its translation, and trans-literation, in all major Indian languages. 

At the end of the year, the readers of the newspaper will have been exposed to 365 such simple sentences, in all major Indian languages. Imagine the positive impact this simple step can create. Further, schools can be encouraged to discuss this in their classrooms daily for a few minutes, so that children too, are exposed to the strength and richness of our diversity. Hence, this step will not only serve a noble cause, but will also increase the strength of the publication itself. 

Ladies and Gentlemen. 

Seventy five years may be a considerable amount of time in a human life-span. But for a nation, or an institution, it marks just a significant milestone. About three months ago, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement. In a way, the journey of the Dina Thanthi, has mirrored the rise of India as a young, vibrant nation. 

Speaking in Parliament on that day, I gave a call for creating a New India by 2022. An India that is free from the evils of corruption, casteism, communalism, poverty, illiteracy, and disease. The next five years must be about Sankalp se Siddhi - accomplishment through resolve. Only then can we create the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters. As a newspaper that was born when the nation embraced the Quit India Movement, may I suggest that the Dina Thanthi has a special responsibility in this regard. I hope that you will use this opportunity, to reflect upon what you can do for your readers, or for the people of India, over the next five years. 

Even beyond the immediate target of five years, perhaps on the occasion of its platinum jubilee, the Thanthi must think of what the next seventy five years will be like. What is the best way to continue to remain relevant, and serve the people and the nation in the age of instant news at the fingertips. And in doing so, continue to maintain the highest standards of professionalism, ethics, and objectivity. 

In conclusion, I once again appreciate the efforts of the publishers of Dina Thanthi in the service of the people of Tamil Nadu. I am sure, they will continue to constructively help in shaping the destiny of our great nation. 

Thank you.

                Miss Kristalina Georgieva, CEO, World Bank; My Colleagues in the Council of Ministers; Senior Officials, Business Leaders; Ladies and Gentlemen!

Today, it’s the holy occasion of Guru Parab. The holy remembrance of Guru Nanak Dev Ji inspires us to lead a life full of truth, lead a life full of commitment towards the truth and integrity of the country. After two years, the entire mankind is going to get the opportunity to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. I convey my best wishes to all of you while bowing down to such a great teacher.

I am very happy to be here today. I sense a well-deserved mood of celebration here. The World Bank has recognized the stupendous work done by us towards improving Ease of Doing Business. We are now among the top hundred countries in the Doing Business rankings. In a short time of three years we have improved forty-two ranks.

 I thank Ms. Kristalina Georgieva for being with us on this joyous occasion. It shows World Bank’s commitment to encourage nations to undertake reforms which benefit society and economy. Her presence today will motivate our team to do even better in the coming days and months.

 Over the last three years, I have been constantly telling the domestic and foreign investor community that we in India are making sincere efforts to improve ‘ease of doing business’. 

And Friends! India has Walked the Talk. 

This year, India’s jump in ranking is the highest. India has been identified as one of the top reformers. Congratulations to all who have worked for this. You have done the nation proud. 

This improvement is important: 

• Because it is an indicator of Good Governance in the Country; 

• Because it is a measure of the quality of our public policies; 

• Because it is a benchmark of transparency of processes; 

• Because, ease of doing business, also leads to ease of life; 

• And, ultimately, it reflects the way people live, work and transact in a society. 

 

Friends! 
But all this is for the benefit of concerned stakeholders. For me, the World Bank report shows that quantum change is possible through commitment and hard work. Continued efforts can help us improve even further. 


And even otherwise you are aware that I don’t have any other work. And that is why, in future, I see potential of doing some work in this thing too. My country, 1.25 billion people of my country and in order to bring about some changes in their lives; and that is why I’d like to assure you that I will not fall short in fulfilling those expectations that this world expects of me.

I say this because, India has reached a position from where, now it is easier to improve further. Our efforts have gathered momentum. In management terms, we have achieved critical mass for a swift takeoff. 


For example, this report has not taken into account the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax or GST. As you all know, GST is the biggest tax reform in the Indian economy. And it impacts many aspects of doing business. With GST, we are moving towards a modern tax regime, which is transparent, stable and predictable. 


And when the issue of GST has been discussed here, so at time when a lot of people from the business world are present here, from this platform, I’d like to tell all the traders of the country that when we had made a pledge to implement the GST then people were not sure whether it would be implemented or not, whether it would be implemented from the July first or not. It was implemented. And even after the implementation they felt: ‘We have been hit very badly and it is Modi, he will not carry out any reform in it.’ And at that time we had said: ‘Let us observe it minutely for three months because India is such a massive country and it’s not like that all the wisdom is there in Delhi only. It’s not like that. The common man of the country has some wisdom. We will learn and understand from him, we will assess the difficulties and find ways’

And when a meeting of the GST council was convened after three months then all the issues that had come to the fore before the council all those issues were solved. For some other issues, some states in the council were not convinced so we constituted committees of ministers of those states and officials. And today I’m happy to inform that though I have not received the verbatim report but the committee of the ministers which was formed by the GST council, they have formed the committee collectively and I have some information about what has happened in that meeting, I don’t yet have the full report with me but I can tell you that all those issues that were raised by the traders, all those suggestions that were made by the businesses, positively almost all of them are going to be accepted. And if no state will create any hurdle in the GST council meeting scheduled for the 9th and 10th then I’m confident that whatever reforms are needed to strengthen India’s business world and Indian economy, those reforms will be cleared. And even after that those new issues that will come in the future, as we are required to adopt a new system and we will have to come out of a system that was several years old, then it’s not necessary that only the government has wisdom to solve them, when all the stakeholders give their input only then the best of the best results become possible. And GST is going to become a good example of this thing that how a system can be made foolproof by respecting everyone’s feelings. This thing reflects in the process of GST.

The World Bank report has only taken into account the reforms carried out till the May 2017 while GST was implemented in July 2017 after that. So you can imagine that our initiatives will be counted in the discussion that will take place in 2018.

There are many other reforms which have already happened, but need gestation and stabilization time, before they are taken into account by the World Bank. There are a few other reforms where our team and the World Bank team need to find common ground. All this, combined with our conviction to do even better, gives me the confidence that India will occupy a place of pride in the World Bank report next year and in the years thereafter.


I compliment the World Bank for engaging with countries to improve ease of doing business across the world. I also compliment them for the theme of this year’s report - ‘Reforming to create jobs’. There can be no denying that business is a major force in our lives. It is an engine for growth, employment generation, wealth creation and delivery of goods and services that make our lives comfortable. 

We are a young country and job creation is an opportunity as well as a challenge. Therefore, to leverage the energy of our youth, we are positioning India as a Start-up Nation and a global manufacturing hub. For this purpose, we have launched various initiatives, such as Make in India and Start-up India. 

Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA. An India where opportunities are created and harnessed to the advantage of the needy. We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society. A good beginning has been made through the Digital India and Skill India initiatives. 


Friends! 

India is swiftly changing for the better. I wish to list some more global recognitions which indicate this: 


o We have moved up thirty two places in the last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum. This is highest for any country; 

o We have also moved up twenty one places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years. 


o We have moved nineteen places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank; 


o We are among the top FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD. 


Some people don’t understand the improvement in India’s ranking from 142nd spot to 100th spot. They are not moved by this. Some of these people have earlier served in the World Bank. Today, even they are raising questions about India’s ranking. Had this kind of reforms, like insolvency code, bankruptcy code and creation of commercial courts, been carried out during your tenure then our ranking would have improved much earlier. And the credit for improvement in ranking would have gone to you. Whether the situation of the country would have improved or not? They did nothing and have been raising questions about someone who has been doing something.

It’s just a coincidence that the World Bank started the process of releasing the ease of doing business ranking in 2004. It’s an important year. And all of you know who was in the government since then till 2014.

I’m such a Prime Minister who has not even seen the building of the World Bank whereas earlier this kind of person has occupied the office of Prime Minister who had run the World Bank.

And I ask them that they should cooperate with us instead of questioning the ranking of the World Bank so that we can take the country to a newer height. We should collectively take a pledge for marching ahead to make a New India.

Our mantra is reform, perform and transform. We want to do better and better. I am happy to note that for the first time, the World Bank is helping us in this exercise at the sub-National level too. In a federal democracy like India, it is often not easy to take on board every stakeholder while undertaking reforms. However, over the last three years, there has been a sea change in the response of Governments, both at Central and State level. State Governments are finding innovative ways to create a business friendly environment. While often competing with each other in implementing business reforms, they are also helping each other in implementing them. This is an exciting universe in which competitiveness and cooperation co-exist. 

Friends, 
The agenda for boosting growth and employment, required many structural changes, many tough decisions and many new regulations. Besides this, the mind-set of the bureaucracy required change to enable them to work fearlessly and honestly. Over the last three years, the Union Government has done a lot on these fronts. We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing businesses and companies. 

Along with manufacturing, we are also pushing for faster progress in infrastructure sectors. Therefore, we are continuously working to improve our investment climate. In the last three and a half years we have undertaken bold Foreign Direct Investment reforms in twenty one sectors, covering eighty seven areas of policy.

I kept hearing it for two years – big bang reforms, big bang reforms, now they have stopped it because people have come to know that the speed, level and size of reforms are such that critics are not able to keep pace with it.

These reforms have touched significant sectors like Defence, Railways, Construction Development, Insurance, Pension, Civil Aviation and Pharmaceuticals. More than ninety percent of the FDI approvals have been put on the automatic route. It’s an extremely important thing We are now among the most open economies for FDI.

 
This has resulted in increased FDI inflow, which year after year is making new records. The FDI inflows of 55.6 billion US dollars for the year ending March, 2016 were an all-time high. The following year, India registered an FDI inflow of 60.08 billion US dollars, thereby scaling an even higher peak. As a result, the total FDI received in the country has gone up by 67% in a short span of three years. 

During the current financial year till August, total FDI of 30.38 billion US dollars has been received, which represents an increase of 30% as compared to the corresponding period last year. In August, 2017, India received a total FDI of 9.64 billion US dollars, which is the highest ever FDI received in any month. 

Friends! 

Over the last three years, we have systemically and critically evaluated business regulations. We have tried to understand the pain points of businesses with regard to interface with government. We engaged with businesses on a regular basis, understood their concerns and sought to modify regulation to address their concerns. 


I have often emphasized that technology must be used to transform governance. Use of technology should minimize physical interface and assist time bound decision-making. I am glad to see that a number of Government Departments and State Governments are deploying technology to improve governance and deliver services. 


Alongwith the tools of technology we also need a complete change of mind-set while dealing with business. Total re-engineering is required both at the level of Mind and Machine. The past mindset of excessive control has to be replaced by the concept of minimum government, maximum governance. This is our goal and my Government is determined to achieve this objective. 


With this objective, an extensive exercise was undertaken to redesign laws and re-engineer government processes to make business environment simpler and more conducive. An attempt has been made to align the Indian regulatory environment to international best practices. Though, we were putting in efforts to improve India’s rank in the Doing Business Report, reforms undertaken by the Government are far more extensive. To give you one example; we have abolished more than 1200 archaic laws and Acts which were only complicating Governance. They have been deleted from the statute book. Similarly, thousands of important reforms have been carried out by the states as well. These additional efforts are not part of the World Bank’s requirement. 


All Ministries of the Central Government, Public Sector Undertakings, State Governments as well as regulators should identify international best practices, consult their stakeholders and align their regulations and processes with international best practices. I have no doubt that people working in these agencies are second to none in the world in respect of their capability and commitment to public service. 


Friends, even though this ranking is being called Ease of Doing Business but I consider it that along with Ease of Doing Business ranking it is also a raking for Ease of Living Life. Improvement in this ranking means that the lives of common man and the lives of middle class people of the country have become easier.

And I say that because whatever parameters have been used for this ranking most of them are related to the life of a common man, to the life of a youth of the country.

India’s ranking have improved so much because in the last three years the government has adopted the path of reforms to reduce the difficulties in the life of a common man of the country. The process of filing tax returns in the country has been reformed in a big way in the last three years. Now people don’t have to wait for getting the refunds as per income tax returns. Earlier you people were required to visit the offices several times for PF registration and for withdrawing money from PF account. Now everything is being done online.

My young friends can now register their new company in just one day. Hearing of commercial cases has been made easier. In the last three years it has become easier to obtain construction permit in India. Getting an electricity connection has become easier. The issuance of passport which earlier used to take months now it is being done in a week. If this is not Ease of Living Life then what it is? 

I must make a special mention of the fact that while Ease of Doing Business is important for all businesses, it is critical for small businesses including small manufacturers. This sector provides the bulk of employment in the country and to make them more competitive, we have to reduce the cost of doing business. The work on Ease of Doing Business must address the issues of these small businesses and manufacturers. 


Once again, let me congratulate the team working on various aspects of ease of doing business for their commitment and dedication. I am sure that together we will write a new chapter in India’s history and transform India so that the dreams and aspirations of our people take wing. 


I would like to thank the World Bank again for their guidance in our efforts to improve ease of Doing Business. I am told that the experience of bringing about decisive changes in a large country like India without affecting the growth process may become an example for many other nations. There is always scope to learn from others. If required, we will be happy to share our experience with other countries. 



Thank You! 

Thank You Very Much!!

                Excellencies,

Captains of Business and Industry,

Ladies & Gentlemen,

 

I am happy to be a part of this august gathering of global leaders and decision makers of the food processing sector.  I welcome you all to World Food India 2017.

This event will provide you a glimpse of the opportunities that await you, in India. It will showcase our potential in the food processing value chain. It will provide a platform to connect with various stakeholders, and collaborate for mutual prosperity. And, it will present to you, some of our most delightful cuisine, which has stimulated taste buds across the world.

Ladies and gentlemen.

India’s strengths in agriculture, are many and diverse.  The second largest arable land area, and as many as 127 diverse agro-climatic zones, give us global leadership in a number of crops like bananas, mangoes, guavas, papayas, and okra. We are second, globally, in terms of production of rice, wheat, fish, fruits and vegetables. India is also the world's biggest milk producer. Our horticulture sector has shown an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent annually over the last ten years.

For centuries, India has welcomed traders from distant lands, who came in search of our distinctive spices. Their travels to India, often shaped the course of history. Our trade synergies with Europe and South East Asia through the Spice Route are well known. Even Christopher Columbus was attracted to Indian spices, and reached America, as he searched for an alternate sea route to India.

Food processing is a way of life in India. It has been practiced for ages, even in the humblest of households. Simple, home-based techniques, such as fermentation, have resulted in the creation of our famous pickles, papads, chutneys and murabbas that now excite both the elite and the masses, across the world.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Let us turn, for a while, to the big picture.

India is today one of the fastest growing economies of the world. The Goods and Services Tax, or GST, has eliminated the multiplicity of taxes. India has jumped thirty ranks this year, in the World Bank Doing Business rankings. This is the highest ever improvement for India, and the highest jump for any country this year. From a rank of 142 in 2014, we have now reached the top 100.

India was ranked number one in the world in 2016 in greenfield investment. India is also rapidly progressing on the Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index.

Starting a new business in India is now easier than ever before. Procedures for obtaining clearances from various agencies have been simplified. Archaic laws have been repealed, and the burden of compliances has been reduced.

I now turn specifically, to food processing.

The Government has undertaken a range of transformational initiatives. India is now the most preferred investment destination in this sector. It is a priority sector in our “Make in India” programme.  100% FDI, is now permitted, for trading, including through e-commerce, of food products manufactured or produced in India. A single-window facilitation cell provides handholding for foreign investors. There are attractive fiscal incentives from the Union and State Governments. Loans to food and agro-based processing units, and cold chains, are classified under priority sector lending, making them easier and cheaper to obtain.

The unique portal – Nivesh Bandhu – or ""investor's friend"" – that we have just launched, brings together information on central and state government policies, and incentives provided for the food-processing sector. It maps resources upto the local level, with processing requirements. It is also a platform for business networking, for farmers, processors, traders, and logistics operators.

Friends.

Private sector participation has been increasing in many segments of the value chain. However, more investment is required in contract farming, raw material sourcing and creating agri linkages. Many international companies in India have taken a lead in contract farming initiatives. This is a clear opportunity for global super-market chains considering India as a major outsourcing hub.

On one hand, there are opportunities in post-harvest management, like primary processing and storage, preservation infrastructure, cold chain, and refrigerated transportation. On the other hand, there is immense potential for food processing and value addition, especially in niche areas such as organic and fortified foods.

Increasing urbanization, and a growing middle class, are resulting in an ever-growing demand for wholesome, processed food. Let me share just one statistic. Over a million passengers have a meal on a train in India, every single day. Each one of them, is a potential customer for the food processing industry. Such is the scale of opportunity that is waiting to be tapped.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Lifestyle disease is raising consciousness globally, about the nature and quality of food consumption. There is a growing aversion to the use of artificial colours, chemicals and preservatives. India can provide solutions, and offer a win-win partnership.

The combination of traditional Indian food, with modern technology, processing and packaging, can help the world rediscover the health benefits, and refreshing taste of Indian food ingredients such as turmeric, ginger, and tulsi, to name just a few. The perfect blend of hygienic, nutritious and tasty processed food, with the added benefits of preventive healthcare, can be produced economically, here in India.

 

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has been engaged in ensuring that processed food made in India, matches global quality standards. The harmonization of the food additives standards with Codex, and the building of robust testing and laboratory infrastructure, will go a long way in creating an enabling environment for food businesses.

Ladies and gentlemen.

The farmers, whom we respectfully call our ""Annadaata"" or the providers of food are central to our efforts in food processing. We have a stated target of doubling farm incomes within five years. Recently, we launched a national level programme, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana, to create world-class food processing infrastructure. This is expected to leverage investment of five billion US dollars, benefit two million farmers and generate more than half a million jobs over the next three years.

The creation of Mega Food Parks is a key component of this scheme. Through these food parks, we aim to link agro-processing clusters with key production centres. This will offer immense value proposition in crops such as potato, pineapple, oranges and apples. Farmer groups are being encouraged to set up units in these parks, thereby reducing wastage and transportation costs, and creating new jobs. Nine such parks are already operational, and more than thirty others are in the process of coming up across the country.

To improve last mile delivery, we are improving governance, by increasing access to digital technology. We plan to link our villages through broadband connectivity, within a clear timeframe. We are digitising land records, and providing various services to the people on mobile platforms. These steps are building momentum towards real-time transfer of information, knowledge and skills to farmers. The e-NAM, our national agricultural e-Market, is connecting our agricultural markets nationwide, thereby giving our farmers the benefit of competitive pricing, and freedom of choice.

In the true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism, our State Governments have also aligned with the efforts of the Union Government to simplify processes and procedures. Many States have come up with attractive food processing policies to attract investment. I urge each State of India to identify at least one food product for specialisation.  Similarly, each district can also select some food items for production, and one item for specialisation.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Today, our strong agricultural base provides us a solid launch pad to create a vibrant food processing sector. Our vast consumer base, rising incomes, favourable investment climate and a Government dedicated to ease of doing business, all make India ‘the place to be’ for the global food processing fraternity.

Each sub sector of the food industry in India offers immense opportunity. Let me give you some illustrations.

The dairy sector has emerged as a vital area for the rural economy. We now aim to take this to the next level by increasing production levels of multiple products based on milk.

Honey is nature's gift to mankind. It offers several valuable by-products, such as bee wax. It has the potential to increase farm incomes. Currently, we rank sixth in the production and export of honey. India is now ripe, for a sweet revolution.

India contributes over six per cent of global fish production. We are the world’s second largest exporter of shrimps. India exports fish and fisheries products to about 95 countries. We aim to make a big leap in the ocean economy through the blue revolution. Our focus is on development of untapped areas, such as ornamental fisheries and trout farming. We also wish to explore new areas, like pearl farming.

Our commitment to sustainable development, is at the heart of our thrust for organic farming. Sikkim, in north-eastern India, has become India's first fully organic state. The entire north-east offers opportunities to create functional infrastructure for organic produce.

Friends.

In order to be successful in Indian markets, understanding Indian food habits and tastes is a key requirement. To give you just one example, milk based products and fruit-juice based drinks are an intrinsic part of Indian food habits. That is why, I have been suggesting to manufacturers of aerated drinks, the potential of blending five per cent fruit juice in their products.

 

Food processing also holds solutions to nutrition security. For example, our coarse grains and millets have high nutritional value. They can also withstand adverse agro-climatic conditions. They can be called ""nutrition rich and climate smart"" crops. Can we take up a venture based on these? This will raise incomes of some of the poorest of our farmers, and also enhance our nutrition levels. Such products, shall, of course, find resonance across the world.

Can we link our potential, to the world's requirements? Can we link Indian traditions with the future of mankind? Can we connect India's farmers with markets around the world? These are some questions that I wish to leave you with.

I am confident that World Food India will help us take some concrete steps in this direction. It will also provide valuable insights into our rich culinary landscape, and highlight our ancient wisdom of food processing.

I am also happy to note that the Department of Post has released a set of twenty four commemorative postage stamps on this occasion, to illustrate the diversity of Indian cuisine.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I invite each one of you to become a part of the exciting growth journey of India's food processing sector. I assure you of my whole-hearted support, whenever required.

Come. Invest in India.

The place with unlimited opportunity from farm to fork.

The place to produce, process, and prosper.

For India, and for the world.

Thank You.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for transfer of all land assets owned by Hindustan Vegetable Oils Corporation Ltd (HVOC) to Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) or its authorized agency for appropriate utilization/ disposal.

In lieu of the transfer of the land assets of HVOC, complete liabilities of HVOC towards loans taken from the Government including interest would be written off. The Government shall also take care of all contingent liabilities of HVOC that may arise in future due to pending cases in various courts/tribunals/authorities.

The land located in seven cities are lying unutilized for many years. The transfer of the properties to MoHUA would enable use of the land for public purpose. This will facilitate early winding up of HVOC, which is a sick PSU under liquidation.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing and ratification of the Investment Cooperation and Facilitation Treaty (ICFT) between India and Brazil.

The Treaty will result in increase of investment flows between the two countries. The ICFT between India and Brazil will provide appropriate facilitation to Brazilian investors in India and Indian investors in the Brazil. It is likely to increase the comfort level and boost the confidence of investors by assuring a level playing field and non-discrimination in all investment facilitation matters, thus providing conducive investment climate to investors. It would help project India as a preferred Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) destination to all Brazilian investors.

        i.            Management of the CPSEs would be free to negotiate wage revision for workmen where the periodicity of wage settlement of five years or ten years has expired generally on 31.12.2016 keeping in view the affordability and financial sustainability of such wage revision for the CPSEs concerned.

     ii.            No budgetary support for any wage increase shall be provided by the Government. The entire financial implication would be borne by the respective CPSEs from their internal resources.

   iii.            In those CPSEs for which the Government has approved restructuring/  revival plan, the wage revision will be done as per the provisions of the approved restructuring / revival plan only.

   iv.            The management of the concerned CPSEs have to ensure that negotiated scales of pay do not exceed the existing scales of pay of executives/officers and non-unionized supervisors of respective CPSEs.

      v.            The Management of CPSEs where the five year periodicity is followed have to ensure that negotiated scales of pay for two successive wages negotiations do not exceed the existing scales of pay of executives/officers and non-unionized supervisors of respective CPSEs for whom ten years periodicity is being followed.

   vi.            To avoid conflict of pay scales of executives/non-unionised supervisors with that of their workmen, CPSEs may consider adoption of graded DA neutralization and/or graded fitment during the wage negotiations.
 

 vii.            CPSEs must ensure that any increase in wages after negotiations does not result in increase in administered prices of their goods and services.

viii.            The wage revision shall be subject to the condition that there shall be no increase in labour cost per physical unit of output. In exceptional cases where CPSEs are already working at optimum capacity, the administrative Ministry / Department may consult DPE considering industry norms.

   ix.            The validity period of wage settlement would be for a minimum period of five years for those who opted for a five year periodicity and for a maximum period of ten years for those who have opted for a ten year periodicity of wage negotiation w.e.f. 01.01.2017.

      x.            The CPSEs would implement negotiated wages after confirming with their Administrative Ministry/Department that the wage settlement is in conformity with approved parameters.

 

Background:

 

There are about 12.34 lakh employees in 320 CPSEs in the country. Out of these, about 2.99 lakh employees are Board level and below Board level executives and non-unionized Supervisors. The remaining about 9.35 lakh employees belong to the unionized workmen category. Wage revision in respect of unionized workmen is decided by trade unions and managements of CPSEs in terms of guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) for wage negotiations.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the revision in the salaries, gratuity, allowances, pension etc. of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts and retired Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts. It follows the implementation of recommendations of the 7thCentral Pay Commission in respect of Civil Servants. 

The approval will pave the way for necessary amendments in the two laws viz. Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958 and High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954, which govern the salaries of Chief Justice of India (CJI), Judges of Supreme Court of India, Chief Justices and all Judges of High Courts. 

The increase in the salary and allowances etc. will benefit 31 Judges of Supreme Court of India (including the CJI) and 1079 Judges(including the Chief Justices) of High Courts. Besides, approximately 2500 retired Judges will also be benefited on account of revision of pension/gratuity etc. 

Arrears on account of revised salaries, gratuity, pension and family pension w.e.f 01.01.2016 will be paid as one time lump sum payment. 

Background: 

Salaries, gratuity, pension, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court are governed by the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958. Salaries etc. of Judges of High Courts are governed by High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954. An amendment in the Acts is required whenever there is any proposal for revision of salaries/pension gratuity, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts. Therefore, Government proposes to move a Bill in the Parliament in the ensuing Session for amendment in the relevant Acts for giving effect to the revision of salaries and allowances.

 Background:

The National Foundation for Corporate Social Responsibility (NFCSR) at IICA is responsible for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved India's Membership for European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)



Necessary steps will be initiated by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance to acquire the membership of the EBRD.

 Impact:

·        Membership of EBRD would enhance India's international profile and promote its economic interests. Access to EBRD's Countries of Operation and sector knowledge.

·        India's investment opportunities would get a boost.

·        It would increase the scope of cooperation between India and EBRD through co-financing opportunities in manufacturing, services, Information Technology, and Energy.

·        EBRD's core operations pertain to private sector development in their countries of operation. The membership would help India leverage the technical assistance and sectoral knowledge of the bank for the benefit of development of private sector.

·        This would contribute to an improved investment climate in the country.

·        The membership of EBRD would enhance the competitive strength of the Indian firms, and provide an enhanced access to international markets in terms of business opportunities, procurement activities, consultancy assignments etc.

·        This would open up new vistas for Indian professionals on the one hand, and give a fillip to Indian exports on the other.

·        Increased economic activities would have the employment generating potential.

·        It would also enable Indian nationals to get the employment opportunity in the Bank.

 

Financial Implications:

 

The minimum initial investment towards the membership of EBRD will be approximately €1 (one) million. However, this assumption is based on India deciding to buy the minimum number of shares (100) required for obtaining the membership. If India were to buy a higher number of Bank shares, the financial implications could be higher. In-principle approval of the Cabinet at this stage is being obtained for joining the Bank.

 

Background

 

The issue relating to acquiring the membership of the ""European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)"" had been under consideration of the Government. With the country's impressive economic growth over the years and enhanced international political profile, it was considered appropriate that India should expand its presence on the global developmental landscape beyond its association with the Multi-lateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank. The decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB) was taken earlier in this backdrop.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for deputation of Group ‘A’ officers of Department .of Telecommunications (DoT) and other Ministries, with Telecommunication and Information Technology background, to Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. (TCIL) as per the following details: 

a) To allow Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) to fill up such number of posts by deputation of Group 'A' officers of the Department of Telecommunications(DoT) and other Ministries, with Telecommunication and Information Technology background, for the intervening period i.e. from 01.10.2016 till the approval of this proposal (earlier Cabinet approval was valid up to 30.09.2016) and for a further period of three years from the date of approval, as per DPE guidelines subject to maximum of 10% of the total number .of below Board level posts, in Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) with exemption from the rule of immediate absorption and

b) To allow that in future the issue of exemption of below Board Level Posts in Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) may be dealt in terms of DPE OM No. 18(6)/2001-GM-GL-77 dated 28.12.2005 so that such proposal is not required to be brought before the Cabinet. 

Background: 

TCIL is a leading ISO-9001: 2008 and ISO:2008 and 14001:2004 certified, Schedule-A, Mini Ratna Category-l Public Sector Undertaking (PSU). TCIL, a premier telecommunications consultancy and engineering company, with a strong base in Telecommunications & Information Technology, was incorporated in 1978 by Government of India with following objectives :- 

i. To provide world-class technology and Indian expertise globally in all fields of telecommunication, 

ii. To sustain, expand and excel in its operation in overseas/ Indian markets by developing proper marketing strategies. 

iii. To acquire State-of-the-Art technology on a continuing basis. 

TCIL, a 100% owned Govt. of India Undertaking, has executed projects in more than 70 countries in the domain of Telecommunications and Information Technology. It provides consultancy and turnkey project execution service from concept to completion, in the field of telecommunications, IT and civil infrastructure. The authorized capital of the company as on 31st March 2017 is Rs. 60 crores, while the paid up capital is Rs. 59.20 crores. 

TCIL is implementing the highly prestigious Pan-African e-Network in 48 countries which shall primarily provide Tele-education, Tele-Medicine and WIP connectivity to African Union member countries through optical fibre and satellite links since 2009. This project is a time bound project and involves comprehensive operation and maintenance till July 2021. In addition to the overseas projects, TCIL is executing a number of projects related to IT and Telecommunications at various places of India. The major projects under executions are procurement, supply, trenching, installation, testing and maintenance to facilitate exclusive optical NLD Backbone network for Defence and NFS Network for Indian Navy on turnkey basis, OPGW Project in J&K, DOP Rural ICT solution (RH) Project, Odisha (ICT) projects in 500 schools & 1500 schools, U.P., web based services across various states of India. Supplying of hardware and software to BBNL for project management works of NOFN project, etc. 

For execution of ongoing overseas/ inland projects besides expected projects in pipeline, TCIL requires experienced and talented senior officers of telecom and IT background as per the requirement of the projects handled by it, from time to time. By taking expert manpower on deputation, TCIL can remain competitive in national and international market as it is difficult for TCIL to get such manpower from the open market at the economical rates as compared to deputationist and that too at a short notice. Moreover, in case TCIL engage manpower from open market, it becomes a permanent liability on TCIL as against the deputationists, who remain with TCIL only for the project period for which their services are required. 

Accordingly, the Cabinet has allowed TCIL to fill up posts on deputation from Group 'A' officers of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and other Ministries, with Telecommunication and information Technology background for the intervening period i.e. from 01.10.2016 till the approval of this proposal (earlier Cabinet approval was valid up to 30.09.2016) and for a further period of three years from the date of approval as per DPE guidelines subject to maximum of 10% of the total number of below Board level posts in TCIL Cabinet has further allowed that in future the issue of exemption of below Board Level Posts in Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) may be dealt in terms of DPE OM No. 18(6)72001-GM-GL-77 dated 28.12.2.005.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the increase in the carpet area of houses eligible for interest subsidy under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for the Middle Income Group (MIG) under Pradhan MantriAwasYojana (Urban).

To further enhance the scope, coverage and outreach of the Scheme, the Cabinet has approved the following:

 i.     increasing the carpet area in the MIG I category of CLSS from the existing 90 square metre to ""up to 120 square metre"" and increasing the carpet area in respect of MIG II category of CLSS from the existing 110 square metre to ""up to 150 square metre""; and

  ii.    making the above change effective from 01.01.2017 i.e. the date the CLSS for MIG had become effective.

The CLSS for MIG is a pro-active step in meeting the challenges of urban housing shortage. It also is a pioneering step to enable the Middle Income Group to access the benefits of an interest subsidy scheme.

The CLSS for MIG covers two income segments in the MIG viz. Rs.6,00,001 to Rs.12,00,000 (MIG-I) and Rs.12,00,001 to Rs.18,00,000 (MIG-II) per annum. In

the MIG-1, an interest subsidy of 4% has been provided for loan amounts up to Rs.9 lakh while in MIG-2, an interest subsidy of 3% has been provided for loan amount of Rs.12 lakh. The interest subsidy will be calculated at 9% NPV over a maximum loan tenure of 20 years or the actual tenure, whichever is lesser.  Housing loans above 9 lakh and 12 lakh will be at non-subsidized rates.

The CLSS for MIG is currently effective up to 31.03.2019.

Impact

·         The limit of 120 sq m. and 150 sq m. is seen as a reasonable enhancement and would cater to the market generally scouted by the MIG belonging to the two income categories specified in the scheme.

·         The increase in carpet area will enable the Ml category of individuals to have a wider choice in Developers' projects.

·         The increased carpet area will also give a boost to the sale of ready built flats in the affordable housing segment.

 Background:

 Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for Middle Income Group (CLSS for MIG) under the Pradhan MantriAwasYojana (Urban) since 1.01.2017 pursuant to Hon'ble Prime Minister's address to the Nation on 31.12.2016 announcing increased benefits for poor people availing housing loans, and a new interest subsidy scheme for housing loans for the Middle Income Group (MIG).

The funds sharing pattern is 90:10 in respect of North Eastern and Himalayan States; and 100% in respect of Union Territories. This will help for completion of on-going projects for construction of 3,000 court halls and 1,800 residential units for judicial officers of District and Subordinate Courts.

Monitoring of the Scheme

An on-line monitoring system will be set up by the Department of Justice enabling data collection on progress, completion of court halls and residential units under construction as well as better asset management.

Regular meetings of the Monitoring Committee may be organised in various States with State Chief Secretaries and PWD officials to enable speedy and good construction. It may also be monitored if the funds released by the Centre are released without delay onward to PWD by the State Governments.

Background:

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for the creation of the posts of Chairman and Technical Members of the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) under GST, following up immediately on yesterday's sharp reduction in the GST rates of a large number of items of mass consumption.This paves the way for the immediate establishment of this apex body, which is mandated to ensure that the benefits of the reduction in GST rates on goods or services are passed on to the ultimate consumers by way of a reduction in prices.

The establishment of the NAA, to be headed by a senior officer of the level of Secretary to the Government of India with four Technical Members from the Centre and/or the States, is one more measure aimed at reassuring consumers that Government is fully committed to take all possible steps to ensure the benefits of implementation of GST in terms of lower prices of the goods and services reach them.

It may be recalled that effective from midnight of 14th November, 2017 the GST rate has been slashed from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings. There are now only 50 items which attract the GST rate of 28%. Likewise, a large number of items have witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12% and so on and some goods have been completely exempt from GST.

The ""anti-profiteering"" measures enshrined in the GST law provide an institutional mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits and reduced GST rates on supply of goods or services flow to the consumers. This institutional framework comprises the NAA, a Standing Committee, Screening Committees in every State and the Directorate General of Safeguards in the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC).

Affected consumers who feel the benefit of commensurate reduction in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular State. However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with 'All India' ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee. After forming a prima facie view that there is an element of profiteering, the Standing Committee shall refer the matter for detailed investigation to the Director General of Safeguards, CBEC, which shall report its findings to the NAA.

In the event the NAA confirms there is a necessity to apply anti-profiteering measures, it has the authority to order the supplier / business concerned to reduce its prices or return the undue benefit availed by it along with interest to the recipient of the goods or services. If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the recipient, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund. In extreme cases, the NAA can impose a penalty on the defaulting business entity and even order the cancellation of its registration under GST.

The constitution of the NAA shall bolster confidence of consumers as they reap the benefits of the recent reduction in GST rates, in particular, and of GST, in general.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following proposals of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion:

(a)     Development of Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (ECC), Dwarka and allied infrastructure in PPP and non-PPP Mode (including Exhibition & Convention spaces, arena, trunk-infrastructure, Metro/NHAI connectivity, hotels, office and retail spaces etc.) at an estimated cost of Rs. 25,703 crore by year 2025.

(b) Incorporation of a new Government company as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the implementation and development of the project with 100% equity from Government through Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. Government of India will provide budgetary support of Rs. 2037.39 crore to the SPV as equity over a period of 3 years to fund trunk infrastructure, a part of Exhibition centre, Foyer, Convention Centre, Metro connectivity, NHAI road connectivity including cost of land to be paid to DDA, water & Sewerage infrastructure, Railway land for Metro Connectivity and expenses towards other Non-PPP components.

(c)    Mobilization of Rs.1,381 crore from the market as Government guaranteed loan and utilization of Rs. 4,000 crore by way of monetization of Government-owned land and annual project revenue by the SPV. The proceeds from land monetization and annual returns accrued by the SPV will be utilized for funding the non-PPP components of the Project.

(d) DMICDC will act as a knowledge partner for the project on payment of an annual fee @1% of the yearly internal accruals, subject to a minimum of Rs. 5 crore and maximum of Rs.10 crore per annum for an initial period of 10 years.

(e) Board of the SPV will be authorized to approve revision in detailed cost estimates, break-up of quantities of project components, phasing of the project, change in scope etc. depending upon the requirement at various stages of project, within the overall approved financial limits. SPV would also be authorized to raise debt/ mobilize resources through land monetization depending upon market conditions.

Phase-1 of the project comprising trunk infrastructure along with Exhibition cum Convention Centre will be implemented and commissioned by December 2019. These will be implemented as non-PPP component. Phase-2 of the project comprising of the remaining Exhibition area will be implemented by 2025. The components comprising hotels, retail space and offices will be implemented in PPP mode.

It is estimated that the proposed ECC facility, once fully operational, will infuse a demand for more than 100 major international and local exhibition events annually. The number of persons visiting the exhibition facility annually (paying visitors) is estimated to be more than 10 million in the first phase (2019-20) and 23 million after completion of the second phase (2025). Similarly, convention based delegate attendance is estimated to cross 1.5 million annually after successful completion of second phase of the project.

Project is estimated to generate over five lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities. The job creation will happen in core ECC facilities as well as in supporting ECC land uses like retail, office and hospitality.

Background:

Conferences and Exhibitions are vital links to connect local manufacturers with global buyers and to serve as a platform for exchange of business ideas. India lacks an integrated world class facility which can meet the requirements of global exhibition-cum convention operators in terms of space, project facilities, transportation linkages, etc. at a large scale. Development of Exhibition-cum-Convention (ECC) Centre at Dwarka accompanied with supporting components, once fully operational is expected to bring New Delhi in the league of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore in the area of exhibition market.

The new paragraphs 4 and 5 being inserted into the existing Article 26 of the DTAA provide that the State from which information is requested cannot deny information on the ground that it has no domestic tax interest in that information or that the information requested is held by a bank or a financial institution, etc. The Protocol further empowers India to use information received under the DTAA to be used for other law enforcement purposes on the supplying State authorizing such use.

Background: 

The existing DTAA between India and Kyrgyz Republic was notified on 7/02/2001 and the same was in force since 10/01/2001. A Protocol amending DTAA between India and Kyrgyz Republic for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income has been agreed to be signed between the two countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing the Joint Interpretative Declaration (JID) between India and Colombia regarding the existing Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between India and Colombia signed on November 10, 2009.

The JID would impart clarity to the interpretation of the existing Agreement as itincludes interpretative notes to be jointly adopted for many clauses, including, the definition of investor, definition of investment, Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET), National Treatment (NT) and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment, expropriation, Investor - State Dispute Settlement provision and Denial of Benefits.

Joint Interpretative Declarations/Statements in general play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime. With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements is likely to have strong persuasive value before arbitration tribunals. Such pro-active approach by partners can foster a more predictable and coherent reading of treaty terms by arbitration tribunals.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded its approval for continuation and restructuring of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) to make it outcome-based, competitive and better monitored with increased focus on sustainability (functionality) of schemes to ensure good quality service delivery to the rural population.  

A sum of Rs. 23,050 crore has been approved for the programme for the Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) period 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The programme will cover all the Rural Population across the country. The restructuring will make the programme flexible, result-oriented, competitive, and will enable the Ministry towards to reach the goal of increasing coverage of sustainable Piped Water Supply.  

The details of the decision are as follows:

1.      National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) is to be continued co-terminus with the 14th Finance Commission cycle till March 2020.

2.      With the restructuring of the NRDWP, there will be 2% earmarking of funds for Japanese Encephalitis (JE) /Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) affected areas.

3.      A new Sub-programme under NRDWP viz. National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) which has been started by the Ministry  of Drinking Water and Sanitation in February 2017 will address the urgent need for providing clean drinking water in about 28000 Arsenic & Fluoride affected habitations (already identified). As per estimates, about Rs. 12,500 crore as Central share will be required over 4 years i.e. up to March, 2021. This is being funded from the allocation under NRDWP.

4.      Pre-financing for the agreed schemes, to the extent of half of the second instalment amount, will be made by the State Governments, which will be reimbursed later on from the central funding. If the State(s) fails to claim this amount before 30th November in the financial year, then, these funds will become a part of the common pool, which will be released to the high performing States, which have already pre-financed the requisite Government of India share on a first come first serve basis.

5.      Other half of second instalment of funds will be released to the States based on functionality status of completed piped water supply schemes, which will be evaluated through a third party.

6.      The Cabinet has approved Rs. 23,050 crore for the programme for the FFC period 2017-18 to 2019-20.

The NWQSM aims to cover all rural population in Arsenic/Fluoride affected habitations with clean drinking water on a sustainable basis by March 2021. States have been given more flexibility in utilization of NRDWP funds by reducing the number of components under the programme.

As per the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, about 77% of rural habitations in India have achieved a fully covered (FC) status (40 litres per capita per day) and 56% of the rural population have access to tap water through public stand posts within which 16.7% have household connections.

Background:

The NRDWP was started in 2009, with a major emphasis on ensuring sustainability (source) of water availability in terms of potability, adequacy, convenience, affordability and equity. NRDWP is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 50.50 fund sharing between the Centre and the States. Over the years, learning from the success achieved and the deficiencies felt during the implementation of NRDWP, certain modifications are needed in existing guidelines and procedure of release of funds to the States for making the programme more outcome-oriented and competitive.

Keeping in view the need to make the NRDWP more result-oriented, incentivize competition amongst States and focused on sustainability, a series of discussions were held with States, various stakeholders / domain experts / international institutions and NITI Aayog, some amendments in the guidelines of the programme have been introduced. These are giving more flexibility to the states in utilization of NRDWP funds by reducing the number of components under the programme. Focus on piped water supply, increase level of service delivery, thrust on coverage of water quality affected habitations (National Water Quality Sub-Mission to tackle Arsenic & Fluoride affected habitations, JE / AES areas), coverage of Open Defecation Free (ODF) declared villages, SAGY GPs, Ganga GPs, Integrated Action Plan (IAP) districts, Border Out Posts (BOP) with piped water supply and Institutional set up for proper O&M of water supply assets etc. have been introduced.

·         The entrance examinations will be conducted in online mode at least twice a year, thereby giving adequate opportunity to candidates to bring out their best. 

·         In order to serve the requirements of the rural students, it would locate the centres at sub-district/district level and as far as possible would undertake hands-on training to the students.

Constitution:

·         NTA will be chaired by an eminent educationist appointed by MHRD.

The amendment seeks to grant retrospective recognition to the Central/State/Union Territory funded Institutions/Universities conducting Teacher Education Courses without NCTE recognition till the academic year 2017-2018. The retrospective recognition is being given as a onetime measure so as to ensure that the future of the students passed out/enrolled in these institutions are not jeopardized.

With a view to achieve above mentioned benefits, Deptt. of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development has brought about this amendment.

Further, the courses of such recognised Institutions/Universities have to be permitted under section 15, of the NCTE Act.

NCTE wrote to all Central Universities and /State Obvernrnents / State Universities / District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) informing them about the legal provisions making it mandatory to seek prior permission for starting Teacher Education Courses and giving them time till 31-03-2017 to inform NCTE if any such Institution/University is running a course without permission of NCTE, for a one-time resolution of past issues.

Background:

In order to achieve the objectives of the Act, separate provisions have been, made in the Act, for recognising Teacher Education courses and to lay down guidelines for compliance by recognized Institutions/Universities.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for expansion of the schemes of Ministry of Women and Child Development under Umbrella Scheme ""Mission for Protection and Empowerment for Women"" for a period 2017-18 to 2019-20. CCEA has also given approval to the new scheme called ‘Pradhan Mantri Mahila Shakti Kendra', which will empower rural women through community participation to create an environment in which they realize their full potential. Expansion under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has also been approved based on the successful implementation in 161 districts.

The financial outlay during 2017-18 to 2019-20 will be Rs.3,636.85 crore with a Central Share of approximately Rs.3,084.96 crore.

Benefits of the Scheme:

The approved sub-schemes are social sector welfare schemes especially for care, protection and development of women. It will also aim at improvement in declining Child Sex Ratio; ensuring survival. & protection of the girl child; ensuring her education, and empowering her to fulfil her potential. It will provide an interface for rural women to approach the government for availing their entitlements and for empowering them through training and capacity building. Student volunteers will encourage the spirit of voluntary community service and gender equality. These students will serve ""agents of change"" and have a lasting impact on their communities and the nation.

Major activities of the Umbrella Scheme:

The new scheme ""Pradhan Mantri Mahila Shakti Kendra (PMMSK)"" is envisaged to work at various levels. While, National level (domain based knowledge support) and State level (State Resource Centre for Women) structures will provide technical support to the respective government on issues related to women, the District and Block level Centres will provide support to PMMSK and also give a foothold to BBBP in 640 districts to be covered in a phased manner.

Community engagement through Student Volunteers is envisioned in 115 most backward districts as part of the PMMSK Block level initiatives. Student volunteers will play an instrumental role in awareness generation regarding various important government schemes/ programmes as well as social issues. More than 3 lakh student volunteers from local colleges will be engaged in this process, while association with NSS/NCC cadre students will also be an option for contributing to nation building as responsible citizens. This will provide an opportunity to Student Volunteers to participate in the development process by bringing change in their own communities and ensuring that women are not left behind and are equal partners in India's progress.

The outcome based activities of student volunteers will be monitored through web based system. On completion, certificates for community service, will be displayed on national portal for verification and can also be used as resource /asset for the participating students in future.

Expansion and intensification of efforts have also been approved for Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) through sustained nation-wide Advocacy and Media Campaign in 640 districts and focused multi-sectoral action .in selected 405 districts. All low CSR districts shall be taken up in the first year itself under BBBP. To provide support to working women 190 more Working Women Hostels to accommodate approximately 19,000 additional working women will be set up. Additional Swadhar Grehs have been approved to provide relief and rehabilitation of approximately 26,000 beneficiaries.

To provide comprehensive support to women affected by violence, One Stop Centres (OSCs) will be established in 150 additional districts during the period. These one stop Centres will be linked with women helpline and will provide 24 hour emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence both in public and private space across the country. A unique initiative involving engagement of Manila Police Volunteers (MPVs) on a voluntary basis in States/UTs will. also be done to create public-police interface, which will be expanded to 65 districts covering all States /UTs.

Monitoring and Evaluation of the Scheme:

One common Task Force shall be created at National, State and district level for planning, reviewing and monitoring all the sub-schemes in this Umbrella, with the objective of ensuring convergence of action and cost efficiency. Every scheme shall have a set of clear, focussed target set forth in the guidelines, aligned with SDGs. Mechanism for monitoring of outcome based indicators for all the sub-schemes as suggested by NITI Aayog will be put in place. The schemes will be implemented through the States/UTs and Implementing Agencies. All the sub-schemes have inbuilt monitoring structure at the Central Level, State, District and Block level.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for removal of prohibition on export of all types of pulses to ensure that farmers have greater choice in marketing their produce and in getting better remuneration for their produce. 

The CCEA also empowered the Committee chaired by Secretary, Department of Food & Public Distribution (DFPD) and comprising Secretaries of Department of Commerce (DoC), Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Revenue (DoR), Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) and Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to review the export/import policy on pulses and consider measures such as quantitative restrictions, prior registration and changes in import duties depending on domestic production and demand, domestic and international prices and international trade volumes. 

Opening of export of all types of pulses will help the farmer to dispose off their products at remunerative prices and also encourage them to expand the area of sowing. Export of pulses would provide an alternative market for the surplus production of pulses. Allowing export of pulses will also help the country and its exporters to regain their markets. 

It is expected that pulses production will be sustained in the country and our import dependence on pulses will come down substantially. This is also likely to provide higher levels of protein to the population and work towards nutritional security. The integration with global supply chain is also likely to help our farmers in adopting good agricultural practices and better productivity. 

In 2016-17 production year, the Indian farmers have lived up to the challenge of reducing India's import dependence on pulses and have produced 23 million tons of pulses. The Government has taken a number of steps to sustain the high pulses production by our farmers. The Government has procured 20 lakh tons of pulses by ensuring minimum support price or market rates, whichever is higher, directly from the farmers and this has been the highest ever procurement of pulses. 

Background: 

The production of pulses in 2016-17 has been very encouraging and is the highest ever till date. Government has supported the farmers by providing attractive Minimum Support Price (MSP) for the pulses and public procurement of pulses to the tune of 20 lakh tonnes. The domestic production of pulses during 2016-17 was 22.95 million tonnes. The Chana Dal (Gram) production was 9.33 million tonnes as compared to 7.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 showing a growth of 32%. The production of other rabi pulses (includes Masoor Dal (Lentil) etc.) for 2016-17 was 3.02 million tonnes as compared to 2.47 million tonnes in 2015-16 showing a growth of 22%. For the year 2017-18, the Government has fixed a target of 22.90 million tonnes of pulses production.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved to utilize part of stock of pulses in the buffer maintained by the Department of Consumer Affairs, for meeting the protein component under various schemes of Central Government providing nutrition to various target groups/beneficiaries. To give effect to the decision, the CCEA has empowered the concerned Departments/Ministries to carry out suitable amendments in their schemes/guidelines to enable them to take/provide pulses from the buffer in kind under their respective Schemes.

The disposal through the Central Government Schemes is in addition to the disposal of pulses from the buffer through open market sale and supply to States.

All the concerned Ministries/Departments will make necessary changes in their schemes and assess requirement of pulses within next three months of the approval. Supply of pulses from the Central buffer would commence based on such requirement indicated by these Ministries/Departments.

The objective of the approval is to enable the concerned administrative Ministries/Departments to ensure that pulses from the buffer are utilized as in 'kind' component of the Centre's contribution in such schemes, in lieu of its financial contribution of equivalent amount. The concerned Departments may revert to the current system of making nutrition available only in case of non-availability of pulses in the buffer. Ministries/Departments or their agencies providingfood/catering/hospitality services have also been enabled to make suitable provision in their Commercial arrangement(tenders/contracts) to ensure that the requirements of pulses for such operations are met through the central buffer.

The approval will also help ensure adequate supply of nutrients/pulses under the various schemes/programmes of Government including Mid DayMeal(MDM) scheme, hospitals, etc. as well as Ministries/Departments or their agencies providing food/catering/hospitality services.

For a sustainable buffer operation, availability of regular and assured channels of disposal wherein a committed quantity is taken/lifted from the buffer at regular periodicity may be of critical importance. This would facilitate optimal utilization and efficient management of pulses in buffer through regular/planned rotation of pulses and replacement of stock through fresh crop on continual basis.

The cost of pulses supplied to States would, in no case, be higher than the market price, protecting their interest as well.

Background:

The buffer of up to 20 Lakh MT has been created to enableeffective market intervention by government, discourage marketmanipulation and provide cushion against price rise to consumers. It may incentivize farmers and encourage production of pulses as well.

As the buffer of pulses serves the interests of both consumers and farmers, ensuring its attainability and efficient operation is importantfor the welfare of these stakeholders. For a sustainable bufferoperation, availability of regular and assured channels of disposalwherein a committed quantity Is taken/lifted from the buffer at regular periodicity may be of critical importance. This would facilitate effectivemanagement of the buffer. Such assured channel for disposal of pulses may be provided by the Central GovernmentMinistries/Departments and their agencies that are operating Schemesunder which food and nutrition is being provided to the beneficiaries e.g. Mid Day Meals. This would also facilitate nutritional security.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the continuation of Rashtriya Krishi VikasYojana (RKVY) as Rashtriya Krishi VikasYojana- Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR) for three years i.e. 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The financial allocation of the scheme will be Rs. 15,722 crorewith the objective of making farming as a remunerative economic activitythrough strengthening the farmer's effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri­business entrepreneurship.

 

RKVY-RAFTAAR funds would be provided to the States as 60:40 grants between Centre and States (90:10 for North Eastern States and Himalayan States) through the following streams:

 

(a)          Regular RKVY-RAFTAAR (Infrastructure & Assets and Production Growth) with 70%of annual outlay to be allocated to states as grants based for the following activities:

                                i.            Infrastructure and assets with 50% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay.

                              ii.            Value addition linked production projects with 30% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay.

                            iii.            Flexi-funds with 20% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay. States can use this for supporting any projects as per the local needs.

 

(b)          RKVY-RAFTAAR special sub-schemes of National priorities - 20% of annual outlay; and

 

(c)          Innovation and agri-entrepreneur development through creating end-to-end solution, skill development and financial support for setting up the agri-enterprise -10% of annual outlay including 2% of administrative costs.

            The scheme will incentivize States in enhancing more allocation to Agriculture and Allied Sectors.  This will also strengthen farmer’s efforts through creation of agriculture infrastructure that help in supply of quality inputs, market facilities etc.  This will further promote agri-entrepreneurship and support business models that maximize returns to farmers.

 

Background:

 

RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) is a continuing scheme under implementation from XI Five Year Plan. The scheme provides considerable flexibility and autonomy to States in planning and executing programmes for incentivizing investment in agriculture and allied sectors. States initiate the process of decentralized planning for agriculture and allied sectors through preparation of District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) and State Agriculture Plan (SAP) based on agro-climatic conditions, availability of appropriate technology and natural resources to ensure accommodation of local needs, cropping pattern, priorities etc. RKVY has also enabled adoption of national priorities without affecting the autonomy and flexibility of States through sub-schemes.  National priorities like Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), Crop Diversification Program (CDP), Reclamation of Problem Soil (RPS), Foot & Mouth Disease - Control Program (FMD-CP), Saffron Mission, Accelerated Fodder Development Programme, etc. are being implemented through the window of RKVY.

 

During XI Plan and XII Plan, States have taken over 13,000 projects in agriculture and allied sector through State Agriculture Department as Nodal Implementing Agency. The interim report of RKVY evaluation done by Institute of Economic Growth summarises that the income emanating from agriculture measured as the agricultural state domesticproduct (AGSDP) is higher in the post-RKVY period than in the pre-RKVY period. Further, almost all the states registered higher value of output from agriculture and allied activities in the post-RKVY period. Continuation of RKVY-RAFTAAR will therefore keep the momentum of agriculture and allied sector growth.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has accorded the ex-post facto approval for implementation of Special Banking Arrangement (SBA) for Rs. 10,000 crore for payment of outstanding claims on account of fertilizer subsidy in the year 2016-17. CCEA has also approved that, in future, Department of Fertilizers would avail the SBA with the concurrence of Department of Expenditure.

Under the SBA, a total loan of Rs. 9,969 crore for settlement of outstanding subsidy bills with SBI was raised by the Government. The loan amount along with interest liability on the part of Government amounting to Rs. 80.90 crore were paid to SBI.

SBA for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore for the year 2016-17 has already been implemented/ operationalised to overcome the liquidity problems of the fertilizer companies.

Background:

Government is making available fertilizers, namely Urea and 21 grades of P&K fertilizers to farmers at subsidized prices through fertilizer manufacturers/importers. For making funds available to the fertilizer companies against their subsidy claims, Ministry of Finance had approved SBA for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore with Government interest liability limited to G-Sec rate. Accordingly, an SBA was worked out with SBI for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore to meet the outstanding subsidy claims of fertilizer companies. The loan together with Government interest thereon has been repaid from BE 2017-18 within the sanctioned budget.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the revision in the price of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme for supply to the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies. The revised price of ethanol would be fixed at Rs.40.85/- per litre under EBP and will be applicable for the forthcoming sugar season 2017-18. GST and transportation charges will also be payable additionally. The revised price will be applicable during ethanol supply period from 1st December 2017 to 30th November, 2018.

The approval will facilitate the continued policy of the Government in providing price stability and remunerative prices for ethanol suppliers. It will also help in reducing dependency on crude oil imports, saving in foreign exchange and benefits to the environment.

Background:

In order to augment the supply of ethanol, the Government in December, 2014, decided to administer the price of ethanol under EBP Programme. The Government fixed the delivered price of ethanol during ethanol supply year 2014-15 & 2015-16 in the range of Rs.48.50 to Rs.49.50 per litre including Central/State Government taxes and transportation charges. It improved significantly the supply of ethanol from 38 crore litres during ethanol supply year 2013-14 to 111 crore litres during 2015-16.

This price was re-examined for ethanol supply year 2016-17 in the context of firming of sugar prices and falling crude prices and consequent under-recoveries of OMCs. The Ex-Mill price was revised to Rs.39/- per litre. Additionally, Central/State Government taxes and transportation charges were payable. It is estimated that for ethanol supply year 2016-17, about 65 crore litres of ethanol will be procured.

Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 which has been extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union Territories to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also sought to reduce import dependency for energy requirements.

However, since 2006, OMCs were not able to receive offers for the required quantity of ethanol against the tenders floated by them due to various constraints like State Specific issues, Supplier related issues including Pricing issues of ethanol.

OMCs have to start the ethanol procurement process for the upcoming sugar season 2017-18 for which ethanol pricing under EBP Programme needs to be decided.

This scheme would give opportunity to farmers, collectors, traders and other stakeholders to get their raw material certified, Minister further said. 

The AYUSH Minister further explained that More than 80% Medicinal plants are sourced from the forest and this area have the potential of generating lot of employment opportunities. He said that the fringe areas of rich biodiversity sites are inhabited by the poorest of the poor, whose incomes can be augmented by a comprehensive strategy aimed at capacity building, provision of value addition facilities and structuring an interface between the community and industry. 

Shri Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary Ministry of AYUSH; former Secretary of AYUSH Shri Ajit M Sharan; Ms. Shomita Biswas CEO, National Medicinal Plants Board were also present on this occasion. 

During the Inaugural session the Minister also launched the “Voluntary Certification Scheme of Medicinal Plants Produce (VCSMPP)”, designed by NMPB through Quality Councils of India (QCI).

                AstroSat, India’s multi-wavelength space telescope, has successfully accomplished the extremely difficult task of measuring X-ray polarisation. In a paper published in ‘Nature Astronomy’, the team has documented the results of their eighteen-month study of the Crab pulsar in the Taurus Constellation and measured the variations of polarisation as this highly magnetised object spins around 30 times every second. This landmark measurement puts up a strong challenge to prevailing theories of high energy X-ray emission from pulsars.

6.         Attention of all print media is also drawn to the following guidelines issued by Press Council of India on 30.07.2010 to be followed for observance during the election:

(i)        It will be the duty of the Press to give objective reports about elections and the candidates. The newspapers are not expected to indulge in unhealthy election campaigns, exaggerated reports about any candidate/party or incident during the elections. In practice, two or three closely contesting candidates attract all the media attention. While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

(ii)       Election campaign along communal or caste lines is banned under the election rules. Hence, the Press should eschew reports, which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between people on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language.

(iii)      The Press should refrain from publishing false or critical statements in regard to the personal character and conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature or withdrawal of any candidate or his candidature, to prejudice the prospects of that candidate in the elections. The Press shall not publish unverified allegations against any candidate/party.

(iv)      The Press shall not accept any kind of inducement, financial or otherwise, to project a candidate/party. It shall not accept hospitality or other facilities offered to it by or on behalf of any candidate/party.

(v)       The Press is not expected to indulge in canvassing of a particular candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of reply to the other candidate/party.

(vi)      The Press shall not accept/publish any advertisement at the cost of public exchequer regarding achievements of a party/government in power.

(vii)     The Press shall observe all the directions/orders/instructions of the Election Commission/Returning Officers or Chief Electoral Officer issued from time to time.

7.         Attention of the electronic media is also invited to the “Guidelines for Election Broadcasts” issued by NBSA dt 3rd March, 2014.

(i)                 News broadcasters should endeavour to inform the public in an objective manner, about relevant electoral matters, political parties, candidates, campaign issues and voting processes as per rules and regulations laid down under The Representation of the People Act 1951 and by the Election Commission of India.

 

(ii)        News channel shall disclose any political affiliations, either towards a party or candidate. Unless they publicly endorse or support a particular party or candidate, news broadcasters have a duty to be balanced and impartial, especially in their election reporting.

 

(iii)       News broadcasters must endeavour to avoid all forms of rumor, baseless speculation and disinformation, particularly when these concern specific political parties or candidates. Any candidate/political party, which has been defamed or is a victim of misrepresentation, misinformation or other similar injury by broadcast of information should be afforded prompt correction, and where appropriate granted an opportunity of reply.

 

(iv)       News broadcasters must resist all political and financial pressures which may affect coverage of elections and election related matters.

 

(v)        News broadcasters should maintain a clear distinction between editorial and expert opinion carried on their news channels.

 

(vi)       News broadcasters that use video feed from political parties should disclose it and appropriately tag it.

 

(vii)      Special care must be taken to ensure that every element of a news/programmes dealing with elections and election related matters is accurate on all facts relating to events, dates, places and quotes. If by mistake or inadvertence any inaccurate information is broadcast, the broadcaster must correct it as soon as it comes to the broadcaster’s notice with the same prominence as was given to the original broadcast.

 

(viii)     News broadcasters, their journalists and officials must not accept any money, or gifts, or any favour that could influence or appear to influence, create a conflict of interest or damage the credibility of the broadcaster or their personnel.

 

(ix)       News broadcasters must not broadcast any form of  ‘hate speech’ or other obnoxious content that may lead to incitement of violence or promote public unrest or disorder as election campaigning based on communal or caste factors is prohibited under Election laws. News broadcasters should strictly avoid reports which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred among people, on the ground of religion, race, caste, community, region or language.

 

(x)        News broadcasters are required to scrupulously maintain a distinction between news and paid content. All paid content should be clearly marked as “Paid Advertisement” or “Paid Content” : and paid content must be carried in compliance with the  “Norms & Guidelines on Paid News” dated 24.11.2011.

 

(xi)       Special care must be taken to report opinion polls accurately and fairly, by disclosing to viewers as to who commissioned, conducted and paid for the conduct of the opinion polls and the broadcast. If a news broadcaster carries the results of an opinion poll or other election projection, it must also explain the context, and the scope and limits of such polls with their limitations. Broadcast of opinion polls should be accompanied by information to assist viewers to understand the poll’s significance, such as the methodology used, the sample size, the margin of error, the fieldwork dates, and data used. Broadcasters should also disclose how vote shares are converted to seat shares.

 

(xii)      The Election Commission of India (ECI) will monitor the broadcasts made by news broadcasters from the time elections are announced until the conclusion and announcement of election results. Any violation by member broadcasters reported to the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) by the Election Commission will be dealt with by the NBSA under its regulations.

 

(xiv)     Broadcasters should, to the extent possible, carry voter education programmes to effectively inform voters about the voting process, the importance of voting, including how, when and where to vote, to register to vote and the secrecy of the ballot.

 

(xv)      News broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results until such results are formally announced by the Returning Officer, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.

 

       The above guidelines should be duly observed for compliance by all concerned.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said Indian agriculture has made rapid growth in food, fruits, vegetables, dairy and fishery production.  The Minister was speaking at the inauguration of two-day national level workshop on Peri-Urban Agriculture, organized by Haryana Agriculture Department.  He further said that the unprecedented development in agricultural production is setting an example for the world and they are trying to learn our techniques and adopt them. He said, in the last three years, the Ministry has developed innovative schemes, provided necessary funds and made policy-making decisions which had a far-reaching effect on the agriculture sector.



Shri Singh said to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022, set by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Ministry is not only working towards increasing the production but also focusing on proper processing techniques, traffic, and market expansion to make agriculture profitable. He said under Peri-Urban Agriculture small and large-scale agricultural production will be done in and around the cities.

The Agriculture Minister further said that Peri-Urban Agriculture can help in climate change adaptation through diversification of food resources for the urban population.  Shri Singh said due to rapid urbanization in the past years, demand for vegetables, fruits and flowers is constantly increasing in these areas. Peri-Urban Agriculture can contribute to price stabilization through the development of important local food production centres of the diversified food system. This will reduce the burden on transport, and help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cold storages.

Shri Singh said that, we are developing a system that will supply food to cities from 100 to 200 km. This will help in creating attractive employment option and prevent the conversion of agricultural land near urban areas into cities and towns. The government is promoting quality in agriculture through food processing and in this regard  Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana has been launched with an allocation of Rs.6,000 crore rupees.

The Minister said that Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) has helped in production and productivity, post-harvest management and marketing by providing assistance in the production of quality seeds,  protected agriculture, vegetable and organic farming.

Shri Singh said that, cow and buffaloes rearing around the cities for milk is an ancient practice. Ministry of Agriculture has implemented important schemes to promote milk production. The Minister added said that Rashtriya Gokul Mission was launched in December 2014 to conserve and develop indigenous breeds in a focused and scientific manner.

                Union Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh today on the occasion of National Milk Day said that India is the ‘Oyster' of the global dairy industry with opportunities galore for the entrepreneurs globally. Since last 15 years, India continues to be the largest producer of milk in the world. This phenomenal increase is contributed to the several measures initiated by the Government of India to increase the productivity of livestock.

Shri Singh said that increasing the milk production significantly from 137.7 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 164 million tonnes in 2016-17. Milk production increased by 18.81% in 2016-17 when compared to 2013-14. Similarly, the per capita availability of milk increased from 307 gram in 2013-14 to 351 gram in 2016-17.  Annual growth rate of Milk Production during the period 2011-14 was 4%, which has increase to 6% during 2014-17. The annual growth rate of world milk production has increased by 2% during 2014-17.

On this occasion the Minister said that Livestock sector contributes significantly towardslivelihoods and security net for the landless and marginal farmers. About 70 million rural households are engaged in dairying in India with 80% of total cow population. The strength of women in Dairy has reached to the 70% of the total work force (about 44 lakh) of which 3,60,000 women are in leadership roles in village dairy cooperatives and 380 women on the boards of Union and State Federations.

Union Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Minister said that the consumption of milk is rising, commensurate with increase in the purchasing power of people, increasing urbanization, changing food habits & life styles and demographic growth. Milk with its varied benefits is the only source of animal protein for the largely vegetarian population of the country. Further, factors such as increased consumer interest in high protein diets and increasing awareness & availability of value-added dairy products through organised retail chains are also driving its demand. During last 15 years, Milk Cooperatives have converted about 20% of milk procured into traditional and value added products that offers about 20% higher revenue.This share of value-added products is estimated to increase to 30% by 2021-22.

Shri Singh informed that the Government has initiated a number of dairy development schemes so that the enhanced demand due to variety of factorsis met through domestic sources by laying special focus on raising milk production through improved productivity of our dairy animals.  A new scheme “Rashtriya Gokul Mission” has been initiated for the first time in the country under which 18 Gokul Grams in 12 different States are being set up.  Also two awards ‘Gopal Ratna Award’ for upkeep of the best dairy animals of indigenous  breeds and ‘Kamdhenu Award’ for institutions maintaining best herd of indigenous breeds.  This year on World Milk Day 10 Gopal Ratna and 12 Kamdhenu awards have been awarded.  Two “National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres” one each in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are being setup for conservation of indigenous breeds.  In these centres 41 cattle and 13 buffalo breeds would be conserved.  In order to make dairy business more profitable “National Bovine Productivity Mission” has been in initiated with creation of e Pashuhaat portal.  This is playing an important role in linking milk producers and breeders for indigenous breeds.

Union Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Minister further said that a scheme titled Dairy Processing & Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF) for dairy cooperative sector has been initiated with an outlay of Rs.10881 crore.  This scheme would focus on creation of additional milk processing infrastructure and chilling infrastructure through setting up of Bulk Milk Coolers.  Also provisions have been made for providing Electronic milk adulteration testing equipment and facilities for manufacturing value added products.

Shri singh said that, with gradual shift towards a technology driven environment, there is a great need for adopting advance systems and strengthening the existing one to meet the future challenges. The National Action Plan Vision-2022 is being prepared to fill the gaps in the infrastructure required to handle the increased coverage and milk production not only to meet the demand of milk and milk products but also to fulfil the objective of doubling the farmers’ income.

                Burning of crop residue in the states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan also contributes in increasing environmental pollution levels.  National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi government and these four northern states to take strict measures to deal with this serious biennial threat.

·         In this regard, Agriculture Ministry issued an advisory to the state governments to create awareness among the farmers about the harmful effect of straw burning.  


	Facilitate farmers residue management machines and equipment such as Zero Till Seed Drill, Happy Seeder, Straw Baler, Rotavator, Paddy Straw Chopper/ Mulcher, Gyro Rake, Straw Reaper, Shredder, etc., to through Custom Hiring Centres or village level Farm Machinery Banks.
	The State Governments have also been directed that Rs. 4000/ Hectare shall be used from the funds available for demonstration of machines under Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization for demonstration of straw management machinery at farmers’ fields.


For crop residue management, under Sub-Mission on Agriculture Mechanization, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare have allocated funds to the four states

                Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said India is one of the oldest organic agricultural nations of the world and a large part of the country still practices traditional organic farming. Shri Singh said it today at the inauguration of Organic World Congress 2017 at India Expo Centre in Greater Noida. The event, organized by International Federation of Organic Farming Movements (IFOAM) and OAFI, will see the participation of 1,400 representatives from 110 countries, and 2000 Indian delegates.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said currently, 22.5 lakh hectares have been brought under organic farming and 3,60,400 farmers have been benefited by Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana. Now, the aim is to bring 50,000-hectare area under organic farming in the northeast region. So far 45,863 hectares have been brought under organic farming, 2,406 Farmers Interest Group (FIG) have been created and 44,064 farmers have been linked to the scheme against the target of 2,500 FIG.

Shri Singh said that in Uttar Pradesh, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana was launched in 2015-16 and so far 28,750 farmers have been benefited from 28750 acres of land. For the marketing of organic products, the government is allocating Rs.5 lakh per district for the setting up of sales outlet.

Union Agriculture Minister said some international scientists call such farming “default organic”, however, it is important to understand that often farmers, who continue with these methods, are organic farmers by choice. Using their wisdom, they have been treading this path for centuries. They are not happy with chemicals and pesticides and choose not to use them. Therefore, their farming practices cannot be called “default” in any way.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Government acknowledges that indiscriminate and excessive use of chemicals during last several decades has posed a question - how long can we continue to do farming like this? The environment and social and economic issues are linked to chemical fertilizer based farming and it needs our attention. Shri Singh said that Food Security is not an issue anymore in the country, but we still have the challenge of providing healthy and nutritious food to the growing population.

We have become dependent on chemical farming and the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals have increased the production but at the same time excessive use of chemicals has led to the production of unhealthy crops. Shri Singh said that if we analyze the adverse effects of indiscriminate use of these chemicals on the environment, we realize a large part of chemical is absorbed by the soil, air, and plants. Spraying of chemicals pollutes far away plants. Also, these chemicals seep into the ground and pollute water sources.

Union Agriculture Minister said the use of chemicals has led to climate change and created ecological imbalance and it is affecting human beings too. For the sake of soil health, sustainable production, and healthy and nutritious food for people, organic farming has become a national and global requirement.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the unprecedented and multi-faceted development of Indian agriculture post-independence is unparalleled. Shri Singh said the world is eager to study and adapt our growth strategy. The Agriculture Minister said it today while addressing a conference on Fruits & Vegetables, Dairy, Poultry & Fisheries - Leveraging the Diverse India Opportunity at World Food India 2017 in New Delhi.

The Agriculture Minister said that at the time of independence, we were unable to feed 34 crore population, but today, thanks to the hard work and wisdom of our policymakers, farmers, scientists, and food production officers, we have moved ahead among the countries suffering from food shortages and not only providing food to 134 million population but have also become a food exporter.

Shri Singh said that with just two percent of the world's land we are not just feeding 17 percent of the global population, 11.3 percent livestock and vast genetic inheritance, but also exporting food. He said that today we are the world's largest milk producer, second largest fruits and vegetable producer, third in the production of fish and holds fifth place in egg production.

Shri Singh said that at the time of Independence, per capita of milk supply was 130 gram per day to the 34 million population and today per capita of milk supply has increased to 337-gram milk per day to 134 million people. This is an incomparable achievement in milk production. The Minister further said that we export a lot of agricultural commodities which is about 10 percent of the country's total exports.

The World Food India, which is being organized in the national capital, is a unique platform where delegates from 60 countries of the world will not only understand but also assess our progress.

The Agriculture Minister said that special emphasis has been given to the overall agricultural growth. The Government has taken various steps to increase the agricultural sector's growth rate. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, e-NAM, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card are some of our key schemes. The Government has allowed 100% FDI in food processing.

Shri Singh said that the Government is implementing Horticulture Development for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) scheme for the Integrated Horticulture Development Mission & Integrated Horticulture Development Mission, which includes various cold chain such as Pack Houses/ Central Sorting, Pr-Cooling, Reefer Vehicle, Primary processing units and Ripening chambers. It also includes processing units in the North-Eastern and Himalayan states.

Under MIDH, 4392 cold storages/ CA Stores of 19.47 million MT capacity, 20710 Farm Pack Houses, 411 Referral Transport, 408 Ripening Chambers, 4414 Primary Processing Units, and 101 Precooling Units have been set up as on March 31, 2017.

The Agriculture Minister said that under the MIDH, the State is promoting the Horticulture Mission, Horticulture crops / Farm level programs to develop the collective area of fruits and vegetables including processing varieties in the field of Mega Food Parks and Export Promotion Areas. In 2016-17, export of horticultural product was 5.03 million MT (Fresh fruits and vegetables - 4.16 million MT, processed fruit, and vegetable - 0.88 million MT, flower farming - 33725 MT) and there has been a 12 percent growth in terms of value.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approvedthe continuation of RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana- Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR) for three years i.e. 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The financial allocation of the scheme will be Rs. 15,722 crorewith the objective of making farming as a remunerative economic activitythrough strengthening the farmer's effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri­business entrepreneurship.



 RKVY-RAFTAAR funds would be provided to the States as 60:40 grants between Centre and States (90:10 for North Eastern States and Himalayan States) through the following streams:

 (a)          Regular RKVY-RAFTAAR (Infrastructure & Assets and Production Growth) with 70%of annual outlay to be allocated to states as grants based for the following activities:

   i.            Infrastructure and assets with 50% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay.

                              ii.            Value addition linked production projects with 30% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay.

                            iii.            Flexi-funds with 20% of regular RKVY-RAFTAAR outlay. States can use this for supporting any projects as per the local needs.

 

(b)          RKVY-RAFTAAR special sub-schemes of National priorities - 20% of annual outlay; and

 

(c)          Innovation and agri-entrepreneur development through creating end-to-end solution, skill development and financial support for setting up the agri-enterprise -10% of annual outlay including 2% of administrative costs.

            The scheme will incentivize States in enhancing more allocation to Agriculture and Allied Sectors.  This will also strengthen farmer’s efforts through creation of agriculture infrastructure that help in supply of quality inputs, market facilities etc.  This will further promote agri-entrepreneurship and support business models that maximize returns to farmers.

 

Background:

 

RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) is a continuing scheme under implementation from XI Five Year Plan. The scheme provides considerable flexibility and autonomy to States in planning and executing programmes for incentivizing investment in agriculture and allied sectors. States initiate the process of decentralized planning for agriculture and allied sectors through preparation of District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) and State Agriculture Plan (SAP) based on agro-climatic conditions, availability of appropriate technology and natural resources to ensure accommodation of local needs, cropping pattern, priorities etc. RKVY has also enabled adoption of national priorities without affecting the autonomy and flexibility of States through sub-schemes.  National priorities like Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), Crop Diversification Program (CDP), Reclamation of Problem Soil (RPS), Foot & Mouth Disease - Control Program (FMD-CP), Saffron Mission, Accelerated Fodder Development Programme, etc. are being implemented through the window of RKVY.

 

During XI Plan and XII Plan, States have taken over 13,000 projects in agriculture and allied sector through State Agriculture Department as Nodal Implementing Agency. The interim report of RKVY evaluation done by Institute of Economic Growth summarises that the income emanating from agriculture measured as the agricultural state domesticproduct (AGSDP) is higher in the post-RKVY period than in the pre-RKVY period. Further, almost all the states registered higher value of output from agriculture and allied activities in the post-RKVY period. Continuation of RKVY-RAFTAAR will therefore keep the momentum of agriculture and allied sector growth.

                There have been some Media reports today, alleging inconsistency in Government’s decision to resume the Fertilizer Subsidy to Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation (GSFC). The reports contain erroneous representation of facts. The following is the clarification in this regard.

The subsidy on Ammonium Sulphate (AS) of GSFC was stopped by an order dated 18.03.2013 on the grounds that the company had not passed on the benefits of subsidy to the farmers. The recovery of subsidy already paid to GSFC on AS w.e.f. 01.04.10 was also ordered by the same order. The order was issued as the company failed to provide the requisite data to substantiate its claim that it has passed on the benefits of subsidy to the farmers. 

The company filed a writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi against the above-said order immediately. The Hon’ble Court by its order dated 02.03.16 asked GSFC to make a representation to the DoF for reconsideration of the matter along with all the requisite documents/data. Hon’ble Court further ordered the Department to dispose-off the representation within 4 weeks. Accordingly, GSFC made a representation along with the requisite data. The Data was forwarded to the Fertilizers Industry Coordination Committee (FICC), a subordinate office of the Department.  After the examination, FICC found that the company has not fully passed on the benefits during 2010-11 and made undue profits. However, the company had passed on the benefits to the farmers during 2011-12 and 2012-13.

FICC calculated the amount of Rs. 33.78 Cr to be recovered from the company for not passing on the benefits of subsidy to the farmers during 2010-11.  The year wise profit made by the company was calculated as under:-

*          Up to 12% of profit is accepted as reasonable by the Department for all products.

A Committee of Senior officers of DoF was constituted to examine the analysis done by FICC. The Committee after examination accepted the analysis done by FICC and recommended that the amount of Rs. 33.78 Crores may be recovered from the withheld subsidy amount of the company w.e.f. 01.04.10 to 17.03.13. The committee further recommended to induct the AS with effect from the approval of the Competent Authority i.e 06.03.2017.

Since, the matter was subjudice and the Hon’ble Delhi High Court had given stay on the order to the extent it seeks recovery of past dues, the department informed the company that the department cannot take further action till the matter is subjudice. The Company withdrew the case to enable the Department to make recovery and take further action.

The matter of release of subsidy for the period 18.03.13 to 05.03.17 is still under examination and no subsidy has been released to the company for the above period yet.

Further, the matter of Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers (RCF), as mentioned in some news reports, is not related to the matter of AS of GSFC and the matter of RCF is under examination in which GSFC is also a party.

In view of the above fact, the department has released the subsidy in line with the orders of Hon’ble High Court and in view of the benefit of the farmers since the Caprolactum Grade Ammonium Sulphate has been manufactured in India only by two companies i.e. Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and GSFC.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has accorded the ex-post facto approval for implementation of Special Banking Arrangement (SBA) for Rs. 10,000 crore for payment of outstanding claims on account of fertilizer subsidy in the year 2016-17. CCEA has also approved that, in future, Department of Fertilizers would avail the SBA with the concurrence of Department of Expenditure.

Under the SBA, a total loan of Rs. 9,969 crore for settlement of outstanding subsidy bills with SBI was raised by the Government. The loan amount along with interest liability on the part of Government amounting to Rs. 80.90 crore were paid to SBI.

SBA for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore for the year 2016-17 has already been implemented/ operationalised to overcome the liquidity problems of the fertilizer companies.

Background:

Government is making available fertilizers, namely Urea and 21 grades of P&K fertilizers to farmers at subsidized prices through fertilizer manufacturers/importers. For making funds available to the fertilizer companies against their subsidy claims, Ministry of Finance had approved SBA for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore with Government interest liability limited to G-Sec rate. Accordingly, an SBA was worked out with SBI for an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore to meet the outstanding subsidy claims of fertilizer companies. The loan together with Government interest thereon has been repaid from BE 2017-18 within the sanctioned budget.

                Airports Authority of India has replaced the existing Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 07 at Chennai International airport at a cost of Rs. 5.0 Crores. ILS provides the necessary guidance to pilots as they approach for landing at the runway. The new ILS will facilitate smooth landing of the aircrafts at Chennai Airport even during rain, low clouds, smog etc. and provide an improved guidance to the Aircrafts.

The new system uses a highly directional antenna system - “Wide Aperture Log Periodic Antenna Array [LPDA]” system. This antenna system has addressed the coverage restrictions of the old ILS, and will provide guidance to the aircraft to a much lower height and improved precision. This is turn will enhance the safety of the aircraft during landing.

The state of the art equipment is manufactured by M/s Indra Navia AS, Norway. The complete installation, alignment, testing, flight inspection and commissioning of the new Instrument Landing System has been done in-house by AAI’s CNS Technical Experts.

                The 1st Heli Expo India and International Civil Helicopter Conclave-2017 is inaugurated in New Delhi today by the Uttrakhand Tourism Minister Shri Satpal Maharaja ji in the presence of the Secretary, Civil Aviation Shri R.N. Choubey, CMD Pawan Hans, Dr. B. P. Sharma and other dignitaries. The first issue of Pawan Hans Magazine Aviation Today is also unveiled by the chief guests on this occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, the Uttarakhand Tourism Minister said that the helicopter taxi services have a huge potential for enforcing law and order, air ambulance services, to check forest fire and can provide better connectivity to religious and tourist destinations located in rough terrain of hilly areas.

On this occasion the Secretary, Civil Aviation Shri R.N. Choubey said that India has achieved a growth rate of about 20% in domestic air travel section in the last three years, which is the highest growth rate in the world Civil Aviation Sector. He said however, that this growth rate is confined to fixed wing traffic only and the helicopter traffic is much less in India. He said that the National Civil Aviation Policy tries to address this gap. As per the new NCAP, helicopters are free to fly from point to point without prior ATC clearance in airspace below 5000 feet. Shri Choubey said the aviation agencies should start exploring the option to start helicopter taxi services between Delhi -NCR and other North Indian States.

This two days 1st Heli Expo India & International Civil Helicopter Conclave-2017 is organised by Pawan Hans Limited, a Mini Ratna company of Ministry of Civil Aviation in association with PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry with the theme of ‘Enhancing Connectivity’ at the Pawan Hans Heliport, Rohini, New Delhi. Experts from Industry and Defence Forces and representatives from ICAO and SAARC countries attended the conclave.

An exhibition is also organised at the venue. The second day is open for public, where one can visit the exhibition and pre-book the Delhi Darshan joy rides by Helicopter.

                The Directorate General of Civil Aviation announced  draft regulations on civil use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, commonly known as Drones yesterday. The Union Minister of Civil Aviation Shri P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju and the Minister for State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha presented and briefed the media about the draft regulation .




As per the draft Civil Aviation Requirements for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),  
 the drones have been classified as follows on the basis of their maximum take-off weight :


1)         Nano               :           Less than or equal to 250 gm
2)         Micro               :           Greater than 250 gm and less than or equal to 2 kg.
3)         Mini                 :           Greater than 2 kg and less than or equal to 25 kg.
4)         Small               :           Greater than 25 kg and less than or equal to 150 kg. 
5)         Large               :           Greater than 150 kg

 

As per the draft regulation all drones are proposed to be operated in visual line of sight, during day time only and below 200 feet. Dropping of any substance, carriage of hazardous material or animal or human payload is not permitted. 
 

All commercial categories of drones  except those in the Nano category and those operated by government security agencies,  will have to be registered by DGCA as per ICAO proposed policy, in the form of Unique Identification Number (UIN). The Mini and above categories will require Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP), but the model aircraft up to maximum take-off weight of 2 Kgs flown below 200 feet inside educational institution premises will not require UIN/UAOP. The draft regulation also mandates tremote pilots  to undergo requisite training, except for Nano and micro categories. As per the draft regulation, the Micro and above category drones will have to be equipped with RFID/SIM, return to home option and anti-collision lights.  

The draft regulation also specifies  certain restricted areas for operations of drones. Drones cannot be operated within an area of 5km from airport, within permanent or temporary Prohibited, Restricted and Danger Areas as notified by AAI in AIP and without prior approval over densely populated areas or over or near an area affecting public safety or where emergency operations are underway and within 50 km from international border and beyond 500 m (horizontal) into sea along the coastline. Drones cannot be operated  within 5 km radius from Vijay Chowk in Delhi and from a mobile platform such as a moving vehicle, ship or aircraft.

The Secretary, MoCA Shri R.N. Choubey informed that the draft for CAR on UAS is available on MoCA’s website for a period of one month from today and suggestions and comments on draft is invited from public.

In a major achievement, the synergetic efforts of Coal India Limited (CIL) and Railways with close monitoring by the Ministries of Coal, Railways and Power have resulted in unprecedented growth in coal off-take and improved despatch of coal for power sector in particular. Strengthening coal transportation and coal production effectively, Coal India Limited loaded 250 rakes of goods train through Indian Railways system on 14 November 2017, an all time high achievement for the month of November to ensure smooth coal supply. Out of these rakes, 223 rakes were exclusively loaded for thermal power stations across the country.

Achieving a loading of 250 rakes in a day in the month of November has set a new record. This achievement has been in spite of the continuation of sporadic rains in some of the coalfields. Normally, loading at such levels is attained from late December when the onset of favourable environment helps in ramping up coal production.

CIL and Railways are now jointly working on a strategy to enhance loading target to 266 coal rakes per-day which will further help both power and non-power sector in meeting their demands for coal.

The growth in coal despatch to power sector in August, September and October of the current Fiscal has been 20%, 21% and 18% respectively as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This has helped coal based power plants in meeting the spurt in demand of festive and paddy season, despite the drop in generation from hydro, nuclear as well as imported coal based plants.

CIL is poised to contribute load of 300 rakes through Indian Railways which includes about 35 rakes for coal beneficiation and coal lifted through road for loading from Goods Shed sidings of Indian Railways.

Shri Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Railways & Coal has launched ‘Grahak Sadak Koyla Vitaran App’benefitting customers of Coal India Limited (CIL) lifting coal through road mode.

 The customer friendly app, launched recently in Kolkata on CIL’s Foundation Day, helps achieve transparency in despatch operations, as a tool to monitor, whether the despatches are made on the fair principle of ‘First in First Out’ and keeps track of all the activities from issuance of Sale Order to physical delivery of coal by road.

 The main benefits of the App for the customers, against the Sale Orders issued, include easy accessibility of the information at the click of the button, apart from transparency in the system of loading programme and despatch. The app also helps in logistics planning for lifting of coal in tune with the loading programmes. It further helps in improved planning of procurement, production and stock management by the customers.

 The main features of the app are that it provides date-wise, truck-wise quantity of coal delivered against the Sale Orders and information related to Scheme-wise, Colliery-wise, Grade-wise, customer-wise details of Sale Orders issued during a period.

 In terms of loading it provides allotment verses lifting status in details from different sources truck by truck and summary of the despatch.

 Coal India is addressing its customer needs in a big way and made ‘ease of doing business’ a major consumer commitment. The launching of the app is also one of the initiatives of CIL towards achieving the much cherished goal of ‘Digital India’ and transparency.

 It may be recalled that CIL in a move to rush more coal to power stations, coal supplies to plants located in shorter distances have been offered through road mode from available pithead stock. As a result, power plants located within 50 Kms to 60 Kms from the mines may take as much coal from the nearest mines as they can.

 During 2016-17 despatch of coal through road mode had been about 140 Million Tonnes (MTs) out of the total despatch of 542 MTs by CIL accounting for 26%. The impetus given in the current fiscal has improved movement of coal through road considerably. As of end of October 2017 the movement of coal through road mode at a little over 93 MTs accounted for 29% of the total coal despatch of 317 MTs.The road despatch during the current fiscal till October 2017 went up by 12 MTs compared to same period last fiscal.

The Minister of State for Human Resource Development (Higher Education), Shri Satya Pal Singh graced the occasion, senior officials from the Government of India and several leading lawyers and professionals from the legal sector were also present.

The Summit explored issues and concerns surrounding the liberalization of the Indian legal services sector.

The Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhu who addressed the Summit through a video message emphasized on the growing importance of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and encouraged the legal community to increasingly make use of this mechanism for enhancing the ease of doing business.

Shri Satya Pal Singh in his inaugural address, stressed on the importance of law as an enabler of justice and spoke on the importance of the impartiality and neutrality of the judicial system in India. He noted that the justice system should focus on the difficulties faced by victims in particular.

The Secretary General of INBA, Shri Kaviraj Singh who introduced the theme of the Summit, highlighted the dramatic changes that have taken place within the legal sector in India in the last two decades and identified the three major areas which the Summit should focus on, (i) the conduct of arbitration in India; (ii) reforms in the Indian legal regulatory sector; and (iii) the liberalization of Indian legal services.

The President of INBA, Dr. Subhash C. Kashyap welcoming the gathering, highlighted the importance of initiating discussions on much needed reforms in the legal sector.

Law Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice, Shri Suresh Chandra said India has huge potential to increase the size of the legal market, which is around $9bn Dollars at present. He suggested that reforms in this sector could tie in with the Prime Minister’s agenda of “reform, transform and perform”.

 Additional Economic Adviser, Department of Commerce, Ms. Sangeeta Saxena, highlighted the need for diversification of services exports and the particular importance of the legal services sector in boosting India’s overall performance in services.

President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Shri R. S. Suri, noted that the “gulf of understanding between the Bar Council of India, State Bar Councils and the government need to be bridged” and that frequent consultations and deliberations are needed in reforming this important sector.

 Head, Centre for Trade and Investment Law, Prof. James Nedumpara, spoke about the need to introduce major challenges in the curriculum in law schools in India to enable young Indian lawyers to become ‘global Indian lawyers’ and avail opportunities in the rising global corporate sector.

 The discussions ended with a presentation on the myths and realities surrounding the debate on liberalization of legal services. The Summit on the whole agreed on the need to reform the legal sector to align itself with the new global realities in the profession.

                The 4th India-Canada Ministerial Dialogue on Trade and Investment was held in New Delhi today. The Indian Delegation was led by the Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhu while the Canadian side was headed by the Minister for International Trade, Mr. François-Philippe Champagne. The talks were held in a friendly and encouraging atmosphere covering a host of trade and investment issues. Both sides recognized that the current bilateral trade is much below the potential between the two world’s robust economies, despite the huge untapped potential for two-way trade and investment. 

Both sides noted the progress made during the 10th Round of the India-Canada Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) held in August, 2017 and expressed their strong commitment for taking forward negotiations for early conclusion. India also highlighted the importance of Services Component under CEPA. Both sides also noted the exchange of wish lists on the Services front and the Indian side reiterated that the architecture for Services under CEPA is a vital focus area and response from Canada on positive elements has to be mutually beneficial. The Canadian side assured that they would look into the issues concerned, including movement of natural persons and what kind of provisions could be built into the CEPA. The Ministers directed the Chief Negotiators to discuss and explore ways for early conclusion of the Agreement. Both sides also took note of the progress made under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) and expressed their hope for an early conclusion. 

Also, both sides deliberated on possible cooperation between the supporting agencies concerned, for mutual benefit as well as finding these agencies contributing directly or indirectly for promoting mutual trade interests. It was agreed to explore collaboration in the area of export credit insurance through India’s Export Credit Guarantee Corporation Ltd. (ECGC Ltd.) and Canada’s Export Development Canada (EDC). Both ECGC Ltd. and EDC are members of the Berne Union (BU), an international association representing the global export credit and investment insurance industry. Canada also proposed for possible cooperation with their Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC). 

The other issues such as early institutionalization of the CEO Forum mechanism, issue of extension of derogation of pulses, etc. were also discussed. On the issue of pulses, the Commerce and Industry Minister suggested that given Canada’s advantage in Geo-Spatial Planning and the work done in Geographical Information System, both should be utilised to analyse the crop production systems in India, forecast the trend for next 10 years and accordingly work towards a predictable environment for potential pulses which could be supplied from Canada. Commerce and Industry Minister also invited the Canadian side for participation in the Partnership Summit scheduled to be held in February, 2018 at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and also invited Canada to be a partner country.

                A high level delegation led by the Canadian International Trade Minister, Mr. François-Philippe Champagne is visiting India to attend the 4th Annual Ministerial Dialogue (AMD) scheduled to begin tomorrow in New Delhi. The Indian delegation will be led by the Commerce and Industry Minister, Shri Suresh Prabhu. 

In the current round of the Ministerial Dialogue, India and Canada would be focusing on some of the key commercial drivers to enhance the India-Canada partnership. Efforts would be made to work towards the expeditious conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) for a progressive, balanced, and mutually beneficial agreement covering both goods and services. Considering the high potential for bilateral trade, the trade ministers of both countries are likely to discuss issues to explore ways of expediting the early conclusion of the CEPA and the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA). They would also explore options for Indian interests in addressing the Temporary Foreign Workers Programme (TWFP) of Canada, which is affecting the movement of Indian professionals seeking short term visas, address equivalence by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for Indian organic product exports and exploring two way investment opportunities. 

India has long standing friendly bilateral relations with Canada. Though geographically separated by a large distance, the historical ties between the two countries date back to the late 19th Century, when Indians began migrating in small numbers to British Columbia in Canada. Canada now has over 1.2 million Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), comprising more than 3 percent of its population. Though India’s commercial ties with US have seen an upswing in the last few years, trade and investment relations between India and Canada are yet to realise their full potential. Given enormous complementarities, a concerted effort to boost bilateral trade and investment from both sides would provide a fruitful outcome.

                The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India, has signed an Institutional agreement with Anna University to establish India’s second Technology and Innovation Support Center (TISC) at the Centre for Intellectual Property Rights (CIPR), Anna University, Chennai, under the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) TISC program. 

WIPO’s Technology and Innovation Support Center (TISC) program provides innovators in developing countries with access to locally based, high quality technology information and related services, helping them to exploit their innovative potential and to create, protect, and manage their Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). 

CIPR has an experience of filing more than 185 Patents, 29 Trademarks, 39 Copyrights, 25 Industrial Design and has also assisted in filing 12 International Patent Applications. Anna University has been accredited with 6th rank among Universities, 8th rank among Engineering Colleges and 13th rank in the overall category in India, by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. CIPR has also organized IPR awareness programs as well as six certificate courses on IPR related subjects. 

The objective of the TISC is to stimulate a dynamic, vibrant and balanced Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) system in India to foster creativity and innovation, thereby promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing social, economic and cultural development by establishing a network of TISCs in India. Over 500 TISCs operate worldwide and establishing a TISC in India will give the host institutions access to the global network. TISC will give an impetus to knowledge sharing, sharing of best practices among the TISCs, capacity building, generation and commercialization of Intellectual Properties.

                The Minister for Commerce and Industry Shri Suresh Prabhu visited Cuba from October 28 to 31 to explore opportunities to tap the huge untapped potential, for not only bilateral trade but also investment in the Latin American and Caribbean regions. It has been the strategy to pursue new markets to expand India's trade footprint and targets to double trade with the Latam and Caricom region in the next 4 to 5 years. With the Caribbean region, India’s bilateral trade was US$ 1755 million in 2016-17, constituting only 7.16 percent of India’s trade with the Latin American and Caribbean region.

India has always enjoyed a good political relationship with Cuba, with India being one of the first countries to recognise the regime after the Revolution. The visit of the Commerce & Industry Minister was to leverage this age old political relationship to enhance the economic and commercial ties between the two countries.

The Minister met almost the entire top leadership in Cuba including the First Vice President Mr. Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez Mario, Vice President and Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning Mr. Ricardo Cabrisas Ruiz, Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Mr. Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz, Minister of Energy and Mines Mr. Alfredo Lopez Valdes, Minister of Industries Mr. Salvador Pardo Cruz and also the President of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. The First Vice President Mr. Miguel Diaz attached historic importance to this visit saying that ‘India has a prominent role in global dynamics” and aligned with the Minister for Commerce & Industries’ proposition of an integrated approach in multilateral organisations and environmental issues. Considering the overwhelming support and warmth in the meetings, a spontaneous decision was taken to take the next step in this econmic engagement in the form of an MoU between the Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation (FIEO) and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. The MoU priorities six sectors for bilateral trade and investments. These are Pharmaceuticals, Tourism, Renewable Energy, Bio Technology, Sugar and Infrastructure development. Similar MoUs were later signed with Barbados and Guyana.

Shri Prabhu also leveraged this opportubity to meet his counterpart from Haiti, Mr. Pierre Marie du Meny and the Barbados Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce and Small Business Development, Mr. Donville Inniss.

The Minister for Commerce & Industry also attended the inaugration of the 35th edition of FIHAV-2017 which saw particpation from over 70 countries. The Minister also inaugurated the Indian Pavilion in the presence of the Cuban Minister of Energy & Mines. The Minister said “FIHAV was an exhibition of goods but I exhibit the love and affection which 1.3 billion people from India have for Cuba”.

Shri Prabhu also engaged with the Indian diaspora, leading businessmen from Cuba and other prominent Cuban individuals, including the daughter of President Raul Castro and the son of Comrade Fidel Castro.

The Minister for Commerce & Industry also visited the Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB) and appreciated the high research standards and advancement in medical technology that Cuba has achieved. Shri Prabhu reiterated the potential of coopertaion between the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry which is a world leader in generics and CIGB to find affordable health solutions.

                The Union Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that government will provide all the necessary and requisite support for fulfilling the dream of a fully connected and truly empowered India very soon. Inaugurating a National Conference on “BharatNet and its Utilization with States” in New Delhi, he said that this is our mission and your vision for the nation. It is equally a call to action for the entire nation, “Connect India”, and then watch India- Create, Collaborate and Conquer. The Minister exhorted that every one of us-the states governments, private sector players, TSPs, Internet, Technology and Digital Services Companies, Media, Academia, Civil Society, Do-gooders, change makers to work together for making this a success. He expressed satisfaction that the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of Digital India is on the right track and Bharat Net is an integral part of that dream.

He said, with BharatNet and the Digital India programme, we hope to touch lives, connect people, inform, educate, spread awareness, create jobs, save lives, build relationships, nurture bonds, make significant investments, contribute to the exchequer and the economy and above all bridge the digital divide and amplify financial inclusion. He said that the National Optical Fiber Network (NoFN) (now renamed as BharatNet) project was launched in 2012 with the approval of Union Cabinet provided in Oct, 2011. When it was launched previously it was actually, no fun for any one. Little or no progress had been made. Progress had been rather slow and the actual work on the project commenced only in the second half of 2014. The project involves connecting all the 2,50,000 GPs in the country to the block headquarters for provision of both bandwidth and dark fiber on a universal and non-discriminatory basis. The network is capable of providing scalable bandwidth of up to 1 GBPS. The provision of broadband & internet penetration and e-services has a positive impact on GDP growth besides quicker, transparent and cost effective governance.

Shri Sinha said that for the purpose of implementation, the Bharatnet project covering all 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats was divided in to Phase-1 and Phase-2. In the last one year the progress of phase-1 has picked up, tremendously. He informed that for 1,25,000 GPs in Phase-I, the duct/pipe has already been laid in 1,10,368 GPs, OFC laid in 1,03,275 GPs, equipment installed in 85,506 GPs, service ready in 75,082 GPs and service opened in 47,836 GPs. The progress of service readiness has picked up to such an extent that in October, 2017 around 25,000 GPs have already been made service ready. To achieve this the process of equipment procurement was smoothened by decentralising it. Moreover, multi-layered monitoring has been instrumental in achieving this success in the last few months. He said that the Cabinet in July 2017 approved a Modified Implementation Strategy for BharatNet and in the modified, new and improved strategy, the most important change is the Involvement of states along with CPSUs and private sector in implementation of the project to make a win-win situation. The states being the most important stakeholder in provision of bandwidth also stand to gain the most, once this block to GP link is established for citizen centric services such as e-health, e-education, e-governance, etc. The implementation is expected to be much faster and smoother with the participation of states.

He said, based on positive response from various states the proposals of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana & Tamil Nadu were approved by Telecom Commission in September 2017. He complimented the states which provided a detailed project report (DPR) on time and extended their full support in resolving the technical, commercial and financial issues, which are common in projects of this nature, size, scale, scope and magnitude.

Shri Sinha said, the major users of this network are the Telecom Service Providers, ISPs, MSOs, LCOs etc which will use the Bharatnet for provision of broadband and extending the mobile network in the rural & remote areas. He said, as the world and India too moves from voice to data, Bharat Net will herald a new era in connectivity and empowerment, reaching the poorest of the poor and every corner of the nation.

The Minister said that an important and critical stakeholder and end user of this network are the Government Ministries, Departments & State Governments and expressed hope that the network will be used for various citizen centric services such as e-health, e-education, e-medicine, etc. He urged all the States – whether present here or otherwise to come forward and include BharatNet in their plans in spreading digital literacy, building digital capacity &, proficiency and proliferation of e-gov services.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Telecom Ms Aruna Sundararajan said that BharatNet phase-1 is nearing its completion by December 2017, where one lakh Gram Panchayats covering 3 lakh villages will see the roll-out of broadband services. Referring to BharatNet as the world’s largest rural optic fibre network, she said that Phase-2 of the project is 100 percent Made in India as from fibre to design to software everything has been spearheaded by C-DoT. The Secretary said that by 2020 about 25 lakh government institutions and 50 lakh households will be linked to BharatNet.

Memorandum of Understanding for implementation of Phase II of BharatNet has been signed with States during the Conference. Keeping in view the Government’s aim to provide affordable digital services in rural areas, the tariffs for utilising BharatNet infrastructure have also been reduced by up to 75% of earlier notified tariffs. Owing to this, the Telecom companies including Airtel, Reliance Jio, Idea and Vodafone have come forward for providing connectivity services utilising BharatNet infrastructure. The Telecom companies like Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance Jio, handed over advance cheques to the Government during the Conference against leasing of BharatNet infrastructure. The service delivery models, which were showcased during the Conference, are set up in collaboration with the Telecom companies. States have also been encouraged to work on such utilization models.

                BharatNet, a flagship project of the Government of India to provide Broadband services in rural and remote areas has entered in service provisioning phase. As on 05.11.2017, Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) connectivity has been achieved in 1,03,275 GPs by laying fibre for 2,38,677 km. Due to several measures initiated to accelerate the end-to-end connectivity, GPON equipment has been installed in 85,506 GPs and 75,082 GPs are Services Ready.

Digital India, to provide Digital Services in rural and remote areas, is one of the priority areas of the Government. In order to provide affordable broadband services in rural India under the dynamic leadership of our Hon'ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi, a new attractive and affordable tariff structure has been decided with the principle of more you use, less you pay. This tariff structure is expected to be reflected in the tariffs to be charged from the consumers by the service providers.

For asymmetrical bandwidth between block to GPs the charges per annum varies from Rs.700/- per Mbps for up to 10Mbps and Rs. 200/- per Mbps for 1 Gbps. However, for symmetrical bandwidth between block to GP, charges have been prescribed as Rs.1000/- per Mbps up to 10Mbps, and Rs.500/- per Mbps for 100 Mbps per annum. Tariff for any intermediate Bandwidth shall be calculated on pro-rata basis. 

Further, discount of 5% to 25% have been offered for taking bandwidth in more than 1000 GPs to more than 25,000 GPs in a single application. Further, to lower the entry barriers, port charges at block and GP have been waived off. Tariffs for dark fibre are prescribed as Rs.2250/- per fibre per km per annum for service providers and Government agencies.

After such initiatives have been taken by the government, Telecom Service Providers have come forward for utilizing the BharatNet connectivity. Airtel has shown interest in 10000 GPs for taking 1 Gbps connectivity on lease while Reliance Jio, Vodafone and Idea are interested in taking 100 Mbps connectivity on lease in about 30000, 2000 and 1000 GPs respectively. The rolling out of services by TSPs in these GPs is expected to trigger the village level eco-system thereby widening the extent to cover more and more number of GPs in near future. This will give an impetus to broadband facilities in rural India.

                Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha today launched a Pan India scholarship program for school children called Deen Dayal SPARSH Yojana to increase the reach of Philately. Under the scheme of SPARSH (Scholarship for Promotion of Aptitude & Research in Stamps as a Hobby), it is proposed to award annual scholarships to children of Standard VI to IX having good academic record and also pursuing Philately as a hobby through a competitive selection process in all postal circles. Briefing the media after the launch of the scheme, Shri Sinha said that under the scheme, it is proposed to award 920 scholarships to students pursuing Philately as a hobby.  Every Postal Circle will select a maximum of 40 scholarships representing 10 students each from Standard VI, VII, VIII & IX. The amount of Scholarship will be Rs. 6000/- per annum @ Rs. 500/- per month.

The Minister said that to avail this scholarship, a child must be a student of a recognized school within India and the concerned school should have a Philately Club and the candidate should be a member of the Club. In case the school Philately Club hasn’t been established a student having his own Philately Deposit Account will also be considered. Every prospective school, which participates in the competition, would be assigned a Philately mentor to be chosen from amongst the renowned Philatelists. The Philately mentor would help in formation of the School level Philately Club, providing guidance to young and aspiring Philatelists on how to pursue the hobby and also helping the aspiring Philatelists on their Philately Projects etc.

Shri Sinha said that selections under the Deen Dayal SPARSH scheme would be made based on the evaluation of Project work on Philately & performance in Philately Quiz conducted by the Circles. The details of the Scheme will be available on the website at www.postagestamps.gov.in and www.indiapost.gov.in

Philately is the hobby of collection and study of Postage stamps. It also entails the collection, appreciation and research activities on stamps and other related philatelic products. The hobby of collecting Stamps includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloguing, displaying, storing, and maintaining the stamps or related products on thematic areas. Philately is called the king of hobbies because Stamp collection as a hobby has lot of educational benefits - it teaches a lot about the socio economic political reality of the period in which the stamp is issued or the theme on which it is issued.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for transfer of all land assets owned by Hindustan Vegetable Oils Corporation Ltd (HVOC) to Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) or its authorized agency for appropriate utilization/ disposal.

In lieu of the transfer of the land assets of HVOC, complete liabilities of HVOC towards loans taken from the Government including interest would be written off. The Government shall also take care of all contingent liabilities of HVOC that may arise in future due to pending cases in various courts/tribunals/authorities.

The land located in seven cities are lying unutilized for many years. The transfer of the properties to MoHUA would enable use of the land for public purpose. This will facilitate early winding up of HVOC, which is a sick PSU under liquidation.

                In the recent past a few reports have appeared in the media about starvation deaths owing to alleged denial of subsidized foodgrains under NFSA to eligible ration card holders for want of Aadhaar number or for non-authentication at PoS etc. 


In the recent case reported from Bareilly District of Uttar Pradesh, the report from State Government indicates that the deceased was an AAY ration card holder and had received foodgrains till the month of October 2017 regularly. The State Government report also indicates that the foodgrains for the month of August and September 2017 had been taken by her husband without Aadhaar based authentication and in the month of October 2017 by herself after Aadhaar authentication. 

It needs to be mentioned that there are 5.2 lakh Fair Price Shops (FPSs) in the country covering 80.7 crore persons under NFSA against 23.2 crore ration cards. 2.83 lakh FPSs in 20 States/UTs have PoS devices for electronic capturing of sale transactions at FPSs. Further, States have been making efforts to seed ration cards with Aadhaar number and so far 81% ration cards are reported to be seeded with Aadhaar number of atleast one family member. The seeding of Aadhaar number is aimed at biometric identification of the beneficiaries for the rightful targeting of the foodgrains provided under NFSA. It may be however noted that even in the month of October 2017, 47 % of PoS transactions are reported to be without Aadhaar-based authentication which clearly indicates that State Governments are enforcing the guidelines regarding not denying benefits under NFSA on account of absence of Aadhaar based identification. 

Government of India is fully aware of challenges in the transition to the PoS based Aadhaar authentication system in the PDS. It has, therefore, issued clear-cut instructions to ensure that while Aadhaar-based authentication needs to be promoted, no eligible beneficiary under NFSA should be deprived of the entitled quantity of foodgrains for want of Aadhaar number or failure of biometric authentication. Department of Food & Public Distribution had issued notification vide SO No. 371(E) dated 08/02/17 for seeding of Aadhaar number of atleast one family member in ration card database by 30th June 2017. Date for the compliance was further extended till 30th Sept. 2017 and the same was again been extended till 31st December 2017.It has been made clear in para 5 of the said notification dated 8th Feb, 2017 that any member of the eligible household will be entitled to receive entire quantity of subsidized foodgrain or cash transfer of Food Subsidy under NFSA on behalf of the household if he/she fulfils identification requirements, irrespective of whether all members of the household have had Aadhaar number assigned to them.Government of India further issued detailed instruction in October 2017 reiterating the safeguards provided in the notification issued in the month of Feb. 2017. It has also been clarified that in case of failure of biometric authentication due to network/connectivity/ linking issue or due to poor biometric of the beneficiary or any other technical reason, the beneficiary is to be provided subsidized foodgrain or cash transfer of Food Subsidy on the basis of physical production of Aadhaar card along with the ration card by him/her in place of biometric authentication, as provided by Section 7 of Aadhaar Act.. 

It merits mention in this context that most of the States/UTs have also put in place an elaborate institutional mechanism for monitoring of PDS operations and grievance redressal, as provided under NFSA. Central Government is also in constant dialogues with the States/UTs to address the issues pertaining to smooth and seamless transition to the new system of Aadhaar based authentication in PDS with a view to bring about greater efficiency, transparency and accountability.

                On account of implementation of GST w.e.f. 1st July, 2017, there may be instances where the retail sale price of a pre-packaged commodity is required to be changed. In this context, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan had allowed the manufacturers or packers or importers of pre-packaged commodities to declare the revised retail sale price (MRP) in addition to the existing retail sale price (MRP), for three months w.e.f. 1st July 2017 to 30th September, 2017. Declaration of the changed retail sale price (MRP) was allowed to be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be.

Use of unexhausted packaging material/wrapper was also been allowed upto 30th September, 2017 after making the necessary corrections.

Considering the requests received to extend the permission for some more time it has been extended to display the revised MRP due to implementation of GST by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing for a further period of three months, i.e. up to 31st December, 2017.

As Government has reduced the rates of GST on certain specified items, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, has granted permission under sub-rule (3) of rule 6 of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, to affix an additional sticker or stamping or online printing for declaring the reduced MRP on the pre-packaged commodity. In this case also, the earlier Labelling/ Sticker of MRP will continue to be visible.

This relaxation will also be applicable in the case of unsold stocks manufactured/ packed/ imported after 1st July, 2017 where the MRP would reduce due to reduction in the rate of GST post 1st July, 2017.

The above permission/ relaxation will be available upto 31st December, 2017.

                The Government of India promulgated today the Ordinance to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (the Code). Earlier the President of India had given his assent to the Ordinance to amend the Code.

The Ordinance aims at putting in place safeguards to prevent unscrupulous, undesirable persons from misusing or vitiating the provisions of the Code. The amendments aim to keep-out such persons who have wilfully defaulted, are associated with non-performing assets, or are habitually non-compliant and, therefore, are likely to be a risk to successful resolution of insolvency of a company. In addition to putting in place restrictions for such persons to participate in the resolution or liquidation process, the Amendment also provides such check by specifying that the Committee of Creditors ensure the viability and feasibility of the resolution plan before approving it. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has also been given additional powers.

It may be recalled that the Regulations by the IBBI were also amended recently to ensure that information on the antecedent of the applicant submitting the Resolution Plan along with information on the preferential, undervalued or fraudulent transactions are placed before the Committee of Creditors in order for it to take an informed decision on the matter.

Along with other steps towards improving compliances, actions against defaulting companies to prevent misuse of corporate structures for diversion of funds, reforms in the banking sector, weeding-out of unscrupulous elements from the resolution process is part of ongoing reforms initiated by the Government. These would help strengthen the formal economy and encourage honest businesses and budding entrepreneurs to work in a trustworthy, predictable regulatory environment.

The Ordinance amends Sections 2, 5, 25, 30, 35 and 240 of the Code, and inserts new Sections 29A and 235A in the Code.

Gist of the amendments is given below:

(i) Clause (e) of Section 2 of the Code has been substituted with three Clauses. This would facilitate the commencement of Part III of the Code relating to individuals and partnership firms in phases.

(ii) Clause (25) and (26) of Section 5 of the Code which define “Resolution Plan” and “Resolution Applicant” are amended to provide clarity.

(iii) Section 25(2)(h) of the Code is amended to enable the Resolution Professional, with the approval of the Committee of Creditors (CoC), to specify eligibility conditions while inviting Resolution Plans from prospective Resolution Applicants keeping in view the scale and complexity of operations of business of the Corporate Debtor to avoid frivolous applicants.

(iv) Section 29A is a new Section that makes certain persons ineligible to be a Resolution Applicant. Those being made ineligible inter alia include:

• Willful Defaulters,

• Those who have their accounts classified as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for one year or more and are unable to settle their overdue amounts include interest thereon and charges relating to the account before submission of the Resolution Plan,

• Those who have executed an enforceable guarantee in favour of a creditor, in respect of a Corporate Debtor undergoing a Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process or Liquidation Process under the Code

• and connected persons to the above, such as those who are Promoters or in management of control of the Resolution Applicant, or will be Promoters or in management of control of Corporate Debtor during the implementation of the Resolution Plan, the holding company, subsidiary company, associate company or related party of the above referred persons.

(v) It has also been specifically provided that CoC shall reject a Resolution Plan, which is submitted before the commencement of the Ordinance but is yet to be approved, and where the Resolution Applicant is not eligible as per the new Section 29A. In such cases, on account of the rejection, where there is no other plan available with the CoC, it may invite fresh resolution plans.

(vi) Section 30(4) is amended to explicitly obligate the CoC to consider feasibility and viability of the Resolution Plan in addition to such conditions as may be specified by IBBI, before according its approval.

(vii) The Sale of Property to a person who is ineligible to be a Resolution Applicant under Section 29A has been barred through the amendment in Section 35(1)(f).

(viii) In order to ensure that the provisions of the Code and the Rules and Regulations prescribed thereunder are enforced effectively, the new Section 235A provides for punishment for contravention of the provisions where no specific penalty or punishment is provided. The punishment is fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to two crore rupees.

(ix) Consequential amendments in Section 240 of the Code, which provides for power to make Regulations by IBBI, have been made for regulating making powers under Section 25(2)(h) and 30(4).

Based on the massive drive undertaken by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, around 2.24 lakh companies have been struck-off till date for remaining inactive for a period of two (2) years or more.

 Following the action of striking-off defaulting companies, restrictions have been imposed on operation of their bank accounts in accordance with the law. Further, Preliminary Enquiry on the basis of information received from 56 banks in respect of 35,000 companies involving 58,000 accounts has revealed that an amount of over Rs. 17,000 crore was deposited and withdrawn post demonetization. In one case, a company which had a negative Opening Balance on 8th November, 2016, deposited and withdrew Rs.2,484 crore post-demonetization.

Apart from the restrictions on bank accounts, action has also been taken to restrict sale and transfer of moveable and immoveable properties of struck-off companies until they are restored. The State Governments have been advised to take necessary action in this regard by disallowing registration of such transactions.

One company was found to have as many as 2,134 accounts. The information with respect to such companies have been shared with enforcement authorities, including Central Board of Direct Taxes(CBDT), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) etc., for further necessary action. Companies have also been identified for inquiry/inspection/investigation under the Companies Act, 2013 and necessary action is underway.

 The Prime Minister's Office has constituted a Special Task Force (STF) under the Joint Chairmanship of Revenue Secretary and Secretary, Corporate Affairs, to oversee the drive against such defaulting companies with the help of various enforcement agencies. The Special Task Force has so far met five (5) times and action has been initiated against several defaulting companies, which is expected to help in the drive against black money.

Separately, action has also been taken to disqualify Directors on the Board of Companies that have failed to file Financial Statements and/or Annual Returns for a continuous period of three (3) financial years during 2013-14 to 2015-16. Around 3.09 lakh Directors have been affected by this action. Preliminary enquiry has shown that over 3,000 disqualified Directors are Directors in more than 20 companies each, which is beyond the limit prescribed under the Law.

 Further, in the light of the evidence with respect to abuse of the Corporate Structure through multi-layering, not more than two (2) layers are now permitted beyond the wholly owned subsidiary. This is in addition to the existing restriction which prohibits a company to make investment through more than two layers of investment companies.

 In order to address the criminality angle, the Director, Additional Director or Assistant Director of SFIO have been recently authorized to arrest any person believed to be guilty of any fraud punishable under the Act. Under Section 447 of the Act, which defines fraud, stringent punishment including imprisonment up to 10 years is stipulated. Further, reference has been made to the Ministry of Finance to include it as a Scheduled Offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

 Action is also being initiated against Professionals guilty of fraud and all complaints against them are being reviewed. A High Level Committee (HLC) has been constituted for suggesting revamp of the disciplinary systems of Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries and Cost Accountants. Further, steps are underway for setting-up National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), an independent body, to test check Financial Statements, prescribe Accounting Standards and take disciplinary action against errant professionals.

 With a view to checking the problem of Dummy Directors, action is underway to seed DIN with PAN and Aadhaar at the stage of DIN application through biometric matching for new applications. The same may be extended to legacy data in due course.

  Finally, a separate initiative is underway to develop a State-of-the-Art software application to put in place an 'Early Warning System' (EWS), which will be housed in SFIO. The objective is to strengthen the Regulatory Mechanism.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju will inaugurate 7th edition of three day ‘Kathakar: International Storytellers Festival’ tomorrow at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts ( IGNCA), New Delhi. Member of Parliament, Shri Manoj Tiwari, Film maker and composer Shri Vishal Bhardwaj, singer and musician Shri Mohit Chauhan, Australian High Commissioner to India Mr Harinder Sidhu and Member Secretary, IGNCA, Dr Sachchidanand Joshi will also participate in the event tomorrow.

Kathakar is the only oral storytelling festival in India and is a part of Ghummakkad Narain- the Travelling Literature Festival which was started under the aegis of UNESCO in 2010. Kathakar is an attempt to not just preserve the art form but also create new audiences for the same.

Another highlight of the inaugural session is the launch of the book 'Curious Tales from the Himalayas' co-authored by Shaguna Gahilote and Prarthana Gahilote. For the first time, the festival in Delhi will also have a circus Act performed by children from the slums trained by Sweedish Circus master Andreo. There will also be stories of Deendayal Upadhyay and Nanaji Deshmukh, celebrated by the Government of India. Vishal Bharadwaj and Mohit Chauhan will be coming together for the first time to share folk stories through music. Adding to that will be the two puppeteers from Italy and Andhra Pradesh who are not just master of their work but also the last ones promoting and practicing the art.

Kathakar is a special initiative within the bigger festival, Ghummakkad Narain, to promote the oral storytelling tradition which has existed across the world. Though performance storytelling has seen a revival in Europe, in India only few efforts have been made to contemporize the art form. The festival this year will be hosted in the cities of Delhi, Gurugram, Noida and Mumbai. The partners for this year’s festival are the IGNCA of Union Ministry of Culture in Delhi, Heritage Transport Museum in Gurugram and the NCPA in Mumbai.

In the past, the festival has been addressed by (Late) Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Margaret Alva, Sunil Shastri, Mohit Chauhan, Nandita Das, Sushma Seth, Emily Gravett, Joanne Blake, TWP, Joseph Baele, Xanthe Gresham, among others. The main organizers of the festival are the NGOs Nivesh and HHACH.

                The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Culture, Dr. Mahesh Sharma and Minister of Culture and Information of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, His Excellency Prof. Moh. Rasool Bawari inaugurated the India-Afghan Cultural Festival in New Delhi today. The Festival has been jointly organized by the Government and Embassy of Afghanistan along with the Government of India and ICCR.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Mahesh Sharma said that India and Afghanistan enjoy age old cultural and civilaisational ties and the deep-rooted linkages in the fields of music, art, architecture, language and cuisine constitute an important bond of friendship between the people of the two countries.

While exponents of Afghan classical music such as Ustad Sarahang were trained in the Patiala Gharana, the popular Indian music of bollywood resonates in Afghan homes, Dr. Mahesh Sharma explained. The central Bamyan province of Afghanistan is an epitome of our shared Buddhist heritage, he added. Dr. Mahesh Sharma said that Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore’s ‘Kabuliwala’ has connected Indians with the honest and large-hearted Afghans.

Highlighting the common values shared by the two countries, the Indian Culture Minister said that the four Gurudwaras and the two temples in Kabul itself are testament to tolerant and diverse society of Afghanistan. Emphasising the developing partnership being extended by India for the people of Afghanistan, Dr. Mahesh Sharma said that Restoration of Afghan cultural heritage and strengthening its cultural institutions has been an important part of our support in reconstruction of Afghanistan. The restoration of Storay palace in Kabul and support to the Afghan National Institute of Music are a few such examples, the Minister added.

Dr. Mahesh Sharma said that the India-Afghan Festival is a unique event being organized and will further bring out the commonalities between the two countries through art, handicrafts, dance, music and other forms.

The three day festival includes cultural performances, handicrafts, exhibitions, cuisine and cultural shows from Afghanistan as well as India.

                An exhibition of photographs of valuable collection of Islamic Calligraphy from the Rampur Raza Library of Ministry of Culture, Government of India was inaugurated as the inaugural event of Festival of India in Brunei Darussalam yesterday. The exhibition was inaugurated by the Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports of the Government of Brunei Darussalam, His Excellency Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Awang Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof. The exhibition consist of 36 photographs of calligraphy including of verses from the Holy Quran, and poetry in Persian and Arabic, selected from the over 3000 calligraphy pieces in the Rampur Raza Library collection. The Exhibition is being jointly hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of the Government of Brunei Darussalam and the High Commission of India in Brunei Darussalam and will stay open to public till 25th November, 2017.

At the inaugural event, Smt. Nagma M Mallick, High Commissioner of India to Brunei Darussalam, described the Exhibition as a gesture of solidarity and friendship of the Government of India to the Government and the people of Brunei Darussalam on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of His Majesty the Sultan. She described the calligraphy on display as another example of the syncretic culture that amalgamated the ancient Indian artistic traditions with Islamic culture over hundreds of years to produce a cultural flowering under the Mughal Empire. The Exhibition of Islamic and other Monuments of India held in Brunei in December 2016 had also showcased the architectural aspects of the same syncretic culture. The art of calligraphy is still a living tradition in India, where over 60 Departments of Arabic and Persian Studies flourish in Indian universities. Prof. Syed Hassan Abbas, Director of the Rampur Raza Library, gave details of some of the treasures stored in the Library, including 17000 original manuscripts. He detailed the names and careers of some of the renowned calligraphers whose works form part of the Rampur collection. The High Commissioner gifted an example of calligraphy in marble to the Minister of Brunei.

                Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley has said that investment in infrastructure is essential to growth. Delivering Defence Estates Day (DED) Lecture 2017 on ‘India’s Roadmap for a World-class Infrastructure’ at DRDO Bhawan here today he said infrastructure investment expands the productive capacity of a nation and raises the productivity of the existing resources. 

Shri Jaitley said 95 per cent of the volume of our international trade is still coming through the sea route, 65 per cent of the value of international trade is still coming through the sea route and therefore it is extremely important that efficiency at the ports levels are maintained. He touched upon other aspects of infrastructure development as well, including development of about 400 railways stations, rural connectivity, air connectivity, solar power, telephone connectivity. 

Speaking on the occasion , Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre said that excellent infrastructure is a pre-requisite component for propelling growth of the country. He said, to enable deployment of world class infrastructure, all stake holders have to contribute their bit. 

Dr Bhamre said the Ministry of Defence is pursuing vigorously for creation of necessary infrastructure and communications along our borders so that our forces can exercise increased vigil. He said the Ministry has liberalised its policy towards accommodating the demands of other Central Departments, State Governments and other local bodies in a fast track manner by sparing defence land for infrastructural projects of roads, flyovers etc. In the past four years, nearly 80 proposals have been cleared for working permission or Government sanction, he added. 

Director General of Defence Estates Shri Jojneswar Sharma and other senior officials of MoD were also present on the occasion.

                Based on the request received from the District Collector, Thiruvananthapuram for assistance in the search and rescue of six fishing boats with fisherman and one Marine Engineering vessel reported to be missing at sea near Vizhinjam, under the influence of the cyclonic storm “Okhi” that has developed in the Indian Ocean off Kerala, the Southern Naval Command has deployed Indian Naval ships Shardul, Nireekshak,Kabra and Kalpeni and two aircraft based at Kochi.

The ships and aircraft would carry out search and rescue (SAR) operations in the area and would continue to maintain at sea for any assistance required by the civil administration till the cyclone crosses coast.

 The Southern Naval Command is also gearing up for any Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) that may be required due to the effects of the storm in the Southern part of Kerala.

                An Indian Air Force Embraer transport aircraft specialised to conduct Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) function, successfully carried out Air to Air Refuelling (AAR), to fly a long duration flight beyond the aircraft’s stated endurance. It is also the first time that AAR has been carried out on the Embraer  platform.

 The “Probe and Drogue” air-to-air refuelling methodology practiced by IAF pilots requires exceptional flying skills as the receiving aircraft has to accurately insert the receptacle probe into the basket shaped drogue trailing behind the fuel tanker aircraft. During the process of Air-to-Air Refuelling both aircraft have to maintain extremely accurate flying parameters. IAF is one of the few Air Forces in the world to demonstrate this capability and the Embraer AEW&C has also proved its prowess in the category. A mere 10 minute in-flight refuelling can generate additional four hours of flying endurance.  The achievement has given a tremendous boost to Indian Air Force’s operational capability.

                The 2nd Defence Ministers’ Dialogue between India and Singapore was successfully concluded today. It was inaugurated after both countries signed the revised Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) in 2015 to further strengthen the longstanding defence relationship between the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Indian Armed Forces.

Of particular significance during this meeting was the conclusion of the India-Singapore Bilateral Agreement for Navy Cooperation, which will lead to increased cooperation in maritime security, joint exercises, temporary deployments from each other’s naval facilities and mutual logistics support. Both Ministers looked forward to the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise next year.

Dr Ng expressed his appreciation for India’s continued support for the SAF’s training in India, covered by the Air Force and Army Bilateral Agreements. Both Ministers welcomed the renewal of the Air Force Bilateral Agreement on the sidelines of the 11th Singapore-India Defence Policy Dialogue in January this year, and looked forward to the successful renewal of the Army Bilateral Agreement next year.

On regional security, both Ministers reaffirmed the importance of maintaining maritime freedom of navigation and trade consistent with international law. India plays a vital role in the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus. Both Ministers also discussed Singapore’s proposal to expand the Code of Unplanned Encounters at Sea to all ADMM-Plus countries as well as to establish guidelines for air encounters between military aircraft, in order to reduce the risk of miscalculations.

Appreciating India’s leading role in the Indian Ocean Region, Dr Ng agreed to India’s proposal for continuous and institutionalised naval engagements in their shared maritime space, including establishing maritime exercises with like-minded regional/ ASEAN partners.

Both Ministers emphasised the importance of international cooperation in tackling transnational security threats, and in particular measures to collectively tackle the threat of terrorism.

Both Ministers also commended the progress made since the India-Singapore Defence Technology Steering Committee was set up in October 2006 to launch joint research projects. Dr Ng expressed his appreciation for India’s offer of its test ranges and infrastructure to Singapore for the conduct of testing and evaluation for R&D projects.

Singapore and India have also made progress in defence industry cooperation, with the signing of the terms of reference for the Defence Industry Working Group (DIWG) in August this year. Both Ministers agreed that this would facilitate greater collaboration in aerospace, electronics and other areas of mutual interest between the defence industries of both countries.

Dr Ng expressed his appreciation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s acceptance as keynote speaker for the 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue to articulate India’s vision for a stable Indo-Pacific region.

                INSV Tarini entered Lyttelton port (New Zealand) today during it’s maiden voyage to circumnavigate the globe. This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. The vessel is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprises Lieutenant Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta.

 Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, Hon’ble Raksha Mantri had flagged-off INSV Tarini from Goa on 10 September 17. The vessel has covered 7800 Nautical miles from Goa, crossing the Equator on 25 September 17 and Cape Leeuwin on 09 November 17.

 The indigenously-built INSV Tarini is a 56-foot sailing vessel, which was inducted in the Indian Navy earlier this year, and showcases the ‘Make in India’ initiative on the International forum.

 The expedition titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’, is in consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. It also aims to showcase ‘Nari Shakti’ on the world platform and help revolutionise societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of their participation in challenging environs.

The vessel would return to Goa in April 2018, on completion of the voyage. The expedition is being covered in five legs, with stop-overs at 4 ports: Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), and Cape Town (South Africa). Presently, the vessel has covered two of the five legs of the voyage, with the first port halt at Fremantle (Australia) in October.

The crew has also been collating and updating meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), as also monitoring marine pollution on the high seas. They would interact extensively with the local populace, especially children, during the port halt to promote Ocean sailing and the spirit of adventure.

 The vessel is likely to depart Lyttelton on 12 December 17.

                Youth aspiring to serve the nation and desirous of joining ‘Indian Navy’ can now walk into any Common Services Centre (CSC) across the country and avail assistance in filling up online application forms (for joining the Indian Navy). This service by CSCs will be at a very nominal fee of Rs 60 (plus GST). Usage of this facility would significantly ease the application process however, it is entirely optional.

            A MoU to this effect was exchanged in the presence of Shri Alphons Kannanthanam, Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, between Vice Admiral AK Chawla, Chief of Personnel, Indian Navy, and Dr Dinesh Tyagi, CEO CSC e-Governance Services India Ltd, at a function in New Delhi on 27 Nov 17.

            Building upon an existing agreement, the new MoU provides an excellent opportunity to applicants to benefit from the vast network of more than 2.5 lakh CSCs. Applicants will be assisted in correctly filling up application forms, scanning and uploading relevant documents and making payment for examination fees, as applicable. Applicants in rural and remote areas, with challenges of reliable internet connectivity, will benefit immensely. The Indian Navy would advertise through CSCs as well as utilise their services for e-KYC during recruitment across the nation. The Indian Navy views the CSCs as ‘virtual touchpoints’ for extending the recruitment outreach and seeks to strengthen their cooperation with CSC e-Governance Services India Ltd in providing services to citizens in pursuance of Digital India movement.

                As per Ministry of Defence (MoD) letter of September 2015, presently only those children who are dependent and meet other conditions of eligibility for family pension at the time of death of the Government servant or his/her spouse, whichever is later, are eligible for family pension. Accordingly, divorced daughters who fulfil other conditions are eligible for family pension if a decree of divorce had been issued by the competent court during the life time of at least one of the parents. 

The Government has been receiving grievances from various quarters that the divorce proceedings are a long drawn procedure which take many years before attaining finality. There are many cases in which the divorce proceedings of a daughter of a Government employee/pensioner had been instituted in the competent court during the life time of one or both but none was alive by the time the decree of divorce was granted by the competent authority. 

The matter has been examined and it has been decided vide Ministry of Defence letter dated 17 November 2017 to grant family pension to a divorced daughter of Armed Forces personnel in such cases where the divorce proceedings has been filed in a competent court during the life time of the employee/pensioner or his/her spouse but divorce took place after their death – provided that the claimant fulfils all other conditions for grant of family pension. In such cases, the family pension will commence from the date of divorce.

	S&P Global has  lauded the Narendra Modi government for passing a number of reforms that address long standing impediments to the country’s growth,whilst affirming India’s existing rating at BBB-/A-3


 

·         These reforms, as asserted by the S&P Report, include:

v  Comprehensive tax reforms through introduction of GST to replace complex and distortive domestic indirect taxes

v  Bankruptcy code

v  Non-performing loan resolution framework

v  Recapitalisation of state owned banks

v  Simplification of regulations and strengthening the business climate

v  Reforms in the energy sector

v  Improvement in contract enforcement & trade

 

·          The report has also appreciated India’s efforts in improving monetary credibility and has noted the presence of strong democratic institutions and free press.

 

·         The report has underlined that India’s government revenue as percentage of GDP is low. It further asserts that effort of the government to expand tax base by demonetization has increased the number of tax registrants and that Introduction of GST will further accelerate government revenue.

 

·         Reforms such as demonetisation and GST may have led to some quarterly cooling but the medium term outlook for growth in India is favourable. This is based upon private consumption, ambitious public infrastructure investment program and a bank restructuring plan that will help investments.

 

·         On India’s external debt, the report has observed that external indebtedness is likely to remain contained throughout the forecast period underpinned by an improved current account deficit.

 

·         The report has observed that India’s contingent fiscal risks are limited, based upon a combined view of India’s govt related entities and its financial system.

 

·         S&P has hence inferred that over the next two years, growth in India will remain strong and India will maintain its sound external accounts position.

 After World bank’s recognition of India’s reforms in improving ease of doing business and Moody’s upgradation for India’s sovereign credit ratings, S&P too has recognised the strides the Indian economy has made under the leadership of  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

                The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind attended the closing ceremony of the 42nd ICMM World Congress on Military Medicine, where 1,187 delegates from 74 member countries participated, at Vigyan Bhavan here today. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said the theme of this year’s World Congress has been is appropriately kept as ‘Military Medicine in Transition’, which portrays both the dynamic and evolving nature of medical science per se and the ever changing and volatile environment of the practice of military medicine in particular. 

Complementing the Congress for addressing aspects of training and research, Shri Kovind said that in keeping with the present world scenario, it was important that we focus on two aspects of medicine, that is, training and medical research. He said both are progressive and mandated requirements of the medical profession, which help the organisation and individual to constantly grow and expand. 

Noting that a special panel discussion was held on role of women as a combat soldier, the President said women have always in some role or the other been an important part of armed forces across the world. Different countries have different terms of engagement at employment of women in uniform. He said more and more countries are going forward to give them greater responsibilities. In India too, women have evolved as able soldiers in whichever arm our Service they have served in. Shri Kovind said in the field of combat medical care historically, women have had a distinguished record as healthcare providers. He said the Indian Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) has had women adorned the uniform as medical, dental and nursing officers since our Independence and they have served and proved themselves even in extremely difficult situation with great distinction.

Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre, while addressing the Congress, said that the nature of armed conflict has been changing with time and operations have shifted from conventional to unconventional during the past century. He said unconventional conflict has been accompanied by its own peculiarities, and the military medicine professionals have had to suitably adapt to them. Dr Bhamre said the member states have been getting together in such scientific gatherings during the last four decades or so, and over this period of time, have enhanced their skills, knowledge and policies to ensure that they are well equipped and well prepared to face and accomplish any operational commitment as and when one arises. He said disaster can hit any part of the world at any time, and it is the armed forces which, in addition to its duties of defending its country, has been found to be the most appropriate responders to such eventualities, be it earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or other natural and man-made disasters. 

The closing ceremony was also addressed by Director General of AFMS Lt General Bipin Puri. The ceremony was attended among others by Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat and Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa. The five-day deliberations at the Congress came to an end with a decision to organise 43rd ICMM World Congress on Military Medicine 2019 at Basel, Switzerland between May 19-24, 2019 on the theme ‘Medicine on the Move’.

                Today, IAF has successfully fired the BrahMos air version anti shipping missile from its frontline Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft off the Eastern Coast. The launch from the aircraft was smooth and the missile followed the desired trajectory before directly hitting the ship target. The missile was fired by the test crew comprising Wg Cdr Prashant Nair and Wg Cdr KP Kiran Kumar. The chase aircraft was flown by Sqn Ldr Angad Pratap and Gp Capt Badrish N Athreya.

The air launched BrahMos missile is a 2.5 ton supersonic air to surface cruise missile with ranges of more than 400 kms. The IAF is the first Air Force in the world to have successfully fired an air launched 2.8 Mach surface attack missile of this category. The integration on the aircraft was very complex involving mechanical, electrical and software modifications on aircraft. The IAF was totally involved in the activity from its inception. The software development of the aircraft was undertaken by the IAF engineers while the HAL carried out mechanical and electrical modifications on aircraft. One of the major challenges overcome by scientists of RCI, DRDO in the missile development was optimization of Transfer Alignment of the inertial sensors of the missile.

The rich experience of the IAF flight test crew ensured that the integration was smooth. The dedicated and synergetic efforts of the IAF, DRDO, BAPL and HAL have proven the capability of the nation to undertake such complex integrations on its own.

The firing could be successfully undertaken with dedicated support from Indian Navy by way of ensuring availability of the target and a large number of monitoring ships to ensure range safety clearance.

The BrahMos missile provides Indian Air Force a much desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target be in sea or land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions. The capability of the missile coupled with the superlative performance of the Su-30 aircraft gives the IAF a strategic reach and allows it to dominate the ocean and the battle fields.

                Brahmos, the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile created history on 22nd Nov 2017 after it was successfully flight-tested first time from the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) frontline fighter aircraft Sukhoi-30MKIagainst a sea based target in the Bay of Bengal. The missile was gravity dropped from the Su-30 from fuselage, and the two stage missile’s engine fired up and straightway propelled towards the intended target at the sea in Bay of Bengal.

The successful maiden test firing of Brahmos Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) from Su-30MKI will significantly bolster the IAF’s air combat operations capability from stand-off ranges. Brahmos ALCM weighing 2.5 ton is the heaviest weapon to be deployed on India’s Su-30 fighter aircraft modified by HAL to carry weapons. Brahmos, the world-class weapon with multi-platform, multi-mission role is now capable of being launched from Land, Sea and Air, completing the tactical cruise missile triad for India. Brahmos is a joint venture between DRDO of India and NPOM of Russia.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman congratulated DRDO and BrahMos for the outstanding accomplishment.

Dr S Christopher, Chairman DRDO & Secretary, Department of Defence R&D congratulated the Scientists and Engineers for this excellent text book kind of flight test.

                In context of incorrect and mischievous reporting by some of the media channels on Tamil Nadu regarding alleged incident involving fishing boat Jehovah Jireh in Palk Bay, following is stated:

Coast Guard Station Commander being quoted by some of the media channels, has himself clearly stated that Coast Guard ship in question is not under his command and therefore he cannot confirm or deny anything on the incident. There is absolutely no mention made by the officer regarding use of any force or bullets on the fishermen in Jehovah Jireh.

The Coast Guard vide their press release dated November 14, 2017 has already stated in absolutely clear terms that “there was no use of force or any firing by Indian Coast Guard on the fishing boat- Jehovah Jireh in Palk Bay”. Mischievous twists and turns being given by section of media in Tamil Nadu to discredit the Raksha Mantri’s statement that no bullets were fired on the fishermen is therefore highly condemnable. It will therefore behove well for all concerned to check the facts before commenting.

                Recipients of the gallantry awards are entitled to the monetary allowance as per the letter of 1972 of Ministry of Defence (MoD), superseded by letter in 1995 of the MoD, which have been revised from time to time. As per the existing condition for grant of monetary allowance, the allowance shall be admissible to the recipient of the award and on his death to his widow lawfully married by a valid ceremony. The widow will continue to receive the allowance until her re-marriage or death. The payment of the allowance will, however, be continued to a widow who re-marries the late husband’s brother and lives a communal life with the living heir eligible for family pension. 

Representations were received from various quarters to remove the condition of the widow’s remarriage with the late husband’s brother for continuation of the monetary allowance. 

This issue was considered by the Government of India and it has now been decided to remove the condition of the widow’s remarriage with the late husband’s brother for continuation of the monetary allowance vide MoD letter dated November 16, 2017. 

The revised condition for grant of monetary allowance for recipients of gallantry awards is as under:- 

The allowance shall be admissible to the recipient of the award and on his death to his widow lawfully married by a valid ceremony. The widow will continue to receive the allowance until her death.

                Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre said the Government has been tirelessly working towards making up for critical shortages of the armed forces over the years and the policies are now designed to make procurement and acquisition of defence platforms both fast and transparent. Dr Bhamre was addressing defence attaches of around 70 countries, strategic experts, captains of indigenous defence industry & Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) while inaugurating the 2nd annual conclave of Foreign Defence Attaches, jointly organised by Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (HQ IDS) and defence portal BharatShakti.in here today. 

Quoting the 2015 statement of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi who had said that the Government was spending tens of billions of dollars on acquisitions from abroad and 20 to 25 per cent reduction in imports could directly create additional jobs in India, Dr Bhamre said, “This is why defence is at the heart of our ‘Make in India’ programme. We have reformed our defence procurement policies and procedures. There is now clear preference for equipment manufactured in India. Our procurement procedures will ensure simplicity, accountability and speedy decision making.” 

Elaborating on the issue of ‘Make in India’, Dr Bhamre further said, it provides a wide opportunity and the Government would like to invite global defence companies to take advantage of India being a huge market while simultaneously sharing their technology with us. The Defence Procurement Procedure 2016 and its Chapter on Strategic Partnership provides the necessary methodology for such partnerships to flourish.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in a video message conveyed best wishes for the important deliberation at the conclave and informed the gathering she was looking forward to the outcome of the conclave. There were three technical sessions entitled ‘Is India Ready to Absorb High-End Technology,’ Defence Exports: The Indian Experience’ and ‘Defence Technology and Models Abroad.’ The valedictory address was delivered by the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC) Lt Gen Satish Dua.

Top Indian scientific institutions, MoD, Ministry of Health, the United Nations and the International Committee of Red Cross are also represented at the Congress. 

There are 26 thematic sessions covering diverse areas including “Terrain Specific Military Medical Support”, “Health Protection and Promotion in the Military Environment”, “Combat Medical Support”, and “Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief”. Workshops by international faculty on management of mass casualties, barrier nursing for haemorrhagic fevers and medical ethics in military medicine are going to be other highlights of the Congress.

The President of India will address the delegates during the valedictory function on November 24, 2017. It will be graced by the three Service Chiefs and high ranking defence and civil officials. The World Congress is going to provide an excellent opportunity for all participating nations to exchange ideas and experiences, thereby enhancing the collective intellectual assets of Military medicine, which would ultimately facilitate the Member States to face the challenges of a rapidly changing global security environment.

                The wreaths were laid at the Teen Murti Memorial by the Cavalry Officers’ Association (COA) on 18 November 2017. 

Teen Murti Memorial was instituted in the memory of the Cavalry Officers and Men of the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade composed of Cavalry Regiments from the Indian States of Hyderabad, Mysore & Jodhpur and detachments from Bhavnagar, Kashmir and Kathiawar who sacrificed their lives during World War I (1914-1919), in the Sinai, Palestine and Syria. The Armoured Corps has traversed the journey in time since independence, with raising of modernised Tank Regiments. 

Speaking on the occasion, Lt Gen Amit Sharma (Retd), President COA highlighted the great contribution of the Indian Armoured Corps in protecting the Nation’s sovereignty. This is aptly reflected by the ‘Gallantry Awards’ earned by the Corps since independence, which includes Two Param Vir Chakras, 16 Mahavir Chakras, Three Kirti Chakras, 57 Vir Chakras and 26 Shaurya Chakras.

Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute celebrated its 32nd Annual Day on 18th November 2017 in The Air Force Auditorium, Subroto Park at 1030 hrs. The Chief Guest for the occasion was Air Marshal HN Bhagwat AVSM VM, Air Officer-in-Charge Administration, Indian Air Force. Mrs Shubhada Bhagwat graciously gave away the trophies and prizes to the exceptional achievers. The School Head girl welcomed all the dignitaries and parents. The Principal, Mrs Poonam S Rampal presented the annual school report highlighting the achievements of the students and spoke about the year-round activities conducted in the school. A PowerPoint presentation was shown along with it. The foyer of the auditorium was decorated with an eye-catching ‘Rangoli’ and installations which showcased the art and cultural heritage of our country.

The theme of the cultural programme was ‘Saare Jahan Se Achha...’ (A Musical Odyssey). The invocation Qawwali ‘Rang’ which was a tribute to Hazrat Nizamudin Auliya was skilfully presented by the students of our school choir ‘Ekyataan’.  It was followed by a dance-drama based on the song ‘Saare Jahan Se Achha’ composed by Muhammad Iqbal. The play was an amalgamation of various elements such as the iconic evolution of alphabets and language, the Ganga-Jamuni  tehzeeb, the origin of Yoga, the grandeur of civilisation of the Mauryan empire, the propagation of Buddhism by Ashoka and how secularism acts as the binding fabric of the Indian society. The essence of the drama revolved around the strength possessed by our country’s unity, despite being tremendously diverse.

The Chief Guest, Air Marshal HN Bhagwat AVSM VM, Air Officer-in-Charge Administration, Indian Air Force praised the efforts of the Principal, staff and students for putting up a remarkable show and taking the institution to glorious heights. The show was put up by a combined effort of around 250 students under the support and guidance of their teachers. It was appreciated by all.

Closing ceremony for the seventh Indo-Bangladesh joint exercise SAMPRITI was held at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Vairengte in Mizoram today. Exercise SAMPRITI is an important bilateral defence cooperation endeavour between India and Bangladesh. Major General Md Moshfequr Rahman of Bangladesh Army and Major General M S Ghura of the Indian Army presided over the ceremony. 

 The exercise is aimed at strengthening and broadening the aspects of interoperability and cooperation between the Indian and Bangladesh Armies while working together in a counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism environment under the UN mandate. Exercise was conducted under the aegis of the Red Horns Division of Gajraj Corps and had two distinct components which included Command Post Exercise (CPX) and Field Training Exercise (FTX). 

 Troops from 38 East Bengal Regiment of Bangladesh Army and Mahar Regiment of Indian Army represented respective Armies during the exercise. The CPX was conducted at recently created Joint Training Node, Umroi, Meghalaya from 06 November to 11 November 2017 over six days whereas FTX was conducted at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Vairengte, Mizoram from 06 November, over a period of 13 days. The CPX focused on planning of counter-terrorist operations whereas during FTX focus was on company/platoon level tactical drills. A tactical exercise was also conducted during the FTX. 

 Both contingents displayed great enthusiasm and professionalism while carrying out joint drills and skill displays during the conduct of exercise and it was a great learning experience for both the contingents. The troops have not only learnt about each other’s organisation, but have also identified best practices. The exercise was a great success and has taught valuable lessons to the troops of both the countries. Joint Exercises between Armies across the world are increasingly becoming an important aspect of the bilateral relations. Exercise SAMPRITI between the armies of India & Bangladesh was not only symbolic of their maturing relationship but will also built trust and confidence between both Armies.

                Joint Indo-Bangladesh Training Exercise SAMPRITI 2017, which is being conducted at Counter Insurgency & Jungle Warfare School, Vairengte in Mizoram culminated today with a validation exercise.  

It is the seventh such exercise in the SAMPRITI series.  The exercise has been aimed to strengthen and broaden the aspects of interoperability and cooperation between the Indian and Bangladesh Armies. The 13-day long field training exercise commenced on 06 November 2017, which was culminated with a validation exercise on November 15-16. It was conducted in a progressive manner wherein the participants initially familiarised themselves with each other’s organisational structure and tactical drills. Subsequently, the training advanced to various joint tactical exercises by the two Armies. 

            Scenario of terrorists hiding in a village was painted for the validation exercise. It had commenced with joint briefings by the company commanders of both the Armies. Based on which troops established a cordon of the village. Validation Exercise finally culminated with a daring raid in the jungle terrain to neutralise the terrorists. A spectacular demonstration on room intervention drills was also conducted jointly by Indian and Bangladesh Army troops. 

            The final exercise was reviewed by Major General Md Moshfequr Rahman of the Bangladesh Army and Major General M S Ghura of the Indian Army. The combined exercise was an unprecedented success. Besides promoting understanding and interoperability between the two Armies, it further helped in strengthening bilateral ties.

                            In an initiative to bolster bilateral relations with friendly foreign countries and navies in the Indian ocean region, INS Sarvekshak, a hydrographic survey ship of Southern Naval Command, arrived Dar-es-Salaam Tanzania on 15 Nov 17 for undertaking joint  Hydrographic Survey along with the Tanzanian Navy.



            The joint survey will be conducted with the Naval personnel of Tanzania who have been trained in India in National Institute of Hydrography, Goa. During the survey, training of Tanzanian Naval personnel will also be undertaken on advanced hydrographic equipment and practices. The ship will visit Dar-es-Salaam harbour in Tanzania during her stay for refuelling and replenishing stores and provisions.  Joint exercises with Tanzanian Navy are planned during the period of deployment.

 

            The ship will be undertaking pioneer survey of Pemba Island which would include detailed surveys of  Port of Wesha and Kiuyo and Pemba Channel in Tanzania and on completion will be proceeding to Port Louis in Mauritius in December for survey of Grand Port. In recent past, Indian Naval Hydrographic Ships Jamuna, Sutlej and Darshak have undertaken various hydrographic surveys of Dar-es-Salaam, Zanzibar, Makoni and Port Tanga in Tanzania. INS Sarvekshak has also undertaken various foreign cooperation surveys in the last few years in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Seychelles and Kenya.

 

            INS Sarvekshak is a specialised survey ship of the Indian Navy presently based at Kochi and is fitted with state-of-the-art survey equipment like Deep Sea Multi beam echo sounder system, Side Scan Sonars and a fully automated digital surveying and processing system. In addition, the ship carries an integral Chetak helicopter which would be extensively deployed during the survey.

 

The ship is second ship of  the Darshak class of ships and has a complement of 15 officers and 175 sailors and is presently commanded by Captain Peush Pawsey. Interestingly, the officer – prior to this appointment – was commanding INS Darshak, in which capacity too he had undertaken a similar survey in Tanzania in 2016.

                In consonance with Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ Policy; Indian Navy on 15th November 2017, has concluded a contract with Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division for supply of Portable Diver Detection Sonar (PDDS) under the ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ category.  This is the second contract to be signed by the Indian Navy under the ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ category to boost Government of India’s Defence indigenisation effort. The maiden contract under this category was also signed earlier this year by the Indian Navy for supply of Surface Surveillance Radar for IN warships.

Portable Diver Detection Sonar would be manufactured by Tata Power SED in India at their facility at Bengaluru with Transfer of Technology from DSIT Israel. Induction of weapons and sensors under ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ category, is one the numerous measures being taken by the Indian Navy to boost indigenisation for ensuring a self reliant Navy, in line with the Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. Induction of Portable Diver Detection Sonar would further enhance Indian Navy’s Underwater Surveillance Capability in the field of Low Intensity Maritime Operations. Procurement of these sonars for utilisation onboard ships is being undertaken by the Indian Navy to augment countermeasures against asymmetric threats.

                Delegation of Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre today returned with the sacred soil from the resting place of two soldiers of 39 Garhwal Rifles. The urn was brought from Laventie, France and will be carried to the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre at Landsdowne. Today the two urns containing the sacred soil were handed over to the Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman by the delegation in a simple and solemn ceremony.

 On 12 November 2017 mortal remains of the two soldiers were sent on their final journey with full military honours at Military Cemetery, Laventie, France. A delegation comprising of Commandant and SubedarMajor, two bagpipers from the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Center and Colonel Nitin Negi, grandson of late Naik Darwan Singh Negi, Victoria Cross, were present on the occasion. On behalf of the Chief of the Army Staff, homage was paid to the soldiers of Indian Meerut Division at Nueve Chapelle War Memorial by laying of wreaths by Brigadier Indrajit Chatterjee, Commandant and Subedar Major Trilok Singh Negi.

 On 20th September 2016 during an excavation work on southern side of the village of Richebourg near Laventie Military Cemetery approximately 230 Kms away from Paris two human remains were found and identified to be of soldiers of 39th Royal Garhwal Rifles. The office of Commonwealth War Graves Commission in consultation with the French Government and Indian Embassy in France decided to hold ceremony to rest them along with their comrades at Laventie Military Cemetery, with full military honorsduring the annual memorial service that is held to commemorate the Indian soldiers who were martyred in action in France and Belgium.

 During World War-I, the Garhwal Brigade comprising of 1st/39th and  2nd / 39th Royal Garhwal showed unparalleled bravery in treacherous trenches of France and Flanders. Fighting shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers the Gharwal Brigade earned six Battle Honours and two Victoria Cross in France and Flanders Theatre.

It will be the second time Dr. Bhamre will be attending the conference. He will be speaking on November 15. 

Over 500 delegates from more than 70 countries and international organisations are expected to gather at the Defence Ministerial in Vancouver. Along with representatives from the African Union, the European Union, NATO and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, these delegates are going to discuss improvements to UN peacekeeping operations. 

Decisive discussions will be taking place during the conference. While ensuring that the integration of gender perspective remains at the heart of the talks, these discussions will revolve around four themes. 

Focus will be on peacekeeping and youth as peacebuilders. The discussion will also explore the importance of economic development in preventing conflict in fragile states and in sustainably rebuilding post-conflict states. 

The last meeting was held in London in the month of September 2016. The conference had taken up issues on Women, Peace and Security, Pre and Post Deployment, Tackling Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) and Improving Peacekeeping – Rapid Deployment.

                Coast Guard vessel on patrol off IMBL in the Palk Bay was routinely investigating fishing boat namely ‘Jehovah Jireh ’Regn’ No. IND-TN-09-MM-221 at 1440 hours on November 13, 2017 while engaged in pair trawling, which is not permitted in the waters of Tamil Nadu.

On sighting the approaching Coast Guard ship, the fishing boat ‘Jehovah Jireh’ fled away from the scene leaving its nets behind in the water and did not stop despite repeated caution by the Coast Guard ship. During the chase, the boat had also rammed into the Coast Guard ship. After a chase of 50 minutes, the boat was finally stopped and investigated and also cautioned by the Coast Guard ship to stop for checks whenever called upon by the Coast Guard.

The stopping of the fishing boat ‘Jehovah Jireh’ and subsequent investigations were carried out in a peaceful manner as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the Indian Coast Guard. There was no use of force or any firing by the Indian Coast Guard.

The attributability of injury and/or bruises, if any, on the fishermen of the fishing boat ‘Jehovah Jireh’ by the Coast Guard are wholly denied as the investigations were undertaken in a peaceful manner as per the SOP.

                1. The equestrian sport patronized by the Maharajas of Rajasthan has transformed house riding into an adventure & competitive sport at national & international levels. While the equestrian sport is competed in various disciplines at national level, Show Jumping, Eventing and Dressage are the prime competitive events at the Olympics. As a unique initiative, Southern Command has combined the Regional Equestrain League with Southern Star Horse Show with the dual aim of spotting the talent for a medal in Olympics as also to provide a visual treat to the horse lovers of Pune. The event will be conducted at Race Course Grounds, Pune Camp from 16 November 2017 to 19 November 2017. 

2. Though the National Equestrian championship has been in existance for many years but Regional Equestrian League (REL) commenced in the recent past. Apart from providing an opportunity and platform to the budding riders of both the civil & the Services to compete at various levels, REL also helps to identify the talent at regional level while simultaneously filtering the meritorious & deserving riders for National Championship in various Equestrian sports. It is pertinent to mention that inspite of the prevalence of Equestrian foot marks in the country for decades, an Olympic podium finish has been elusive for the Nation. Set to realise this elusive dream, the journey started with the country joining the league of Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) thus acquiring the eligibility for competing at International events. Riders like JS Ahluwalia, Mohammed Khan, Hussain Khan & Daya Singh, the first ones to represent India in Olympic, were devoid of medals because of their lack of experience and exposure in cross country phase of Eventing. Determined to make a mark at the International level, the sport infrastructure has now been developed in India & also its awareness has risen manifold. 

3. Equestrian Federation of India (EFI), the regulating body of Equestrian sports in India started organising Equestrian sports competitions in India for Show Jumping, Eventing & Dressage. With the strong tent pegging contingent garnering country’s first gold medal in 1982 Asiad, equestrianism was brought to the attention of millions. Though the interest in sport has grown but the medals continue to elude the country in Show Jumping & Eventing. Contributions from Services riders like GM Khan, Indrajeet Lamba, AJ Singh, Rajesh Pattu, Palwinder Singh and civ rider Imtiaz Anees have made a mark at International arena. Imtiaz became the first civilian rider to represent India abroad. With the development of the Equestrian Node, sports infrastructure and provision of quality horses, riders like Rajesh Pattu and Bhagirath Singh were able to remain in contention for individual medals in Asian games in 2002 & 2006. In the last ten to fifteen years the civilian involvement has grown enormously as a result of increased equestrian activity in various regions. 

4. It is against this back drop that Regional Equestrian League and Southern Star Horse Show is being organised for Puneities with effect from 16 to 19 November 2017 in which participation by promising riders from all over the country is confirmed. To make it a holistic adventure sports and recreational activity, Army band, Dog show, Air show, free pleasure horse riding etc are also being offered as a onetime opportunity for the spectators. The event would be held with its usual pomp and show everyday from 10 AM to 1 PM & 3 to 5.30 PM at the Race Course Grounds, Pune Camp. It’s time for Puneites to avail this unique opportunity with their families and children to break the monotony and witness an enchanting and entertaining competitive equestrian events.

                Mortal remains of two Indian soldiers of 39 Garhwal Rifles were laid to rest at Military Cemetery at Laventie, France. A delegation comprising of Commandant and Subedar Major of the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre, two bagpipers from the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Pipe Band and Colonel Nitin Negi, grandson of late Naik Darwan Singh Negi, Victoria Cross, attended the ceremony.

        On the occasion, homage was also paid to the soldiers of Indian Meerut Division at Nueve Chapelle War Memorial by laying wreaths on behalf of the Chief of the Army Staff, Indian Army by Brigadier Indrajit Chatterjee, Commandant and Subedar Major Trilok Singh Negi, SM of the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre. The Commandant expressed his gratitude to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for the excellent care and maintenance of the War Memorial dedicated to Indian soldiers in France and Flanders. He also thanked the Government of France for the conduct of the solemn ceremony.

 On 20th September 2016, during an excavation work on southern side of the village of Richebourg near Laventie Military Cemetery, approximately 230 Kms away from Paris, two human remains were found and identified to be of soldiers of 39th Royal Garhwal Rifles. The office of Commonwealth War Graves Commission in consultation with the French Government and Indian Embassy in France decided to hold ceremony to rest them along with their comrades at Laventie Military Cemetery, with full military honours during the annual memorial service that is held to commemorate the Indian soldiers who were martyred in action in France and Belgium. In a symbolic gesture, the soil from the graves of these soldiers will be brought back to their homeland.

During World War-I, the Garhwal Brigade comprising of 1st/39th and 2nd/39th Royal Garhwal showed unparalleled bravery in treacherous trenches of France and Flanders. Fighting shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers, the Garhwal Brigade earned six Battle Honours and two Victoria Cross in France and Flanders Theatre.

                On 20th Sep 2016, during an excavation work on southern side of the village of Richebourg near Laventie Military Cemetery approximately 230 Kms away from Paris, two human remains were found. On examining their belongings, they were identified as causalities of 39th ROYAL GARHWAL RIFLES. The office of Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWWGC), which is curator of the graves of these unsung heroes, in consultation with the French Government and the Indian Embassy in France decided to hold a burial ceremony at Laventie Military Cemetery, with full military honours for these martyrs alongside the Annual Memorial Service to commemorate the Indian soldiers who sacrificed their lives in France and Belgium. On behalf of the Indian Army, a delegation comprising of the Commandant and the Subedar Major of the GARHWAL RIFLES Regimental Centre, two bagpipers from the GARHWAL RIFLES Regimental Pipe band and Colonel Nitin Negi, grandson of late Naik Darwan Singh Negi, Victoria Cross, the gallant hero in the battle of Festubert, were nominated to attend the Ceremony. In a symbolic gesture the soil from the graves of these soldiers would be brought back to their homeland. 

During World War I, the GARHWAL Brigade comprising of 1st/39th and 2nd /39th ROYAL GARHWAL RIFLES showed unparalleled bravery in those treacherous trenches of France and Flanders. The British and the Indian soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder and attained martyrdom in the call of duty. The GARHWAL Brigade earned six Battle Honours and two Victoria Cross in France and Flanders Theatre. 

On the solemn occasion, homage will also be paid to the martyrs of Indian Meerut Division at Nueve Chapelle War Memorial by laying wreaths on behalf of the Chief of the Army Staff, Indian Army by Brigadier Indrajit Chatterjee, Commandant and Subedar Major Trilok Singh Negi of the GARHWAL RIFLES Regimental Centre.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) achieved yet another feat today with the successful test flight of ‘NIRBHAY’ - India’s first indigenously designed and developed Long Range Sub-Sonic Cruise Missile which can be deployed from multiple platforms. It was successfully test fired from the Integrated Test Range (ITR), Chandipur, Odisha. The missile has the capability to loiter and cruise at 0.7 Mach, at altitudes as low as 100 m. The flight test achieved all the mission objectives completely from lift-off till the final splash, boosting the confidence of all scientists associated with the trial. 

The missile took-off in the programmed manner and all critical operations viz. launch phase, booster deployment, engine start, wing deployment and other operational parameters demonstrated through autonomous way point navigation. The guidance, control and navigation system of the missile is configured around the indigenously designed Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG) and MEMS based Inertial Navigation System (INS) along with GPS system. The missile majestically cruised for a total time duration of 50 minutes, achieving the range of 647 km. The missile was tracked with the help of ground based radars and other parameters were monitored by indigenous telemetry stations developed by DRDO. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, hailed the success of DRDO Scientists and complimented them for this inspired achievement. She was optimistic that this successful trial would take India to the select League of Nations for possessing this complex technology and sub-sonic cruise missile capability.

Chairman DRDO and Secretary Department of Defence (R&D), Dr. S Christopher, DG (Aero) Dr. CP Ramanarayanan, Director ADE, RCI , ITR and CEMILAC, along with other senior DRDO scientists and user representatives from Army witnessed the momentous launch and congratulated the team ‘NIRBHAY’ for making DRDO proud for the long awaited achievement.

                Integrated Quarter Master Package (IQMP) software application was formally released to the Indian Army by the Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Sarath Chand in an event organised at South Block on 02 Nov 2017. IQMP is web based software developed by Army Software Development Centre in association with M/s TCS Ltd. The application automates various logistics related functions of an Army Unit. The application will replace numerous legacy applications such as ‘Vastra’ and ‘Quarter Master Package’.

  The package comprises thirteen modules to automate all the logistics functions at unit level. The application can be dynamically configured to meet the specific requirements of various types of Army units and is capable of sharing information and data with other software applications in the domain of logistics management.

         

The software has been developed with the aim of bringing speed, accuracy and transparency in handing logistics aspects in the unit. It will help in effective logistics management and decision making, thereby assisting Army units to be battle ready all the time. It will also play an important role in achieving automation of Indian Army and prove to be a significant milestone towards ‘Digital Army’ in consonance with the ‘Digital India initiative’ of the government.

                The Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre inaugurated a two-day seminar on ‘Challenges in Planning, Investigation, Design and Construction of Highway Tunnels in Himalayan Region’ organised by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) here today. Addressing the function, Dr. Bhamre said development of road infrastructure plays a vital role in overall development of the nation, creation of jobs, attract foreign investment and in integration of remote parts of the country with the mainland. He said, in the Himalayan region, road infrastructure is of special significance, as it remains the only means of communication for movement of inhabitants, their logistic support and for their overall development. For the areas having security concerns, necessity of reliable and all-weather connectivity becomes all the more important. 

Dr. Bhamre, however said that construction of road network in upper Himalayan region, poses severe challenges and to address such issues effectively and ensure all weather connectivity meeting the growing ecological and environmental concerns, underground structure like ‘tunnels’ are the only viable solution. “Therefore for mighty Himalayas, tunnel construction shall form an important feature of the road and rail network to ensure an all-weather, smooth and reliable communication, even if at initial stage it works out to be a costly solution” he stated. Dr. Subhash Bhamre further said that the country is now making a rapid advancement in the construction of tunnels both for road and rail network. Construction of Chenani–Nashri highway tunnel and Banihal-Quazikund rail tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir and number of tunnels in Delhi Metro has proved India’s technical strength in this specialised field in the global community. He also said that in near future, the completion of 8.80 km long highway tunnel across Rohtang pass, which is under construction by BRO where a breakthrough has now been achieved will ensure proper connectivity. The RRM also inaugurated an exhibition where several companies involved in designing and construction of highway tunnels have showcased their exhibits. 

Engineer-in-Chief Lt Gen Suresh Sharma, Director General Military Operations Lt Gen Anil Kumar Bhatt, Managing Director, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Dr. Mangu Singh, Director, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Professor V Ramgopal Rao and Director General Border Roads Organisation Lt Gen SK Shrivastava also highlighted the importance of this specialised subject. The function was attended by several senior officials from BRO, Ministry of Defence and representatives from various companies.

On 30th October 2017, Lieutenant General PM Hariz, General Officer Commanding in Chief Southern Command and Colonel of the Regiment of Mechanised Infantry paid a visit to their affiliated Indian Navy Ship, INS Ghariyal.  He complimented all on board for their commitment and professional excellence. He urged them to continue the cooperation and further build on it to achieve greater synergy.

 

The case for affiliation of the Mechanised Infantry Regiment with INS Ghariyal was initiated in January 1999 by late Lieutenant General PS Joshi and was approved on 24 February 1999. INS Ghariyal is the second Landing Ship Tank (Large) of Indian Navy, which was built indigenously and was commissioned on 14 February 1997.  The ship can carry troops and vehicles and hence is ideally suited for amphibious operations.  Due to the above it is closely associated with the Mechanised Infantry where both compliment each other evenly.

                The Joint Indo-Russia Tri-Services Exercise INDRA-2017 was successfully conducted from 19 to 29 Oct 2017 at Vladivostok in Russia.  The name of the exercise INDRA has been derived from INDia and RussiA. So far INDRA exercises have been undertaken between respective Armies, Navies and Air Forces engaged with each other without concurrent participation from other Services. 17 such service specific exercises with the Russian defence forces have been conducted since 2003.  Exercise INDRA-2017 is the first Joint Tri-Services Exercise between Russia and India.  This is also the first time that Russia has hosted a Tri-Services Exercise on its soil. 

The theme of Exercise INDRA-2017 was ‘Preparation and Conduct of Operations by a Joint Force for Suppression of International Terror Activity at the request of a host country under UN mandate’. 

More than 900 soldiers, sailors and air warriors from the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force participated in the exercise along with over 1000 personnel from the Russian Defence Forces. The exercise was conducted in the Sergeevsky Combined Arms Training Range, Cape Klerk Training Area and the waters of the Sea of Japan.

            Army exercise tasks involved check point defence and humanitarian convoy escort in the back drop of threat from armed groups.Naval tasks comprised Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) operations besides Force Protection Measures, Joint Air Defence and Anti-mining Operations. The Air Forces of both countries, combined their air crews for Combat Air Patrols, Reconnaissance Missions, Formation Flying and Slithering operations utilising Russian fighters, transport aircraft and helicopters.

            It was indeed a historic occasion for two of the world’s greatest Armed Forces to join hands and successfully conduct an exercise of this magnitude with professionalism, providing an opportunity for both defence forces to imbibe the best practices from each other and jointly evolve and practice drills to defeat the scourge of terror.  The first ever Indo-Russia Joint Tri Services Exercise has been a combination of training and cross training in field conditions on land, sea and air, to achieve seamless integration.  The validation of the exercise tasks is a testimony of the contingents of both countries having integrated and synergised seamlessly to achieve the laid down objectives.  The exercise also provided an opportunity to all personnel for cultural exchange and for friendly sports competitions.

            Exercise INDRA-2017 will surely be a benchmark for future exercises of this nature all across the world.  The espirit de corps and goodwill generated during the exercise will facilitate further strengthening of bonds between the defence forces of India and Russia enabling them to understand each other’s organisations and the methodology of executing joint counter terrorist operations.  It is even more satisfying that this milestone in Indo-Russia defence cooperation has been realised as we commemorate 70 years of Indo-Russian friendship.

                The Goa Maritime Conclave (GMC) was inaugurated by Honourable Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman at the Tarang Auditorium of INS Mandovi, Goa. The conclave was aimed at “Addressing Regional Maritime Challenges” wherein the deliberations were focused on emerging maritime threats and force structuring, maritime domain awareness, maritime security architecture, and maritime security challenges in the Indian Ocean Region(IOR). Each of these themes was elaborated upon by speakers of national and international renown, comprising a veritable who’s who of analysts, scholars and practitioners such as Admiral Arun Prakash (Retd) of India, Admiral Dr Jayanth Colombage (Retd) of Sri Lanka, Admiral Md Khurshed Alam of Bangladesh, Professor Ashley J Tellis, Dr C Raja Mohan, Professor Harsh V Pant and Dr Christian Bueger.

Delivering the key note address the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri said that the Goa Maritime Conclave (GMC) aims to bring together like minded nations to evolve and formulate collective responses to emerging challenges in the maritime domain. It would also provide an opportunity to communicate our viewpoints in a forthright manner and collectively shape a favourable maritime environment for all countries in the region added the Raksha Mantri. She further said that the IOR has progressively gained centre-stage largely due to the political impact of its regional dynamics on international geo-politics. One can claim with considerable assertion that the future of the world will be shaped, to a large extent, by the political and economic interactions between the stake holders in the IOR, she added.

She further stated that “Whilst it is good that the compulsions of globalisation have enabled economics to shape transactional relationships between nations, opaqueness in strategic intent and incoherent behaviour by certain nations are preventing these very relationships from evolving beyond their transactional nature. On land, the unresolved borders and riparian disputes which are predominantly a legacy of the colonial era are some of the key causes of conflict. Further, this impasse in international relationships, is a product of many causes such as ideological differences, political insecurities, economic dependency, technological dependencies, inequitable access to resources, geographical imperatives etc. The net impact of these differences is that trust deficit and tensions between nations continue to persist, on account of perceived challenges to sovereignty, despite positive economic interactions between them. As international behaviour in the maritime medium is influenced considerably by land based imperatives, cordially or latent hostility prevalent amongst countries on land tends to be reflected in the seas”.

Concluding her address the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri recommended the following to be deliberated during the GMC:-

( ) Evaluation of the impact of emerging maritime security architectures on overcoming maritime security challenges.

(i) Shaping a discourse in the region in order to work out the differences and capitalise on commonalities so as to ensure maritime security in IOR.

(ii) Tapping the considerable intellectual capital resident in the region and evolve customised solutions to the challenges rather than importing extra-regional solutions and force-fit them on to the regional template.

While delivering the inaugural address, Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff thanked the Hon’ble RM to have graced the occasion. He also thanked all the delegates whose presence reaffirmed the bonhomie that is shared by the navies and innate friendship that prevails amongst the nations. The CNS, however brought out that there is a perceptible lack of formal arrangements with respect to engagement between littoral navies of the south and south eastern IOR and the concept of GMC has been evolved to bridge this gap and to establish a regional maritime forum amongst like-minded navies of the region for the apex level dialogue.

The Admiral further stressed on creation of comprehensive infrastructure, equipping the force with technology and investing in quality training while exercising financial prudence. He also said that by making large and long term financial commitments to counter specific threats from perceived adversaries may not necessarily yield the desired results in the future. Instead it would be wiser to adhere to long term plan which is underpinned by a clear assessment of desired capabilities. The CNS concluded with remarks that we hope to consolidate the progress made so far and shape a way ahead for greater maritime cooperation in the region.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has hailed the exemption granted to “bamboo"" from the Indian Forest Act and said the entire North Eastern Region (NER) of India will benefit from this decision which had been a public demand for the last nearly 90 years.

Following the approval by the Union Cabinet in a meeting chaired by the Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi, the President of India yesterday promulgated the Indian Forest (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 to exempt bamboo grown in non-forest areas from the definition “Tree”, thereby dispensing with the requirement of obtaining a permit for felling of bamboo for economic use. The decision has been hailed as historic because the bamboo was legally defined as a ""Tree"" under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 which proved to be a major impediment for bamboo cultivation by non-farmers on non-forest land.

Hailing the decision, Dr Jitendra Singh said India is one of the major producers of bamboo in the world, found abundantly in the NER. He said, bamboo can be utilized for manufacture of furniture, handicrafts, house construction and several other diverse applications including paper industry, cottage industry, fabric making units, wood substitutes like flooring, roofing, panels etc.

Describing the Amendment as a game-changer reform, Dr Jitendra Singh said this will not only help in generating employability and self-employment but also give a major boost to revenue as well as Start-Up entrepreneurship in the Northeast.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that over 20 million people are involved in bamboo-related activities and just one tonne of bamboo has the capacity to provide employment to 315 people.

At a high level meeting of senior functionaries of the Ministry of DoNER and North Eastern Council (NEC) here today, Dr Jitendra Singh also deliberated on the observations and comments made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee regarding the implementation of various projects in the Northeast. He also received an update on the current status of the exercise to reorient the NEC as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the eight States of the NER.

Secretary, DoNER, Shri Naveen Verma, Secretary, NEC, Shri Ram Muivah, Member NEC, Shri C K Das and several senior officers were present in the meeting.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh spoke here today about an exclusive ""Rural Livelihood"" scheme for the Northeast. The unique scheme under the title “North East Rural Livelihood Project” is being supported by the World Bank and will primarily benefit the tribals and the lower socioeconomic groups, including women, in the North-Eastern Region (NER). 

To begin with, four states, - Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, will be taken up for helping the tribal and even the non-tribal lower groups living in remote areas. The project is aimed at assisting over 10,000 Self Help Groups (SHGs) and benefit about three lakh poor households. 

Besides, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the North-Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation (NERAMAC) Ltd, a PSU under the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region, is also assisting the farmers and agriculturists to obtain remunerative price for their produce. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, while the development and empowerment of the NER is high on the priority of the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the special focus is on Women, particularly tribal women, woman-headed households and single woman households. The more vulnerable tribal groups like Reang in Tripura and Lepsha and Bhutias in Sikkim are also going to benefit from it, he said. 

Meanwhile, a delegation of the ""Forum of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Legislators and Parliamentarians"" led by its National President, Shri Inder Iqbal Singh Atwal today met Dr Jitendra Singh and presented a memorandum focusing on the issues of empowerment of tribal communities in Northeast.

                The Two-day “12th North-East Business Summit” was inaugurated here today. The summit aims to explore the scope for business opportunities in the North-Eastern region of India. Focus areas are Infrastructure and Connectivity with Public Private Partnerships, Skill Development, Financial Inclusion, Services Sector Development- Particularly in Tourism, Hospitality & Food Processing. The Summit is being organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), with Manipur being the state partner for the event.

Speaking on the inauguration of the summit, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that North Eastern states have lot of potential which is still unexplored. He said that we need to explore this unexplored potential for the development of the region and the development of the country as a whole. If one region of the country is underdeveloped, the country cannot be developed, he added. He said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi accords high priority to the peripheral states. The Minister said that the potential of the developed states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra has been achieved to the maximum and now exploring the unexplored potential of the North Eastern states will contribute to the making of ‘New India’ which Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi keeps inspiring us. He said that about 70% of the population of India is under the age of 40 years, this unexplored region will meet the aspirations of these youth, when other regions have saturated.

The Minister said that about 40% of the fruit production in North East (NE) goes waste due to lack of further processing, so it can be an area of potential for the industrialists. He said the Union Government has taken various initiatives for ensuring ‘ease of doing business’ in the North Eastern region. The emphasis has been on addressing the connectivity issue, he added. He said that train services are being provided to the states hitherto untouched by the rail map of India. He further informed that the construction of the Agartala to Bangladesh rail track will be funded by the DoNER Ministry for the portion of the track on the Indian side. He also mentioned of 19 unexplored waterways and projects like Bhupen Hazarika Bridge. He suggested that bamboo - the thriving business sector should be taken out of the purview of the forest sector and that every district should have a post office passport Kendra for facilitating doing business in the region.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Prime Minister’s “Startup India, Standup India” is a programme which includes incentives like, tax holiday in the early phase and an exit period of three months. Added to this, the Ministry of DoNER is offering an additional benefit of providing the initial Venture Capital Fund to any youngster who decides to set up an entrepreneurship in the North-Eastern region. Dr Jitendra Singh said that a day will come when NE will become the favourite destination for all start-ups in India.

Appealing the business community, he said that they should explore the unutilised potential of North East. He said that this region has much more to offer to the business community. The tourism, specially the concept of ‘Home Tourism’ has also picked up in the North east region, he said. This has been possible due to the efforts of the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), the Minister added. He said that the DoNER Ministry has been exploring the idea of introducing a helicopter based Dispensary/OPD service in such far flung and remote areas, where no doctor or medical facility was available and the patient, in need, also did not have any access to any medical care. The first such experiment will be done in Imphal and Shillong, he added. He said that this concept can be emulated by the other states which are having the similar topography. He also informed the North East Industrial Promotion Policy is also in pipeline. The North Eastern Council (NEC) is also being reoriented by the Government, Dr Singh added.

The Governor of Mizoram, Lt. Gen. Nirbhay Sharma said that vision and clarity on issues related to North East are very important for momentum to move ahead. He said that for the future development of the region, a clear vision and action plan with certain timelines is needed. He said that the NE festivals being held in various parts of the country help introducing North East India to the rest of India and vice-versa. He further said that NE as a link need to be strengthened. He said that NE states are exchanging ideas with the neighbouring countries, which is important for NE states and vice-versa. The Government alone cannot do the whole task, the need of the hour is for private players to come in and participate., he added. He emphasised on the connectivity in the NE region, with digital connectivity and air connectivity being the main forms of connectivity. He also said that Mizoram is bio-diversity rich state, which needs to be explored. He further said that new economic policy is the state has tried to address various issues such as land rules, which were proving to be hindrance to the industrialists. He suggested that a North East Forum should be created where all the stakeholders can meet and annual action plan can be created which can be followed up afterwards.

The Minister of Department of Textiles, Commerce & Industries, Government of Manipur, Shri T. H. Biswajit, said that Manipur will become the gateway to South East Asia. The state will have a good opportunity for investment in various sectors, he added. He also said that rail connectivity to Imphal will be complete by the year 2019. He also said that Manipur has potential for handicrafts and textile industry.

The Secretary, DoNER, Shri Naveen Verma said that the topics being discussed in this summit are of importance for the NE region. He said that Government of India has taken various initiatives for the development of NE region. These include North East Council’s support toward the development of the tourism sector in the region, rural livelihood development through North East Rural Livelihood Programme and SAMPADA etc. He said that 'North Eastern Tourism Development Council’ aims to develop regional circuits for tourism in North East and with the neighbouring countries. He also spoke on the potential of organic cultivation, medical tourism, cross-border regional value chain, infrastructure development etc. The NE is the paradise unexplored, Shri Verma added.

The Secretary (East), Smt Preeti Saran, said that NE region plays an important role in the Look East policy of the Government. A strong and stable NE can act as a bridge between rest of India and our neighbouring countries. She gave a detailed idea about the initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of External Affairs toward integrating NER for boosting sub-regional trade and connectivity. She also mentioned that the MEA is undertaking the India-ASEAN Connectivity and Business Summits where North East and connectivity to the region will play an important role.

Speaking on the occasion, the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, Dr R Chidambaram, said that Ministry of DoNER is in touch for scientific and technological intervention for North East region. He said that scientific intervention is required in NE region in farm and non-farm sector. The gaps should be identified to see where the technology can be utilised, he added. He said that this is our responsibility to take the development of this region forward.

Shri P K Bezboruah, Co-Chair, ICC North-East Regional Committee & Chairman, Tea Board felt although the region has high agricultural produce, lack of agricultural marketing needs to be addressed. He also suggested that development must go hand in hand with ecological sustainability.

The two-day conference will include technical sessions on development of infrastructure and connectivity in North East: Focus on Regional Air Connectivity, IWT, Roads & Highways, Skill development in NE & Financing the services sector, Development of Food Processing Industry in NE with focus on Natural Organic and Super Foods from NE and Promotion of Tourism & Hospitality Sector in NE.

                Northeast is all set to get India’s first-ever ""Air Dispensary"" based in a helicopter and the Union Ministry of Development of Northeast (DONER) has already contributed Rs. 25 crore as part of the initial funding for this initiative.

Disclosing this here yesterday after a meeting with the representatives of Aviation Sector and helicopter service/Pawan Hans, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said, for quite a few months, the DoNER Ministry had been exploring the idea of introducing a helicopter based Dispensary/OPD service in such far flung and remote areas, where no doctor or medical facility was available and the patient, in need, also did not have any access to any medical care. The proposal put forward by the Ministry of DoNER, he said, has been accepted and is in the final stages of process in the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation.

The Union Ministry of Northeast/DoNER, Dr Jitendra Singh said, is keenly pursuing the proposal so that by the beginning of 2018, this could be the Union Government’s gift to the people of Northeast.

Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that even today, nearly 1/3rd of India’s population did not have access to proper hospital bed care, as a result of which, poor patients living in remote areas remained deprived of crucial medical care. The experiment being introduced in the Northeast, at the behest of the Ministry of Northeast/DoNER, can also be emulated in other hill states having difficult topography like Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, he added.

As per the envisaged plan, Dr Jitendra Singh said, to begin with, helicopter will be based at two locations, namely Imphal in Manipur and Meghalaya in Shillong. Both of these cities have premier postgraduate medical institutes from where specialist doctors, along with the necessary equipment and paramedical staff, would be able to move into the helicopter and hold a dispensary/OPD in different locations across the eight States of North Eastern Region. On its way back, he said, the same helicopter can also transport a sick patient, requiring admission, to a city hospital. Giving an account of other new helicopter service plans for Northeast, Dr Jitendra Singh said, three twin-engine helicopters are planned to be placed for initial operation on six routes in the region around Imphal, Guwahati and Dibrugarh.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh  attended the Conference on “North East India: Organic Production Hub; Opportunities Unexplored” at World Food India 2017 here today.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that North East (NE) India is indeed a land of opportunities unexplored. He said that now we have to move ahead and also decide how to move ahead. Highlighting the steps taken by the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he said that in the last three years, a lot of initiatives have been taken to explore the unexplored potential of North East India. He said that the earlier always the efforts have been made to bring North East India closer to the rest of India, now the efforts are being made to bring rest of India closer to North East India. He said that there is a lot to learn from North East for all of us. The Minister said that balanced development of all regions is necessary for the overall development of the country. 

Throwing light on the potential of North East, Dr Jitendra Singh said that NE region has about 50 species of bamboo, about 14 varieties of banana and 17 varieties of citrus fruits. The NE region also has huge production of fruits such as pineapple and oranges. This production goes waste, if there is no ancillary support to export these products, he added. He said that in the current Government, there has been a lot of emphasis on rail and road connectivity.

                Water Aid has recently released a report entitled “Out of Order – The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”. This report quotes data from the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP),which extrapolates sanitation data based on available data from past studies between 2000 and 2015. This means it misses out on most of the progress under the Swachh Bharat Mission which aims to eradicate open defecation from the country by October 2019. 

Recognizing that such an unprecedented commitment to bringing so many people out of open defecation in such a short span of time has no parallels anywhere in the world, the JMP, in the same report, inserted a special section with high praise for the rapid results being seen under the Swachh Bharat Mission, and stating that their report does not capture a lot of the work done since 2015, and hence the data is not up to date. 

Egregious mistakes

However, this point has not been mentioned in the report by Water Aid, thereby misleading the readers into believing that this is the present status of sanitation in India. The disparity between the numbers mentioned in this report and reality is extremely stark. This report says that “355 million women and girls are still waiting for a toilet”. This is a total departure from reality.The same JMP report confirms that as on June 2017, the total number of people defecating in the open in India has reduced to 350 million, and this has further come down to below 300 million people as on November 2017. The report also mentions that 56% of people in India lack access to safe sanitation, whereas the present number is down to about 28%. In fact, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation maintains a detailed household level database of sanitation coverage on its website, which is also open to the public. 

Such statements from an organization of the credibility of Water Aid are factually incorrect and irresponsible, especially since the Water Aid India team has been working closely with the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin, and is fully aware of both the ground work, macro statistics and overall progress. It is unfortunate that these facts were not been communicated by Water Aid India to their global counterparts.

                On the occasion of World Toilet Day, large number of behaviour change and toilet usage activities were undertaken by the States and districts around the country as part of Swachh Bharat Mission. Processions were taken out, discussions were held, and school children joined in large numbers in several innovative activities to highlight the importance of toilet access and usage. 


If Santa Claus was the flavour of toilet education in Jharkhand, Punjab launched Swachhta Raths. Noted Sand Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik crafted a swachhata message on sand and a group of Assamese women inspired 371 villagers to build toilets. 

Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer led centre- state team to complete the construction of twin pit toilets in Turkauliya village in East Champaran district of Bihar. 

The team had a three-day immersion exercise during which they extensively interacted with villagers directly, including women and students to generate demand for toilets. 

Village Mukhiyas from neighbouring GPs had a grand chaupal with the Secretary and his team. The Mukhiyas assured that they would help making the district ODF in six months of time. The Secretary, Mr Iyer also launched a national radio campaign for Toilet adoption and usage on the occasion. 

Once toilets were built, the Government team joined the villagers in a Chetana Yatra to spread the message of swachhata and usage of toilets to a nearby Gandhi memorial. Underlining the importance of World Toilet Day, the Secretary stressed upon the need of having a toilet at home and its usage by all the members of family.

                In the run up to World Toilet Day tomorrow, behaviour change and  toilet construction activities are being undertaken by the States and districts around the country. Leading this initiative, a senior central level team from the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation performed shramdaan by assisting villagers in building twin-pit toilets in Turkauliya village in East Champaran district of Bihar.



The senior officers, led by Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, had arrived in the village on November 17, 2017, as part of a village immersion exercise. One of the aims of the exercise was to give the officials an opportunity to stay in the village for an extended period of time, interact with villagers directly, join in trigger behavior change and discuss their challenges and aspirations over the course of three days, in one of the lowest  sanitation coverage districts in the country. 

The team chose Champaran as the district to visit for this exercise as part of the Champaran centenary year, “Satyagrah se Swachhagrah tak” celebrations. The team encouraged villagers to build and use twin pit toilets in their homes. A screening of the movie, Toilet Ek Prem Katha, was also organized for the villagers at a ratri chaupal after the first day of shramdaan.

The joint team of the Ministry and the State of Bihar, joined the villagers to dig twin pits for the toilets in the village including brick laying inside the pits and building of toilet. The village will be declared ODF  tomorrow on World Toilet Day.The team also  paid homage at various memorials to Gandhiji at Champaran. The team also participated in a Master Sanitation Trainers' Workshop organised by the State Government. 

Early this morning, the team led by Secretary Shri Parameswaran Iyer began morning vigil exercise in the villages together with local Nigrani Samities to assess the extent of open defecation. An intense interpersonal communication exercise was undertaken with the people who had come out to defecate in open. The team also visited households to motivate people to build their own toilets. Village women and children enthusiastically participated in the interaction.

A special session with girl students of the area was organised at Turkauliya school.

The World Toilet Day initiative in Champaran is  expected to give an impetus to the Swachh Bharat programme in Bihar which is making special efforts to accelerate it's sanitation programme. In their interaction with the villagers, Secretary Iyer and his team emphasized the need to community's behaviour change and usage of toilet. The call was enthusiastically supported by the villagers who promised to make their villages ODF soon.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded its approval for continuation and restructuring of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) to make it outcome-based, competitive and better monitored with increased focus on sustainability (functionality) of schemes to ensure good quality service delivery to the rural population. 

 A sum of Rs. 23,050 crore has been approved for the programme for the Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) period 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The programme will cover all the Rural Population across the country. The restructuring will make the programme flexible, result-oriented, competitive, and will enable the Ministry towards to reach the goal of increasing coverage of sustainable Piped Water Supply. 

 The details of the decision are as follows:

 

1.      National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) is to be continued co-terminus with the 14thFinance Commission cycle till March 2020.

 2.      With the restructuring of the NRDWP, there will be 2% earmarking of funds for Japanese Encephalitis (JE) /Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) affected areas.

 

3.      A new Sub-programme under NRDWP viz. National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) which has been started by the Ministry  of Drinking Water and Sanitation in February 2017 will address the urgent need for providing clean drinking water in about 28000 Arsenic & Fluoride affected habitations (already identified). As per estimates, about Rs. 12,500 crore as Central share will be required over 4 years i.e. up to March, 2021. This is being funded from the allocation under NRDWP.

 

4.      Pre-financing for the agreed schemes, to the extent of half of the second instalment amount, will be made by the State Governments, which will be reimbursed later on from the central funding. If the State(s) fails to claim this amount before 30th November in the financial year, then, these funds will become a part of the common pool, which will be released to the high performing States, which have already pre-financed the requisite Government of India share on a first come first serve basis.

 

5.      Other half of second instalment of funds will be released to the States based on functionality status of completed piped water supply schemes, which will be evaluated through a third party.

 

6.      The Cabinet has approved Rs. 23,050 crore for the programme for the FFC period 2017-18 to 2019-20.

 

The NWQSM aims to cover all rural population in Arsenic/Fluoride affected habitations with clean drinking water on a sustainable basis by March 2021. States have been given more flexibility in utilization of NRDWP funds by reducing the number of components under the programme.

 As per the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, about 77% of rural habitations in India have achieved a fully covered (FC) status (40 litres per capita per day) and 56% of the rural population have access to tap water through public stand posts within which 16.7% have household connections.

 

Background:

 

The NRDWP was started in 2009, with a major emphasis on ensuring sustainability (source) of water availability in terms of potability, adequacy, convenience, affordability and equity. NRDWP is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 50.50 fund sharing between the Centre and the States. Over the years, learning from the success achieved and the deficiencies felt during the implementation of NRDWP, certain modifications are needed in existing guidelines and procedure of release of funds to the States for making the programme more outcome-oriented and competitive.

 Keeping in view the need to make the NRDWP more result-oriented, incentivize competition amongst States and focused on sustainability, a series of discussions were held with States, various stakeholders / domain experts / international institutions and NITI Aayog, some amendments in the guidelines of the programme have been introduced. These are giving more flexibility to the states in utilization of NRDWP funds by reducing the number of components under the programme. Focus on piped water supply, increase level of service delivery, thrust on coverage of water quality affected habitations (National Water Quality Sub-Mission to tackle Arsenic & Fluoride affected habitations, JE / AES areas), coverage of Open Defecation Free (ODF) declared villages, SAGY GPs, Ganga GPs, Integrated Action Plan (IAP) districts, Border Out Posts (BOP) with piped water supply and Institutional set up for proper O&M of water supply assets etc. have been introduced.

Government of India has deplored the serious insensitivity towards the Father of our Nation shown by Mr Leo Heller, the United Nations Special Rapporteur (UNSR) on human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. In a press release in New Delhi today, he said, “Now is a critical time to replace the lens of those glasses (Gandhi’s glasses) with the human rights lens”. The world knows that the Mahatma was the foremost proponent of human rights, including for sanitation, his unique and special focus. Gandhiji’s glasses, the unique logo of the Swachh Bharat Mission, epitomise core human rights principles. 

The UNSR on human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation undertook a visit to India from 27 October to 10 November 2017. While, the UNSR appears to compliment India’s efforts in recent years in addressing gaps in water and sanitation services through an “unprecedented commitment”, he goes on to make sweeping judgements which are either factually incorrect, based on incomplete information, or grossly misrepresent the drinking water and sanitation situation on the ground. Admitting that “two weeks is not sufficient to fully understand all aspects of the situation of human rights to water and sanitation in a country as big, diverse and complex in India”, he still goes ahead to make the unsubstantiated allegation that human rights principles have not been properly addressed in India’s water and sanitation programmes. 

In a statement, the Central Government strongly rejected his mostly baseless assertions and reiterated that the Swachh Bharat Mission and the rural and urban drinking water programmes fully conform to the Human Rights Criteria and Principles (as established by the UN system) as listed below. 

Availability

·   Over 25 crore people have got sanitation facilities in three years. Over 2.7 lakh villages, 227 ODF districts and 6 ODF states are open defecation free (ODF)

·   77% of the habitations in rural areas have access to at least 40 Litres Per Capita per Day (LPCD) of water supply. More than 90% people in urban areas have access to safe drinking water

Quality

·   SBM promotes safe toilet designs. States have flexibility to establish relevant quality standards 

·   GoI’s national sub-mission to end arsenic and fluoride contamination in rural water in 4 years 

Acceptability

·   SBM emphasizes behavior change through community mobilization to ensure toilets are acceptable to all sections of society and privacy for women 

·   Separate toilets for men and women at all institutions 

Accessibility

·   Over 5.3 crore Individual Household Latrines have been constructed in three years alone 

·   The National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) provides for drinking water within the household premises or at a distance of not more than 100 metres from their household 

Affordability

·   SBM provides a toilet incentive of Rs.12,000 in rural areas and Rs.4,000 in urban areas 

·   Water is available for free or very nominal rates to  the rural population

Non Discrimination

·   SBM focuses on community approaches to sanitation, taking along all sections of society 

·   SBM ensures access to sanitation for specially abled, transgenders, poor and backward classes 

·   The NRDWP earmarks22% funds for SC and 10% for ST concentrated habitations 

Access to information

·   Both SBM and NRDWP have robust MIS and dashboards which are in the public domain

·   SBM trains local grassroots motivators to provide information on sanitation to communities 

Participation

·   The ODF declaration process is completely decentralized, democratic and community driven 

·   Women, children and marginalized groups are leaders in the mobilization and monitoring 

·   Village Water and Sanitation Committees plan, operate and monitor water supply schemes

Accountability 

·   SBM has a thorough verification process at district, state and national level. Third party verifications through reputed agencies are a key aspect of SBM.

·   All toilets constructed under SBM must be geo-tagged 

Sustainability

·   Sustainability is one of the hallmarks of SBM. There is a detailed sustainability protocol, including continued IEC post ODF, and a sustainability verification of ODF verified villages 

·   NRDWP earmarks 10% allocation for water security through source and system sustainability 

 

Referring to the incomplete understanding of water and sanitation in India, the statement says that the UNSR has failed to acknowledge the paradigm shift in national sanitation policy which has moved from construction of toilets to open defecation free communities and seems to be looking at the SBM from a tinted lens. He also attempts to question the findings of a third party, 1,40,000 household national survey by the Quality Council of India that usage of toilets was above 91%, by misleadingly comparing it with a survey of only 1024 households by Water Aid which focused on toilet technology and not on usage.

Regarding the allegation about the lack of toilets in government schools, the UNSR’s claim citing a report by a private organization is denied. It may be noted that an unprecedented programme to ensure separate toilets for boys and girls in every school was successfully implemented in just one year between August 2014 and August 2015. 

The UNSR also claims that there is inadequate attention and funds for water supply, whereas the reality is that since the launch of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) in 2009, Rs. 1,20,000 Crore has been invested by Centre and States on into rural drinking water, and Rs. 40,000 Crore has been invested by the Central Government on urban water supply since 2005. In addition, about Rs. 40,000 Crore are devolved every year to rural local bodies (through fourteenth finance commission) to provide basic services, including water and sanitation. Further, most states have invested heavily with their own resources on drinking water, both for rural and urban sectors.

The above are only a few examples of the inaccuracies, sweeping generalizations and biases revealed in the UNSR’s rambling report (often confusing between rural and urban) on human rights and water supply and sanitation in India, which has been produced after only a two week visit with fleeting trips to a few states and including some anecdotal references. The Government has the highest commitment to human rights in general and particularly in the water supply and sanitation sectors and strongly rejects the claims in the UNSR’s report and press statements.

                For providing additional funds for research and related infrastructure, Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), has started its operations. The HEFA Board had held its 2nd meeting today and approved projects for Rs. 2,066.73 Cr for six institutions – IITs Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Kharagpur, Kanpur and NIT Suratkal. These funds would be used to improve the research infrastructure in these institutions to further improve their standing at the global level.



 

The HEFA Board approved projects for Rs. 2,066.73 Cr for six institutions as per the details below:

These institutions can avail of these funds as per the progress of the project and complete them. The funding under HEFA would be in addition to the grants being given to these institutions.

 

Expressing happiness over the approval of interest-free loans by HEFA Board, Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar said that today is a historic day for financing the needs and promotion of research and innovation beyond budgetary allocations. The Union Budget gives ample allocation and grants to Higher Education institutions but still there is a greater need. The vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the resolve of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made possible the operationalisation of HEFA to extend funds beyond budgetary allocations.

 

These funds are in addition to the grants that Government gives to these institutions. As per the scheme, HEFA would mobilise Rs. 20,000 Cr through market borrowing and would release the same to the Government institution as interest- free loans.

 

HEFA was born out of the vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for providing additional finance for promoting research in the higher educational institutions.  The intent to create HEFA was made in the Budget speech of 2016-17 which stated that, “We have decided to set up a Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) with an initial capital base of Rs.1,000 crores. The HEFA will be a not-for-profit organisation that will leverage funds from the market and supplement them with donations and CSR funds. These funds will be used to finance improvement in infrastructure in our top institutions and will be serviced through internal accruals”.  The Union Cabinet has approved setting up HEFA on 12th September 2016.

 

Modalities of operation of HEFA

 

The HEFA is a novel method of funding the premier institutions by using the instrument of ‘securitising the future flows’. Under this, each institution agrees to escrow a specific amount from their internally earned resources (not govt grants) to HEFA. This forms basis for a credit line which can be used by the institution for creating the required capital and research assets. The Principal portion is repaid from the escrowed amount and the interest is met by Govt. For the institution, this is an interest-free amount and gives facility to the institution to build the required research infrastructure of world class.  

 

Operationalising HEFA

 

The HEFA was registered as a Section – 8 Company under the Companies Act on 31st May 2017. Canara Bank has been identified as the partner for setting up the Company. Government has released Rs. 250 Cr equity and the Canara Bank has given Rs. 50 Cr equity in the HEFA. RBI has granted a license under the RBI Act for HEFA to operate as NBFC on 21stNovember 2017 and to leverage the equity to mobilise money from market as per the requirements of the institutions. 

 

The Board has been constituted and held its first meeting under the Chairmanship of Secretary Higher Education on 12thJune 2017.

                The National Achievement Survey (NAS) is the largest ever national assessment survey in the country and is amongst the largest in the world, was conducted throughout the country today. Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the NAS is a transparent and credible exercise done under third party verification. It was conducted for the Classes 3, 5 and 8 in government and government aided schools. The survey tools used multiple test booklets with 45 questions in Classes III and V related to language, mathematics and 60 questions in Class VIII in Mathematics, Language, Sciences and Social Sciences. The competency based test questions developed reflected the Learning Outcomes developed by the NCERT which were recently incorporated in the Right to Education Act (RTE) by the Government of India. Along with the test items, questionnaires pertaining to students, teachers and schools were also used. 

The learning levels of more than 25 lakhs students from 1,10,000 across 700 districts in all 36 States/UTs were assessed. More than 1.75 lakhs trained Field Investigators from outside the government education system were engaged to conduct the learning assessment in the country. To ensure the fairness of the survey, a monitoring team was constituted which consisted of observers from inter-ministerial departments drawn from the State Governments, National and State Observers from Education Departments and multi-lateral organizations. This monitoring team observed the implementation of the survey in all the districts, on the Day of Assessment. 

The district wise learning report cards will be prepared based on a software especially designed for this. Subsequently, analytical reports will be prepared. The analysis will reflect the disaggregated and detailed learning levels. The whole process will begin immediately and will be completed within 3-5 months. The inferences will be used to design Classroom interventions percolated to all the schools in the districts for implementation. The findings of the survey, will also help in understanding the efficiency of the education system. NAS results will help guide education policy, planning and implementation at national, state, district and classroom levels for improving learning levels of children and bringing about qualitative improvements.

                Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar inaugurated a two-day National Workshop ‘Chintan Shivir’ organized by Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development in New Delhi today. The main aim of the workshop is to provide holistic education relevant for 21st century India and to bring together key stakeholders from various NGOs, private sector and individuals to deliberate on key themes in the education sector.

Speaking on the occasion HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar congratulated the officers of the ministry for organizing the workshop by which we can learn from the best practices of each other. He informed that workshop mainly focuses on five themes i.e. Digital education, Life Skill education, Experimental learning, Physical Education and Value education.

He envisaged ‘Operation Digital Board’ to be operational in all the schools of the country in the coming years. He said government and various other organisations working in the field of education should do content Aggregation and create a common digital platform to provide digital education for all the students of the country. The Minister said education is incomplete without Physical Education. Students must do exercise, yoga, aerobics, running depending upon their choice to stay fit and healthy. The Minister further said life skill education and value education is the need of the hour and one must inculcate these attributes in his behavior for the holistic development.

Speaking on the occasion MoS, HRD Shri Satyapal Singh said that the main aim of the education is to provide complete development of a person and to inculcate humanity in them. He said complete development involves development of human body, mind, wisdom and soul. He further said that human body can be developed by teaching physical education and wisdom can be gained by value education. We must teach our children the value of life and education. He appreciated the efforts of the organizers and wished them all the success in future endeavors.

Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar also launched a Compendium on ‘Innovations and Best Practices in School Education’ and a State-NGO-CSR Portal – ‘Shaala Sarathi’ on the occasion.

Over the course of two days a total of 157 organizations/experts will be making their point via presentations.

                India recognises that accountability in financing of education is critical to achieve SDG4 and associated targets. It involves accountability in financing of education on the part of both the development partners and individual countries. Accountability on the part of development partners relates to the commitment to enhance funding that is needed to implement SDG4-Education 2030 agenda. The latest Global Education Monitoring Report released recently points out that“at the global level, international commitments to finance the education sector, remains weak”. The Report indicates that “only 6 of 28 OECD-DAC countries met their commitment to allocate 0.7% of national income to aid.” Therefore, OECD developed countries must fulfil their commitment. Ultimately, investing in education is investing in peace and sustainable future. 



Accountability on the part of individual countries relate to the commitment to set nationally appropriate spending targets for education, mobilising financial resources and achieving in a progressive manner the international benchmarks of allocating at least 4% to 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) to education; and/or allocating at least 15% to 20% of public expenditure to education. Accountability on the part of individual countries also relates to efforts aimed at ensuring that the available funds are used efficiently and effectively. 

The Government of India recognises that achieving the education development goals and targets set in the context of SDG4-Education 2030 agenda requires increased and well-targeted financing and effective and efficient utilisation of allocated funds. Government of India is investing nearly 4.5 % of GDP on education, despite competing demands on resources. The Central and State/ UT governments have been making efforts to provide adequate and equitable financing to educational priorities. There has been a broad consensus that investment on education be gradually increased to reach a level of six per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Efforts are being made to step up the outlay on education by facilitating substantial increase in both public and private sector investment in education. Furthermore, improved coordination, monitoring and evaluation processes have been attempted to ensure that the available funds are used efficiently and effectively, and with measurable education outcomes and impacts for children and youth, especially in terms of attainment of expected learning outcomes.

The amendment seeks to grant retrospective recognition to the Central/State/Union Territory funded Institutions/Universities conducting Teacher Education Courses without NCTE recognition till the academic year 2017-2018. The retrospective recognition is being given as a onetime measure so as to ensure that the future of the students passed out/enrolled in these institutions are not jeopardized.

                Starting with the London Process in 2011 which initiated a broad dialogue on the opportunities and challenges in an increasingly networked world and to create a platform to address key themes in cyberspace, the delegates to the Fifth Global Conference on Cyberspace (GCCS) 2017, met in New Delhi from November 23-24, 2017 to promote an inclusive, sustainable, open, secure, stable and accessible cyberspace.

 

2.    The Conference recognised that international community, including the governments, private sector, civil society, industry and technical and academic communities have developed significant capacities, technologies and mechanisms/frameworks to harness the vast potential of ICTs for development. The Conference agreed that the focus needs to be on looking beyond digitisation to digital technology as means to empower people.

 

3.    We noted with concern that the existing digital divide among the countries presents a challenge to many States. Therefore, we cannot have a situation where access to internet is discriminatory or controlled through selective gateways. The conference strongly supports this concept as reflected in its theme of cyber4all.

 

4.    In particular the conference noted with satisfaction India’s Digital Initiative of transformation and empowerment of the people through programmes like Digital India, Skill India, Start-up India, Stand-up India that are empowering common people as well as our Mass digital movements like Common Service Centres in the rural areas that are promoting entrepreneurship and and promoting digital inclusion.

 

5.    The conference noted that women form a significant part of the IT workforce. Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women. In this way the IT sector has potential for gender empowerment.

 

 

Cyber 4 Growth:

 

6.    The conference highlighted the use of new technologies has a major potential for transformation of governance structures of the future. Artificial Intelligence, IoT, data analytics, robotics and virtual reality are transforming global business and economies. We appreciate the need to develop proper policy environment with open and free cyber space.

 

7.    We noted with satisfaction that Governments around the world are leveraging digital platforms, and building digital infrastructure, to transform how they deliver public services and support to citizens, enabling participative, bottom-up citizen engagement and anytime/anywhere service delivery within disadvantaged communities.

 

8.    Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation. Startups, are providing solutions to common everyday problems. The global investor community must recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped.The global economy is becoming increasingly dependent on cyberspace and digital technology. It is important to give primacy to human face of technology in this context.

 

Cyber 4Digital Inclusion

 

9.    The conference stressed the fact that Inclusiveness is the bedrock of sustainability. This calls for a program based approach with focus on access programs, digital skill training, community technology spaces and low cost access devices. India’s myGov initiative is an example of how digital technologies could be tools of effective citizen engagement.

 

Cyber4Security

 

10. Securing the cyberspace has become one of the biggest challenges in the present day. Nations must take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization.

 

11. We recognize that we must coordinate our security services in order to detect and deter attacks.  We need to create the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other. Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other.

 

Cyber 4Diplomacy

 

12. The extensive use of cyber space by states to carry out its legitimate activities including service delivery of its citizens, has thrown up new challenges in terms of establishing norms of responsible state behaviour, handling cyber-crime through trans- national cooperation and resolving conflicts in cyberspace. Cyber diplomacy in digital age can be used as a tool to promote economic growth, development of technology to ensure an open source, interoperable and accessible cyber space to all.

Conclusion & Way Forward

 

13. Cyberspace is a public resource, improving the quality of life of individuals, improving the reach and productivity of business and effectiveness of governments. Technology breaks barriers.

 

14. India emphasizes the need for creation of a digital platform which would enable various stakeholders to address potential information and communication technology gaps and harness information and communication technology for sustainable development. There is particularly the need for finding scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology. There is also the need to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled. 

 

15. To facilitate this India will enable a Digital Knowledge Sharing Platform which will help in sharing of knowledge and expertise between different countries

 

16. The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received. India calls upon Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, to work towards a formal collaborative framework. This will enable a secure cyberspace which improves quality of life.

                Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad today addressed a plenary session Cyber 4 Growth: Transformed role of Governments- Regulator to Enabler leading to technology led inclusive and sustainable growth, which was also attended by Lord Tariq Ahmed of Wimbledon, Ms. Marina Kaljurand, Chair of GCSC and Mr. Tarek Kamel, Advisor ICANN.



 

While speaking at the session Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “The real power of Cyberspace is in the economic and social benefits of the digital content, and in the empowerment of the poor, common citizen- which is the only way to ensure both free access to markets and the vindication of vital public interest objectives.”

 

He went on add that, “Business models are not just being disrupted, they are being totally transformed, and across all sectors.  Communication, both interpersonal and professional, has shredded the boundaries of time and space. Nature and structure of governments and its agencies is transforming from reactive to proactive.  Today, technology is redefining who we are, how we communicate to our colleagues and peers and how should we work.”

 

“We in India, are trying to create inclusive, safe and secure, cyber space for sustainable development. We recognize that the transformative power of digital technologies can help developing countries leap frog development, and create more effective and participative democracies. Our strategy aims to benefit the weak and the poor, the rural and the neglected segment of society. The emphasis is on looking beyond mere digitization to digital technologies as a means to empower people.

 

“In the last three years, we have made great strides in digital delivery of services under the flagship initiative of Digital India Programme under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The Digital India programme, based on the three pillars of (i) Digital infrastructure as Utility to Every Citizen, (ii) Governance and services on demand and (iii) Digital empowerment of citizens is a programme to transform India into a digital empowered society and knowledge economy.”

 

Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad signed off by saying, “We have innovated new strategies and technologies, which focused on Affordability, Inclusion and Development focus. Let me share with you a glimpse of how this has helped us to transform India. India would be a voice of moderation. India would be a voice of reason. India would be a voice of assimilation as far as Internet discourse is concerned. But let it be known that India would be a voice of assertion in favour of those who are digitally deprived. Because Digital India has been designed to bridge the gap between digital haves and digital have-nots. I think it is very important that we understand that through digital empowerment we are creating an equal world which would truly reflect our motto of cyber4growth and cyber4all.”

Themed on Cyber4All: A Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development, this is the fifth edition of GCCS wherein international leaders, policymakers, industry experts, think tanks and cyber experts will gather to deliberate on issues and challenges for optimally using cyber space. The overall goals of GCCS 2017 are to promote the importance of inclusiveness and human rights in global cyber policy, to defend the status quo of an open, interoperable and unregimented cyberspace, to create political commitment for capacity building initiatives to address the digital divide and assist countries, and to develop security solutions in a balanced fashion that duly acknowledge the importance of the private sector and technical community.

 In his welcome address, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister for Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, said, “The fundamental philosophy of our government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ (cooperation of all for development of all). Digital India seeks to realise this goal of inclusive development by using the tools of technology. The digital India vision of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a new approach to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. It has given a new paradigm of technology led development for sustainable development. The spectrum of India’s digital development ranges from digital delivery of services to rising digital economy powered by 1.3 billion people and reinforced by demographic dividend where 65% of them are below the age of 35.”

 “India’s quest for a safe and secure cyber space flows from India’s commitment for an inclusive digital world leading to inclusive and sustainable development. India is privileged to host over 4000 distinguished delegates from 131 countries who have come together to give a safe, secure and sustainable digital future to the humanity.” Added Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.

 “Corruption and leakages in the service delivery system that were the biggest roadblocks to inclusive growth and sustainable development have been tackled effectively by using the trinity of JanDhan Bank accounts-Aadhaar digital identity and Mobile phones or JAM trinity. Direct Benefit Transfers of financial entitlements into the bank accounts of the poor have benefited 515 million people and has curbed corruption and leakages in the system. It has also led to savings of nearly $9 billion in last three years of tax payers money that was earlier pocketed by fictitious claimants and middlemen. I am confident that Global Conference on Cyber Space 2017 which is the largest congregation of experts from technology world, researchers, academicians and policy makers would prove to be a milestone in our quest for a safe, secure and inclusive cyber space.” Concluded Shri Prasad.

 The Prime Minister also felicitated the winners of the Global Cyber Challenge called Peace-a-thon. The winners were declared following a 36-hour challenge in the Grand Finale of the Hackathon, wherein hundreds of teams from throughout India and from countries like USA, Canada, France, Argentina, Australia and Algeria turned up to showcase their talent and compete in the challenge.

Fintech in India Needs a Cybersecurity Reboot

Fintech represents the next phase of the evolution of financial services, wherein technology and technology-focused start-ups are innovating products and services currently provided by the traditional financial services industry. Fintech has disrupted all aspects of the industry - banking and capital markets, asset and wealth management, insurance, funds transfer and payments in India. Fintech has not only led to the growth of start-ups but has also begun disrupting the way traditional banks offer services to customers, as banks look to integrate multiple digital channels into an omnichannel customer experience. India has recorded $1.77 billion in Fintech investments between 2014 and 2015 through a total of 158 deals. While these figures highlight the growth of Fintech in India, there are several factors in play that support phenomenal growth in the near future like high adoption of technology, internet penetration, government policies and thrust on financial inclusion. The Indian Fintech market is expected to reach $2.4 billion by 2020 and the total transaction value of the entire Indian Fintech industry is forecasted to reach $73 Billion in 2020 growing at a CAGR of 22%. While Fintech is growing rapidly and offers several advantages such as substantial reduction in costs, improved customer retention and differentiation of financial institutions from the competition, the need for proper security is paramount. Security and privacy are top threats to the rise of Fintech. The financial services sector handles sensitive information about individuals and enterprises. With the emergence of Fintech, more data is now available in digital format, which makes it easier to analyze and generate insights but also makes the data more susceptible to security breaches. Moving forward, security and data privacy are going to play a key role in winning consumer confidence and catalyzing the adoption of Fintech. The session was attended by Dr. Gulshan Rai, National Cyber Security Coordinator, Prime Minister's Office, Shri G. Padmanabhan, Non-Executive Chairman, Bank of India, Mr. Yashish Dahiya, Co-Founder & CEO, Policybazaar, Mr. V. N. Sastry, Professor, IDBRT, Mr. Sean Duca, VP, Regional Chief Security Officer - Asia Pacific at Palo Alto Networks, Mr. Shariq Plasticwala, Head - Amazon Payments, Amazon India and was moderated by Mr. Bharat Panchal, Head Risk Management, NPCI (Moderator)

 The second day of the Curtain Raiser also had a Closed Meeting of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The Curtain Raiser had 14 events where approximately 1400 stakeholders had participated. Besides, there have been multiple side events in the backdrop of GCCS 2017 that presented a unique opportunity for people to engage with delegates present in the conference.

                The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) responding to a news report, appeared in certain section of media on “210 Government sites made Aadhaar info public” as if Aadhaar data is leaked or breached, has said that such report is a skewed presentation of the facts and poses as if the Aadhaar data is breached or leaked which is not the true presentation. UIDAI said in a statement here that the Aadhaar data is fully safe and secure and there has been no data leak or breach at UIDAI.

UIDAI said that this said data on these websites was placed in public domain as a measure of proactive disclosure under RTI Act by these government and institutional websites which included beneficiaries’ name, address, bank account, and other details including Aadhaar number and was collected from the third party/users for various welfare schemes. It was this collected info which had been displayed in the public domain under RTI Act. There was no breach or leakage of Aadhaar data from UIDAI database or server as has been aired by the said report.

UIDAI said that acting promptly on this, UIDAI and Ministry of Electronics & IT had directed the concerned Government departments/ministries to immediately remove it from their websites and ensure that such violation do not occur in future. Certain other measures were also taken at various levels to ensure that such incidents of display of Aadhaar numbers do not take place. Following UIDAI’s action such data were removed from these websites immediately. However, the news presented the facts in a skewed manner and misleads readers as if Aadhaar data has been leaked or breached at 210 websites posing Aadhaar security is vulnerable.

UIDAI reiterated that Aadhaar security systems are best of the international standards and Aadhaar data is fully secure. There has been no breach or leakage of Aadhaar data at UIDAI. Also, the Aadhaar numbers which were made public on the said websites do not pose any real threat to the people as biometric information is never shared and is fully secure with highest encryption at UIDAI and mere display of demographic information cannot be misused without biometrics.

UIDAI clarified that Aadhaar number is not a secret number. It is to be shared with authorized agencies when an Aadhaarholder wishes to avail a certain service or benefit of government welfare scheme/s or other services. But that does not mean that the proper use of Aadhaar number poses a security or financial threat. Also, mere availability of Aadhaar number will not be a security threat or will not lead to financial/other fraud, as for a successful authentication fingerprint or iris of individual is also required. Further all authentications happen in presence of personnel of respective service provider which further add to the security of the system.

Furthermore, UIDAI security system has people’s participatory security system like Biometric Lock facility available at UIDAI portal which any Aadhaarholder can use to put his/her own lock on one’s biometric by visiting UIDAI’s official website www.uidai.gov.in.

GCCS 2017 to be much bigger than its previous editions

·         The Curtain Raiser events to kick-off from 20th November

·         A 36-hour Grand Finale of Global Cyber Challenge - Peace-a-thon to take place in the GCCS 2017

·         A nearly paperless event in which entire chain starting from pre-registration to travel to hotel booking to meals to session check in will be done through App and Web 

India, for the first time ever, is going to host the Global Conference on Cyber Space (GCCS), one of the world’s largest conferences in the field of Cyber Space and related issues, on 23 & 24 November 2017, at Aerocity, New Delhi. The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the mega event, while Smt. Sushma Swaraj, Hon’ble Minister of External Affairs will deliver the keynote address in the Valedictory function. 

Incepted in 2011 in London, second GCCS was held in 2012 in Budapest with focus on relationship between internet rights and internet security, which was attended by 700 delegates from nearly 60 countries. The third edition of GCCS was held in 2013 in Seoul with commitment to Open and Secure Cyberspace. The fourth version GCCS 2015 was held on April 16-17, 2015 in The Hague, Netherlands which saw participation from 97 countries. 

Themed on Cyber4All: A Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development, this is the fifth edition of GCCS wherein international leaders, policymakers, industry experts, think tanks and cyber experts will gather to deliberate on issues and challenges for optimally using cyber space. The overall goals of GCCS 2017 are to promote the importance of inclusiveness and human rights in global cyber policy, to defend the status quo of an open, interoperable and unregimented cyberspace, to create political commitment for capacity building initiatives to address the digital divide and assist countries, and to develop security solutions in a balanced fashion that duly acknowledge the importance of the private sector and technical community. 

While briefing the press, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister for Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, said, “This is a historic moment for all of us to host the Fifth edition of the Global Conference of Cyberspace in India. I believe it is recognition of India’s emerging role as a massive cyber power, accelerated by the Digital India push, which has acquired international acknowledgment. The GCCS 2017 is certainly in accord with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision to transform India into a digitally empowered country. GCCS 2017 will give the world’s cyber community a unique opportunity to learn from global experience and expert insight, and discover more about the technology led transformation being engineered in India. As India is poised to become a US$1 Trillion digital economy and lead the digital revolution in the world, it is imperative to formulate and put across a robust cyber space.”

 

“The GCCS 2017 is going to be four times bigger than its previous edition in terms of its magnitude. The last conference held in The Netherlands saw about 1800 delegates, and I am happy to announce that we have over 10000 delegates who will participate in person.  There will also be virtual participation from over 2800 locations across the world will be connected in an interactive mode. We have had over 40 Run-up events around the world since March 2017 to precede the main event that received an unprecedented response from the policy makers, industry, academia, civil society and think tanks. We look forward to cooperation and knowledge sharing among countries to implement and replicate successful initiatives as one of the major expected outcomes of this conference. ”added Shri Prasad.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has strongly reiterated that with the responsibility of lifting millions of people out of poverty and raising the standard of living, technology and finance are the key for countries like India that can simultaneously address climate change and our development needs. Asserting that India is ready to show a practicable, implementable, green and people-friendly model that can be emulated by the rest of the world in any field, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that this should clearly underscore India’s commitment to the issue of climate change. Delivering the keynote address at the two-day ‘International Finance Corporation Business Forum 2017 – The Path to Green Growth’ here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that people from all walks of life from all over the world have come together on one platform for such an important issue as climate change, with one thinking, one vision and one approach to protect this planet and the world. 

Expressing happiness that people from financial institutions have come together on the issue of climate change, the Environment Minister, on behalf of the Government, extended an assurance that India, under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, is truly committed to the movement on climate change. Dr. Harsh Vardhan referred to the Prime Minister’s dream and vision of delivering a new, Green India, by the year 2022. Recollecting the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s thoughts that access to clean air, water and a liveable climate are inalienable human rights and solving this crisis is our moral obligation, the Environment Minister said that for us in India, protecting the environment and ensuring justice to our future generations of children is considered a moral duty. 

The Minister reiterated that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, India has taken several initiatives to address the issues related to climate change including taking forward the concept of “climate justice and sustainable lifestyles”, which forms an integral part of the Paris Agreement. He added that the NDCs include reducing the emissions intensity of our GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level; achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 and creating an additional sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan highlighted that for India, climate change is not about politics, but a moral commitment. The Minister noted that even though India’s contribution to global emissions is about one-third of the global average and carbon dioxide stock is just about 3 per cent, India has declared its ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC). He underlined the fact that on the domestic front, India envisages an increase in the overall renewable energy installed to capacity to 175 GW by 2022. “To achieve our climate goals, Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which encompasses eight national missions. The broad policy initiatives of the government are supplemented by actions of the State Governments through their State Action Plan on Climate Change”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. Highlighting a number of other initiatives including distribution of energy efficient appliances, the Minister said that about 23.39 crores LED lights have been distributed. “Government of India is also implementing its own National Adaptation Fund with a corpus of Rs. 350 crore”, he added. Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that at the international level, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, India launched the International Solar Alliance (ISA) jointly with the French Government. 

The two-day IFC Climate Business Forum 2017 has been designed as a forum for exchange of knowledge and a platform to showcase innovative approaches to climate-smart projects.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that Ministry is continuously pursuing the matter of Air Pollution Control in Delhi. As directed, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had also called a meeting with the implementing agencies to review the actions being taken for better air quality in Delhi and NCR. “It was evident that because of sustained actions by various agencies, the air quality has improved significantly”, the Minister said. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that air quality has further improved and the Particulate Matter (PM) levels at 1800 hrs today were 243.9 (PM10) micrograms/cubic meter and 153.6 (PM2.5) micrograms/cubic meter. The Minister added that all actions including dust mitigation measures by the construction agencies are being insisted upon. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that the Chairman CPCB, Secretary, DST and Chief Secretary of Delhi Government had a meeting to discuss the issues of landfill sites and both short and long-term measures required for effective control of air pollution from the landfill sites.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the challenge of climate change being faced today is the result of unsustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns. Making the Country Statement at COP-23 in Bonn today, the Minister said that at times, it may be difficult to take hard measures to address climate change, as we have still not fully come to terms with the enormity of the challenge. Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasized that India’s traditional wisdom can be a beacon of light, as its glorious traditions have stood for sustainable lifestyles and care for nature for centuries. 

Appreciating the initiative taken by the Fijian Presidency for adopting the Bula spirit of inclusiveness for guiding climate change discussions and action, Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined the fact that India supports an inclusive approach and believes that citizens are important stakeholders and must also be included in this process. He added that if all global citizens contribute to ‘green good deeds’, the challenge of combating climate change shall become more manageable. 

The following is the text of the Environment Minister’s Country Statement at COP-23 in Bonn: 

“At the outset, let me convey my sincere thanks to the COP Presidency, Government of Fiji for steering the Twenty Third Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC and Government of Germany for their warm hospitality and hosting this COP. We look forward to working closely with the COP Presidency towards achieving a meaningful and balanced outcome at COP 23. 

COP 23 is extremely crucial as it would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre 2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementation of the Paris Agreement. India has deep cultural and historic ties with Fiji. Like Fiji, India has a long coastline of 7,517 Km spread over 9 States and 4 Union territories. It has 1382 islands, some of which are quite large. The coastal areas support a number of economic and strategic activities and are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Our countries, have had a history of shared challenges and long standing cooperation. I assure you of our highest commitment to support you in your efforts for charting out a strong and holistic approach to combating climate change. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the world leaders and everyone gathered here today for their resolution to uphold the Paris Agreement in form and spirit and once again demonstrate the success of multilateralism. However, this is only the beginning. The task ahead is its effective operationalization in accordance with the agreed principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). We must also address the issue of climate justice. 

The climate change challenge that we face today is result of unsustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns which are not necessarily linked to higher levels of well-being. We may at times find it difficult to take hard measures to address climate change as we still have not fully come to terms with the enormity of the challenge. It often takes a hurricane, a massive hole in the Antarctic ice sheet, a devastating forest fire or an extreme flood event, to humble us, and remind us of our role in the current crisis, and nudge us to take action. We need not always wait for scientific reports to act. Additional and early Pre -2020 actions by developed countries under Kyoto Protocol and provision of Finance, Technology Transfer and Capacity building support to developing countries are critical for limiting the global temperature rise to 2°C by end of century while keeping the door open to keep it below 1.5°C. 

India’s climate actions are synchronized with its development goals and simultaneously reflect its bold vision for combating climate change. India has undertaken ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions in the field of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centers, promotion of waste to wealth, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, abatement of pollution and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. Planned actions and economic reforms have contributed positively to the rapidly declining growth rate of energy intensity in India and steps are being undertaken to de-couple the Indian energy system from carbon in the long run. However, poverty eradication remains an overriding priority for us as we strive to ensure housing, electricity and food security for all. India has taken ambitious targets in its NDC and is on path for achieving those. This is in line with all our glorious traditions which have for centuries stood for sustainable lifestyles and care for nature. In fact India’s traditional wisdom can be a beacon of light at this stage. We appreciate the initiative by the Fijian Presidency for adopting the Bula spirit of inclusiveness for guiding climate change discussions and action. India supports an inclusive approach and believes that citizens are important stakeholders and must also be included in this process. I think if all global citizens contribute to ‘green good deeds’, the challenge of combating climate change shall become more manageable. 

Going forward, we expect that the COP 23 outcomes are balanced and reached upon through a party-driven process. They should not result in reinterpretation of the Paris Agreement and equal progress should be made on all pillars. 

At COP 21 in Paris, Mr. Narendra Modi, Indian Prime Minister and Mr. François Hollande, French President released a book ‘Ecology of our worlds: views on climate and the environment’. It highlighted the wisdom of ancient and contemporary thinkers on the environment and climate, to serve as guidance to inspire the necessary transformation and pave the way for harmonious co-existence between humans and nature and a communion between our inner self and outer life. It is in this spirit that we are organizing sessions on Yoga at the India Pavilion here in Bonn. I welcome you all to come and benefit from this ancient Indian practice, the spiritual aspects of which, can address lifestyle related issues and provide a solution to climate change. 

UN Secretary General U Thant, in his address at the 7th General Assembly held in New York in 1970, pondered what a future universal historian on another planet would say about us ‘With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas.’ This is not a future we wish to leave for our children. This is our chance to act fast and do more to save the only planet that we have got. Let us make ourselves proud. 

Thank You”.

                The lost agenda in Climate Change negotiations at Twenty Third Conference of Parties (COP 23) on ambitious pre-2020 mitigation action by developed countries was redeemed with efforts by India, China and other developing countries. Many of the proposals floated by India as part of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) were agreed upon by the COP Presidency and found a place in the draft decision text.

A strong message was communicated to the developed countries that post-2020 climate action as part of the Paris Agreement cannot be divorced from pre-2020 commitments. Failure by developed countries to act on previous COP decisions will undermine the integrity of the UNFCCC process and unduly burden the developing countries to do more than their fair share in the post 2020 era.

Early entry into force of second commitment period of Kyoto Protocol (KP II) is at the heart of pre-2020 discussions, which entails revisit of greenhouse gas mitigation targets by developed countries and provision of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries. Although this agenda has a significant bearing on developing countries and has been under discussion since 2007, it has slowly been relegated to the background.

Strong voices of concern by developing countries prompted the COP Presidency to recognize their concerns and call for early ratification of KP II and consult United Nations Secretary General to encourage it. The draft texts addresses the key ask from India on a mid-2018 deadline for this process. Other important decisions include a periodic stocktake of pre-2020 implementation and ambition at COP 24 in 2018 and COP 25 in 2019.

The year 2018 is an important year for Climate Change negotiations as it will help finalize the Paris Agreement rulebook and perhaps will also be the last opportunity to close the emissions gap by developed countries. In this regard, the scope of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue has been expanded from taking stock of collective efforts for the long-term mitigation goal and inform the preparation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to considering pre 2020 action and support as well.

It is expected that the 2018 Facilitate Dialogue will focus on closing the emissions gap so as to have a better starting point in 2020 for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

                Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change said today that on account of further measures taken by implementing agencies at ground level, as directed by the Ministry and also due to improving weather conditions, the Particulate Matter (PM) levels in Delhi and NCR declined further as anticipated. The Particulate Matter level reached Very Poor category with PM10 at 316.8 micrograms /m3 and PM2.5 at 206.8 micrograms/m3 at 16:00 Hours today, compared to severe category yesterday. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that all the measures and actions initiated by various agencies will be pursued vigorously and continued further. 

The Minister also said that the hotspots in the city have been already identified for local control measures, including sprinkling of water, regulation of construction activities, dust mitigation, as well as other actions for control measures, as directed by the MOEFCC to various ground-level agencies. He added that a meeting with concerned agencies is proposed on 17.11.2017at CPCB to discuss the actions taken for local control of pollutants in the identified hotspots. 

""The actions are being reviewed on a daily basis, based on the reports of the field teams of CPCB deployed for getting feedback on the actions initiated by the implementing agencies and further follow-up is also taken diligently"", assured Dr Harsh Vardhan.

                Union Minister for Environment Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology & Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said today that on account of pollution control measures and slight improvement in weather conditions, the declining trend in PM levels which started in the afternoon of November 12, 2017 continues even today and Delhi and NCR have now moved from emergency level to severe category of PM levels with PM10 being 392 µg/m3 and PM2.5 being 262 µg/m3 at 1300 hrs today. Appreciating the discipline shown by the public in general, Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that this has largely been achieved due to efforts of various government agencies and public participation based on voluntary actions. 

He further added that the IMD has predicted that weather conditions are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over next 2-3 days and hence, air quality is expected to improve further. During the Task Force Meeting held at CPCB on November 13, 2017, the measures taken by the SPCBs were reviewed and they were requested to intensify the actions against violators, especially in industrial and the construction sectors, added Dr Harsh Vardhan. 

“At this juncture, while all government agencies have to maintain highest level of alertness and continue intense efforts at checking pollution, I would like to appeal to all citizens in Delhi & NCR to continue the good work and help us with achieving better levels of air quality”, added Dr Harsh Vardhan.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology & Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that there is a declining trend in the levels of Particulate Matter at present, indicating an improvement in air quality due to the efforts made by implementing agencies. “There has been a decline in PM10 values – from 712.1 to 566.6 micrograms and decline in PM2.5 levels from 480 to 385.7 micrograms at 2.00 p.m today”, the Minister said. He added that with the present trend, it is expected that the decline in Particulate Matter levels will continue and air quality is likely to fall back in the Severe category. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that the present air quality in Delhi NCR has been in the Severe Plus category and emergency conditions due to adverse weather conditions because of western disturbances, stubble burning and high levels of relative humidity. 

The Minister said that initially the conditions started on November 7, 2017 at 6.00 a.m and declined to severe category (concentration less than 500 micrograms/m3 for PM10 and less than 300 micrograms/m3 for PM2.5) on November 11 at 3.00 p.m. Later, the level has gone up again because of adverse weather conditions, which is further improving now.

                Emphasising that air quality has been improving over the last two days, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the people of Delhi need not panic, as several steps are being taken by the Government to mitigate air pollution.  Speaking to mediapersons here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) must be earnestly and meticulously implemented by the concerned State Governments, as well as municipal and civic organisations. He added that focussed attention at the highest level has been ensured through committees headed by the Union Minister, Minister of State, MoEF&CC and Secretary, MoEF&CC.   Dr. Harsh Vardhan referred to the review meetings with concerned State Governments and agencies and said that crop residue and stubble burning have been under detailed discussions during all these meetings. 

  The Environment Minister pointed out that for the first time, this year, a focussed approach has been adopted to deal with emergency-like situation through GRAP, which had been prepared last year.  He added that a Task Force has been set up to review the air quality in Delhi-NCR headed by Member Secretary, Central Pollution Control Board well in advance.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan also underlined the augmenting of the number of monitoring stations in Delhi-NCR to enhance the quality of information system. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stressed the fact that as a part of advance planning and special intervention, 40 monitoring teams of CPCB have been deployed since September 1, 2017 to give feedback on the ground situation and air polluting activities in Delhi.  ‘A systemic response mechanism was put in place for the last one year and regular alerts were conveyed to all stakeholders’, the Minister said.

Earlier, with a view to ensure wider public participation, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has launched campaigns such as “Harit Diwali, Swasth Diwali” and “Swachh Hawa for Swacchh and Swasth Bharat” involving over 2000 schools in Delhi and over two lakh schools in the country.  A mini-Marathon had also been organised on October 15, 2017 at India Gate, in which nearly 15, 000 school children had participated. 

Additionally, special focus has been trained on monitoring the situation at specific hotspots such as Anand Vihar, I.T.O, Punjabi Bagh and DTU.  Specific interventions have been suggested from time to time, as well as various directions have also been issued to implementation agencies such as state governments, district administration, police authorities, municipal corporations and industries for effective actions to curb air pollution. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised that in view of the recent episode of very high levels of air pollution, the following actions have been initiated in the Delhi-NCR region: 


	Activated close co-ordination with the concerned Ministries/State governments and departments.
	A committee headed by the Secretary, MoEF&CC comprising Secretary, Science & Technology, Secretary, Earth Sciences, Secretary, Biotechnology, Chairman, CPCB, representatives of Niti Aayog and NDMA has been constituted to review the present situation and suggest immediate, as well as long-term measures.
	A meeting of the Central Committee chaired by Secretary, MoEF&CC, comprising Chief Secretaries of concerned State governments of NCR and Chairman, CPCB convened to deliberate on effective measures under GRAP.
	Meeting with EPCA and CPCB was held to improve upon effectiveness of enforcement mechanism and to ensure coordinated approach of various agencies.
	Meeting has been held at the level of Lt. Governor, Delhi for better coordination among all agencies within Delhi for effective ground actions.


 The Environment Minister added that some of the immediate short-term measures initiated include: 


	Ban on diesel gen-sets, brick kilns, stone crushers, hot mix plants as per GRAP is being effectively enforced;
	Ban on entry of trucks with non-essential supplies to Delhi is being strictly enforced.
	Enhanced parking fee and capacity augmentation of public transport. Metro has increased its frequency and number of coaches by 25%.
	Civil construction activities have been stopped for the moment.
	Watering over unpaved roads to contain road dust is being carried out on a large scale. Fire tenders, water tankers of corporations have been pressed into service for sprinkling water. 
	Regulated emission from industries in NCR region advised the State governments to issue directions to the concerned authorities.
	Impose fines on defaulters through Municipal Corporations/State Pollution Control Boards and other organisations.
	Enforce ban on garbage burning.

A meeting to deliberate the issue of mitigation of air pollution was held here today under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).  Several decisions were discussed at the meeting.  After detailed deliberations, it was decided that all concerned organisations of State Governments and the Central government involved in this will work towards effectively implementing the following short-term measures immediately:-

(i)                 Strict compliance of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) and all other directives issued by Hon’ble Courts;

(ii)               Effective enforcement of ban on diesel gen-sets, brick kilns, stone crushers, hot mix plants etc.

(iii)             Ban on entry of unauthorised trucks into Delhi;

(iv)             Enhancing parking fee and capacity augmentation of public transport;

(v)               Use of methods of dust containment and stop civil construction activities for the moment;

(vi)             Ensure watering over unpaved roads to contain road dust;

(vii)           Impose fines on defaulters through Municipal Corporations/State Pollution Control Boards and other organisations; and

(viii)         Improve waste management and stop garbage burning.

The Committee also noted that these steps have already been initiated and that each of these steps needs to be enforced effectively.  It was decided that each State Government will set up one or more Monitoring Groups, which will continuously look at compliance.  There were suggestions that State Governments should also set up Flying Squads to assess the situation on the ground, prevent violation and report.

Chief Secretary, Haryana and representatives from Punjab government informed the Committee that stubble burning in both the States was over and in the medium term, further problems because of that may not arise.  However, both the States had requested that long-term measures to ensure that this does not happen every year need to be put in place.  On these issues, it was decided that the Committee will continue to meet regularly and discuss viable options like incentivising the farmers, providing subsidised equipment and using existing technologies to tide over this problem.

The meeting discussed the critical issue regarding deteriorating air quality in NCR and the short-term measures which were required to be urgently put in place.

            Among those who attended the meeting were - Chief Secretary, Haryana - Shri Deepender Singh Dhesi,  Chief Secretary, Delhi - Dr. MM Kutty, Principal Secretary, Department of Environment, Uttar Pradesh – Ms. Renuka Kmar, Chairman, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Punjab – Shri KS Pannu and Secretary, Department of Environment, Rajasthan – Shri RK Grover.     The meeting was also attended by Secretary, Ministry of Earth Science; Secretary, Department of Science and Technology; and Secretary, Department of Biotechnology and Chairman, CPCB.

                A seven-member committee headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has been constituted to continuously monitor the short-term and long-term solutions to air pollution. The Committee will meet at regular, short intervals to draw up a plan and ensure enforcement. Other members of the committee include:

Secretary, Science & Technology;

Secretary, Department of Biotechnology;

Additional Secretary, Niti Aayog;

Chief Secretary, Delhi;

Chairman, Central Pollution Control Board and

Representative of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.

Several other critical issues were deliberated upon at a meeting held in the Environment Ministry here today, to discuss and review the situation arising out of air pollution in Delhi and National Capital Region. Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri C.K Mishra, held a meeting with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) to assess the current situation of air quality and work out the future course of action. Chairman, EPCA, Shri Bhure Lal, Member, EPCA, Ms. Sunita Narain and officers of MoEF&CC were among those who attended the meeting.

A decision was taken at the meeting to request respective State Governments to fully implement the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) including control of road and construction dust, garbage burning, control of power plants and industrial emissions, entry of vehicles and several other related factors. It was also decided to ensure that apart from other directions, closure of brick kilns, hot mix plants, stone crushers, intensification of public transport, sprinkling of water and mechanised sweeping of roads, ban on construction, ban on use of pet coke and furnace oil should be fully implemented and respective implementing agencies held accountable. CPCB has been asked to continuously monitor the situation.

As meteorological conditions have been a major factor for the current situation, the issues likely to impact it were also discussed at the meeting. It was also decided to ensure that the directions issued by the MoEF&CC/CPCB/EPCA are implemented by all the concerned agencies and the hotspots are visited regularly to assess the situation.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, who is currently in Bonn, Germany, to attend the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, has requested all the State governments in the National Capital Region of Delhi to take effective steps for mitigating the levels of air pollution and bring them to acceptable levels. He has also requested for the effective implementation of Graded Response Action Plan, as well as other steps identified in various meetings held by the Central Government with the State Governments to improve the situation. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan recalled that he had held several meetings with all the State Governments, including the Government of Delhi and the measures required to deal effectively with the issue of air pollution have been agreed upon and reviewed regularly at his level and highest levels in the concerned State Governments.  He also referred to the steps taken to involve people in management of air pollution through Clean Air Campaign this year.  He said that every possible step required to tackle the situation has been already identified and the need of the hour was to put them into action at ground level, which will yield significant results. He also called for cost-effective measures since management of air pollution requires sustained action over a long period of time to be effective.  Referring to some media reports that Central Government has not supported the demand of the government of Delhi for sprinkling of water through helicopter, he said that it had already responded to the request and asked the State Government to examine cost-effectiveness of the measure vis-a-vis other simpler measures such as mechanised/vacuum sweeping of roads, blacktopping of dusty roads and road shoulders etc.  However, he said that if the Government of Delhi thought that sprinkling water through helicopter was the most cost effective measure, it was free to do so. 

The Minister also requested the State Governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to implement the ban related to stubble burning. He stated that the current high levels of the smog in some areas was the result of adverse meteorological conditions and hoped that the situation will improve in the near future.  He has also requested EPCA to effectively implement identified steps in a practical manner, so that visible improvement is seen on the ground.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan assured the people that the Central Government shall do everything possible to bring about improvement in the air quality in Delhi and NCR.

                          Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that India considers climate change as a major threat to collective well-being and wants to play a positive, as well as constructive role in combating it.  Addressing a gathering at the inauguration of India Pavilion at the ongoing meeting of Conference of Parties (COP-23) at Bonn in Germany today, the Minister said that climate change will put a disproportionate burden on the poor and marginalised sections of the global community.  He added that scientific evidence clearly indicates the severity of climate change and the cost of delayed action. “Access to clean air, water, and a livable climate are inalienable human rights. And solving this crisis is just not a question of politics, it is our moral obligation”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. 



     Emphasising that though India’s per capita emissions are only one-third of global average and its contribution to global stock of carbon dioxide is less than 3%, India has still moved ahead with implementation of path-breaking initiatives under the leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

          The Minister pointed out that India Pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress, our traditions and indigenous technology, aspirations and achievements.  

          Inviting views and best practices among different stakeholders, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that one of the key global objectives is to develop an inclusive world order that does not leave anyone behind. The Minister underlined poverty eradication as one of the most fundamental objectives we all must work together upon. Dr. Harsh Vardhan also pointed out that the contribution of citizens, sustainable lifestyles and climate justice provides an alternative means to address climate change, which must be rigorously pursued

 

          The Minister also highlighted several key initiatives at the national and state level.

The following is the text of the Environment Minister’s speech in Bonn today:

“I welcome you all to the India Pavilion at COP 23. India considers climate change a major threat to our collective well-being and wishes to play a positive and constructive role in combating it. We have large vulnerable populations and therefore, we take the challenge seriously, especially because climate change shall put disproportionate burden on the poor and marginalized sections of the global community. Therefore, this COP is of great significance to all of us.

We have gathered here at COP-23 in Bonn to move forward and work towards developing guidelines for efficient implementation of the Paris Agreement under the Convention.

Scientific evidence clearly indicates the severity of it and the cost of delayed action. Access to clean air, water, and a liveable climate are inalienable human rights. And solving this crisis is just not a question of politics, it is our moral obligation. We have only one planet and humankind must become accountable for the destruction of our collective home. Protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species. Though India’s per capita emissions are only one-third of global average, and its contribution to global stock of carbon dioxide is less than 3%, it has still moved ahead with implementation of path breaking initiatives under the dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

In this context, the India Pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress; our traditions and our indigenous technology; our aspirations and our achievements. India’s new economic momentum is a subject of international attention and a source of global opportunity.

A series of events will be hosted at India Pavilion showcasing India’s achievement, contributions and initiatives to address various dimensions of climate change and we invite exchange of views and best practices among different stakeholders. Therefore, we are here with a constructive and positive approach. One of the key global objectives is to develop an inclusive world order that leaves no one behind. Therefore, poverty eradication is one of the most fundamental objective that we all must work together to bestow upon the future generations a healthy and green planet.

Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister, we have launched many policies and institutional mechanisms to advance our climate actions. These initiatives are a reflection of our commitment towards addressing climate change concerns including energy security, food and water security, capacity enhancement at national and state level etc. Some of the key initiatives include:

·             Achieving about 58.3 GW of Renewable Energy Capacity out of a targeted 175 GW for 2022.

·             Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana for providing free LPG connections and Ujala for embracing energy efficient LED bulbs dedicated towards supporting citizens move towards sustainable lifestyle.

·        The broad policy initiatives of the central government are supplemented by actions of the State Governments. 32 States and Union Territories have put in place the State Action Plan on Climate Change attempting to mainstream climate change concerns in their planning process.

·        As part of our mission on strategic knowledge on climate change, we have established 8 Global Technology Watch Groups in the areas of Renewable Energy Technology, Advance Coal Technology, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Green Forest, Sustainable Habitat, Water, Sustainable Agriculture and Manufacturing.

·        India is one of the few countries where, despite ongoing development, forest and tree cover has increased transforming country’s forests into a net sink owing to national policies aimed at conservation and sustainable management of forests.

·        A number of schemes for transformation and rejuvenation of urban areas have been launched including Smart Cities Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. These schemes have integrated appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures for environment protection.

·        Swachh Bharat Mission has been launched with aim to make India clean and litter free. Government has recently revised following waste management rules to make them more effective, efficient and stringent.

·        Government has revised six waste management rules which are more effective, efficient and stringent. These include rules for solid waste, Plastic waste, E-waste, bio-Medical and Hazardous and Construction and Demolition Waste.

·        Greening of India's extensive Railway routes and Highways is being undertaken.

·        Air Quality Index launched in over 30 cities to provide real-time data of air pollution on daily basis.

·        Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been formulated with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop per drop'.

·        Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has been launched for farmers’ welfare. Another scheme has been launched to provide Soil Health Card to every farmer. Further Government of India has set up the goal is to double the income of the farmers by 2022.

·        Second Phase of Science Express Climate Action Special train with the aim to create awareness among various sections of society, especially students, on the science of climate change, the observed and anticipated impacts, and different possible responses as to how climate change can be combated.

·        Government has launched “Skill India” with the target to provide skill training in various sectors including sustainable development to about 400 million people by 2022.

·        Zero Effect, Zero Defect is a policy initiative to enhance energy efficiency and resources efficiency in Medium & Small Industries.

·        Another important initiative relating to rivers is the National Mission for Clean Ganga which seeks to rejuvenate the river along its length of more than 2,500 km.

·        Digital India has been launched to transform India into digital empowered society and knowledge economy. 

·        All these schemes contribute to mitigation and adaptation.

 

India has been ambitious in its climate change actions and expect other countries also to be ambitious based on their historical responsibility on the basis of equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. We also believe that contribution of citizens, sustainable lifestyles and climate justice provides an alternative means to address climate change which must be rigorously pursued.”

                The opening plenary of the 23rd Conference of Parities (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provided a flicker of hope to the poor and vulnerable people in the developing countries who are most at risk to the adverse impacts of climate change. 

The much forgotten, pre-2020 agenda, under which developed countries are to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP II) to undertake greenhouse gas emission cuts and also provide finance and technology support to developing countries for enhancing their ambition, found a place in the COP 23 agenda. 

Meeting the long-term temperature goal of limiting the temperature rise to 2°C by the end of century requires strong short-term action. Enhanced pre-2020 action will reduce the overall costs and economic challenges for making a transition to low carbon growth pathway and also reduce climate risks and help realize immediate co-benefits such as improved public health as a result of lower air pollution, improved energy security, reduced crop yield losses among others. 

India along with the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group strongly voiced the need for urgent time bound action on climate change by developed countries in the pre-2020 period to build trust and confidence for ambitious climate action in post 2020 era. In his intervention, Chief Negotiator of India on Climate Change, Mr. Ravi S. Prasad, called for early time-bound ratification of KP II by developed countries to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all Parties. He further added that this agenda is of utmost importance for developing countries and is not new but was agreed upon and under discussion since 2007. While action on Post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement has gained momentum, the discussions on Pre-2020 actions have lagged behind. 

COP 23 is critical and maybe the last chance for the developing countries to fight for their right to development and the global carbon space by ensuring that the developed countries act on their pre-2020 commitments. It is the foundation upon which climate action should be built after the year 2020.

                The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that the deceleration trend in overall growth, which was witnessed since the First Quarter of last Fiscal Year, has been now reversed. The Finance Minister was responding to the real GDP growth data for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2017-18 which was released here today by the CSO. As per the data, the real GDP growth is estimated at 6.3 percent, a substantial increase from 5.7 percent in the first quarter. Real GVA growth has shown a similar increase from 5.6 percent in the first quarter to 6.1 percent in the second quarter, despite a deceleration in agricultural growth from 2.3 percent in the first quarter to 1.7 percent in the second.

The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley further said that the acceleration in growth this quarter has been helped by a rapid growth in manufacturing which increased from 1.2 percent in the first quarter to 7 percent in the Second Quarter. Robust growth of 7.6 percent in electricity and other utilities, and 9.9 percent in trade, transportation and communications also powered this acceleration. Overall, the services sector recorded a growth of 7.1 percent in the second quarter. 

Encouragingly, the rate of growth of gross fixed capital formation has also increased from 1.6 percent in the first quarter to 4.7 percent in the second quarter. Real private consumption growth has broadly held steady at 6.5 percent.

​The Finance Minister concluded that the economy now seems to have weathered the transitional challenges experienced earlier in the year and appears poised for a durable recovery going forward.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing and ratification of the Investment Cooperation and Facilitation Treaty (ICFT) between India and Brazil.

The Treaty will result in increase of investment flows between the two countries. The ICFT between India and Brazil will provide appropriate facilitation to Brazilian investors in India and Indian investors in the Brazil. It is likely to increase the comfort level and boost the confidence of investors by assuring a level playing field and non-discrimination in all investment facilitation matters, thus providing conducive investment climate to investors. It would help project India as a preferred Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) destination to all Brazilian investors.

The website has been developed in-house by the NIC Wing of CPAO. The CPAO website is now web responsive and can be accessed by the pensioners on the mobile, tablet and other digital devices in a more responsive manner. The website provides a single window for both accessing pension related information and facilitating grievance Redressal of pensioners. By registering on the CPAO website, the pensioners can get the detailed information of their pension processing status and the last 12 payment details. They can also view and download all PPOs (Pension Payment orders) and SSAs (Special seal authorities) issued by CPAO. Apart from this, pensioners can register their grievances on CPAO website and track the status thereon.

 

The Ministries/Departments and banks have also been provided MIS Reports under their respective logins and their users can access various reports designed as per their needs. This would help them in better pension delivery and faster grievance redressal of pensioners.

                The Government of India is seized of the issue of Exporters complaining about delay in grant of refunds pertaining to Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) paid on goods exported out of India and similarly Input Tax credit (ITC) on exports. Media reports with incorrect estimations of refund amounts held-up for the period July to October 2017 have been noticed. It is clarified that the quantum of IGST refund claims as filed through Shipping Bills during the period July to October 2017, is approximately Rs. 6,500 crore and the quantum of refund of unutilized credit on inputs or input services, as per the RFD 01A applications filed on GSTN portal, is to the tune of Rs. 30 crore.

With regard to IGST paid on goods exported out of India, majority of refund claims for exports made in July, 2017, wherever due, have been sanctioned. Refund claims of IGST paid for exports made in August, September and October 2017 are being sanctioned seamlessly wherever returns have been accurately filed. The prerequisites for sanction of refund of IGST paid are filing of GSTR 3 B and table 6A of GSTR 1 on the GSTN portal and Shipping Bill(s) on Customs EDI System by the exporter. It is essential that exporters should ensure that there is no discrepancy in the information furnished in Table 6A of GSTR 1 and the Shipping Bill. It has been observed that certain common errors such as incorrect Shipping Bill number in GSTR1, mis-match of invoice number and IGST amount paid, wrong bank account etc. are being committed by exporters while filing their returns. These errors are the sole reason for delay in grant of refunds, or rejection thereof. While information has been made available to Exporters on the ICEGATE portal if they are registered, they may also contact jurisdictional Customs authorities to check the errors they have committed in furnishing information in GST returns and Shipping Bill, and rectify them at the earliest.

As the Customs System is designed to automatically grant refunds without involvement of any officer by matching information that is furnished on GSTN portal and Customs system, the onus is on the exporters to fill in all the details accurately. Exporters may,therefore, take due precaution to ensure that no errors creep in while filing Table 6A of GSTR 1 of August 2017 and onwards. The facility for filing GSTR 1 for August 2017 would also be ready by 4th December 2017. In case of wrong entries made in July, Table 9 of GSTR 1 of August month would allow amendments to GSTR 1 of July 2017.

As far as refund of the unutilized Input Tax Credit on inputs or input services used in making exports is concerned, exporters shall file an application in FORM GST RFD- 01A on the Common Portal where the amount claimed as refund shall get debited from the Electronic Credit Ledger of the exporter to the extent of the claim. Thereafter, a proof of debit (ARN- Acknowledgement Receipt Number) shall be generated on the GSTN portal, which is to be mentioned on the print-out of the FORM GST RFD-01A and to be submitted manually to the jurisdictional officer. The exporters may ensure that all the necessary documentary evidences are submitted along with the Form GST RFD 01A for timely sanction of refund.

Exporters are, therefore, advised to immediately file (a) Table 6A and GSTR 3B, if not already done, for processing of IGST refund (b) RFD 01A on GSTN portal for refund of the unutilized input tax credit on inputs or input services used in making exports and (c) GSTR 1 for August 2017 for amending details provided in July GSTR1 wherever required. The Government has taken various measures to alleviate the difficulty and is fully committed to provide speedy disbursal of refunds due to exporters.

                “Over the last few days, a rumour is being propagated regarding waiver of loans of capitalists by banks. Time has come for the nation to be apprised of facts in this regard.



Between the years 2008 to 2014, Public Sector Banks disbursed disproportionate sums of loans to several industries. The public needs to ask the rumour mongers at whose behest or under whose pressure were such loans disbursed. They should also be asked that when these debtors delayed in repayment of their loans and interest thereon to Public Sector Banks, what decision was taken by the then Government.

Rather than take firm decision with regard to such debtors, the then Government, through relaxation by banks in loan classification kept these defaulters as non-NPA accountholders. These loans were restructured through this, the loss to banks was kept hidden. The banks kept giving loans repeatedly to these debtors and kept ever-greening the loans.

The current Government recognised this nexus and took firm decisions with regard to the defaulters. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was enacted, and by amending it, in respect of companies whose money was not returned to the banks, decision was taken that the debtors concerned would not be allowed to participate in the business of such companies.

At the same time, banks were given necessary capital so that Public Sector Banks become strong and capable of contributing to nation’s development. The reason for giving capital to banks is that these banks may become mazboot, i.e., strong, rather than mazboor, i.e., hard-pressed. Public Sector Banks have been provided capital in the past as well. During 2010-11 to 2013-14 too, Government provided banks an amount of Rs. 44,000 crore for recapitalisation. Was that also for waiving loans of capitalists?

 


	
		
			
			Legacy of aggressive lending:

			During the period of aggressive lending from 2008 to 2014, the gross advances of Public Sector Banks increased from about Rs. 34,00,000 crore. Despite repayment not being regular on these, through relaxation in loan classification, banks continued to keep defaulters as non-NPA accountholders by restructuring them. Through this, the losses of banks and their precarious position was kept under the carpet.

			 
			
			
			
			
		
	



	
		
			
			Transparent and realistic recognition of NPA:

			Asset Quality Review carried out for clean and fully provisioned balance-sheets in 2015 revealed high NPA. Through correct recognition of NPA, the NPA amount of Public Sector Banks rose from Rs. 2,78,000 crore in March 2015 to Rs. 7,33,000 crore in June 2017. Meaning thereby that those loans, of about Rs. 4,54,466 crore, which were actually fit to be NPA and were under the carpet, were recognised after intensive scrutiny under Asset Quality Review.

			
				
					
						 
					
					
						 
						
					
				
			

			 

			 

			 

			 

			Provision for expected losses:

			In the past, adequate provision was not made for expected losses from stressed loans under the relaxation available for restructured loans. Public Sector Banks initiated clean-up and NPA recognition, and made up-front provision for expected loss. Government envisage need of capital to the tune of Rs. 1,80,000 crore till FY 2018-19. Accordingly, Government provided for Rs. 70,000 crore. As a result of Indradhanush despite high NPA and the need for consequential provisioning, Public Sector Banks were successful in complying with Basel III norms. Between 2013-14 and the first quarter of FY 2017-18, provision of Rs. 3,79,080 crore was made to deal with expected losses, as against provision of Rs. 1,96,937 crore made s

			in the preceding 10 years.

			 
			
			
			 

			

			

			 

			 

			 

			 

			 

			 

			 

			
			
		
	


No loan waiver:

Government has not waived any loans of big NPA defaulters as aforesaid. On the contrary, under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code brought by the Government, cases have been instituted in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for timebound recovery from 12 largest defaulters in six to nine months, in NPA cases of Rs. 1,75,000 crore. Cases for the recovery of NPA dues from the assets of these big defaulters are under way at various stages.

Bar on wilful defaulters:

To safeguard misuse of the legal process by unscrupulous and undesirable persons, this week, through an ordinance, Government has barred wilful defaulters and persons associated with NPA accounts from participating in the process under way in NCLT. Through these steps, for the first time in the country, Government has put in place a clean and effective system through which wilful defaulters of bank loans may be kept away from the management of their business and timebound recovery effected from them.

Unprecedented capitalisation of Public Sector Banks:

With the object of increase credit off-take and creation of jobs, Government has taken the big decision of capitalising Public Sector Banks. Under this, with maximum allotment in the current year, capital increase of Rs. 2,11,000 crore would be effected within two financial years. This would be arranged through Rs. 1,35,000 crore of recapitalisation bonds, Rs. 18,139 crore of budget provision, with the balance coming from raising of capital from the market (estimated potential Rs. 58,000 crore) by diluting Government shareholding. Through capital infusion, banks weakened by NPAs would become strong and become capable of raising adequate capital from the market. For receiving this capital, banks will have to carry out several reforms, so that such situations do not recur.

Loans to honest businesspersons:

Through these strong steps taken over the last three years, not only have the problems received as legacy been addressed but reforms for rebuilding the strength of Public Sector Banks have been boosted. The process of creation of strong and large banks began with the integration of State Bank of India, and the recapitalisation announced will bolster this process. While honest businesspersons will be able to access loans from strong and reformed banks, strict and clear law and the all-round clean-up initiated by the Government would result in a clean system in the country.”

In an immediate follow up action of last week's Cabinet approval for creation of the posts of Chairman and Technical Members of the National Anti-profiteering Authority under GST, the Government today issued orders appointing senior IAS officer Shri B.N. Sharma, as the first Chairman of this apex Authority in the rank of Secretary to Government of India. 

Shri B.N. Sharma, an IAS officer of 1985 batch belonging to Rajasthan cadre, is currently posted as Additional Secretary in the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance. Shri B.N. Sharma has been closely associated with the formulation of GST and its implementation. He has also worked as Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Power and prior to that, in the Commercial Taxes Department in the State of Rajasthan. As its first Chairman, Shri B.N. Sharma is expected to give a direction to the Authority in boosting the confidence of consumers that GST is a ''Good and Simple Tax'' in the overall national interest.               

Shri B.N. Sharma would be assisted by four senior officials of the rank of Joint Secretary and above, who have been appointed as Technical Members in the Authority. These officials are Shri J.C. Chauhan, Chairman Tax Tribunal, Himachal Pradesh; Shri Bijay Kumar, Principal Commissioner GST, Kolkata; Shri C.L. Mahar, Principal Commissioner GST, Meerut; and Ms. R. Bhagyadevi, ADG, Systems, Chennai.

The appointment orders of Shri B.N. Sharma as Chairman and of the other officials as Technical Members of the Authority were issued on the recommendation of a high level Selection Committee headed by Shri P.K. Sinha, Cabinet Secretary. Revenue Secretary, Chairman, CBEC and Chief Secretaries of States of Maharashtra and Tamilnadu were the other members of the Selection Committee.

The Authority has been set up for a two-year period, which would begin from the date Shri B.N. Sharma assumes charge as Chairman. 

The Authority is mandated to ensure that the benefits of input credit and the reduction in GST rates on specified goods or services are passed on to the consumers by way of a commensurate reduction in prices. With the Chairman and Technical Members now having been appointed, the Authority becomes functional thereby reassuring consumers of Governments' commitment that GST would result in lower prices of goods and services. 

It may be recalled that in almost every meeting, the GST Council has been engaged in rationalizing and reducing the GST rates on a wide spectrum of goods and services. The last and indeed the most significant reduction took place from midnight of 14 November, 2017 when the GST rate were slashed from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings. This now leaves only 50 items which attract the highest GST rate of 28%. Likewise, a large number of items witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12% and so on with some goods being completely exempt from GST. 

In addition to the Authority, the institutional mechanism for effective implementation of the ""anti-profiteering"" measures enshrined in the GST rules consists of a Standing Committee, State level Screening Committees and the Directorate General of Safeguards in the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC). 

Consumers who are aggrieved that there has been no commensurate reduction in prices may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the State. After forming a prima facie view on the substance of the application, the matter would be referred to a Standing Committee at the Centre. The Standing Committee shall, in turn, ask the Director General of Safeguards, CBEC to carry out detailed investigation. The Director General of Safeguards shall report its findings to the Authority. The Screening Committee is expected to look into complaints of local nature while the Standing Committee would ordinarily enquire into cases of mass impact with All India ramification. 

Once the Authority confirms there is justification to apply anti-profiteering measures, it has the authority to order the business concerned to reduce its prices or return the undue benefit availed along with interest @18% to the consumers of the goods or services. If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the consumers, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund. The Authority also has the power to impose penalty on the defaulting business or even order the cancellation of its registration under GST.

The Authority shall function from the Jeevan Bharti Building, Connaught Place, New Delhi. The secretariat for the Authority shall be as follows:

Directorate General of Safeguards,

2nd Floor, Bhai Veer Singh Sahitya Sadan,

Bhai Veer Singh Marg, Gole Market,

New Delhi: 110001.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the signing and ratifying of an Agreement between India and Philippines on co-operation and mutual assistance in customs matters. 

The Agreement will help in the availability of relevant information for the prevention and investigation of Customs offences. The Agreement is also expected to facilitate trade and ensure efficient clearance of goods traded between the countries. 

This Agreement shall enter into force after the necessary national legal requirements for entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled by both the countries. 

Background: 

The Agreement would provide a legal framework for sharing of information and intelligence between the Customs authorities of the two countries. It would help in the proper application of Customs laws, prevention and investigation of Customs offences and the facilitation of legitimate trade. The draft text of the proposed Agreement has been finalized with the concurrence of the two Customs Administrations. The draft Agreement takes care of Indian Customs' concerns and requirements, particularly in the area of exchange of information on the correctness of the Customs value declared and authenticity of certificates of origin of the goods traded between the two countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved India's Membership for European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)

Necessary steps will be initiated by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance to acquire the membership of the EBRD.

 Impact:

·        Membership of EBRD would enhance India's international profile and promote its economic interests. Access to EBRD's Countries of Operation and sector knowledge.

·        India's investment opportunities would get a boost.

·        It would increase the scope of cooperation between India and EBRD through co-financing opportunities in manufacturing, services, Information Technology, and Energy.

·        EBRD's core operations pertain to private sector development in their countries of operation. The membership would help India leverage the technical assistance and sectoral knowledge of the bank for the benefit of development of private sector.

·        This would contribute to an improved investment climate in the country.

·        The membership of EBRD would enhance the competitive strength of the Indian firms, and provide an enhanced access to international markets in terms of business opportunities, procurement activities, consultancy assignments etc.

·        This would open up new vistas for Indian professionals on the one hand, and give a fillip to Indian exports on the other.

·        Increased economic activities would have the employment generating potential.

·        It would also enable Indian nationals to get the employment opportunity in the Bank.

 Financial Implications:

 The minimum initial investment towards the membership of EBRD will be approximately €1 (one) million. However, this assumption is based on India deciding to buy the minimum number of shares (100) required for obtaining the membership. If India were to buy a higher number of Bank shares, the financial implications could be higher. In-principle approval of the Cabinet at this stage is being obtained for joining the Bank.

 Background

 The issue relating to acquiring the membership of the ""European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)"" had been under consideration of the Government. With the country's impressive economic growth over the years and enhanced international political profile, it was considered appropriate that India should expand its presence on the global developmental landscape beyond its association with the Multi-lateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank. The decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB) was taken earlier in this backdrop.

                The GST Council in its 23rd Meeting held on 10th November, 2017 at Guwahati, has recommended the reduction of the GST rate from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings, leaving now only 50 items under the GST slab rate of 28%. A large number of items have also witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12%, 12% to 5% and so on. All these changes are effective from the midnight of 14th November, 2017. The benefit of reduction in the GST rate has to be passed on by the suppliers to the consumers by way of commensurate reduction in prices. The reduction in GST rates is also expected to encourage domestic demand and investment. 

Ms. Vanaja N. Sarna, Chairperson, Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) has addressed a letter to all the major Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies pointing out the need to immediately revise the MRP on all the products in which the reduction of GST has been announced by the Council. She has also requested all to give wide publicity to the revised MRP of products. The Government expects that the industry should immediately respond to the earlier appeal made by the Finance Minister on this issue.

                The Logistics Sector has been granted Infrastructure status.The need for integrated Logistics sector development has been felt for quite some time in view of the fact that the logistics cost in India is very high compared to developed countries. High logistics cost reduces the competitiveness of Indian goods both in domestic as well as export market. Development of logistics would give a boost to both domestic and external demand thereby encouraging manufacturing and 'job creation'. This will in turn be instrumental in improving country's GDP.

The inclusion of “Logistics Sector” in the Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Sub-sectors was considered in the 14th Institutional Mechanism (IM) Meeting held on 10th November, 2017. It was recommended by the Institutional Mechanism and subsequently approved by the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley. “Logistics Infrastructure” is included by insertion of a new item in the renamed category of ‘Transport and Logistics’, with a footnote stating that ""Logistics Infrastructure” means and includes Multi-modal Logistics Park comprising Inland Container Depot (ICD) with minimum investment of Rs. 50 crore and minimum area of 10 acre, Cold Chain Facility with minimum investment of Rs.15 crore and minimum area of 20,000 sq. ft, and/or Warehousing Facility with investment of minimum Rs. 25 crore and minimum area of 1 lakh sq ft.

It will enable the Logistics Sector to avail infrastructure lending at easier terms with enhanced limits, access to larger amounts of funds as External Commercial Borrowings (ECB), access to longer tenor funds from insurance companies and pension funds and be eligible to borrow from India Infrastructure Financing Company Limited (IIFCL).

                An Interim Meeting of the Steering Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) was held here today in national capital to assess the Center’s activities since its inauguration in February 2017 and to review the Fiscal Year 2018 Work Plan. The Committee had met earlier on February 13, 2017 after the inauguration of the Center. Officials from all Six (6) Member countries attended, together with the Development Partner representatives (the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and USAID), and IMF staff.

In his Opening Remarks, the Chairman, Shri Dinesh Sharma, Special Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of India noted that “for building SARTTAC to meet its potential, a convergence of bright, right and positive minds are needed”. The Steering Committee Members welcomed the speed with which SARTTAC has become operational and the array of capacity development (training and technical assistance), the Center has delivered across all work streams in a short space of time. They strongly supported the demand-driven principles embedded in the preparation of the Work Program. The Committee appreciated the range of training delivered to Member countries, including in-country training and the inclusion of subnational officials from India. There was an appreciation for the efforts being made to blend the training with technical assistance, leveraging the unique design of the Center that allows it to deliver both the types of support. The Committee also recognized the efforts, the Center has been making to customize training that is tailored to the unique needs of the South Asia’s economies. 

The Committee took note of the large demand from member countries to work with SARTTAC on their capacity development needs; this includes growing interest from India’s subnational Governments. Recognizing resource constraints on the center’s operations, it supported calls to prioritizing rigorously and continuing to demonstrate results. The Committee members also recognized the high resource costs of customization and agreed that scope to customize all activities was constrained. At the same time, the Committee expected SARTTAC’s Budget’s to be managed flexibly to ensure the Center was able to respond in an agile way to meet members’ needs. Members also took note of the actions required to support and strengthen the selection of training participants to ensure maximum impact. 

The Committee endorsed the FY 2018 work plan. It also approved a new work area in Government Finance and Public Debt Statistics, where members have expressed strong demand, and work is underway to plan future technical assistance and training. The Committee welcomed progress in securing over 90 percent of the financing for SARTTAC’s first five-year (2017-2022) Phase. SARTTAC was encouraged to continue its dissemination of results, its coordination with external partners in the region, and its outreach activities. The next Steering Committee meeting will take place in Sri Lanka in May, 2018.

The South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC), which was inaugurated in February 2017, is the first IMF Regional Capacity Development Center to fully integrate training and technical assistance activities. Located in New Delhi, India, SARTTAC works with Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Member countries finance two-thirds of the Center’s Budget, with additional funding from the European Union, Korea, the United Kingdom, and Australia. 

The IMF’s capacity development efforts are part of its core mandate and help Governments modernize their economic policies and institutions. A global network of Regional Capacity Development Centers anchor IMF support for economic institution building and are complemented by global thematic funds for capacity development. They are financed jointly by the IMF, external development partners, and member countries.

                The Finance Act, 2012 inserted a new Chapter XII-BB consisting of Section 115JG in the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) which contains “Special provisions relating to conversion of Indian Branch of a Foreign Bank into a Subsidiary Company”.  Section 115JG of the Act, inter alia, provides that in case the conversion of Indian Branch of foreign bank fulfils the conditions notified by the Central Government, the capital gains arising from such conversion shall not be chargeable to tax and the provision relating to unabsorbed depreciation, set-off or carry forward and set-off of losses, tax credit in respect of tax paid on deemed income relating to certain companies and the computation of income in case of foreign company and Indian subsidiary shall apply with such modification, exception etc. as may be specified in the notification.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the “Scheme for setting-up of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) by foreign bank in India” (the Scheme) on 6th November, 2013. The Scheme, inter alia, provides the procedure for conversion of existing branches of Foreign Bank in WOS.  A Foreign Bank is required to set-up a WOS in India and the Indian Branch shall amalgamate with WOS as per the Amalgamation Scheme approved by the shareholder of Foreign Bank and WOS which is sanctioned by the RBI.

 In view of the above, it is proposed to issue Notification under Section 115JG(1) of the Act specifying the conditions to be fulfilled by the conversion and also specifying modifications, exceptions, in applicability of certain provisions of the Act to such conversion. In order to have wider consultations in this matter, the draft of proposed Notification has been uploaded on the website www.incometaxindia.gov.in. The stakeholders are requested to send their comments/suggestions on the Draft Notification by 30.11.2017 to the email address dirtpl2[at]nic[dot]in.

                Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has upgraded the Government of India's local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Baa2 from Baa3 and changed the outlook on the rating to stable from positive. India’s rating has been upgraded after a period of 13 years. India’s sovereign credit rating was last upgraded in January 2004 to Baa3 (from Ba1).

Government of India welcomes the upgrade and believes, as rightly noted by the Moody’s that this is in recognition of major economic and institutional reforms undertaken by Government of India. These reforms include introduction of path breaking Goods and Services Tax (GST); putting in place a sound monetary policy framework; measures taken to address recapitalisation of public sector banks and a number of measures taken to bring formalisation and digitalisation (The JAM agenda) in the economy - demonetization, the Aadhaar system of biometric accounts and targeted delivery of benefits through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system.

Moody’s have also rightly recognized the Government’s commitment to macro stability which has led to low inflation, declining deficit and prudent external balance and Government’s fiscal consolidation programme which has resulted in a reduction of fiscal deficits from 4.5% of GDP in 2013-14 to 3.5% in 2016-17 and its consequential sobering impact on general government debt. Government intends to stay the course on fiscal consolidation in the medium term.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for the creation of the posts of Chairman and Technical Members of the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) under GST, following up immediately on yesterday's sharp reduction in the GST rates of a large number of items of mass consumption.This paves the way for the immediate establishment of this apex body, which is mandated to ensure that the benefits of the reduction in GST rates on goods or services are passed on to the ultimate consumers by way of a reduction in prices.

The establishment of the NAA, to be headed by a senior officer of the level of Secretary to the Government of India with four Technical Members from the Centre and/or the States, is one more measure aimed at reassuring consumers that Government is fully committed to take all possible steps to ensure the benefits of implementation of GST in terms of lower prices of the goods and services reach them.

It may be recalled that effective from midnight of 14th November, 2017 the GST rate has been slashed from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings. There are now only 50 items which attract the GST rate of 28%. Likewise, a large number of items have witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12% and so on and some goods have been completely exempt from GST.

The ""anti-profiteering"" measures enshrined in the GST law provide an institutional mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits and reduced GST rates on supply of goods or services flow to the consumers. This institutional framework comprises the NAA, a Standing Committee, Screening Committees in every State and the Directorate General of Safeguards in the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC).

Affected consumers who feel the benefit of commensurate reduction in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular State. However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with 'All India' ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee. After forming a prima facie view that there is an element of profiteering, the Standing Committee shall refer the matter for detailed investigation to the Director General of Safeguards, CBEC, which shall report its findings to the NAA.

In the event the NAA confirms there is a necessity to apply anti-profiteering measures, it has the authority to order the supplier / business concerned to reduce its prices or return the undue benefit availed by it along with interest to the recipient of the goods or services. If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the recipient, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund. In extreme cases, the NAA can impose a penalty on the defaulting business entity and even order the cancellation of its registration under GST.

The constitution of the NAA shall bolster confidence of consumers as they reap the benefits of the recent reduction in GST rates, in particular, and of GST, in general.

                Various representations have been received from Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations regarding unwillingness of the vendors / suppliers to record the UIN (Unique Identify Number) while making sales to such Missions / Consulates or UN organizations. It may be noted that sale or supply to Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations is like any other Business to Consumer (B2C) sale and will not have any additional effect on the supplier’s tax liability. Recording of UIN while making such sales will enable Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations to claim refund of the taxes paid by them in India. Therefore, it is advised that under no circumstance any supplier should decline to record the UIN of the diplomat / official on the tax invoice. 

Further, it may also be noted that the diplomats / consulate staff may quote the same UIN as allotted to their Missions / Consulates or UN organizations while making any purchases. 

Unique Identification Number (UIN) is a 15-digit unique number allotted to any specialised agency of the United Nations Organisation or any Multilateral Financial Institution and Organisation notified under the United Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947, Consulate or Embassy of foreign countries. First two digits of the UIN denotes State code where the Diplomatic Mission/Consulate/ Embassy is located. 

Search functionality for UIN is available on the GST Common Portal in “Search Taxpayer” option. On entering UIN and captcha, details of the Diplomatic Mission/Consulate/ Embassy will be available.

The GST Council, in its 23rd meeting held
at Guwahati on 10th November 2017, has recommended the followingfacilitative
measuresfortaxpayers:

Return
Filing

a)      The
return filing process is to be further simplified in the following manner:

                   
i.           
All
taxpayers would file return in FORM GSTR-3B along with payment of tax by 20th
of the succeeding month till March, 2018. 

                 
ii.           
For filing of details in FORM GSTR-1 till
March 2018, taxpayers would be divided into two categories. Details of these
two categories along with the last date of filing GSTR 1 are as follows:

(a) Taxpayers
with annual aggregate turnover uptoRs. 1.5 croreneed to file GSTR-1 on quarterly
basis as per following frequency:




 
  
  Period
  
  
  Dates
  
 
 
  
  Jul- Sep
  
  
  31st Dec 2017
  
 
 
  
  Oct- Dec
  
  
  15th Feb 2018
  
 
 
  
  Jan- Mar
  
  
  30th April 2018
  
 




 

(b)      Taxpayers
with annual aggregate turnover more thanRs. 1.5 croreneed to file GSTR-1 on monthly
basis as per following frequency:

  Mar
  
  
  10th May 2018
  
 




 

               
iii.           
The time period for
filing GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 for the months of July, 2017 to March 2018 would
be worked out by a Committee of Officers. However, filing of GSTR-1 will
continue for the entireperiod without requiring filing of GSTR-2 & GSTR-3
for the previous month / period.

b)      A
large number of taxpayers were unable to file their return in FORM GSTR-3B
within due date for the months of July, August and September, 2017.Late fee was
waived in all such cases. It has been decided that where such
late fee was paid, it will be re-credited to their Electronic Cash Ledger under
“Tax” head instead of “Fee” head so as to enable them to use that amount for
discharge of their future tax liabilities. The software changes for this would
be made and thereafter this decision will be implemented.

c)      For
subsequent months, i.e. October 2017 onwards, the amount of late fee payable by
a taxpayerwhose tax liability for that month was ‘NIL’will be Rs. 20/- per day
(Rs. 10/- per day eachunder CGST & SGST Acts) instead of Rs. 200/- per day
(Rs. 100/- per day eachunder CGST & SGST Acts). 

 

Manual
Filing

d)     A
facility for manual filing of application for advance ruling is being
introduced for the time being.

 

Further
benefits for service providers

e)      Exports
of services to Nepal and Bhutan have already been exempted from GST. It has now
been decided that such exporters will also be eligible for claiming Input Tax
Creditin respect of goods or servicesused for
effecting such exempt supply of servicesto Nepal and Bhutan.

f)       In
an earlier meeting of the GST Council, it was decided to exempt those service
providers whose annual aggregate turnover is less than Rs. 20 lakhs (Rs. 10 lakhs
in special category states except J & K) from obtaining registration even
if they are making inter-State taxable supplies of services. As a further
measure towards taxpayer facilitation, it has been decided to exempt such
suppliers providing services through an e-commerce platform from obtaining
compulsory registration provided their aggregate turnover does not exceed
twenty lakh rupees. As a result, all service providers, whether supplying intra-State,
inter-State or through e-commerce operator, will be exempt from obtaining GST
registration, provided their aggregate turnover does not exceed Rs. 20 lakhs
(Rs. 10 lakhs in special category States except J & K).

 

Extension
of dates

g)      Taking
cognizance of the late availability or unavailability of some forms on the
common portal, it has been decided that the due dates for furnishing the
following forms shall be extended as under:

agencies will be done by the Central Government in coordination with the
Ministry of External Affairs.

Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has planned to conduct State specific APY mobilization Campaigns under the title “People First”. The People First campaign will be a series of campaigns conducted at various states across the country to increase APY outreach. 

To begin with, People First Campaign is being conducted in the State of Uttar Pradesh from 7th- 14th November 2017. In the first three days, more than 15,000 APY accounts have been sourced in UP. All the banks and its branches and postal branches are participating in the Campaign with enthusiasm. UP has more than 17,000 APY touch points which include all bank branches and post offices in the State. Out of 17,000 branches, more than 15000 branches have sourced at least one APY account in the current year. 

At the end of the Campaign, PFRDA has planned to recognize the achievers under the criteria given below. 

UP is the largest State in the country with a population of 7.1 crore in the APY scheme age group of 18-40 years. UP State is the largest contributor so far in the scheme, with nearly 7 lacs enrolment. There is however considerable scope for future growth in APY enrolments in the State. 

Overall, APY subscriber base has reached 71 lacs and more than 10,000 APY accounts are getting opened every day. 

Based on the success of the Campaign, PFRDA is planning to roll out similar campaigns in other States such as Bihar, MP and Rajasthan in the next few weeks.

The Agreement will stimulate flow of investment, technology and personnel from India to HKSAR & vice versa, prevent double taxation and provide for exchange of information between the two Contracting Parties. It will improve transparency in tax matters and will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance.

This Agreement is on similar lines as entered into by India with other countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the protocol amending the Agreement between India and Kyrgyz Republic for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.

The Protocol amending Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) aims to update Article 26 (Exchange of Information) of the DTAA to international standards. The updated Article provides for exchange of information to the widest possible extent. The new paragraphs 4 and 5 being inserted into the existing Article 26 of the DTAA provide that the State from which information is requested cannot deny information on the ground that it has no domestic tax interest in that information or that the information requested is held by a bank or a financial institution, etc. The Protocol further empowers India to use information received under the DTAA to be used for other law enforcement purposes on the supplying State authorizing such use.

Background: 

The existing DTAA between India and Kyrgyz Republic was notified on 7/02/2001 and the same was in force since 10/01/2001. A Protocol amending DTAA between India and Kyrgyz Republic for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income has been agreed to be signed between the two countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing the Joint Interpretative Declaration (JID) between India and Colombia regarding the existing Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between India and Colombia signed on November 10, 2009.

The JID would impart clarity to the interpretation of the existing Agreement as itincludes interpretative notes to be jointly adopted for many clauses, including, the definition of investor, definition of investment, Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET), National Treatment (NT) and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment, expropriation, Investor - State Dispute Settlement provision and Denial of Benefits.

Joint Interpretative Declarations/Statements in general play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime. With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements is likely to have strong persuasive value before arbitration tribunals. Such pro-active approach by partners can foster a more predictable and coherent reading of treaty terms by arbitration tribunals.

                Pursuant to revelations made by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), a Washington based organization in April 2016 about certain Indians having linkages with entities in offshore no tax/low tax jurisdictions, the Government constituted a Multi-Agency Group (MAG) on 4th April 2016, inter alia, to facilitate co-ordinated and speedy investigation. The MAG consisted of officers of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Reserve Bank of India.  So far, the MAG has submitted 7 reports to the Government.

The Panama Papers contained brief particulars of about 426 persons, prima facie, Indians or persons of Indian origin. The Income Tax Department conducted enquiries in all 426 cases, inter alia, through making 395 references to 28 foreign jurisdictions. Based on analysis of the information obtained and investigation conducted, the outcome so far indicates 147 actionable cases and 279 non-actionable cases (non-residents/no irregularities etc).

Out of the 147 actionable cases:


	Investigations have led to the detection of undisclosed credits of about Rs. 792 crore, so far;
	Searches have been conducted in 35 cases and surveys in 11 cases;
	In other cases, the persons have been confronted with the evidences during enquiries;
	In 5 cases criminal prosecution complaints have been filed;
	In 7 cases notices under section 10 of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income & Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 have been issued;
	Further investigation in all the above cases is in progress.

                Revelations made today in the media under the name ‘Paradise Papers’ [based upon expose done by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)] indicate that out of 180 countries represented in the data of offshore entities held by persons of different nationalities, India ranks 19th in terms of number of names. 714 Indians reportedly appear in the tally. The Paradise Papers include nearly 7 million loan agreements, financial statements, emails, trust deeds and other paperwork over nearly 50 years from inside Appleby, a prestigious offshore law firm with offices in Bermuda and beyond. The leaked documents include files from the smaller, family-owned trust company, Asiaciti (Singapore), and from company registries in 19 secrecy jurisdictions. 

            Names of only a few Indians (legal entities as well as individuals) have appeared so far in the media. Even the ICIJ website (www.icij.org) has not yet released the names and other particulars of all the entities. The website of ICIJ suggests that information will be released in phases and structured data connected to the Paradise Papers investigation will be released only in the coming weeks on its Offshore Leaks Database. 

            The Investigation units of the Income Tax Department (ITD) have been alerted to take note of revelations for immediate appropriate action. It has been reported that many cases of offshore entities are already under investigation on fast track. As soon as further information surfaces, swift action as per law will follow. 

            Further, the Government has directed that investigations in cases of Paradise Papers will be monitored through a reconstituted Multi Agency Group, headed by the Chairman, CBDT, having representatives from CBDT, ED, RBI & FIU.

                The Government of India, 25 State Governments and Asian Development Bank (ADB) jointly reviewed a total of 55 investment projects financed by ADB recently in Bengaluru. 

Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary (Multilateral Institutions), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, and Mr. Diwesh Sharan, Deputy Director General (DDG) for ADB’s South Asia Department, co-chaired the Tripartite Portfolio Review Meeting to discuss the status of ongoing projects and prioritized actions to achieve their implementation targets. Over 150 officials of the Central and State Governments including Project Directors, and ADB staff participated in the said meeting. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Sameer Kumar Khare said that the projects assisted by multilateral development banks such as ADB should demonstrate faster and better results while facilitating international best practices, new technologies and reforms. He said that the Review Meeting is an important forum to discuss issues and find resolution for timely and quality implementation of development projects. 

Referring to the recently approved 5-year Country Partnership Strategy for India, ADB’s South Asia, DDG, Mr. Diwesh Saran said that ADB is willing to enhance its annual sovereign lending from the present $2 billion to $3 billion, building on the increasingly robust implementation performance in the recent years, and by extending support to low income states and economic corridors. 

As of October 2017, ADB’s projects under implementation for India comprise 55 projects amounting to $13.5billion, of which works worth $9.6 billion is ongoing and $5.4 billion has been disbursed. ADB primarily focuses its assistance in India on three Infrastructure Sectors—Energy; Transport; and Urban Infrastructure and Services. 

The TPRM acknowledged the further acceleration of ADB-financed project implementation in 2017, with the likely annual disbursement reaching almost $2 billion. The Meeting also accorded the best project implementation performance awards to the following projects: 

· Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission and Distribution System Improvement Project 

· Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program (Tranche-1) 

· Uttarakhand Emergency Assistance Project.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed here today the Joint Financial Partnership Declaration in the august presence of the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley with an objective to deepen the cooperation in support of Renewable Energy.

ISA and EBRD have joined hands for promotion of Solar Energy. From ISA’s side, Shri Upendra Tripathy, the Interim Director General ISA and on behalf of EBRD Ms. Nandita Parshad, Managing Director EBRD for Energy and Natural Resources signed the declaration. During the signing ceremony Shri Anand Kumar Secretary, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Government of India, H.E. Mr Alexandre Ziegler, Ambassador of France to India and Sir Suma Chakrabarti, EBRD President were also present.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley said that India has been in the forefront of the 42 nation International Solar Alliance. He said that India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has pledged unequivocal commitment for furthering the cause of New and Renewable Energy since the Paris COP21 UN Climate Change Conference. Shri Jaitley said that our energy requirements are huge and want to make optimal use of our New and Renewable Sources of energy. The Finance Minister congratulated both ISA and EBRD for partnering with an objective to deepen cooperation in support of renewable energy. Shri Jaitley said that ISA has taken a giant leap forward to mobilise international support for investment in Solar Sector. He added that ISA need to firm-up such financial partnership deals with more Multilateral and Bilateral Donor Agencies in order to meet its stated objectives of getting better Technology; aiding easier costing to improve affordability of Solar Energy. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley urged both the signing parties to go in for innovation of New and Dynamic Mechanism for credit enhancement and risk mitigation in solar sector. Citing the first Financial Partnership collaboration of ISA with the World Bank, Shri Jaitley urged that more and more multilateral and development banks should come forward and join hands with ISA in help fulfilling the objectives of massive and affordable deployment of solar among 121 ISA member countries.

Earlier, Shri Upendra Tripathy, the Interim Director General ISA informed that the ISA and EBRD have agreed to strengthen cooperation in pursuit of their shared goals of mobilising green energy financing. The collaboration will provide an opportunity to EBRD to support solar energy investment in the least developed countries especially in Africa. This will also help funding of solar projects both in African and other countries. He also stated that more such financial partnership deals shall be signed by the ISA in near future to achieve its mandate in a proper and effective manner.

Speaking on the occasion, Sir Suma Chakrabarti, EBRD President stated that this is a very important agreement for the EBRD, which has always been eager to share its expertise with new partners and also to learn from them. He said that with the ISA, we share the vision of sustainable development and of green energy, which ultimately benefits the global economy.

ISA is working for deployment of over 1000 GW of solar energy and mobilising more than US$ 1000 billion into solar energy by the year 2030. Similarly the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is keenly interested to increase its green financing portfolio to 40% of its annual business. To this effect the EBRD launched Green Economy Transition Approach in 2015. Till date, the EBRD has invested more than €4 billion directly in renewable energy, supporting projects in over 20 countries and funding more than 6.5 GW of capacity.

The International Solar Alliance is an initiative jointly launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the President of France on 30th November 2015 at Paris, in the presence of the Secretary General of the UN, on the side lines of COP21 UN Climate Change Conference. The main objective of ISA is to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs of 121 countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics. So far 43 countries have signed the Framework Agreement of the ISA, and out of which 14 have also submitted the Instrument of ratification to the depository i.e. Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. ISA will be the first international inter-governmental treaty based organization to be headquartered in India.

In keeping with India’s commitment to implement the recommendations of 2015 Final Report on Action 13, titled “Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting”, identified under the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, section 286 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) was inserted vide Finance Act, 2016, providing for furnishing of a Country-by-Country report in respect of an international group by its constituent or parent entity. Section 92D of the Act was also amended vide Finance Act, 2016 to provide for keeping and maintaining of Master File by every constituent entity of an international group, which was to be furnished as per rules prescribed in this regard.

      

       Subsequent to the aforesaid amendments to the Act, comments and suggestions were invited on the proposal to insert rules 10DA, 10DB and form nos. 3CEBA to 3CEBE in the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (‘the Rules’), laying down the guidelines.

 

       After examining the recommendations of the Committee set up in this regard, and comments and suggestions received from stakeholders and general public, the Central Board of Direct Taxes has notified the rules for maintaining and furnishing of transfer pricing documentation in the Master File and Country-by-Country report.

 

       Since it is the first reporting year for furnishing of the Country-by-Country report, the due date for filing the Country-by-Country report for reportable accounting year 2016-17 has already been extended to 31st of March, 2018 vide Circular No. 26/2017 dated 25.10.2017. Similarly, the date of compliance for furnishing the Master File for FY 2016-17 has been extended to 31st of March, 2018 as a one-time relief measure.

 

       The salient features of the Country-By-Country Report and Master File rules are as under:

 

·          The threshold for the Country-By-Country Report is total consolidated group revenue of Rs. 5,500 crore or more.

·          The threshold for the Master File is consolidated group revenue exceeding Rs. 500 crore and either the aggregate value of international transactions as per the books of accounts exceeding Rs. 50 crore or aggregate value of international transactions in respect of intangible property exceeding Rs. 10 crore.

·          Report of Master File has to be submitted in Form 3CEAA and the Country-by-Country Report in Form 3CEAD.

·          An international group having multiple Indian constituent entities may designate one constituent entity to file the Master File.

·          Part A of Form 3CEAA is to be filled by every constituent entity of an international group regardless of whether it qualifies under the threshold for furnishing Master File. However, to reduce the compliance burden, such international group having multiple Indian constituent entities can designate one constituent entity to file Part A on its behalf.

·          Form 3CEAD for furnishing Country-by-Country Report follows OECD template.

 

       The notification is available on www.incometaxindia.gov.in.

In continuance of the several initiatives under taken by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) during the last few years to increase the pension coverage in the country, PFRDA has now increased the maximum age of joining under NPS-Private Sector (i.e. All Citizen and Corporate Model) from the existing 60 years to 65 years of age.

         Now, any Indian Citizen, resident or non-resident, between the age of 60- 65 years, can also join NPS and continue up to the age of 70 years in NPS. With this increase of joining age, the subscribers who are willing to join NPS at the later stage of life will be able to avail the benefits of NPS.

         NPS provides a very robust platform to the subscriber to save for his/her old age income security. Due to the better healthcare facilities and increased fitness, along with the opportunities and avenues available in the private sector as well as in the capacity of self-employment, more and more people in their late 50s or 60s are now living an active life allowing them to be employed productively.

         The subscriber joining NPS beyond the age of 60 years will have the same choice of the Pension Fund as well as the investment choice as is available under the NPS for subscribers joining NPS before the age of 60 years.

         Subscriber joining NPS after the age of 60 years will have an option of normal exit from NPS after completion of 3 years in NPS. In this case, the subscriber will be required to utilize at least 40% of the corpus for purchase of annuity and the remaining amount can be withdrawn in lump-sum.

         In case of such subscriber willing to exit from NPS before completion of 3 years in the NPS, he/she will be allowed to do so, but in such case, the subscriber will have to utilize at-least 80% of the corpus for purchase of annuity and the remaining can be withdrawn in lumpsum.

         In case of unfortunate death of the subscriber during his stay in NPS, the entire corpus will be paid to the nominee of the subscriber.

         The increase in joining age will provide the options to the subscribers who are at the fag-end of the employment and expecting lump-sum amount at the time of retirement, but willing to defer their retirement planning for future, to open the NPS account and contribute the lump-sum corpus to NPS for better fund management by Professional Fund Manager to fetch better returns and plan for the regular income after some time. The Annuity rates available in the older age fetch better annuities than that at the age of 60 or less age.

This initiative will allow a larger segment of the society particularly senior citizens to reap the benefits of NPS and plan for their regular income.

                World Food India 2017 achieved a resounding success with delegates from over 60 countries and Global CEOs congregating in New Delhi for the three day Conference cum exhibition. The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind graced the event at its Valedictory session and congratulated the Union Minister of Food processing Industries Smt Harsimrat kaur Badal, ably supported by MoS Sadhavi Niranjan Jyoti for putting together the mega event.

Addressing the gathering, President Shri Kovind said “World Food India 2017 has helped showcase the vast and near limitless opportunities in the food industry and in food processing in India.” The President termed WFI “the Kumbh Mela of Indian food.” He noted that the diversity of Indian cuisine literally renders one human lifetime not enough to experience the range and richness of Indian food! The President however pointed out that Food is not just culture, it is also commerce. He said “India’s food consumption is currently valued at US $370 billion. It is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2025, in less than a decade. There are opportunities across the entire food value chain in India – including post-harvest facilities, logistics, cold chains, and manufacturing. It is a sector with a large business appetite and the food industry can be a huge employer.”

The President cautioned that the regrettable wastage has to be curtailed. “A focused emphasis on modern food processing can change things. It gives the food sector the potential to become the intersection of so many of our flagship programmes – Make in India, Start-up India, Skill India, Digital India, and the resolve to double farm incomes” Shri Kovind added.

The President noted that the food story in India has world-wide implications. “On a global scale, the market for Indian food products is massive. It extends from 1.8 billion people in South Asia to a 30 million strong diaspora population, and to millions more in all parts of the world” he elaborated. On the occasion, the President gave away Start-up Awards and Hackathon Awards to college students  who helped suggest ways of detecting food adulteration. Shri Kovind said “There is an increasing stress on food safety, accurate labelling, intellectual property issues and innovation in the food processing sector – as well as on using technology as an enabler”.

 Recapitulating the action packed three day Mega Food event, the host Union Minister Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that inspired by the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, her Ministry sees World Food India 2017 as a beginnimg and not end of an event.  She said at the World Food India 2017 not only has a Guinness book record been established for cooking 918kg of ubiquitous comfort, wellness food – the nutritious Khichadi; business worth $11.25b with 50 MoUs has been transacted during the three days.

Smt Badal said MoFPI’s resolve is only strengthened to help India be established as the World Food Factory. Smt Badal said that during WFI, States including Punjab and Haryana also have negotiated MOUs worth $2.5b. “Ministry of Food Processing Industries will forge ahead to work expeditiously on implementing these MOUs. A special cell has been setup in Invest India to follow up on these negotiations and the Knowledge Partners would help achieve the goals” she informed. Smt Badal said her Ministry is guided by the principles of  - ensure steps to reduce wastage, produce more and process more. Farm to Fork is their mantra and Food Processing Industries have to be the bridge between Farmers and Consumers. The Minister informed that while States of Maharashtra and Telangana have announced their Food Processing Policy, the MoFPI would soon finalize the National Food Processing Policy.

 To mark the historic World Food Convention hosted for the first time by India, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched - Nivesh Bandhu – ( http://foodprocessingindia.co.in/)

the unique portal or ""investor's friend"". The portal will help bring together information on central and state government policies, and incentives provided for the food-processing sector. The portal maps resources upto the local level, with processing requirements. It is also a platform for business networking, for farmers, processors, traders, and logistics operators. Seven publications of Ministry of Food Processing Industries which will help investors in Food Processing Sector in making informed decisions have been included in the portal. The Prime Minister also released a Coffee table book and commemorative stamp on Indian Cuisines.

 The Prime Minister highlighted India’s diverse strengths in agriculture. He said “The second largest arable land area, and as many as 127 diverse agro-climatic zones, give us global leadership in a number of crops like bananas, mangoes, guavas, papayas, and okra. We are second, globally, in terms of production of rice, wheat, fish, fruits and vegetables. India is also the world's biggest milk producer. Our horticulture sector has shown an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent annually over the last ten years.”

Shri Modi recounted that for centuries, India has welcomed traders from distant lands, who came in search of our distinctive spices. He pointed out “Food processing is a way of life in India. It has been practiced for ages, even in the humblest of households. Simple, home-based techniques, such as fermentation, have resulted in the creation of our famous pickles, papads, chutneys and murabbas that now excite both the elite and the masses, across the world.”

Showcasing the big picture, PM said India is today one of the fastest growing economies of the world. The Goods and Services Tax has eliminated the multiplicity of taxes. India has jumped thirty ranks this year, in the World Bank Doing Business rankings - the highest ever improvement for India, and the highest jump for any country this year. India was ranked number one in the world in 2016 in greenfield investment. India is also rapidly progressing on the Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index. He emphasised that starting a new business in India is now easier than ever before. Procedures for obtaining clearances from various agencies have been simplified. Archaic laws have been repealed, and the burden of compliances has been reduced.

PM noted that Private sector participation has been increasing in many segments of the value chain. However, more investment is required in contract farming, raw material sourcing and creating agri linkages. Many international companies in India have taken a lead in contract farming initiatives. Shri Modi pointed out that there exists a clear opportunity for global super-market chains considering India as a major outsourcing hub.

PM added that “The combination of traditional Indian food, with modern technology, processing and packaging, can help the world rediscover the health benefits, and refreshing taste of Indian food ingredients such as turmeric, ginger, and tulsi, to name just a few. The perfect blend of hygienic, nutritious and tasty processed food, with the added benefits of preventive healthcare, can be produced economically in India.”

            After the inaugural, the Prime Minister visited the exhibition area - the specially curated Food Street by Chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Food Street is a lively vibrant zone to showcase Indian and foreign cuisines using Indian ingredients, flavours and fragrances. An exhibition spread over 40,000 sq mtrs in lawns of India Gate has been mounted where more than 800 global companies representing 22 Countries & domestic companies are exhibiting their stregths in Food Processing sector. Ministry of Food Processing Industries’ Theme Pavilion provides an overview of India’s offering to the world in terms of products, geo mapping of produce availability and mega food parks.

Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal noted that today is a historic day where 1st Mega Food Event is launched in India. World Food India brings together 7000 stakeholders from 60 countries, 75 International & National policy makers and Heads of State, 60 Global CEOs and 100 Indian CEOs; 5000 B2B meetings over the course of three days. Smt Badal said that her Ministry of Food Processing Industries is committed to help and handhold companies to help farmers double their income and transform India’s farm economy. She elaborated that the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana,  has been recently launched to create world-class food processing infrastructure to leverage investment of five billion US dollars, to benefit two million farmers and generate more than half a million jobs over the next three years. Creation of Mega Food Parks is a key component of this scheme. These food parks will help link agro-processing clusters with key production centres. Nine such parks are already operational, and more than thirty others are in the process of coming up across the country.

 The participating Global CEOs congratulated the Prime Minister for undertaking significant structural reforms like GST and the impressive improvement recorded by India in the Ease of Doing Business rankings. Germany, Japan and Denmark are Partner Countries to World Food India whereas Italy & Netherlands are Focus Countries. They were represented by H.E Mr Kenji Hiramatsu, Ambassador of Japan to India; H.E Mr Peter Taksøe-Jensen, Ambassador of Denmark to India; H.E Mr Alphonsus Stoelinga, Ambassador of Netherlands to India; H.E. Lorenzo Angeloni, Ambassador of Italy to India who expressed keenness to deepen their investment commitment to India, to enable mutual exchange of best practices, technology and to be a part of the revolution in the food processing industry which will take place in India.

In a specially organised session showcasing India as the preferred Investment  Destination for the food processing sector, the Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Shri Arun Jaitley spelt out the transformational initiatives undertaken by the Government of India in the last three years. “Food Processing is a priority sector’’ said Shri Jaitley where 100% FDI, is now permitted, for trading, including through e-commerce, of food products manufactured or produced in India. Exclusive separate CEOs roundtables were also held during the day with Prime Minister and Finance Minister.

                India has reduced its new malaria cases by one third, and even crossed the malaria mortality targets of 2020. This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the High Level Roundtable on “Accelerating the Elimination of Malaria in the South-East Asia Region”, here today. Shri J P Nadda further said that with nearly ¾ of the share of the regional burden, India’s successes have significantly contributed to the reduction of the burden of malaria for the entire South-East Asia region. 

Health Ministers from the countries of South Asia Region, Heads of Country Delegations, Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region and Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, WHO, Deputy Director General Designate also graced the occasion. 

Speaking at the occasion, Shri Nadda said this success comes against the backdrop of the political leadership and support that health programs have received in India. “The commitment to ensure health for every person in India comes from the highest office of the Government. It is Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji’s vision to see health and development reach to the furthest corners of our country, and use the very latest innovations in technology and implementation science to achieve these outcomes,” the Union Health Minister elaborated. 

Shri Nadda stated that that the majority of malaria cases in the country come from the bordering districts, forest and tribal areas, while most of the remaining parts of the country remain malaria free. “Addressing malaria therefore, is not only an issue for India’s aspiration of achieving universal health coverage, but also achieve it with equity, Shri Nadda added

Reiterating the commitment to eliminate Malaria, Shri Nadda stated that the focus on the bordering districts and empowering local authorities with information, tools and knowledge will help malaria reductions in India and its neighbors. The Union Health Minister further said that India as a hub for research and science would also support malaria implementation research, as well as capacity building in health research. 

At the function, Shri J P Nadda also launched the book “Addressing the challenge of controlling malaria across international border lines” and unveiled the Regional Action Plan (2017-2030). 

The three-day ministerial roundtable on accelerating elimination of malaria in the South-East Asia region is in consonance with the United Nations Assembly Resolution on consolidation and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria. 

Also present ate the event were Asia Pacific Leaders Alliance against Malaria, representatives from the Asian Development Bank, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, members of the Strategy Advisory Group for Malaria Elimination and various development partners.

                Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) and Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary, DHR and DG, ICMR, launched the India Hypertension Management Initiative (IHMI) at a function, here today. The IHMI aims to reduce disability and death related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in India, by improving the control of high blood pressure (hypertension), reducing salt consumption and eliminating artificial trans-fats, leading risk factors for CVD. 

Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), underlined the various aspects of the non-communicable diseases like prevention, detection and management. She stated that creating awareness about NCDs is vital as it is a silent disease. The Health Secretary further said that there is urgent need to raise awareness about NCDs amongst families regarding packaged food and processed foods with excessive salt and trans-fat. She also highlighted the need for incorporating yoga in one’s life for prevention and management of hypertension. 

Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary, DHR and DG, ICMR highlighted the importance of initiating and managing treatment for hypertension. She emphasized on the need for public education programme on nutrition and training of frontline healthcare workers regarding management of hypertension. She stated that the risk factors have to be managed at a very young age and we need to look into behavioral issues related to food intake, especially salt. 

Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO India Representative, highlighted the importance of awareness and detection of hypertension. He congratulated the Health Ministry and ICMR for this initiative and said that this programme will help with the management of hypertension in the country. 

The India Hypertension Management Initiative (IHMI) is a collaborative project of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), State Governments, World Health Organization (WHO), and Resolve to Save Lives initiative of Vital Strategies. The primary goal of this project is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to CVDs, the leading cause of death in India, by improving the control of high blood pressure, which is a leading risk factor for CVDs among adults in India. 

The IHMI is focused on five essential components of scalable treatment of hypertension. It will support the adoption of standardized simplified treatment plans for managing high blood pressure, ensure the regular and uninterrupted supply of quality-assured medications, task sharing so health workers who are accessible to patients can distribute medications already prescribed by the medical officer, and patient-centered services that reduce the barriers to treatment adherence. Data on hypertension will be improved through streamlined monitoring systems, and the lessons learned and practice-based evidence will inform further interventions to improve cardiovascular care. IHMI will be progressively rolled out in 25 districts in the first two years across districts selected by the Health Ministry for expansion of active screening and intensification of treatment activities for hypertension. 

Around 200 million adults in India have high blood pressure, yet control rates for the condition remain low. Studies suggest that in rural areas in India, only one quarter of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, and only around 10 percent have their blood pressure controlled. In urban areas, around 40 percent of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, and only around 20 percent have their blood pressure controlled. This initiative aims to strengthen the cardiovascular disease component of the Health Ministry’s National Program for Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). It will focus on strengthening hypertension management and monitoring at the primary health care level, within the existing healthcare system, and is aligned with WHO’s Global HEARTS Initiative and National Guidelines. 

Also present at the event were Shri Manoj Jhalani (AS&MD, NHM), Dr BD Athani (Special DGHS) and Shri Pawan Aggarwal, CEO, FSSAI and Dr Alka Aggarwal Singh, Country Director, Vital Strategies along with the other senior officers of the Ministry and representatives of international development organizations.

                “When seen from the perspective of reason and rationale, the gift of life is the ultimate gift that one could give and organ donation is, therefore, a ‘God like act’ and needs to be encouraged.” This was stated by Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State (HFW) on the occasion of ‘8th Indian Organ Donation Day’, organised by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO), here today. Urging all to come forward and donate their organs, Smt. Anupriya Patel said that apart from promoting organ donation, it is important to improve infrastructure and capacity of Government Hospitals for undertaking transplantation so that even those who cannot afford transplantation may also benefit. Smt. Anupriya Patel also administered the pledge to the participants to donate organs. Dr. C. Vijaya Baskar, Minister of Health, Government of Tamil Nadu was also present at the function. 

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel stated that it is important to understand that in India it is mainly the living donors who are donating organs and only about 23% of the organ transplant is being done with organs obtained from the cadavers. “There is a need to promote cadaver or deceased organ donation rather than relying on living donors in order to avoid the risk of commercial trading of organs and also to avoid the inherent risk to the health of the living donor, Smt Anupriya Patel added. 

Dr. C. Vijaya Baskar, Minister of Health, Government of Tamil Nadu, expressed happiness at the announcement of Tamil Nadu being adjudged the Best State in Organ Donation for the third time in a row. He highlighted the exemplary work that Tamil Nadu had done by retrieving 5933 organs from 1056 donors; and had been the first state in India for various initiatives like mandatory certification of Brain Stem Death, streamlining organ distribution and setting up green corridors. He informed the participants that Tamil Nadu is also supplying free immunosuppressant drugs and is providing sanctions of upto Rs. 35 Lakh under the Chief Minister Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme for facilitating organ transplants in the private sector. 

Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), applauded Shri K. K. Sharma, Director General, BSF, for his efforts towards motivating 70,000 personnel to pledge their organs, and also congratulated the state of Tamil Nadu for leading the nation in the field of organ donation. She urged the religious leaders and youth to take forward the movement of organ donation and highlighted the importance of ownership at the highest level, and connectivity at the lowest level to build up a successful and transparent organ donation program in the country. She not only pledged her organs, but also reaffirmed her commitment towards the cause. 

At the event, Smt. Anupriya Patel felicitated Shri K.K. Sharma, DG, BSF, and the families of deceased organ donors from various parts of the country. The best performing states of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Telangana also received awards whereas JIPMER, Puducherry was announced as the Best Budding performer in Organ Donation and Transplantation. Yashoda Hospital, Telangana, PGI, Chandigarh and Sahidri Speciality Hospital, Pune were declared as the top three Best Hospitals in the country for their contribution. Transplant co-ordinators, Dr. Patricia Namitha Maria Viego, Karnataka; Dr. P. Periyanayagam, TN; Ms. Sangeeta Sherawat from Safdarjung Hospital and Mr Balram from AIIMS bagged the prizes for best transplant co-ordinators. Non-government organisations like the Mohan Foundation, Organ India, NSS, and Kidney Foundation of India were also felicitated for their efforts. 

Also present at the event were Dr. Jagdish Prasad, Director General Health Services, Dr. R.K. Vats, Addl. Secretary, Health Dr Sudhir Kumar, Joint Secretary, MoHFW, Shri K. K. Sharma, Director General BSF, Dr. Vimal Bhandari, Director, NOTTO and senior officers from BSF, CRPF and the students and representatives of various development organizations.

He further said that the dialogue on role of competition in competitive pricing and discussion on related WTO agreements influencing health should lead to a larger umbrella of suggested policy options for the government. 

Shri Nadda stated that the 2015 National Medical Device Policy will enable local manufacture in the multiproduct, multidisciplinary industry. “In India, nearly 150 thousand orthopaedic knee procedures are done every day. More investments and more players in the medical devices sector will lead to lowering down of prices and access to medical products as most of the governments are sensitive to access and pricing of medical products,” he added. 

Addressing the conference via video link, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State (HFW) said that research and development in public health should focus on two main aspects. To enable safe, effective and quality medical products for the diseases and rolling out the innovations and inventions along with the learning’s from the field to the people. He further stated that the research and development should focus on making the cost of medical devices/products affordable to the people and highlighted the issue of Anti-microbial Resistance (AMR). 

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State (HFW), stated that India is committed to attainment of the highest possible standards of health for its citizens. She further said that at the national level, access to medical products (medicines, vaccines, medical devices & diagnostics) is an important facet in the health system as a whole and at the international level, access to medical products is a critical factor for the success of the 2030 sustainable development goals agenda that aims to ensure healthy lives and to promote well-being of people of all ages. 

Dr. V.K. Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Govt. of India stated that there is a need for investment in medical products for preventive therapy and treatment and highlighted the importance of affordability, quality, domestic production capacity and to create an eco-system of policy and innovation for greater accessibility of affordable medical drugs and devices. Dr V K Paul further said that technology is an integral block for strengthening medical systems in any country and must also ensure timely maintenance of medical equipment by suppliers in remote and rural areas such that equipment functions effectively. 

Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) spoke about the issues of access of medicines and medical products. She said that safe medical products should be available at affordable prices. She further reiterated that the Health Ministry is committed to robust regulatory systems for ensuring safety, quality and efficacy of drugs. 

Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary (DHR) and DG, ICMR highlighted issues such as how to use TRIPs flexibilities; alternative models for affordable medicines and devices such as voluntary licensing; clear predictable regulatory pathways; more investment in R&D and publicly funded R&D; innovative healthcare service delivery models; anti-biotic stewardship; and collaboration between the public and private sectors including academia to reduce cost of production and delivery. 

The Conference is being organized by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare with the support of WHO Country Office for India and in partnership with Indian Society of International Law. The objective of the Conference is to exchange knowledge and expand understanding on contemporary issues in international trade laws and research and innovation for access to medical products to achieve SDG 2030 agenda. 

Also present at the event were, Dr. R.K. Vats, Addl. Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Dr. Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India; and Dr. EMS Natchiappan, President, Indian Society of International Law, India along with other senior officers of the Ministry, delegates from various countries and representatives of development organisations.

                The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has recently announced the launch of daily regimen for TB patients across the country under The Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP). The Health Ministry has been providing the thrice weekly regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), however it has now decided to change the treatment strategy for TB patients from thrice weekly to daily drug regimen using fixed dose combinations (FDC) for treatment. This change will bring transformation in the approach and the intensity to deal with this disease which accounts for about 4.2 lakh deaths every year.

The daily FDC anti-TB drugs will be made available to private pharmacy or at private practitioners to dispense to TB patients who seek care in private sector, depending upon the convenience of patient and practitioner free of cost. The Health Ministry will take this forward with all major hospitals, IMA, IAP and other professional medical associations to expand the access to daily FDC to all TB patients.

The salient features of this treatment strategy are use of Ethambutol in continuation phase for all patients, drugs to be given daily (as against only 3 times weekly previously), fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets to be used which will reduce pill burden (as against separate 7 tablets previously), for children, child friendly formulations as dispersible tablets and use of Information Technology (IT) enabled treatment adherence support system.

Current WHO Global TB Report, 2017 has reported that incidence of TB has reduced from 28.2 lakh to 27 lakh and mortality by 60 thousand over the last one year, which is a testimony of anti TB drive by Government of India.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare organized a one-day national workshop on the promotion of male participation in family planning, here today. Smt. Vandana Gurnani, Jt. Secretary inaugurated the workshop, which highlighted concrete strategies to understand and incorporate the male perspective and male needs in the same way as attention is given to women's perspectives and needs. The Health Ministry through its sustained family planning efforts, aims to increase male participation in family planning, with continued emphasis on delivering assured services, generating demand and bridging supply gaps. 

The workshop also saw the launch of the Family Planning Logistics Management Information System (FP-LMIS) manual. The FP-LMIS software was developed to facilitate the management and distribution of contraceptives and is designed to provide robust information on the demand and distribution of contraceptives to health facilities and ASHAs and strengthen supply chain management. It is intended to be a decision-making tool for policy makers, program managers and logistics personnel to monitor and manage the flow of contraceptive supplies, in order to reduce stockouts and overstocks, and improve the program’s effectiveness and contraceptive security. 

Male participation in improving the reproductive health of couples is crucial. While the permanent methods of contraception have traditionally found more acceptance in India, the maximum number of acceptors are women. The World Vasectomy Day is an event intended to raise global awareness on Vasectomy. The National Workshop today is also a precursor and curtain raiser to the upcoming Vasectomy Fortnight across States. All states/UTs across India will observe a dedicated ‘Vasectomy Fortnight’ from 21st November to 4th December 2017 with commensurate publicity whereby quality male sterilization services would be provided to clients at public health facilities. 

The observation of a dedicated fortnight is intended to galvanize awareness on male sterilization and thereby improve its acceptance in the community. The Vasectomy Fortnight will be observed up to the block level with focus on Family Planning service delivery along with IEC & advocacy.

The theme of the workshop and the ‘Vasectomy Fortnight 2017’ is:



“Zimmedar Purush ki yehi hai Pehchan, Parivar Niyojan mein jo de Yogdaan” 

The observation of the Vasectomy Fortnight 2017 will be conducted in two phases:

1.                Mobilization phase (21st Nov – 27th Nov) - This fortnight is utilised for awareness generation on the benefits of male contraception. IEC, especially on male participation in Family Planning and addressing various myths associated with it, will be available across public and accredited health care facilities. 

2.    Service delivery phase (28th Nov – 4th Dec) - In addition to awareness generation, all districts and blocks will organise for provision of male sterilization services in this dedicated fortnight. 

Male participation in adoption of family planning has been a challenge along with other numerous challenges that must still be overcome, particularly in terms of raising public awareness around promoting and male engagement in family planning services. The promotion of male participation is vital to the success of the Family Planning programme. The theme of the workshop was in alignment with the theme of the Vasectomy Fortnight and discussions during the workshop revolved around a variety of topics such as:

·         Concerted efforts to promote male involvement in Family Planning

·         Bolstering young men’s engagement in adopting reproductive decisions

·         Bridging the gender gap

·         Addressing the sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents

The eminent speakers at the workshop also included the pioneers of NSV in India who addressed the gathering on the global scenario and the role of technical agencies in promoting male participation. The state representatives highlighted the respective strategies for improving the uptake and arresting the decline of vasectomy services.

                The Hon’ble Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today released the findings of ‘India State Level Disease Burden’ report of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in presence of Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary (DHR) and DG (ICMR) and Dr. Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Govt. of India.

Addressing the participants, the Vice President of India stated that achieving good health for all of India’s population is an important goal of the Government of India and a foundation for further social and economic development. The Vice President further stated that the health status of Indians has been improving since Independence. “The life expectancy of a person born in India in 1960 was 40 years, which has increased to about 70 years now. Of every 1000 live children born in India in 1960, about 160 died in the first year, but now this death rate of infants is about a fourth of that level,” he added.

In his address, the Vice President cautioned that in order to do better, several things need to happen. These include higher priority for health in the country’s policy making and enhanced resources for preventive and public health measures. “There should be adequate mechanisms at the ground level for keeping Indians healthy and for suitable healthcare when they fall sick. We should also have a solid knowledge system that enables comprehensive tracking of the health and disease burden trends in every part of the country,” the Vice President elaborated.

Speaking at the function, Shri J P Nadda stated that the Health Ministry along with the state governments and other important partners in the country is making serious efforts to enunciate provision for health services that are suitable for the health situation of particular state, mainly through the public sector. “In this regard, the data and results shared by the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative today in its report, scientific paper, and the online visualization tool will serve as a useful guide for fine-tuning data driven health planning specific for health situation of each state of the country,” Shri Nadda said.

Shri Nadda further informed that the estimates released today, which are based on utilization of all available epidemiological data, show that the per person burden due to major infectious disease, that is, diarrheal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and tuberculosis is 7 to 9 times higher in the states like Bihar, Odisha, U.P, Assam, Rajasthan, M.P. and Jharkhand than in other states. “ Likewise, the burden due to the leading non-communicable diseases, that is, ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease is 4-9 times higher in some states than in other states,” Shri Nadda said.

Shri Nadda further said that the disease profile of each state released today showing the contribution of specific diseases and risk factors to the overall health loss can be a useful guide for states when they develop their Project Implementation Plans for health. The open-access visualization tool that is being released today shows disease and risk trends in each state 1990 to 2016 in a simple manner, which can be of much use for policy makers. I hope that the planners and experts in each state will use the findings released today and engage with the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative to further improve health in their respective states, Shri Nadda added.

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel, MoS (HFW) said that the data and results shared by the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative today in its report, scientific paper, and the online visualization tool will serve as a useful guide for fine-tuning health planning in each state of the country. “The burden due to non-communicable disease and injuries has overtaken the burden due to infectious and maternal-child diseases in every state of India, though this happened in some states about three decades ago and in some other states more recently. This means that the more developed states that had this transition a long time ago need to go on a war footing to control the rapidly rising burden of major non-communicable diseases and injuries, Smt Anupriya Patel stated.

The India State-level Disease Burden Initiative, a joint initiative between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India along with experts and stakeholders associated with over 100 Indian institutions, released the first comprehensive set of state-level disease burden, risk factors estimates and trends for each state in India to inform health planning to reduce health inequalities amongst states in India. These estimates are based on analysis of all identifiable epidemiological data from India over quarter of a century.

Also present at the function were Dr. Srinath Reddy, President, PHFI, Shri JVR Prasada Rao, Former Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India, Dr. Chris Murray, Director, Institute of Health Metrics & Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, USA along with other senior officers of the Ministry and representatives of development partners.

                The India Expert Advisory Group on Measles & Rubella (IEAG-MR) has commended India on the progress of the measles and rubella vaccination campaign, as it reviewed the existing strategies and efforts towards measles elimination and control of rubella during the past two days with Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The expert member group concluded that ‘the country is on the right track’. The experts commended the strong leadership of the Government of India, as well as the ownership of the state governments to ensure that every child is vaccinated against these two diseases. 

The expert group consisting of national and international experts complimented India on the growing trend in MCV (measles containing vaccine) coverage, and the significant reduction in MCV-1st dose and MCV-2nd dose dropout rate which declined from 44% to 13%. There has also been a reduction of DPT booster dose and MCV2 missed opportunities from 43% to 7% . The group has advised for the MR vaccination campaign to cover the whole country by 2018. Presentably 13 states have been covered by the vaccination campaign. The most recent campaigns in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were reviewed in detail, and the experts complimented both states for excellent performance and their innovations to achieve very high coverage. The Group has recommended to strengthen the surveillance for MR and to expand the MR laboratory network. 

Secretary (Health) Smt. Preeti Sudan stated that ‘The country is fully committed to achieving the goal of measles elimination and rubella control to protect its children from these diseases’. She commended the state governments along with partners who have supported these efforts. She also credited the concerted IEC and awareness campaign to address the barriers to the vaccination; and the appropriate programmatic and strategic modifications based on learnings during the different phases of the campaign for the success. 

Dr. Robert Kezaala from UNICEF stated that “UNICEF salutes the Government of India in tackling such a major threat to children’s lives and wellbeing - through a combination of campaigns and the operation Indradanush. UNICEF as a children’s agency commits to walk the extra mile with the Government of India.” Applauding India’s efforts, WHO HQ representative Dr. Katrina Kretsinger said that “India has shown tremendous leadership on advancing measles elimination and rubella control. It sets an important example globally, demonstrating best practices.” 

Two doses of Measles vaccine fully protect children against measles infection. In the past while the 1st dose coverage was close to 90%, the 2nd dose lagged behind by 45%. Commending the Government efforts, Dr. Jacob John, the co-Chairman of the IEAG, says that both the MR campaigns and IMI are dramatically reducing this gap. 

Dr. Jim Goodson from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta said that “the Government of India has a smart plan that capitalizes on previous investments for polio eradication by re-tooling existing information systems and resources for measles elimination. Measles surveillance data should continue to be used to identify any areas with children missed by vaccination, thereby contributing to measles elimination efforts in India.” 

Measles kills an estimated 49,000 children in India each year, which is about 37% of the global deaths due to this disease. India has set an ambitious goal to eliminate measles from the country. Measles Rubella vaccine has been introduced in 13 states. It is planned to expand across the country, covering 41 crore children by the end of 2018.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the Wage Policy for the 8th Round of Wage Negotiations for workmen in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).

Highlights:

    i.     Management of the CPSEs would be free to negotiate wage revision for workmen where the periodicity of wage settlement of five years or ten years has expired generally on 31.12.2016 keeping in view the affordability and financial sustainability of such wage revision for the CPSEs concerned.

   ii.    No budgetary support for any wage increase shall be provided by the Government. The entire financial implication would be borne by the respective CPSEs from their internal resources.

   iii.     In those CPSEs for which the Government has approved restructuring/  revival plan, the wage revision will be done as per the provisions of the approved restructuring / revival plan only.

   iv.    The management of the concerned CPSEs have to ensure that negotiated scales of pay do not exceed the existing scales of pay of executives/officers and non-unionized supervisors of respective CPSEs.

   v.    The Management of CPSEs where the five year periodicity is followed have to ensure that negotiated scales of pay for two successive wages negotiations do not exceed the existing scales of pay of executives/officers and non-unionized supervisors of respective CPSEs for whom ten years periodicity is being followed.

 vi.   To avoid conflict of pay scales of executives/non-unionised supervisors with that of their workmen, CPSEs may consider adoption of graded DA neutralization and/or graded fitment during the wage negotiations.

 

 vii.   CPSEs must ensure that any increase in wages after negotiations does not result in increase in administered prices of their goods and services.

viii.    The wage revision shall be subject to the condition that there shall be no increase in labour cost per physical unit of output. In exceptional cases where CPSEs are already working at optimum capacity, the administrative Ministry / Department may consult DPE considering industry norms.

 ix.   The validity period of wage settlement would be for a minimum period of five years for those who opted for a five year periodicity and for a maximum period of ten years for those who have opted for a ten year periodicity of wage negotiation w.e.f. 01.01.2017.

 x.   The CPSEs would implement negotiated wages after confirming with their Administrative Ministry/Department that the wage settlement is in conformity with approved parameters.

Background:

There are about 12.34 lakh employees in 320 CPSEs in the country. Out of these, about 2.99 lakh employees are Board level and below Board level executives and non-unionized Supervisors. The remaining about 9.35 lakh employees belong to the unionized workmen category. Wage revision in respect of unionized workmen is decided by trade unions and managements of CPSEs in terms of guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) for wage negotiations.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh will be leaving tomorrow on a three-day visit to Russia from 27th-29th November, 2017. 

During his visit, the Union Home Minister will hold discussions with Mr. Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Minister for Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and other senior Russian leadership. The discussions would cover the entire gamut of bilateral, regional and international matters of mutual interest. 

Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh is likely to sign an Agreement on Cooperation between Ministry of Home Affairs, India and Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation. He will also sign a Joint Action Plan between the Narcotics Control Bureau, MHA and Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation. The signing of a comprehensive security agreement on cooperation in combating terrorism and organized crime with the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation would reinforce the relationship between India and Russia through exchange and sharing of information, expertise, best practices and would help in curbing terrorism and enhancing security in the region. 

Shri Rajnath Singh will also hold meetings with Mr Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary, Security Council of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Puchkov, Minister of Civil Defence, Emergency Situations and Disaster Relief of the Russian Federation and Mr. Alexander Bortnikov, Director, Federal Security Service of Russia. He will pay a visit to the National Crisis Management Centre (EMERCOM) under the Ministry of Situations. 

As both the countries have long history of close cooperation on matters of shared security concerns, this visit will provide an opportunity to further cement and strengthen the mutually beneficial bilateral ties between both the countries.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh chaired the 12th meeting of the Standing Committee of Inter-State Council (ISC), here today. 

Addressing the meeting, Shri Rajnath Singh said that a number of steps have been taken in recent years by the Central Government to promote cooperative federalism. He said that the meeting of the Inter State Council, which was held in July, 2016, happened after a gap of 10 years. Subsequent to that, meetings of the Standing Committee of the Inter-State Council are being periodically convened to lend speed and purpose to the process of harmonizing Center State relations, he said. He expressed satisfaction over the fact that the meetings of the Zonal Councils have now become regular and periodical. He also said that our effort is to see that at least one meeting of all the Zonal Councils is convened annually. He mentioned that a number of important State-to-State and Centre-State issues that are raised at these meetings find resolution. In 2015 such 82 issues were resolved and 140 issues were resolved in 2016. 

Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction over the fact that the Inter State Council and the Standing Committee have been rejuvenated. He said that it is important for us to promote the spirit of cooperation with greater zest and zeal and expressed satisfaction over the deliberations held today in harmonious and congenial atmosphere for arriving at consensus on some complex issues that have been covered in the agenda notes. 

The Home Minister said that Volumes-I & II were discussed during the eleventh meeting of the Standing Committee in April this year and Volumes-VI and VII will be discussed during the next meeting of the Standing Committee. Shri Rajnath Singh said that the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Punchhi Commission’s report will then be placed before the Inter-State Council, headed by the Prime Minister. 

The subjects discussed at the meeting included : Matters related to financial transfers from the Centre to the States; Goods and Services Tax; Structure and devolution of functions to local bodies; District Planning; Special provisions for Fifth and Sixth Scheduled Areas; Maintenance of communal harmony; Deployment of Central Forces; Migration issues; Police reforms; Criminal justice system and other internal security issues. The Standing Committee at its meeting considered 118 recommendations contained in Volumes-III, IV and V and finalised its recommendations. 

The Punchhi Commission was set up by the Government under the chairmanship of Justice (Retd.) Madan Mohan Punchhi, former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of India in 2005. The Punchhi Commission submitted its report in 2010 containing 273 recommendations in 7 volumes. The 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of ISC was held on 9th April this year after a gap of 11 years and 69 recommendations of the Punchhi Commission relating to the Constitutional provisions on various subjects such as the role of Governors, the Inter-State Council, assent to bills passed by Legislative Assemblies etc. were discussed. The convening of the Standing Committee meetings twice in the same year reflects the importance attached to the promotion of harmonious Centre-State relations. 

The meeting of the Committee was attended by the Union Ministers of Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley; Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the Chief Minister (CM) of Chhattisgarh Dr Raman Singh, CM Odisha Shri Naveen Patnaik, CM Rajasthan Smt Vasundhara Raje Scindia and CM Tripura Shri Manik Sarkar as members. Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for law and Justice, Shri Hardeep S Puri, Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development were present as special invitees.

                The National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH) is observing the Communal Harmony Campaign and Fund Raising Week from November 19-25, 2017 and the Flag Day was celebrated today with enthusiasm and fervour. Publicity material like Flag stickers, wrappers, posters, brochures, pamphlets etc. were dispatched to about 1.24 Lakh units for appropriately marking of this significant occasion all over the country during this year including all States / UTs and covering all Ministries / Departments, Central Public Sector Undertakings, Paramilitary organizations, Universities, educational institutions, Nationalized Banks, etc. Out of these 1.03 Lakh units were educational institutions.

 

In response to the appeal made by the NFCH, programmes are being organized by different stakeholders including educational institutions, public sector enterprises, Government Departments/ agencies, NGOs and voluntary organizations, etc. during the Week to promote the ethos of Communal Harmony and National Integration. The Week’s last working day, today, is being observed as the Flag Day throughout the country. This occasion is also utilized to generate financial support for destitute children affected by communal, caste, ethnic or terrorist violence.

 

Six children, two each from the States of Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir and one each from Assam and Uttar Pradesh were invited by the Foundation along with their mothers/guardians and escorts (State Government representatives) to participate in the Communal Harmony Campaign Week & Flag Day celebrations. These children viz. Amrooz Shabir and Sawan Kumar from Jammu & Kashmir; Gopalbhai Vakhatsinh Parmar and Km. Azim Bibi Chiniwala from Gujarat; Km.

These children were taken to local sight-seeing in Delhi and nearby places of historical, religious and cultural importance i.e. Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, India Gate, Qutub Minar, Rajghat, Lal Quila, Nizamuddin Dargah and Rail Museum during their weeklong stay in the national capital. They were very excited to see these places and enthused to intermingle with their fellow friends coming from different states for this celebration.

The Foundation also organized an Inter School competition on Hindi Declamation on the topic: “सांप्रदायिक सदभाव : राष्ट्र की आवश्यकता” to observe the Communal Harmony Campaign Week & Flag Day 2017 amongst children of different schools in Delhi on November 22, 2017. Students from 18 different schools participated in the programme. This event provided a platform for interaction between students of various communities. Winners were felicitated with Awards and Certificates by the Foundation.

 

The programme was presided over by Shri Syed Ghayorul Hasan Rizvi, Chairman, National Commission for Minorities. Shri Awadh Kumar Singh, Secretary, NFCH; Shri Paramjeet Singh Chandhok, Member, Governing Council, NFCH; Dr M D Thomas, Founder Director, Institute of Harmony and Peace Studies and Smt Naaz Rizvi of the National Museum of Natural History also graced the occasion and shared their valuable thoughts on the theme. About 500 school children from different communities assembled on the occasion.

 

The National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH), an autonomous organisation with the Ministry of Home Affairs, organises the Communal Harmony Campaign coinciding with the Qaumi Ekta Week and also observes the Communal Harmony Flag Day. The Foundation promotes Communal Harmony and strengthens National Integration. Under its Project ‘Assist’, the NFCH also provides financial assistance for relief and rehabilitation of children rendered orphan or destitute in communal, caste, ethnic or terrorist violence.

                The Ministry of Home Affairs through National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) today conducted a first-of-its-kind multi-State mega mock exercise on tsunami preparedness covering the entire eastern coastline of the country.

Simulation exercises were conducted simultaneously in 35 coastal districts across four States of West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh & Tamil Nadu and Union Territory of Puducherry along the entire East Coast, to assess and improve the early warning and response mechanism to mitigate the impact of a high-intensity tsunami.

The NDMA experts, who led the exercises from the State Capitals, briefed the participants about the proceedings of the day. The exercise scenario depicted a high intensity earthquake near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, at about 0930 hrs. Within moments, the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC), INCOIS, issued a massive tsunami threat notification for the eastern coast through e-mails, fax and SMSes. It also put out detailed bulletins on its website.

A two-hour reaction time was notified within which the entire State machinery needed to be mobilised so as to efficiently respond to the situation such that the impact of the tsunami is reduced.

In less than half an hour, the State Emergency Operation Centres (SEOCs) were activated. Besides mobilising the State machinery to respond, public warnings were sent out to the communities. Evacuation instructions were issued, rescue teams were formed under Incident Commanders and kept at standby in the Staging areas.

Evacuation drills were conducted in coordination with various agencies, such as Traffic control, Fire Fighting department, Ambulances, Police, Coast Guards, Civil Defense and community stakeholders.

Post the simulated landfall of the tsunami, damage assessment was carried out at the SEOCs on the basis of information received from affected districts and first-hand information by air sorties, both fixed wings and helicopters. This helped the administration in prioritising the response and dispatching the appropriate task forces to the affected sites.

Representatives from 11 Pacific Island countries observed the exercise for key lessons and best practices to be adopted while preparing for and responding to a disaster situation. Their participation was part of a training programme meant for enhancing their ability to improve the preparedness of their organisations to reduce disaster risks, especially for tsunamis.

After the drills, post-exercise analyses were carried out by NDMA representatives, in which all concerned officials took part. Detailed discussions were conducted on gaps and shortcomings, and ways to improve coordination among participating agencies and officials.

Initial reports and analyses suggest that the response of the State/UT machinery was effective and encouraging. A detailed analysis is underway which will help us further help improve our response to such disasters.

The exercise is one of the various activities planned on the occasion of the 2nd World Tsunami Awareness Day held on 5th November this year. It began with an orientation conference on 8th November, which was held to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise. This was followed by coordination conferences and table-top exercises at various SEOCs in which all the involved districts participated through videoconferencing.

Tsunami is a highly devastating natural hazard, and requires rapid response when it occurs as the reaction time is limited. The exercise is significant as India's eastern coast is susceptible to both cyclones and tsunamis. The region was one of the worst affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. This exercise will go a long way in helping States/UTs in updating their resources, procedures and plans.

                The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir has said that Training and Technological Knowledge Management forms an essential component of capacity building in the security sector. He exhorted the public and private sector to work in synergy and learn from each other’s best practices for better safety and security of the country. He was addressing the inaugural session of the 27th Global Conclave organized by the International Institute of Security and Safety Management here today. The session deliberated on varied aspects related to Safety and Security in the contemporary digital era.

Shri Ahir said that the training deficit of security agencies and officials can be bridged by ensuring a well-defined technologically versatile training infrastructure. He said that the security sector is facing new challenges which need to be tackled with better and efficient knowledge management techniques and tools. He said technological creativity and innovation are leading to new products in this sector. He said that the technological knowhow with proper training is a quintessential need of the hour. With the development of digital infrastructure, he said the security sector has donned a modern façade with upgraded electronic security gadgets and equipments such as Electronic Surveillance equipments, CCTV cameras and Cyber-security infrastructure with digital security. He commended the public and private Security agencies, Intelligence agencies, CAPFs and Security Forces for attributing high priority to learning new technological security knowhow.

The Minister said that there is a need to elevate the traditional training on security to high-technology driven modern practical approach. He emphasized that both public and private sector should work in synergy for making Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s initiative of ‘Start-up India and Stand-up India’ by exploring new opportunities of collaboration in the security value chain. He said providing entrepreneurial and employment opportunity is the priority of the Government. He further said that industry, academia and government sector need to collaborate for better coordination and developing and learning best practices for addressing security and safety challenges.

Appreciating the suggestions provided by eminent speakers present on the occasion on amendment of the Security Act to reflect the challenges of digital era, Shri Ahir said that adherence by law enforcement agencies on security is the basis for ensuring law and order. At the same time, he said, the security apparatus needs to be sensitive to human rights and people’s needs. The minister said that there is a growing demand for Centers of excellence for training and better education on safety and security aspects. He also said that suggestions provided regarding taxation (GST) on security equipments will be communicated to the GST Council and Ministry officials for their analysis.

Shri Ahir exhorted the stakeholders including the industry, business community and security agencies to come up with suggestions based on their deliberations in the coming two days of the conclave. He said the security issues have attained a national priority as proper safety and security is essential for the growth and development of the country reflected in its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and investor confidence in Indian Industrial Sector. He said that industry has to step up its role in Research and Development (R&D) and set new benchmarks for enhancing the security standards of the existing infrastructure. He said that, whether it is Internal Security of the country or better Border Management, having a robust security apparatus is essential to tackle insurgency, infiltration and trafficking issues. The Minister further said that security officers need to be physically strong as well as they should demonstrate acumen to assimilate technological advancements in their regular day-to-day work for better utilization of technology.

                The Ministry of Home Affairs through National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) will conduct a multi-State mega mock exercise on tsunami preparedness tomorrow.

The exercise will be simultaneously conducted in 31 coastal districts across four States - West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - and Union Territory Puducherry along the entire East Coast. The disaster scenario will simulate tsunami waves originating due to a high-intensity earthquake near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which will lead to a massive tsunami along the East Coast.

Participants from 11 Pacific Island countries will observe the entire exercise to take away key lessons and best practices to be adopted while preparing for and responding to a disaster situation.

The exercise is one of the various activities planned on the occasion of the 2nd World Tsunami Awareness Day held on November 5 this year. It began with an orientation conference on 8th November, which was held to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise.

This was followed by coordination conferences and table-top exercises at various State Emergency Operation Centres (SEOCs) wherein all the involved districts participated through videoconferencing. These exercises helped familiarise participants with their responsibilities, actions required and helped them evaluate their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for tsunami warnings in the run-up to the exercise to be held tomorrow.

Officials from all the important departments such as the Army, Navy, Air Force, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), health, police, education, firefighting, Civil Defense, transport, electricity, public relations, etc. participated in these preparatory meetings.

Tsunami is a highly devastating natural hazard, and requires rapid response when it occurs as the reaction time is limited. A two-hour reaction time has been planned in this scenario during which the entire State machinery will be mobilised in a defined manner to respond swiftly and efficiently. Evacuation drills will also be rehearsed at selected sites. This exercise aims to assess and help improve the preparedness, response mechanism and coordination among concerned agencies.

India's eastern coast is susceptible to both floods and tsunamis and many coastal districts have conducted similar mock exercises for better preparedness over the years. This is, however, the first time that the entire eastern coast will participate in a mock exercise simultaneously.

                The Union Home Secretary chaired a meeting to kick start the process of formulating comprehensive safe city plans for women in eight metropolitan cities of the country – Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Hyderabad. Municipal Commissioners, Police Commissioners, senior State Government officials and Civil Society representatives attended the Steering Committee meeting constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Chairmanship of Union Home Secretary which was notified on Ocober 31, 2017.

During the meeting, the Home Secretary took a comprehensive review of the progress made and steps taken by the police and civil administration of these eight metropolitan cities regarding women’s safety. Various issues reviewed included 33% reservation of women in police, installation of CCTV cameras, deployment of women in police stations, emergency response system, police verified public transport, prevention of cyber crime, infrastructure issues, mapping of dark spots & crime-prone areas and involvement of educational institutions, among others. The initiatives taken by these cities for women’s safety were also discussed in detail. These initiatives include Himmat App, All Women Patrol Van, Shishtachar programme of Delhi police; SHE teams, Hawkeye Mobile App & Bharosa programme of Hyderabad police; Suraksha App of Bengaluru police and Power Angels of UP police. The steps taken by other metro cities including mobile counselling vans for hearing the grievances of women, lighting in the sub-urban railway station areas, complaint boxes in the colleges, dedicated helpline for women, awareness programmes organised by the police, setting up of shelter homes for women and making provisions for street lighting were also discussed.

During the meeting, it was brought to the notice that police representatives are taking steps in the direction of implementing the target of 33% reservation of women in police and gradually moving towards the set target. It was informed that more than one lakh women are using Himmat App, which has been made bilingual by Delhi Police. The use of social media platforms for women’s safety was also emphasised during the meeting. The representatives also discussed various measures which can reduce the response time and thus ensure better results. The setting up of norms for standardisation of luminosity for CCTV cameras was also discussed by the participants.

The Home Secretary said that independent analysis and feedback system should be institutionalised to assess the perception of women on ground regarding their safety issues. Their feedback and suggestions on various issues can also be incorporated after independent survey and our approach to women’s safety can thus be fine tuned. Shri Rajiv Gauba emphasised on ‘targeted intervention’ by the police and civil administration, which will have larger impact on women’s safety. Shri Gauba emphasised on Integrated Command and Control Centres and on collaborative monitoring by police and privately installed CCTV cameras. This integration should be in a time-bound and phased manner, he stressed.

It was decided that the police and municipal corporations of these eight cities will frame a plan of action. The plan will be forwarded by the respective State Level Committee headed by the Chief Secretary of the state. The plan of action to be submitted by these cities within a month will be assessed by the Steering Committee headed by the Union Home Secretary, which will make suitable recommendations.

The representatives of Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways were also present during the meeting.

                Russian Ambassador to India, Mr. Nikolay Rishatovich Kudashev called on Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs. While remembering his visit to Sochi in Russia in 2015 during the Immigration Ministers’ meeting, Shri Rijiju emphasized on the time-tested, friendly and strong relations between India and Russia. Shri Rijiju assured to extend all possible cooperation in further strengthening the ties so that the strong bilateral relations can be leveraged to build partnership and collaboration in multifaceted dimensions. 

While reiterating that the relations reflect the aspirations of two growing economies, the Russian Ambassador impressed upon the need to build on strong people to people contacts. He said that bilateral cooperation is on the rise with enhanced level of cooperation in multi-lateral fora like Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS. He envisaged more opportunities for cooperation in future between the two countries. 

Shri Rijiju said that India and Russia are facing the threat of Fundamentalism and Terrorism in various forms and asserted that both the countries stand together in the global fight to address the menace of terrorism. He reiterated that concerted efforts by cooperation of global community are important to eliminating this menace. 

On the issue of internal security, Shri Rijiju apprised about the multipronged approach of the Indian Govt. in handling the security situation in the country. The efforts of the Govt. of India in strengthening the internal security and discouraging the centrifugal forces have been given boost by decision of demonetization by Prime Minister by checking fake currency and flow of money among the anti-social elements. He said that NDA Government has demonstrated strong resilience in last 3 years in containing the insurgency. He said despite being home to second largest population of Muslims, the effect of ISIS is minimal in India due to the wisdom of the community leaders and the parents. However, the Govt. is also carrying out de-radicalization and counter-radicalization programme. 

While Russian Ambassador mentioned about the proposed agreements on cooperation between the two countries, both the sides accepted the necessity of cooperation in the fields of border security, facilitating international trade etc.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing an Agreement on Cooperation between India and Russia in the field of combating all forms of terrorism and organized crime. 

The Agreement is proposed to be signed during the upcoming visit of Indian Delegation, led by Home Minister, to Russia from 27-29 November, 2017. 

Background: 

India and Russia have a long history of close cooperation in international fora on matters of mutual interest. With the rise in terrorism and organized crime across the world, it is imperative for countries to work together to combat all forms of terrorism. The proposed Agreement, which will replace the Agreement of October, 1993, is a step towards consolidating the benefits accrued in the field of security and seeks to jointly fight the new and evolving risks and threats. The Agreement would reinforce the relationship between India and Russia through exchange and sharing of information, expertise, best practices and would help in curbing terrorism and enhancing, security in the region.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir has said we must have a robust cyber-security policy and there is an urgent need for skilled manpower. Addressing the inaugural session of the 6th International Conference & Exhibition on Homeland Security here today, he asked the industry to fulfill the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s objective of ‘Make in India’ and said the domestic manufacturers should invest more on R&D, particularly in Defence Production. 

Shri Ahir said the Government’s focus towards emerging Internal Security challenges is highlighted with the recent restructuring of Divisions in the MHA, resulting in the creation of Cyber and Information Security (CIS) Division and Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Radicalisation (CTCR) Division. Thefts resulting from cyber crimes and radicalization through the social media have altered the security dynamics and pose a grave challenge to the Security Agencies, he added. 

Expressing concern over an estimated more than one crore illegal immigrants in the country, Shri Ahir said the Government has taken several initiatives to secure the country’s porous borders by erecting Smart Fencing. He called upon the various stakeholders to come out with robust solutions to secure our country’s borders.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon young police officers to orient themselves for a multi-dimensional role in the era of technological growth. Addressing the 69th batch of Indian Police Services (IPS) Officers here today, he said that behavioural and attitudinal orientation is equally important as intellectual excellence. He urged the officers to solve people’s problems with sympathetic and empathetic behaviour towards them. He stressed that qualities of police officers in their career should invariably include honesty, integrity, hard work and constant striving for excellence in their day-to-day functioning. He said assuming responsibility with a sense of purpose to help public is quintessential to the job of an IPS officer. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that technology should be utilised in an optimal manner for the development of police functioning and to address people’s problem quickly and efficiently. Mentioning anecdotes from his experiences as former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Union Home Minister said that society’s perception towards IPS Officers should be positive and Officers should likewise develop a sense of sensitivity, protection and security towards public, so that they can discuss their problems and have their solutions with ease. He exhorted the officers to have a visionary leadership role in their future job responsibilities with an attitude of development. The Union Home Minister said that it is the essence of job satisfaction and long term growth of service holistically too. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that IPS officers should inculcate the habit of power delegation for motivation of their team members with proper monitoring and performance review on a regular basis. He said Governance with transparency and responsibility is the mantra of success.

He emphasised that Disaster Mitigation Strategy should be areas of priority for addressing Disaster Risk Management. Shri Rijiju was inaugurating the ‘India Disaster Response Summit’, organised jointly by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Facebook, here today on how best to leverage social media platforms to 'prepare, respond and recover' for, during and after a disaster. 

Calling it a great example of execution on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s ten-point agenda on Disaster Management, which has clearly listed harnessing technological innovations to create a culture of disaster resilience in the country, Shri Rijiju said, the world is moving towards partnerships, where people are proactively partnering with the Government in responding to disasters. This partnership is a benchmark and first of its kind – we are the first Government to partner with Facebook on disaster response, he added. Shri Rijiju also invited other technology companies to create tailored solutions for disaster-related challenges. 

Shri Rijiju said that reaching out to the people and communities is the primary responsibility of all stakeholders and efforts should be to make people aware, informed and to guide them during emergency situations. He urged community groups and stakeholders to find innovative ways to inform people on time in scenarios of Disaster Management. He said the efficacy of Disaster Management requires a well defined guideline and the role of media is vital when disaster strikes and even in executing rescue and relief operations. He exhorted the communities to come forward with new techniques of sharing information on real time basis for better handling of situation at disaster scenario. Technology can be leveraged in providing a quick response and information to people at time of need, he added. 

Shri Rijiju said collaboration with various stakeholders including NGO’s and private players could provide the necessary base for response with a vision towards ‘Capacity Building’ to handle disaster risk situation for addressing emergency rescue situations. He said that Government will act as facilitator towards information and communication among various stakeholders by helping evolve new modes of communication for better contact between the ‘Government and the People’. 

Shri Rijiju said that social media affects everybody’s life and common sources of communication through social media has played a vital role in day-to-day information communication, which needs to be leveraged in proper direction. Mentioning about earthquake resistant technologies adopted by foreign countries, he said that efforts should be in the direction of better planning towards evolving technology in line with better communication tools for disaster response planning. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, said, the NDMA is proactively using social media for awareness generation. This collaboration is a milestone towards integrating social media with disaster response activities. He hoped this partnership will open new avenues for using mobile technology in disaster situations. 

Later participating during a panel discussion on the need for effective data analysis and tools, Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, NDMA, said, social media can help shape a future where, on the one hand, vulnerable communities become increasingly self-reliant and on the other hand, Government agencies have more powerful tools to get real-time feedback and reach out to people whom they seek to serve. 

Introducing the Disaster Information Volunteers (DIV) programme, wherein a network of trained volunteers would provide supplementary information on disasters in their local communities to assist Government relief efforts through the Facebook Workplace platform, Facebook Head (Policy Programmes) for South Asia, Shri Ritesh Mehta said we are aiming to empower communities by building products that connect people and create positive social impact. The programme will be piloted in two disaster prone states - Assam and Uttarakhand, he added. Facebook will now share its disaster maps, developed using aggregated, de-identified data, with NDMA. These maps can aid swift disaster response by providing real-time, actionable information. 

Senior officials of MHA, NDMA, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), Central Government Departments, representatives of Facebook and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) attended the event.

                Shibpur Naval Air station to be converted into Joint User Airport 
 

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh chaired the second meeting of Island Development Agency (IDA) here today. The Island Development Agency reviewed the concept development plans and detailed master plans for holistic development of 09 islands (four in A&N Islands i.e. Smith, Ross, Long, Avis) and (five in Lakshadweep i.e. Minicoy, Bangaram, Thinnakara, Cheriyam, Suheli).  The project being steered by NITI Aayog aims at promoting and implementing development based on sustainable approach to building a thriving maritime economy of the project islands.  

The Union Home Minister expressed satisfaction at the progress made since its last meeting held on July 24, 2017, when directions were given to identify and execute infrastructure and connectivity projects together with provisioning of water and electricity.  It was noted that site development potential reports have clearly mapped and delineated environmentally sensitive zones in the project islands and considering the unique maritime and territorial bio-diversity of the islands, enhanced connectivity has been recommended as one of the key priorities.  Accordingly, it was decided that the Naval air station at Shibpur near Diglipur in northern Andaman & Nicobar Islands would be co-used as Joint User Airport.  

During the meeting, it was also decided to develop a PPP package including a airport (Joint User Airport) at Minicoy Island, to unlock the tourism potential.  It was agreed to promote tuna fishing industry for improving livelihoods in Lakshadweep.  Union Home Minister directed all concerned to expedite implementation of ongoing key infrastructure projects in the islands and develop community based tourism in consultation with local stakeholders.  

NITI Aayog was also asked to drive the formulation of PPP projects and proposed detailed guidelines to boost private sector participation. 

The IDA was set up on June 01, 2017 following the Prime Minister’s review meeting for the holistic development of islands. 

The meeting was attended by Lt. Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Admiral D.K. Joshi, Former Navy Chief (Vice Chairman of IDA), Cabinet Secretary Shri P. K. Sinha, CEO, NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, Secretary, Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri C. K. Mishra and representatives of Ministries of Tourism, Power, Defence, Health, Telecommunications and Civil Aviation.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) today conducted a one-day national-level brainstorming session on ""Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Disaster Management"". The event aimed to build and improve the capacity of stakeholders to use UAVs and related technologies for better disaster preparedness and response.

Underlining the importance of UAV technology for disaster management, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, said that all stakeholders should strive to leverage existing technologies for quick and efficient disaster response. Shri Jain expressed hope that this event would encourage various stakeholders to collaboratively work towards research and development of UAV technology for Disaster Risk Reduction.

""UAVs can be effectively used in different phases of disaster management - they can help us identify areas affected by disasters. They can also aid disaster response,"" said Dr. D. N. Sharma, Member, NDMA.

NDMA officials and experts from educational institutions such as Delhi Technological University (DTU) and Anna University, and organisations such as Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Department of Science and Technology, National Aeronautics Limited (NAL), Nagaland GIS and Remote Sensing Centre, North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC) and various others attended the event. Representatives of many State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) also participated in the brainstorming session.

UAVs can provide high-resolution, real-time images of even the inaccessible locations. These images can then be used to produce accurate hazard maps so that prevention and mitigation measures for reducing disaster risks are planned accordingly. In a post-disaster situation, UAVs can be used to map the affected areas in high resolution within a short time, which, in turn, can aid swift and efficient response.

                A delegation from the United Kingdom led by the Minister of State for Immigration Mr. Brandon Lewis, held talks with the Indian delegation led by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju here today. The discussions covered variety of important issues ranging from cooperation in matters of immigration, tackling extremism, extradition, cyber crimes, sharing of criminal records and social security for Indian workers returning from the UK. 

At the outset, Shri Kiren Rijiju elaborated the stand of the Government of India on the Migration issues between India and the UK and also sought cooperation of the UK side on more favourable visa regime for Indians, especially Indian students. While seeking cooperation of the UK Government in expediting India’s 13 extradition requests MoS (Home) also assured the visiting Minister of full cooperation on behalf of the Government of India in the extradition of Mohammad Abdul Shakur wanted in the UK on murder charges. During the meeting, Shri Rijiju conveyed New Delhi’s concerns on the continuing anti-India propaganda carried out by Kashmiri and Sikh extremists in the UK that bear “serious repercussions on India’s sovereignty”. On behalf of the Government of India, Shri Rijiju also conveyed willingness to cooperate on exchange of criminal records. 

Mr. Lewis expressed satisfaction that meetings between the Indian and UK Immigration Ministers have been formalized as a dialogue every six months and expressed hope that this will further strengthen the bilateral ties. Further, drawing attention to the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) that will take place in London in April next year, Mr. Lewis sought India’s participation and support in making the summit a success.

Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba chaired a meeting here yesterday to discuss various measures including technology upgradation, provision of modern equipment, additional space, professional manpower etc. for improving immigration services at Delhi Airport. Senior officers of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Bureau of Immigration (BOI), National Informatics Centre (NIC) and Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) were present.

Following decisions have been taken to improve the immigration services:-

·         DIAL will provide additional space for at least 10 more immigration counters at “Departure area” by November 15, 2017. BOI will provide manpower and other equipment like passport reading machines, computers, web cameras etc. to make these counters functional by November 20, 2017.

·         Additional space will be provided by DIAL for providing 10 more additional immigration counters for facilitation of travelers in the ‘Departure area’. These counters would be made functional by January, 2018.

·         At least 10 e-Visa counters would be made functional for electronic Visa facility for foreigners by November 30, 2017.

·         25 more counters for electronic Visa facility will be made functional by January, 2018. This will facilitate foreigners availing electronic Visa which is becoming increasingly popular.

·         Bureau of Immigration will provide additional manpower of 1,800 personnel for improving immigration services by filling up vacant posts, inducting personnel from Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and also some ex-servicemen. This will augment manpower strength at immigration counters to enable Immigration Officers to provide professional and courteous service to the travelers.

The above decisions will substantially improve Immigration services at Delhi International Airport which will facilitate not only foreigners coming to India, but also Indian travelers visiting abroad.

The meeting followed MHA taking cognizance of recent reports about long queues at Delhi International Airport during peak hours. Senior officers of MHA and Bureau of Immigration subsequently visited Delhi International Airport for on-the-spot assessment.

Government has policy to encourage foreigners to come to India for tourism, medical tourism, business, studies etc. Several initiatives have been taken to improve Visa and immigration services to encourage foreigners to visit India and to provide them a pleasant experience.

                A group of 25 women from Jammu and Kashmir, who are visiting the city on a Bharat Darshan tour programme, called on the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir here today. The group comprises members of the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) from Kupwara, one of the worst militancy affected districts of the Kashmir Valley.

With a view to encourage the women of Kupwara associated with SEWA and to develop strong bonds with women in other parts of the country for closer social, cultural and emotional integration, the project for Bharat Darshan tour of four batches (25 women in each group) was approved in September, 2017.

While interacting, the members of SEWA stated about the benefits of joining the SEWA. They told that there is need for marketing their products so as to increase their earnings. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Ahir said that MHA will help support the marketing across the country of products made by the SEWA members from J&K. He said the SEWA centre at Kupwara is augmenting the Prime Minister’s objectives of Skill Development and Make in India, and the involvement of women from J&K is especially noteworthy. Self Help Groups are key to the Government’s programmes aimed at social welfare and poverty alleviation.

The Women Centric Welfare Scheme is being run in Kupwara through SEWA under the Civic Action Programme (CAP). Under this, setting up of Resource Centre at Kupwara, J&K by SEWA was approved in 2012. SEWA proposed to train 3,500 women including 500 master trainees of Kupwara in various activities i.e Cutting, Tailoring, Handicraft, Food Processing, Renewable Energy and Agriculture and allied activities. Against the target, SEWA has trained 3,883 trainees and 558 master trainees.

The SEWA Kupwara Centre has now been registered under the Registration of Societies Act VI of 1998 under the name “Shehjar District Association Kupwara” on June 20, 2017. Some of the women workers have started their own enterprises like boutique, craft, stitching centre etc. Based on their skill enhancement, some of them are involved in production orders for reputed designers. Further, activities related to Agriculture, Horticulture Supply Chain, Farm Management and Renewable Energy have been conducted in Kupwara. The Kupwara Centre has also tied up with Coca Cola for selling of apples.

                Sh Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs has informed that 1,789 cities have been declared ODF (Open Defecation Free) so far. Further, urban areas of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli have become ODF, which is a major achievement. Speaking at a conference on PPP model for waste to energy projects organised by CII here today, the Minister informed that Swachh Bharat Mission on 2 October 2014 is being implemented in urban areas by the Ministry with two key objectives of elimination of Open Defecation and 100% Scientific management of Municipal Solid Waste. These objectives are to be achieved by 2 October 2019, which would be a befitting tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary, he added. The mission has attained great momentum, which is reflected in the commitment of all 4041 cities & towns to become Open Defecation Free by December 2018, much before the envisioned timeline. “The Swachh Bharat Mission, which aims to make India a clean and open defecation free nation by October 2019, needs to become a ‘Jan Andolan’ with participation from every stakeholder. We have taken up a multi-pronged strategy for making the Mission a people’s movement”, he further said.

On the Solid Waste Management front, with India generating nearly 62 million tonnes per annum of MSW (Municipal Solid Waste), the Minister stated that it becomes critical to manage this waste optimally and more importantly realise the potential of this waste. Informing of the ministry’s focus in this regard, he stated that, “this is resonating in the Ministry’s emphasis on Waste to Wealth and compliance with Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. SBM is not, however, free from challenges. A large number of people still going for OD for want of toilets, a large amount of MSW is still unprocessed, 100 % segregation of MSW at source is not achieved. As of today, 23% waste generated is being processed. While processing plants with 15 million tonnes capacity are currently functional, plants with an additional 24 million tonnes capacity are in the pipeline, we clearly have a long way to go in this area.”

For Swachh Bharat Mission to be a continuing success, it is important that we look at waste as a resource and not as garbage that should be discarded at the landfill site. Overflowing landfill sites are leading to air, land and water pollution in addition to loss of valuable wealth that could have been extracted from the waste. In view of this, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has released a ready reckoner on technologies in Waste to wealth on 2nd October 2017. This compendium lays out various technology options available in converting waste to wealth resource. The compendium also has a collection of case studies from all over the country which can be effectively replicated. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Ministry has taken several initiatives along with sister Ministries and Departments to promote “Waste to Wealth” and for enabling implementation of Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016.

                An indo-spanish technical cooperation (government to government) agreement was signed by mr vinay kumar singh, managing director/ ncrtc and mr miguel nieto menor, director general, adif of spain, in the presence of shri hardeep singh puri, minister of housing & urban affairs here last evening and shri durga shanker mishra, secretary in the ministry. the ceremony was attended by mr. fernando nocolos puiggari, director international/adif, senior ministry officials, representatives from ministry of external affairs and spanish embassy in india.

addressing on the occasion, sh hardeep s puri informed that the agreement will enable availability of technical advice on specific issues, besides providing training and collaboration in the technical areas of Track, Signalling, Rolling Stock, Safety, Multi modal integration, station design etc. Stressing on the importance of the project, Shri Mishra stated that this agreement will provide institutional mechanism for mutual cooperation in the field of urban transport and specially in implementation of RRTS project.

National Capital Region Transport Corporation, a Joint Venture of Government of India and State Governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, is mandated to design, construct, operate & maintain rail based Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) in the National Capital Region. Three RRTS corridors: Delhi-Meerut Smart Line, Delhi – Panipat Smart Line and Delhi – Alwar Smart Line have been prioritised for implementation in first phase. Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor will be the first corridor to be implemented for which pre-construction activities including geo-technical investigations, detailed design, utility shifting planning and traffic diversion planning are in progress.

RRTS, first of its kind project in India, with design speed of 180 kmph will use state of the art technologies for track structure, rolling stock and signalling system. Expertise and experience in India on these technologies for higher speeds being limited, International expertise will be tapped for efficient implementation of project, operation of system and developing capacity in the country. Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF), Spain, State-Owned Railway infrastructure company has experience of planning, developing, constructing, operating and maintaining high-speed railway and regional rail systems like Cercanias’ in Madrid. SNCF, the State-owned Railway Company of France, has also expressed willingness to support RRTS projects. Possibility of similar agreement between NCRTC and SNCF was explored during recent visit of SNCF delegation’s earlier this week.

Global Housing Construction Technology Challenge (GHCTC) Proposed to Identify Best Technologies for Mass Housing 

 

A day long national Workshop on National Consultation on Accelerating Implementation of Urban Missions-PMAY(Urban) was inaugurated by Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of state for Housing and Urban Affairs(I/C) here last Friday. The Workshop chaired by Sh Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary in the Ministry was attended by nearly 170 participants including Principal Secretary (Urban Development) of states, state Mission Directors for SBM, Municipal commissioners and other officials of cities with population of 5 lakh and above, and of nearby cities of NCR area, as well as representatives from Ministry partners. The following strategies have been suggested for moving forward: -

 


	States/UTs need to implement necessary land reforms to ensure that beneficiaries have valid land document (land pattas/land title).
	State/UTs shall put in place a Single-window time bound clearance system for layout approvals and Building Permissions.
	States/UTs to share their respective road map with respect to Slum Redevelopment Projects under ISSR.
	States/UTs to focus on the ISSR vertical using land as a resource with minimum relocation, make a model by leveraging value of the land. Incentives like additional FAR & TDR should be given to make the ISSR projects viable. Provide rental accommodation to the slum dwellers while resettling them in ISSR projects.
	States/UTs shall prepare a land database to ensure availability of land and facilitate ease of implementation with respect to the affordable housing.
	States/UTs may converge their states policies with new 8 PPP models and utilize suitably to promote affordable housing.
	States/UTs shall emerge with innovative strategies to promote the CLSS vertical. With the increased carpet area of MIG in CLSS (120 sq. mt for MIG -I & 150 sq. mt for MIG-II) there is a huge boost for demand in MIG sector. The States to target specific categories such as Teachers, Anganwadi workers, Paramilitary forces, State Police Depts. etc. The States/UTs shall collaborate with SLBCs and DLBCs to monitor the progress of the CLSS vertical.
	States/UTs shall adopt 16 alternate innovative modern, sustainable, green and disaster resistant technologies that have been identified and SoR of 7 technologies have already been issued. The States/UTs are encouraged to adopt these technologies for fast and quality construction of houses under AHP and ISSR verticals.
	The Ministry proposes to launch the Global Housing Construction Technology Challenge (GHCTC) to globally identify best technologies which are suitable for mass housing. Through this challenge, all entrepreneurs, technology providers, institutions, academia and other stakeholders across the globe are proposed to be invited to contribute to the future of India's Housing Development. The Ministry also proposes to conduct Region/ State wide demonstration of technologies to explore and identify appropriate technologies as a way forward.


The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing PMAY (U) which aims at providing pucca houses to all eligible urban poor including slum dwellers. A demand of around 1.2 crores houses has been assessed from the Mission Cities across all States and UTs so far. The Government is pursuing the vision of providing housing to all the urban poor in which the role of the States & UT Government is crucial. Since the launch of the Mission on 25th June 2015, a total of 30.81 lakhs houses across all verticals of the scheme have been accepted by Government of India for releasing Central assistance under PMAY (U). Currently, 15.65 lakh houses have already been grounded of which about 4.13 lakh houses have been constructed and remaining are at different level of construction.  The objectives of the workshop was to understand and address the issues and concerns of the States/UTs while planning and implementing AHP & ISSR projects by states/UTs; to learn the successful models of AHP and ISSR projects being implemented in various States/UTs; to discuss on how the PPP models for AHP be used to encourage private sector participation in developing affordable housing and to learn from States/UTs on use of innovative construction technologies in AHP & ISSR verticals under PMAY (U). 

In order to facilitate cross learning among States & UTs, presentations were made by States of Gujarat, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh wherein the ISSR and AHP verticals have shown good performance and are replicable models with State perspective and policy. The presenting States emphasized on the importance of strategic planning with respect to the socio economic, financial and engineering aspects to ensure that projects under these two verticals gain success. The perspective of private sector in affordable housing was also deliberated upon and was led by CREDAI and NAREDCO.   The cross learning and deliberations from the consultation by both private developers and States/UTs together has been encouraging for States/UTs to develop implementation strategies of AHP & ISSR verticals.

                As part of continuing efforts to build the capacities of Urban Local Bodies in various implementation components of Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban, a National Workshop titled “Accelerating Implementation of Urban Missions” was held here later last week for two Missions of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, namely – Pradhan Mantri Avaas Yojana (Urban), and Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), and was inaugurated by Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of state for Housing and Urban Affairs(I/C). 

 A guide Book for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) on Bulk Solid Waste Generator’s Compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules 2016”, and the online database for states and cities, both pertaining to SBM Urban was launched on the occasion. The guidebook lays out the roles and responsibilities of bulk waste generators and will handhold ULBs in implementing the SWM Rules, while the online database will henceforth capture data directly from states and cities online, regarding their progress on SBM components, thereby enhancing the robustness and transparency of Mission monitoring.

The session on Swachh Bharat Mission, attended by nearly 170 participants including Principal Secretary (Urban Development) of states, state Mission Directors for SBM, Municipal commissioners and other officials of cities with population of 5 lakh and above, and of nearby cities of NCR area, as well as representatives from Ministry partners, was chaired by Sh Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary and co-chaired by the National Mission – SBM (Urban), Shri Vinod Kumar Jindal.  The session was highlighted by the following major takeaways: 

 

o   In order to enthuse cities with a spirit of healthy competition, the concept of a star rating protocol for garbage free cities was introduced during the workshop. Given its potential as a developmental cum aspirational tool for cities to incrementally improve their overall cleanliness, while working towards a garbage-free status, this is expected to greatly enthuse the city administrators. The star rating protocol is different from the Swachh Survekshan ranking survey in that it will allow multiple cities to be awarded the same star rating, and is expected to be formally introduced by the Ministry in the next few weeks.

o   Given the focus on the issue of cleanliness of community and public toilets, there is a concerted drive to seek user feedback for CT/PTs through the Google toilet locator and Swachhata app. Hence, extensive discussions were held on the issues of uploading all community / public toilets in cities on Google maps under the Business listing category, integrating with Swachhata app, as well integrating all grievance-related and other applications for SBM across states and cities with the Ministry’s “Swachhata” app.

o   Various best practices were presented by cities and states, on topics covering Collection and transportation of MSW (from Pune), Source Segregation of Waste (from Chhattisgarh), Ensuring compliance to SWM Rules 2016 by Bulk Waste Generators (from Bengaluru), Financing options and models for SWM (from Haryana and Andhra Pradesh), Citizen engagement (from Indore), and engaging ‘swachhagrahis’ (from Trichy).

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State(I/C) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has informed that since launch of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) (U) on 25th June 2015, the Government has sanctioned a total of 30.76 lakhs houses across all verticals. Currently, 15.65 lakh houses have been grounded and are at various stages of construction and about 4.13 lakh houses have been constructed since the launch of the mission. Inaugurating the National workshop on Accelerating Implementation of Urban Missions: PMAY(Urban) and Swachh Bharat mission(Urban) here today, the Minister stated that the Urban India is undergoing a transition in terms of physical forms, demographic profile and socio-economic diversity. The important role of cities in national economic process and their global linkages demand more attention for their development, than being hitherto given. Cities are expected to perform efficiently in keeping with emerging demands for employment, commerce, trade, industry and other services.  The Housing sector is the engine of economic growth that enables and feeds into the aforementioned. It is a vital sector of the economy creating jobs and generating taxes and wages that positively influence the quality of life. The government has embarked on an ambitious plan to empower Indian citizens by 2022 that marks the 75 years of independent India, he added. Sh Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary (HUA) and officials from several states and industry associations are attending the conference.

Addressing the day long workshop, the Minister observed that the local demand for housing is pegged at around 12 million and informed that the government has endeavored a number of measures like infrastructure status to affordable housing, direct tax benefits under Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act, relaxation in FDI and ECB proposals, reduction in holding period for long-term capital gain benefits and standardized usage of carpet area definition. Emphasis on reforms like stamp duty exemption and single window clearance, have been actively pursued by the Ministry.

Highlighting the progress made under PMAY (U), the Minister informed that it has made noteworthy progress over the past missions.   A closer analysis of the PMAY (U) verticals will reflect that most of the projects under the BLC and AHP verticals of the Mission have shown considerable progress. “Today’s seminar is very focused.  We have all gathered to deliberate on the bottlenecks and roadblocks that impend the progress of States/UTs with respect to the implementation of the In-situ Slum Rehabilitation (ISSR) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) verticals. The ISSR vertical has had a few challenges in its implementation due to land related issues, financing models, selection of private developer, beneficiary participation and policy concerns of the States/UTs.  It is pivotal for the States/UTs to adopt a slum free approach and comprehensively develop their cities with focus on slum redevelopment taking complete advantage of the ISSR vertical” he added.  Sh Puri called on the states to ensure better outreach for Credit-linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) and focus on convergence between the banking institutions, private sector and beneficiaries. While the AHP vertical has shown considerable progress, to further promote the AHP vertical issues such as financing models, encumbrance free land, private sector participation etc. need more focus to cater to the housing demand emerging from the EWS segment with no land ownership.

The Beneficiary-led Construction (BLC) vertical has witnessed wider implementation. The States/UTs have actively pursued this vertical which caters to individual households having own land and policy enablement has ensured to protect the interest of those households with no own land through the AHP and CLSS components.  It is crucial that we as stakeholders introspect collectively, and emerge with a robust implementation strategy to fast track achievement especially with respect to ISSR, AHP and CLSS verticals.

Dwelling on the Initiatives taken in the direction of addressing the housing demand, the Minister informed that in order to create an enabled environment this Ministry has recently launched the 8 PPP models for affordable housing along with the housing technology challenge to bring in the state of art innovations into the housing sector. The Public Private Partnership Models for Affordable Housing has been initiated in order to address some of the identified challenges and give fillip to the Mission’s objectives. It is envisaged that a sizeable and sustainable response through strategic PPP models will allow a self-propelled market to address the challenge of land availability and its high cost. The private sector participation will also enhance access to financing and capital markets, as well as reduce costs through gains in construction, operations and time-bound delivery of houses.

The Minister urged the States and UTs to actively participate, contribute and present an action-oriented approach particularly for the progress of ISSR and AHP.   The private sector, the State Government and Parastatal bodies should join hands to fast track the Mission’s objective by coming forward to invest their resources and energy in public housing.

                “Sustainable waste management is the need of the hour, which involves managing waste in an environmentally sound, socially satisfactory and techno-economically viable manner. The waste management hierarchy demands firstly, avoiding generation of waste, followed by reducing, reusing, recycling, recovering, treating and disposing whatever wastes produced. The fundamental objective should be to maximize re-use and recycling so that minimum land space is occupied for disposal and at the same time, natural resources and energy are saved” said the Union Minister of state (I/C) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs at the National workshop on “processing and use of construction & demolition waste on deconstruction & in-situ processing for ecology and economics which he inaugurated here today. Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, M/o Housing & Urban Affairs, Govt. of India, Dr. Shailesh Kr Agrawal, Executive Director, BMTPC and senior officials were also present at the workshop. 

During his address, Sh Puri stated that there is pressing need to bring awareness about the problem of waste management and the necessity to adopt proper procedure of collection, processing, recycling and use of C&D wastes in manufacturing of building components among different stake holders of the country. “In order to meet requirements of urban transformation and flagship programmes of our Government as regards housing and infrastructure, it is known fact that we can not continue to make use of conventional building materials which continue to depend on finite natural resources mainly drawing upon the carrying capacity of the eco system and often causes irreparable environmental damages. It is being increasingly recognized that raw materials from natural resources are being used at a faster rate than they are being replenished or alternatives being found. The challenge posed by the emerging trends of higher consumption levels has to be met within the concept of sustainable development, of which gainful utilization of waste is one of the important components”, he added. 

Highlighting the problem, Sh Puri stated that often it is seen that building owners, waste haulers and demolition contractors improperly and illegally dispose off these wastes in gravel pits or ground water recharge areas, on farm land and prime residential property, borrow pits and low lying areas. Such stacks of wastes may choke the surface drains causing flooding of roads and low lying areas while wastes from individual house construction or demolition, often find its way to nearby municipal waste storage bin, waste storage depots, making the municipal wastes very heavy and unsuitable for further treatment, he said. The wastes which are buried at site itself, form impervious layer, which adversely affect the growth of vegetation and prevents the infiltration of surface runoff into the ground water table. Therefore, it is essential to properly manage the C&D wastes. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of India, under Environment Protection Act, 1986 has recently notified Management of Construction and Demolition Wastes Rules 2016 to provide an institutional framework for management of C&D Wastes. This gives timelines for the state government to formulate policy, identification of sites for collection and processing facility, commissioning and implementation of the facility and monitoring by State Pollution Control Boards, the Minister informed. 

The proper implementation of the Notification is the collective responsibility of all stakeholders gathered here. Guidelines on Environmental Management of Construction & Demolition Wastes was brought out by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in March, 2017. CPCB guidelines address the issues pertaining to abatement of adverse environment impacts specifically arising from C&D waste management activities. BMTPC has also published Guidelines on Utilization of C&D Wastes as a useful resource for building materials and components. All these guidelines supplement each other and provide a technical and legal framework for effective utilization and management of C&D waste. In many developed countries, substantial part of its construction & demolition waste are re-used and recycled. In India, there are some significant initiatives such as C&D waste processing plants at Burari & Shastri Park in Delhi, use of C&D waste in East Kidwai Nagar Project in Delhi by NBCC and C&D Waste processing plant at Ahmedabad. 

The minister also mentioned that major municipalities like Surat, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Rajkot have floated tenders and are at the verge of putting up C&D waste processing plants and many more processing plants are also understood to be in the process of getting installed in other parts of the Country.

                ShHardeep S Puri, the Minister of State (I/C) Housing and Urban Affairs has stated that the Real Estate Act is a pioneering legislation which will have a long term transformative effect. “We have put in place an eco-system to ensure that real estate sector is properly governed and buyers are empowered. I have absolutely no doubt that the history of Real Estate in India will be written in two segments, pre and post RERA. The pre-RERA phase was characterised by the dreams and ambitions to own a house of many being dashed for a considerable period of time by a few persons exploiting that dream. We are not out of that phase yet,” he added. He was speaking at the RICS Real Estate Conference on “policy, reform and regulation: the backbone of Indian Real Estate” here today.

Addressing the participants, ShPuri observed that the lack of finances was only part of a problem for owning a house. There was very little transparency in the housing sector. Broken promises, incomplete housing projects tell a tragic tale of untold misery inflicted on hapless citizens who, in many instances, had pledged their life time savings and even the family silver just to own a house. We are still witnessing the final phase of a cleaning up process involving the misdemeanours of a few who tarnished the image of the many developers who were genuine in their dealings, he further said.

Referring to a technical study conducted in 2011 which placed the housing shortage at 18.76 million in urban areas, of which 96% is in the EWS segment and in LIG Housing, the Minister said that subsequent assessments led to a revision of this figure and in the final analysis, the shortage is likely to be around or in excess of 10 million units which is aimed to be addressed through the flagship programme ‘PMAY’ (Pradhan MantriAwasYojana) Urban, of the Government of India. Shri Puri stated that the thrust of the Mission has been to make available housing for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Lower Income Groups (LIG) and also the MIG (Middle Income Group), by harnessing Government land. “We have also released various PPP Models to encourage housing through private partnership. Among the distinctive features of this scheme are that government will make available the land and in addition provide a subsidy to each allottee and assist in obtaining easy financing from banks for the remaining sum required. The house will be in the name of the lady individually or co-jointly with the male member of the family. This will help gender empowerment. It will have a kitchen and a toilet and serve to help foster security of the girl child.”, he further added.

Stressing the importance of the Housing Sector, the Minister said that it plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the demand for housing and infrastructure in the country and is the second largest sector after agriculture providing employment to 6.86% of the workforce in the country. While the sector has grown significantly in recent years, it has largely been unregulated, with absence of professionalism and standardization, and lack of adequate consumer protection. It has also largely been opaque, with consumers often unable to procure complete information, or enforce accountability against builders and developers in the absence of effective regulation. The biggest fallout affecting the sector is delay in project completion; diversion of funds collected from buyers; one-sided contracts in the absence of adequate supply; reneging on contractual commitments by both the developers and the buyers; and constraints in financing and investment options available to the sector, thereby affecting its long-term growth.

Referring to RERA, he observed that the Act itself is a response to the dire need of Indian consumers and in discharge of the sovereign functions towards public interest. The Act upholds the spirit of federalism by allowing the States to set up the Regulatory Authority and the Appellate Tribunal, and the role of the Central Government is limited to Union Territories without legislature. The Act is aimed at consumer protection, by creating an online system for information sharing so that there is mutual trust between the developer and the buyers, and projects are implemented in time.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister has asked HUDCO to prioritize Affordable Housing in all its endeavors to contribute to Housing for All by 2022. He was speaking at the inauguration of HUDCO Build Tech– 2017 pavilion at ITPO here today. Sh Ravi kanth, CMD, HUDCO was also present on the occasion. Addressing on the occasion, Sh Puri lauded HUDCO’s contribution through financing a wide range of housing and infrastructure projects including roads, bridges, hospitals, metro rail, etc., and partnering in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), NULM etc. 

Explaining to the Minister, CMD HUDCO informed that it is a techno-financial institution and the exhibition has tried to capture the multi-dimensional roles played by HUDCO towards sustainable development and particularly urban development. The exhibition focuses on the housing & infrastructure projects and innovative consultancy assignments in architecture, city planning, utilization of cost effective and sustainable building materials, technologies and services, and energy efficient Green Buildings, CSR etc. “HUDCO’s contribution is not just limited to affordable housing but also contributes through financing of national assets like Lucknow Agra Expressway, Bengaluru Metro Rail and Cochin International Airport etc. HUDCO has contributed to sustainable development through its financing of water supply schemes, riverfront development as well as creation of public spaces and conservation of lakes. The exhibition captures the tremendous work done by HUDCO for affordable housing and urban infrastructure in the country”, he added. 

CMD, HUDCO informed that the company has also designed some landmark projects in the capital city of New Delhi, ecologically sensitive area of Sikkim as well as affordable housing in Jammu & Kashmir and Madhya Pradesh. HUDCO is a Central Nodal Agency (along with NHB) for the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) component of the Govt. of India programme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) – Urban. A corner in the exhibition showcases HUDCO’s contribution towards successful implementation of this ambitious programme that aims to provide Housing for All by 2022. 

HUDCO has made a concerted effort to reach the unreached as well as support the flagship programmes of the Govt. of India such as Swachh Bharat and Skill India etc. Through its CSR assistance towards purchase of Mini Tippers for collection of solid waste in Guwahati and construction of toilets in schools, HUDCO has expressed its commitment in making our Prime Minister’s dream of Swachh Bharat a reality. The construction of class rooms and skill development training are yet other examples to empower the downtrodden through education and livelihood promotion. HUDCO has also extended CSR assistance for construction of Night Shelters with sanitation facilities in many cities including Chennai Ahmedabad etc. to provide shelter to the most deprived sections of the society – the urban homeless. 

The exhibition showcases HUDCO’s effort towards conservation of built heritage. HUDCO collaborated with National Culture Fund, a Govt. of India organization for conservation of Sunderwala Mahal, a protected Architectural heritage. A unique initiative of HUDCO is construction of a work shed in Gangtok for cobblers to protect them from the vagaries of nature and ensure uninterrupted work hours.

The Government has revised the House Building Advance (HBA) rules for Central Government Employees incorporating the accepted recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission.  Following are the salient features of the new rules:-

 

1.         The total amount of advance that a central government employee can borrow from government has been revised upwards.  The employee can up to borrow 34 months of the basic pay subject to a maximum of Rs. 25 lakhs (Rs. Twenty Five Lakhs only), or cost of the house/flat, or the amount according to repaying capacity, whichever is the least for new construction/purchase of new house/flat.  Earlier this limit was only Rs.7.50 lakhs.

2.         Similarly, the HBA amount for expansion of the house has been revised to a maximum of Rs.10 lakhs or 34 months of basic pay or cost of the expansion of the house or amount according to repaying capacity, whichever is least. This amount was earlier Rs.1.80 lakhs. 

3.      The cost ceiling limit of the house which an employee can construct/ purchase has been revised to Rs.1.00 crore with a proviso of upward revision of 25% in deserving cases. The earlier cost ceiling limit was Rs.30 lakhs.

4.      Both spouses, if they are central government employees, are now eligible to take HBA either jointly, or separately.  Earlier only one spouse was eligible for House Building Advance.

5.      There is a provision for individuals migrating from home loans taken from Financial Institutions/ Banks to HBA, if they so desire.

6.      The provision for availing ‘second charge’ on the house for taking loans to fund balance amount from Banks/ Financial Institutions has been simplified considerably. ‘No Objection Certificate’ will be issued along with sanction order of HBA, on employee’s declaration.

7.      Henceforth, the rate of Interest on Housing Building Advance shall be at only one rate of 8.50% at simple interest (in place of the earlier four slabs of  bearing interest rates ranging from 6% to 9.50% for different slabs of HBA which ranged from Rs.50,000/- to Rs.7,50,000/-) .

8.       This rate of interest shall be reviewed every three years.  All cases of subsequent tranches/ installments of HBA being taken by the employee in different financial years shall be governed by the applicable rate of interest in the year in which the HBA was sanctioned, in the event of change in the rate of interest.  HBA is admissible to an employee only once in a life time.

9.      The clause of adding a higher rate of interest at 2.5% (two point five percent) above the prescribed rate during sanction of House Building Advance stands withdrawn. Earlier the employee was sanctioned an advance at an interest rate of 2.5%  above the scheduled rates with the stipulation that if conditions attached to the sanction including those relating to the recovery of amount are fulfilled completely,  to the satisfaction of the competent authority, a rebate of interest to the extent of 2.5% was allowed.

                Sh Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of state (I/c) for Housing and Urban Affairs has said that the Skywalk and FOB at ITO is among the 5 projects approved for funding of Rs 643.58 crore through the Urban Development Fund by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. The other projects involving construction of flyovers, underpasses etc are coming up at Mahipalpur, Narela, ISBT Kashmiri Gate and Rani Jhansi Road. The project has been mooted for one of the busiest crossings in Delhi. It is an intersection point, with a metro station, the Tilak Bridge railway station and seven major arterial roads. This leads to inter-crossing of pedestrian with the vehicular traffic, posing a potentially dangerous situation to the pedestrians.

Speaking at the Foundation laying ceremony held in New Delhi here today, Shri Puri stated that the Skywalk and Foot Over Bridge(FoB) will provide safe and comfortable passage to a large number of pedestrians, who come to this area. At present, vehicular peak hour traffic volume is around 16,000 to 20,000 PCU on ITO Chowk and 12,000 PCU on ‘W’ Point. Around 29,000 pedestrians cross both the points. The entire cost of Rs 54.34 crore of the project is being funded through Urban Development Fund (Rs 43.47 crore) and by DDA (Rs 10.87 crore). The project is expected to be completed by March, 2018. Ms Meenakshi Lekhi, MP was also present on the occasion.

This project will benefit the public at large who visit these offices along with the employees working in over 25 major offices located in the ITO area i.e. Police HQ, PWD HQ, Institute of Engineers, ICAI, Income Tax office, Central Excise, DDA, School of Planning and Architecture, GST office, Supreme Court, Pragati Maidan, ASI, College of Art and Lady Irwin College etc. A new complex for the Hon’ble Supreme Court is also coming up near the Pragati Maidan Metro Station which will further increase the volume of pedestrian traffic. “Considering the importance and the high visibility of any Skywalk in the area, the design of the Skywalk should be unique, highly functional, aesthetic and should be recognized as one of the Landmarks of Delhi, he stated. “Having going through the walkthrough and presentations, I am sure that upon completion of the project, not only the pedestrians will be provided with safe passage but the entire area will have a different look, which is definitely going to be a landmark in Delhi”, he further said.

Besides, we have recently sanctioned Solid Waste Management project for the three MCDs under which a total of Rs 300 Crore will be spent where each MCD will get Rs 80 crore for implementation of the project through Urban Development Fund and the rest of the contribution from Govt of India. All these projects when completed will definitely go a long way into improving the facilities and quality of life of the people of Delhi. We are also committed to fund similar projects in future also.

 About 1,000 policy makers including Mayors and Municipal Councilors from the five southern States, administrators, experts, urban planners, researchers and technology and service providers from over 20 Indian States and 25 foreign countries will converge at the iconic HITEX City in Hyderabad for a three day Conference from tomorrow to discuss issues, challenges and solutions  related to transport and mobility in the cities and towns.

            Vice-President of India Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu will inaugurate the ‘Urban Mobility India Conference and Expo’ tomorrow. Chief Minister of Telanagana Shri K.Chandrasekhara Rao and Union Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri will also address the inaugural session setting the tone for deliberations over the next three days.

            Hyderabad was decided as the venue for the tenth UMI Conference and Expo by Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu last year when he was the Union Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation. Hyderabad is hosing this Conference for the first time since UMI Conference was introduced in 2008. This Conference is being organized jointly by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of Telangana and CODATU, a French Transport Institute.

            UMI Conference aims at promoting dissemination of information and exchange of ideas on urban transport and mobility issues and the best practices being followed in the cities across the world. At the Hyderabad Conference, initiatives and experiences in respect of various aspects of urban transport of 86 cities including 36 foreign cities will be presented as case studies for detailed discussion.

            Case studies of foreign cities to be discussed include Boudeau and Lyan (France), Lausanne (Switzerland), Lisbon (Portugal), Gaudalajara (Mexico), Curitiba (Barzil), Bangkok (Thailand), Santiago (Chile), Constantine (Algeria), Cape Town (South Africa), Rabat (Morocco), Dhaka (Bangladesh) etc.

            Indian city case studies to be presented and discussed include three relating to Hyderabad viz., Road Safety Aspects, Transit Oriented Development and Introduction of Tram Services besides Parking Policy, Planning and Implementation in Vijayawada, initiatives and experiences of Mysuru, Bengaluru, Chennai, Trivendrum, Varanasi, Lucknow, transport planning for Maha Kumbh Mela to be held in Allahabad in 2019, Indore, Bhopal, Amritsar, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chandigarh, Kolkata etc.

            A total of 60 Plenary, Special and Technical Sessions will be held over the next three years for a detailed discussion on Intelligent Transport Solutions, Inclusive Urban  Transport and Sustainable Urban Transport Planning.

            The highlight of the Hyderabad Conference is two Special Sessions for Mayors and Municipal Councilors from the States of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Inclusive and Sustainable Mobility and Intelligent Mobility.

            Intelligent Transport Solutions (ITS) are advanced ICT based applications for enhancing the efficiency of use of different modes of transport in cities through better coordination and by informing the users to make safe, quick and smarter use of transport networks. ITS are used for effective management of traffic and mobility.

            Inclusive Urban Transport Planning seeks to ensure the right of access to public spaces and particularly, to public transport systems for all. In the present scenario, road spaces in Indian cities are being used more by the vehicle owning sections at the cost of the poor and the marginalized.

            Sustainable Urban Transport and Mobility aims at integrating environmental concerns with transport planning so that urban residents are not deprived of quality air.

            UMI Conferences are being organized  to further the objectives of the National Urban Transport Policy which lays stress on ‘moving the people rather than the cars’.

            Hyderabad Conference will deliberate on various components of the chain of urban transport from conceptualization of urban transport projects, design, financing and execution. The broad themes to be discussed include; Mobility for All, Multi-modal Integration, Inclusive Planning, New Paradigms of Mobility, Smart Cities and Mobility, Electric Mobility, Shared Mobility, Linking Urban Transport and Environment, Informal Transport Systems, Using Urban Transport Planning as an Opportunity, Efficient and Sustainable City Bus Service Systems, Financial Planning for Urban Transport Projects, Land Value Capture and Transit Oriented Development, Metro Rail Policy etc.

            Nine leading transport technology and service providers will display the latest technologies for the benefit of city and State Governments.

            The conclusions and recommendations of the Hyderabad Conference will be presented by Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary(Housing & Urban Affairs) during the Valedictory Session on Monday i.e November 6, 2017.

Egyptian born French Canadian filmmaker Egoyan’s work often explores themes of alienation and isolation, featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy or other power structures. Egoyan's films often follow non-linear plot structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information. His films have been presented in several retrospectives across the globe. ‘Exotica (1994) ’, ‘The Sweet Hereafter (1997)’ and ‘Remember (2015) were screened at IFFI 2017. 

The Indian Film Personality of the Year Award was presented to Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan amidst thunderous applause.

                Celebrated filmmaker Karan Johar, TV Czarina Ekta Kapoor and Sudhanshu Vats (Group CEO, Viacom18) attended the Panel Discussion with the theme ‘Mastering A New Reality’ presented by World Economic Forum on Day 8 of International Film Festival of India 2017. They extensively spoke about the growing emergence of online content providers, considered to be a threat to cinema and movie business.  



 

Moderated by Ronojoy Banerjee, Principal Correspondent, CNBC TV 18, the session was truly exhilarating and enriching for the packed auditorium. While Ronojoy started off the conversation by pointing out that content is the king, the meaning of that is still getting reinforced in many ways. The digital journey is quite exciting. The broadband penetration has been going up and is growing by 30 percent every year. The real revolution is taking place in terms of mobile handsets. By 2021, 80 percent of mobile traffic will be video led.

 

Profitability in movie making is probably at an all-time low. With more competition coming from online content providers like Netflix and Amazon, how has moviemaking as a process changed?

 

Karan Johar said, “Movie making per say has advanced tremendously. The general standard of cinema has taken a quantum leap in terms of narrative, technology, etc. everyone has upped their game. What is alarming to the mainstream cinema when we talk about purely theatrical business is that we have seen a downslide only because the energy that surrounds entertainment has been enhanced considerably. There are so many options available to the cine-goer or the consumer, be it digital, television and mobile handset. It used to be just sport and cinema considered as the go-to phenomena for entertainment. But now all these verticals have added so much for the average consumer that cinema unless it is a huge event film or a big word-of-mouth film, nothing else seem to be doing the numbers. And this downslide we have seen in the last five years. It has been a tremendous drop and my understanding suggests that it’s been 20 percent in just theatrical revenues and any exhibitor of the mainstream chains, be it the PVR, INOX, Cinepolis that they have witnessed the reduction of footfalls and as filmmakers is hugely an alarming sign.""

 



 

“We used to be the mothership of entertainment and I can soon see it becoming a stepchild. That’s what really scares me as a filmmaker. I know most of us will be enforced and empowered by the digital world. Cinema is truly to me everything. It’s really where the big the zone of entertainment began. It’s the mother of all entertainment portals and verticals. I really feel the need to protect it like I’m sure many other filmmakers across the world feel the same. Now when good films are being sent to festivals for just finding digital platforms for it to release on, it sort of breaks my heart because cinema used to be the only platform giving us the community feeling of watching and experiencing the film,” the filmmaker added.

 

Ekta Kapoor said, “Digital content is specific and polarized for individual viewers. The content differs from domain to domain. As a creative individual, the idea is to cater to the audience in terms of their age groups. It doesn’t necessarily need to be the same content for everyone. In one year, I do shows like Bhramrakshas and the web series Bose and Ragini MMS Returns for different audience.""

 

Sudhanshu Vats added, “There are two dimensions to it as we go forward. One is the theatrical thing and the other good news for filmmakers is that in the last one and half year, there is one more promising stream of revenue which is going to take the industry which is basically digital. If you look at a film cycle, you may see a theatrical which comes in first about 60 days for about 60 days and followed by digital in many cases or a satellite. From the profitability point of view this is good news. We need to think about getting the filmmaking budget right.”

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                Over the years IFFI has captured the emerging contemporary trends of cinema from a global and Indian perspective. As a platform it has always encouraged the participation of young filmmakers and creative people.



This year at the festival young filmmakers showcased new ideas and used innovation in their work. Experimental filmmaking and the willingness to take risks was evident from the kind of cinema screened at IFFI. Young filmmakers who believe that films be made from a height of intelligence, content wise and also visually made their presence felt at the festival.

The filmmakers who attended the event included Pratim D Gupta, director Macher Jhol, Tarun Jain, director Haryanvi Non Feature film Amma Meri, Nithin R, director of Hindi Non Feature film Name Place Animal Thing and Mahesh Narayan, director of Take Off and they shared their views and experiences.

Talking about the trigger that led to the making of Take Off, director Mahesh says, ""If you look at the nursing community that comes here from Kerala, it's huge. These nurses don't have a standard salary they get in Kerala. My point is why they are going to these war-zoned areas. They should be celebrated like people working at the borders. The wounds they encounter are bullet wounds. They are not prepared for that and yet why are they going there. That question was a trigger to make this film.""

Pratim says, “The film is about relationships and a fragmented family. Food is used like a metaphor in the film. There so many food memories that we have. Food in many ways represents relationships also. So I wanted to explore that.”

Director Nitin says, “This film was made before I got any formal film education. So this just a bunch of friends who decided to make a film. I'm very happy to get this far."" 

Tarun Jain says, “The idea of this film came because the projects for the past ten years that I worked on were mostly shot in UP and Haryana. Constantly we were dealing with things which were happening with the new constructions happening around. People are losing their farmlands. Some of them are definitely getting good compensation but that is not giving them a stable ground or future. The idea to do something with this crisis was always in my mind.”



The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

Canadian stage and film director, writer and producer Atom Egoyan hosted a special Master Class on Day 8 at the 48th International Film Festival of India.



Atom Egoyan is one of Canada’s most celebrated directors and was knighted by the French government and is a Companion of the Order of Canada, the country’s highest honour. 

While his film Exotica, which won the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes’94, was his first international breakthrough, The Sweet Hereafter, his most critically acclaimed film, received two Academy Award nominations. His other films Where the Truth Lies, Adoration and The Captive have all competed for the Palme d’Or in Cannes.

Exotica talks about a dutiful wife and mother re-examining her veneration of her husband after she finds another woman’s underwear in his laundry. Her quest to find the truth leads her to an unexpected journey of liberation.

The IFFI 2017 Atom Egoyan's Master Class held on 27th November was a treat for budding filmmakers and cinema aficionados, as he discussed his filmmaking style and other aspects of direction. 

Atom Egoyan says, “I think for any drama genre film to work, you need to work on the projection through the eyes of a viewer and then the actual transformation happens. There’s this sense of naturalism which I try to display in each of my films, the structure, the story-telling and situations need to be realistic. My stories have always been unconventional.”

Festival Sunit Tandon says, “We are so pleased that Mr Egoyan agreed to be part of IFFI 2017. I have seen his films since long time and his films have always featured at IFFI. It’s wonderful to have him personally here and he will be receiving the lifetime achievement award at this festival tomorrow.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

Canada partnered with the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) to be the ‘Country Focus’ for the 48th edition of the event.

 

The press conference related to the Canadian movie Meditation Park was attended by the Counsel General of Canada Jordan Reeves, and the cast and crew of the movie including producer Stephen Hegyes, director Mina Shum, and actors Cheng Pei Pei, Tzi Ma and Don McKellar. Besides talking about Meditation Park, the panel members spoke about the India - Canada collaboration and dealing with a movie budget model in countries as well as the stereotypes Asians often face.

 

Jordan says, “One of the things that really impressed the Canadians was the encouragement, the warm welcome and the hospitality. Some of the discussions we've had this week have been very exciting. Canada had a couple of things that we wanted accomplished here. First was to provide a platform for Canadian films, artists and filmmakers and the other was to increase collaboration between our two main industries.”

 

Director Mina Shum adds, “The inspiration for the film, the character in many ways comes from the idea that we live in world where citizens feel completely powerless. We can't do anything about the environment or the corporation. So I wanted to create a character that was powerless within a family structure.”

 



 

About Asians battling stereotypes in the movie business, Tzi Ma said, ""We have challenged and fought against the portrayals of who we are. We also want to be participatory in terms of the shaping, the image and the way the world sees us. I think it is changing slowly. Within the parameters of Hollywood, we as actors need to take a more proactive position into what they see and what we see.""

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                The last session of the Open Forum in 48th International Film Festival of India discussed on the topic: ‘Digital Revolution…Changing Face of Cinema’.

Raghvendran, Researcher and Film critic participated in the discussion. Indian Documentary Producers Association President Mike Pandey moderated the session.



 

Ujwal Nirgudkar while elucidating on digital revolution in cinema said “In 2008 we started to use digital technology for cinema. Now many changes are taking place in digital revolution, so ‘High Ultra Definition’ will be reality in India very soon”. Digital technology is really wonderful thing, but the problem lies with storage capacity and duration, he added.

 

Sanjay Chandekar, Head of Radio FTII, Pune said that digital technology has offered wings everybody to fly. Digital technology offers more options to user. In sound industry the problem is that sound engineers are not able to judge digital technology. Audio is in both optical and digital combination.

ESG is coming out with more and more technology driven projects, he informed. M. A. Raghvendran film critic also expressed his views on digital revolution in cinema.

Sushant, who has always pushed boundaries and taken risks every step of the way through the course of his career, started the conversation by asking challenging questions to the filmmaker who he deeply admires and respects.

Talking about his participation in the master-class Sushant added, “I’ve come here to listen to the master Shekhar Kapur like everyone present here and I have certain questions to ask him. I started off a science student but my interest always lied in performing arts. I was sort of confused in my head and started looking for answers. I'm really proud to be part of the engaging session and grateful to Shekhar Kapur for answering all my questions.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa

                International Film Festival of India 2017 has lived up to its endeavor to connect and showcase stories with themes never explored before. At Asia's biggest film festival, Italian filmmaker Andrea De Sica and French film producer, Sandra Da Fonseca discussed their respective films, Children of the Night and Montparnasse Bievenue at a feature called, Meet the Directors - Cinema of the World'. Both the films had very unique themes and made for an enlightening conversation at the festival.

Interestingly, ‘Children of the Night’ is based on a true story. It revolves around a 17-year-old Giulio sent to a boarding school for difficult offspring of rich families.  The teen finds a good friend in Edoardo. Taking advantage of the relaxed nocturnal security at the school they both start running away to a nightclub in the middle of the woods, where they meet Elena, a young prostitute whose destiny will be unforgettably linked to theirs. The night is a space of freedom, of new and perturbing experiences for the students but what they don’t know is that their transgressions are part of the educational program of the school.



Talking about the inspiration to make the film Andrea said, ""It comes from my personal experience when I was in high school. I met a guy in Rome and it's full of noble folks like prince and princesses. I met this prince, he was 16 like me and he was a very kind guy. We hung out for a while and I discovered he was attending boarding school for four years. I was really impressed because I thought that boarding school in Italy were very old and didn't know that they existed. Later, I discovered that he was under trial for murder. It freaked me out and I decided to make this film.""

The other film that was a talking point, ‘Montparnasse Bievenue’, a French film is about a person who is broke, has nothing but her cat to her name and doors closing on her face. Paula is back in Paris after a long absence, she meets different people along the way. There is one thing she knows for sure, she is determined to make a new start and she'll do it with style.

Producer of the movie, Sandra said, “The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival. We are very happy that the movie is travelling all over the world to India here in Goa. Thank you to the festival for showcasing the movie.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI will be held till 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                Over the years, IFFI has gained the reputation of being one of the most awaited events amongst cinema lovers from around the globe. It’s an attempt to weave the audience and filmmakers through a narrative that combines culture, language and the heritage of different visions.

The Indian Panorama: Meet the Directors on Day 7 of IFFI 2017 was graced by Atanu Mukherjee, director of the Hindi feature film, Rukh and Pooja Gupte – cinematographer of the movie. The movie talks the journey of a boy, Dhruv, who studies at a boarding school way away from his home. He is not aware about the problems happening inside his home till he gets news of his father passing away. He is in a dilemma whether his father has actually passed away or it’s a planned murder. That forms the basic crux of the story.

Antana Mukherjee said, “It’s a great honour and I’m excited to be part of IFFI. Shooting my debut film has been a great journey – right form conceiving the idea and developing it – it was a memorable journey. I’m happy that it’s a part of Indian Panorama and has been screened at the Indian Panorama and has got a very good response.”



Pooja Gupte added, “Manish Mundra is one of the finest producers and he picks up scripts that he has supported including ‘Aankho Dekhi’ among others has been commendable. I’m glad that he has supported us throughout the film. He is someone who everybody looks out to work with.

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

                Open Forum session with the theme – ‘Crowding the Social Media: Is Documentary the only source of Genuine Information’ was attended by Manish Desai, DG, Films Division, Siraj Syed, Senior Journalist, Dheep Joy Mampilly, Deputy Director (Social Media Cell) PIB; social media experts and aspiring documentary filmmakers. The session was moderated by Shashwat Gupta Ray, (Resident Editor – Gomantak Times).

Shashwat Gupta Ray said, “There is hardly anybody left today who is untouched by the social media. Most of us are connected through the social medium. Interestingly, the divorce cases have increased because of the over consumption of social media by married men and women as there’s hardly interaction left between the married couples.”

“Films and documentaries are also not untouched anymore. It’s a vital element that we are discussing today. My view is more of an issue of content and the medium through it is liberated than the medium itself. The concern is whether the content that is being generated is for which platform. And accordingly, we need to work on that front.”



“The digital age has been changing dramatically. The digital revolution has totally redefined the documentary filmmaking. Anybody who has a smartphone can be a documentary filmmaker because over a period of time and the advent of social media, the trend of micro documentary genre has come to fore across the world. The structured documentaries have their own rules and regulations and they want to bring a change in the society in a particular way,” added Manish Desai.

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

                The much awaited documentary film festival in India, the Mumbai International Film Festival for Documentary, Short and Animation Film or MIFF as it is known popularly, will see the grand inaugural on 28 January, 2018 at the National Centre for Performing Arts, Mumbai.  The week long fiesta of best documentary, short fiction and animation films from across the world will conclude on 3rd February.

 The oldest and largest film festival for non-feature films in South Asia, which began in 1990 is organized by the Films Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India. The Organizing Committee of MIFF is headed by the Secretary, I&B and consists of eminent film personalities, documentary makers and film critics.

The response to the 15th edition of MIFF has been overwhelming, signifying a vibrant documentary culture in India and the world.  The festival directorate has received a record 790 entries, with 194 entries from 32 countries in the International competition and 596 entries in the National competition.  Selection Committees have been set up to evaluate the entries and recommend them for National and International Competition Sections.

 Giving a major boost to the documentary movement, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has approved doubling of prize money for the Golden Conch Award winning Best Documentary Film in the International Competition to Rs 1 million (Rs 10 lakhs) from the earlier Rs 500,000 (Rs 5 lakhs). 

 Golden Conch, Silver Conch and trophies with handsome cash awards are part of the competition in categories like Best Documentary, Best Short Fiction and Best Animation film.  Besides, technical awards will be given for Best Cinematography, Editing and Sound Design.  Other highlights are the Pramod Pati Special Jury award, Best Student Film and Best Debut film award all of which carry trophy and cash awards.  Indian Documentary Producers’ Association (IDPA) and the Government of Maharashtra, through Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari join hands with Films Division in instituting awards.

 The festival directorate is constituting two Juries consisting of eminent film makers from India and abroad to judge best films in both International and National competition.

 Apart from films in various competition categories, best documentary short and animation films produced in India and abroad will be screened under special packages including Jury retrospectives and best of festivals.  Special packages like Russian and Turkish animation films, French short films, NFAI Archival packages, films from South East Asia are being organized.  There will be screening of films in Homage section too.

 On the sidelines, cinematography and pitching workshops will be held during the festival providing a rich and wholesome experience for film makers and cineastes. A business platform for documentary film makers is being planned by FICCI during the current edition of MIFF to help film makers find funding and screening avenues in India and abroad.  The proposal is in initial stages.

 The coveted V Shantaram lifetime Achievement Award for promotion of documentary movement in India will be conferred upon an eminent documentary film maker chosen by an independent jury. The Award money for the Lifetime Achievement award has also been doubled from Rs 500,000 (Rs 5 lakhs) to Rs 1 million (Rs 10 lakhs).  All together cash awards of Rs 5.8 million (Rs 58 lakhs) will be given away during MIFF 2018.

 While feature films generally address the entertainment needs of people, documentaries fill up the information needs of people.  In a bid to make MIFF a people’s festival, the delegate fee has been kept at a modest Rs 100 while there will be no fee for student delegates. The screenings will be held in the theatres in Films Division complex, 24-Pedder Road, Mumbai and nearby Russian culture Centre from January 29, 2017. Come to Mumbai and celebrate the documentary movement.

                Renowned casting director, Mukesh Chhabra has made a substantial contribution to Indian cinema by introducing some of the most remarkable talents in the country to the world. Having worked closely with award-winning filmmakers for landmark movies, the cinephile today conducted a master-class at the prestigious International Film Festival of India, 2017.

Associated with critically acclaimed and commercially successful films such as Gangs of Wasseypur, Shahid, Kai Po Che, Highway, Haider and Dangal, the casting director addressed the topic,  ‘Characterisation and Casting for Cinema’ at his master-class session on 25th November, 2017. With years of cinema expertise, Mukesh successfully heads his own casting company and is a credible authority to open the topic to conversation. The said master-class was an interactive session that sheds light on the exact requirements of the entertainment industry today.



During the master-class he said, “Casting is one of the core aspects of filmmaking. I'm glad it's being talked about at film festivals as well. I want to help talented people meet the right directors. I love casting more as it gives me happiness. While working on a project, I only follow my script while casting. As far as Bollywood is concerned, only your talent will take you further, not contacts. If you’re talented, nepotism doesn’t matter.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa. IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

                A hugely popular section of IFFI 2017 is Indian Panorama: Meet the Directors, where the delegates and the media interact with the directors of the film screened at the cinematic extravaganza in Goa.



 

Also, this year at the festival, regional cinema has arrested the attention of cinephiles. Popular Marathi actor, Prasad Oak spoke at length about his directorial debut Kaccha Limbu, that was met with commendable appreciation, while National Award-winning filmmaker Deepak Gawade went on to talk about his Marathi film Idak: The Goat. 

 

Prasad Oak, who makes his directorial debut with the Marathi film, Kaccha Limbu and has been the recipient of several awards and state honours for his work, says, “This is a very proud moment for Team Kaccha Limbu. It is my directorial debut. We are very happy that IFFI gave us the chance to participate this year. I'm very happy because there are nine films in Marathi fraternity in the festival this year. And amongst all nine films, only Kaccha Limbu was selected internationally. Kaccha Limbu deals with a problem of special parents. I always feel that the problem of those special parents is very big than the special child. We always give them sympathy. We always try to help them in a negative way. We always look at them in a very wrong way. They don't need all that. They just need love. I just want to portray that love through this film. It deals about the sexual, the physical and the economic problem of a special parent.” 

 

Deepak Gawade adds, “Regional cinema is doing very well for the past three to four years. Content is the life of that cinema. People come to watch just that. We are proud as regional filmmakers that our content is well accepted not just by Bollywood audience but it is also internationally recognized. The producers also don’t look at the figures anymore. Once they are impressed with the content they want to support you.”

 

Nila Madhav Panda, Director of the film Kadawi Hawa and filmmaker Atanu Mukherji of the film Rukh were also part of the Indian Panorama – Meet the Directors session.

 

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

                Bhumi Pednekar has been breaking stereotypes even before the release of her debut film, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, which was highly acclaimed and won her the Filmfare award for Best Debut female. The actress next chose films like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Shubh Mangal Savdhan both of which talked about unconventional subjects.



At IFFI2017, the young actress spoke extensively about women and breaking the stereotypes in a candid conversation with movie buffs and her fans, at a special Master-class.

Bhumi expressed, “Being overweight was linked to being depressed for a long time and I was happy that a film like Dum Laga Ke Haisha changed that thinking.” Post Dum Laga Ke Haisha I was offered around 24 scripts but the roles offered weren’t good enough for me to even consider. I waited for the right opportunity and the perfect script. I grabbed films like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Shubh Mangal Savdhan because they were important roles written for an actress. I feel myself lucky if I can make a difference to even one life through the films that I do.""

During the Q&A session, the Bhumi Pednekar displayed some more views.

To the question of whether she would like to do films that carry a social message, she replied positively and said that as an individual you cannot avoid your responsibilities.

She also added that she loves her country from a very young age and given a chance she would like to do films with social messages in the future too.

To the question of  what kind of stereotypes she would like to break in personal life, She responded that she would like to get rid of gender differences; even today, ‘ghar ka chiraag' is understood by the boy.

Responding to another question, she said, the characters in her film were progressive by thoughts and not by clothes.

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

                Indian Panorama – considered as an important section of IFFI Goa 2017 witnessed filmmakers Kunjila and Vaibhav to share their experiences making diploma films – GI (Malayalam) and Palash (Bengali).  The aim of this session was to weave the audience and filmmakers through a narrative that combines culture, language and heritage of different nations and different reasons.




Kunjila, Director of Malayalam Non-Feature film, ‘GI’, says, “Making GI was overwhelming in terms of putting things together like memories, cultures and events that I have witnessed. I've tried to deal with the concept of memory and relationships, the violence in relationships with context to the political environment.”

 



 

Vaibhav Hiwase, Director of Bengali Non-Feature film, ‘Palash’ told media, “Palash was my Diploma film from Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute .The environment and the film culture there was healthy, encouraging and gave its students a certain creative freedom that led me to make this film. I'm honored to be here, especially since I'm just starting off as a filmmaker.” 

 

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

Amartya Bhattcharaya in his opening remark said that actor must not take control over cinema. Performing art is very primary because technology is never a replacement of human feelings. While narrating the experience about film making Mr Bhattcharaya said that, he completed a film ‘Benaras-the unexplored attachments’ withDSLR Camera and that won National Cinematography award. Further, he expressed that, abuse of the technology is main challenge & not the use of technology.     



Deb Kamal Ganguly, Faculty, FTII said that in the film important aspect is ‘acting’ technology is supplementary part of film. We have replaced voice of actors long ago but not emotions and sentiments, which we see onscreen is ‘profilmic reality’ means we see that happens in front of camera. ‘Idea of stardom’ changes every decade, said Mr Ganguly.

French filmmaker Pierre Assouline expressed his views on technology. He said that new technologies are the means to control commercial cinema. Cinema is not for highlighting an actor but to tell the story.

Swastik chaudhary, Oriya filmmaker said that there is always an opportunity to break conventions. Shyam G K filmmaker from Bengaluru also participated in the open forum discussion.

Tomorrow at Open Forum discussion the topic is ‘Crowding the Social Media, is documentary the only source of genuine information’. Manish Desai, Director General, Films Division, Shaswat Gupta Ray, Editor, Gomantak Times and Deep Dhruv from Social Media Wing of Press Information Bureau will participate in the discussion.

                Day 6 of IFFI 2017 started with an interesting and informative panel discussion conducted by filmmaker Bharat Bala on the topic ‘Digital Space: The Future Ahead’ in the presence of eminent guests from the film industry and digital world including Shekhar Kapur, Sudhir Mishra, Vijay Subramaniam (Director – Content – Amazon Prime Video India), Nachiket Pantvaidya (CEO, ALT Digital), Sameer Nair (CEO – Applause Entertainment) and Karan Anshuman (Filmmaker & Producer).



 

The panel discussion was about the Digital Space – whether it’s a threat or a blessing to cinema and the opportunities available to everyone using the online medium.  

 

Shekhar Kapur says, “Someone met me outside the auditorium and asked me how to become a filmmaker. So I asked him if he is able to shoot the movie on his phone, edit it on the computer, and upload it on You Tube, he said yes. The question is do you want to be an iconic filmmaker or a filmmaker. In order to be an iconic filmmaker over a period of time, you develop the idea of the gatekeepers and in today’s time, Amazon and Netflix are the new gatekeepers. So they decide but before that there were studios, production houses, etc. There’s a huge technology shift. Netflix and Amazon became the rebels and became the icons themselves in their space. Gatekeepers take advantage of technology.”

 

Nachiket Pantvaidya adds, “Internet medium is almost free for the consumers. So the pipes are laid in and the consumers are getting it free. There’s almost one million crore rupees invested in the pipe and so there’s a huge gap between the content that is served on the pipes and investment on these pipes. There’s a huge gap between Naagin and Narcos. For instance, we only have homemade food available as compared to having Mughlai or any other variety in terms of the content available on the internet. That’s a very important space that’s the Indian original space is going to occupy. Digital is the way by which you can do home delivery for cinema. You can order at home and enjoy it in a different atmosphere.”

 

Sudhir Mishra adds, “Most of the digital content is being watched on the smartphone. The digital space is wonderful because it allows you to have that little cloud of self-censorship in your head also disappears, so you work freely.”

 

Sameer Nair points out, “It’s always been audiences who decide the fate of the films, and as they rightly say there’s no entertainment without applause. The gatekeepers are driven by revenue and economics, so it has always been that the audience will decide. Digital is a good space to be in. Today, we are not talking about theatre screens but mobile screens.”

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                With a culturally diverse and illustrious jury, International Film Festival of India, 2017 has been playing out on a grand global scale. Assigned as the Jury Chairman of IFFI, National Award-winning Indian filmmaker, Muzaffar Ali, who has been associated with the festival for a long time, began the press conference by acknowledging that IFFI has grown in content, size, quality and participation this year.  



Talking about his experience this year, the filmmaker said, ""We are looking to a great quantum leap in this realm of festivals which showcase world cinema. For it was a very big experience to work with such distinguished jury members. It was like a big orchestra coming together and each one of us shared moments of our lives through these films we've seen. It was a very cinematic experience."" 

Associated with the prestigious, Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Maxine Williamson, the only woman the jury, while sharing her experience said, ""It's really a privilege to be at IFFI. I have been following this festival strongly for the last ten years. We (as a jury) had a wonderful time and journey. The films were strong. I was really happy to see regional cinema in the competition. A strong competition it is and so it's difficult for us to come to a decision."" 

Academy Award-winning production designer, Roger Christian lent his insight on the importance of festivals, as he said, ""I do a lot of festivals. I do as many as I can because with the demise in the world of independent cinema, it's very hard for any filmmaker especially new ones to get their films shown. The only place is a festival now. A festival exposes it. Like an echo, the word of mouth goes out and it gets picked up.""  

Multiple award-winning Russian cinematographer, Vladislav Opelyants said, ""Thank you for inviting me. It was a great experience. My English is not very good but we are talking in a cinematographer's language. That language is only of emotions. Thank you India, I'm glad to be here."" 

Acclaimed Israeli actor and director, Tzahi Grad talked about getting to know other cultures through the festival. On being asked about judging films that belong to different cultures the filmmaker said, ""First of all we look at it as cinema first. How it affects you. It's easy to feel it. Many films had several ideas that managed to switch our opinions."" 

The 48th edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017, in the beach state of Goa.

                Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel laureate literary titan, multi-faceted creative powerhouse, humanist and reformer of global repute, generated a treasure trove of timeless poetry and went onto form the spine of many wonderful cinematic creations. Nearly 80 years after he left us, he continues to be living in our midst and was today celebrated at IFFI2017.



The panel discussion moderated by Vani Tripathi with panelists Moon Moon Sen, Shoma Chatterji and noted Argentinian filmmaker, Pablo Cesar focused on the many ways in which the ""Bard of Bengal"" influenced Indian cinema in various languages. 

Vani Tripathi points out, “It’s interesting that we’re having a panel session on Tagore at a film festival, one of the biggest film festivals in this part of the world, the International Film Festival of India.  Moon Moon Di was saying to me before when we were sitting in the lounge that what better place to have a festival than in Goa. The most interesting part is that the closing film of the festival is this beautiful film Thinking of Him, made on Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .We have the director Pablo Cesar who flew all the way from Argentina to join us"".



Director Pablo Cesar said, “I started off the project in 2008 when the ambassador of India was in Argentina that time. He said that I need to think about the idea of making a film on the relationship between Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Victoria Ocampo. And that time I knew very little about that. I was not specialized in it. Then I started to study him. It’s not possible to study Tagore completely because there is so much to him and his life"".

Moon Moon Sen adds, “My mother Suchitra Sen was the first Indian actress to win an international award. My introduction to Tagore was through her. I did my Master’s Degree under some wonderful professors like Nobinita Deb Sen, where I studied Tagore in English. My daughters grew up with my mother and they used to listen to poetries and prayers inspired by the works of Tagore.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                Different layers of trainings come into play to meet quality output. So, there is a need for film courses and training to meet the present day demand, this is the common feeling expressed in open forum. In IFFI today there was anOpen Forum discussion on ‘Need for film courses and training to meet the present day demand’. AmitTyagi, Dean (Film), Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, Ms Ana Tiwary, Producer and Director, Australia, Ms Sukhpreet Kahlon, Film Scholar, New Delhi, ShashankBhosale, Film maker from Goa were participated in the discussion. 



AmitTyagi, while making his point emphasized on bringing more film institutes to cater younger population. In our country nearly 5 to7 croes of youth population is under 30. This meant a huge potential for those wanting to learn filmmaking. While FTII caters to only 110 select students, this is a huge dearth in training potential.

“We need to welcome those who are interested to learn the audio-visual medium. I say audio-visual because it’s an equally large industry as the others. 30 years ago we could only watch movies, but today the average house has 300 channels. The tools to produce too are affordable.” He went on to add that in terms of training there are different layers to it. Events at the local level like a wedding would not require the skills that perhaps a filmmaker would. So, there is a need to keep all layers of proper training intact.



 

Ms Ana Tiwary, a resident of Australia for the past 10 years is currently putting together a syllabus on cultural competencies for a university there. She mentioned the need to bring out diversity in society and be socially sensitive. She said that, film schools create a support system. Network of friends helps into building a career and sustaining a career also. While describing Australian Films, she told that Australian films missing cultural understanding. Cultural understanding is very important for film making.

In addition to a formal film education, Sukhpreet Kahlon, a film scholar said that there needs to be an effort to educate the young on India’s rich cinematic legacy. She elucidated with an incident where a student didn’t know the existence of silent films in India.“We need to give a sense of cinematic history only then they will be able to connect,” she said.

Samantha Santori, a journalist from New York said certain aspects need a formal education and every filmmaker needs to put his heart into the film.

A young filmmaker ShashankBhonsale from Goa shared his experience of beginning his journey without any formal education. He spoke of the making of his first award winning short film that dealt about the preservation of mangroves. ShashankBhosle,is from Information and Technology field. He said that there is no need of formal education of film making. ShashankBhosale’s documentary on mangroves in Goa appreciated in Green Heros Film Festival, Mumbai. Now ShanshankBhosale is working on documentary on ‘Crocodiles’.

Tomorrow at ‘Open Forum’ topic of discussion will be “Are actors loosing control due to changing technologies?” at Old GMC Building, IFFI Goa.

                Among the 16 Non-Feature films selected for the Indian Panorama 2017 section at IFFI, are SupriyoSen’s Our Grandparents Home and R K Soren’s EPIL.



The films are among the 6 to be selected from 154 entries that were submitted this year for the Indian Panorama category.

While Our Grandparents’ Home is about 16 young scholars from India and Bangladesh who record memories of third generation of partition refugees of 1947, EPIL is a Santhali language film about a little girl called Epil.

Talking about the film Epilin the press conference, director R K Sorensays, “I studied at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute and this is my first time in Goa and at IFFI. EPIL is a Santhali name which means “star”. I come from a tribal family and wanted my film to reflect that essence strongly. It’s a dream to actually present EPIL here because nothing gives me more happiness than making films and telling stories”.



At the press conference SupriyoSen said, “I have been participating at IFFI for a very long time and have a longstanding connection with it.I enjoy coming here because we are welcomed to such a packed house, which is rarely seen for a non-feature film. I come from a family of refugees and so partition and its aftermath has always been an integral part of my films.” Adding that, “Documentaries and non-features need better funding and distributing to make it reach more audiences. We don’t have a big market for this segment and the only way to change that is to start marking better and greater non-features that people want to support.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                Day 5 of IFFI Goa 2017 was off to a great start with a master class on Virtual Reality (VR) conducted by the visionary Anand Gandhi, who heads the avant-garde Memesys Culture Lab featuring filmmakers, writers, philosophers and other creators of world class VR.



In February this year, Anand Gandhi and his team released their most-touted project: ElseVR, a collection of original, provocative VR documentaries and videos made entirely by Memesys. The videos are short—two to ten minutes long—but they’re followed by stories, interviews, and essays that provide context. He has produced around 8 Virtual Reality documentaries that have now played at various international film festivals.

Anand says, “We are rapidly moving into the science fiction age. From painting to photography to video to now VR, technology has evolved over the years. Similarly, cinema has also progressed with generations and with new generation filmmakers coming in at regular intervals and starting afresh. Life has been a constant optimization of what can be stored and what can be let go off.”



“The idea is to bring stories and images to Virtual Reality (VR), granting the audience an entry into the story. Virtual Reality has changed the way we see reality, making the experience as real as possible for users. Each story is a Virtual Reality Experience accompanied with a piece of long form journalism and images to create a deep and well-rounded understanding of the subject for the audience. VR is a tool to preserve records and memories for posterity. It explores the storytelling techniques and enriches the experiences of life. It helps compress space and time.”

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                It was an inspiring start to Day 5 at IFFI 2017 as filmmakers Bidyut Kotoky, Manouj Kadaamh, Miransha Naik and Rajesh Mapuskar spoke about their films Xhoixoboite Dhemalite (Assamese), Kshitij: A Horizon (Marathi), Juje (Konkani) and Ventilator (Marathi) respectively at the press conference.



Assamese feature film 'Xhoixoboite Dhemalite' (Rainbow Fields) has earned the Best Foreign Film Award at the Hollywood International CineFest 2017. This film is about children growing up in violent places, witnessing brutality around them and how it affects them deeply, leaving an indelible mark on their growth.

Said filmmaker Bidyut Kotoky,"" This film was important for me to make because the subject stayed with me for so long. It is semi-autobiographical. I don't expect the film to change anything but I also know that if you don't ask questions, nothing will change. I'm so happy to announce that Xhoixoboite Dhemalite will now release in Assam"".

Kshitij is the story of a 12 year old girl struggle to continue her education in the face of severe adversity. Talking about his attempt with the film said director Manouj Kadaamh, ""In my film the little girl doesn't want to just study but wants to bring a change. Cinema mirrors society and I'm hoping my film speaks to society. A lot of our little girls are not saved and if they are saved they don't have the opportunities to education. This is my small attempt to bring that change"".

Juje, follows the story of a terrifying landlord in a small Goan village who drives Santosh, a stubborn teenager on his path to self-discovery; to make a brave and difficult choice. Director Miransha Naik Said, ""Making this film for me was not about giving a message or making a statement. To me film making is about telling an engaging story and that's what I attempted with this film"".

Ventilator is a 2016 Indian Marathi language comedy-drama film written and directed by Rajesh Mapuskar and produced by Priyanka Chopra. Mapuskar conceived the film after one of his family members was hospitalized and put on a ventilator; he started writing the script after noting the reaction of his family members, trying to treat the difficult situation with humor.

Rajesh Mapuskar said, ""Right from the time we are born, we are born into relationships. Each relationship has a different dynamic and I wanted to look at these dynamics from a different perspective with Ventilator"".

The 48th Edition of IFFI is being held from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                The Indian Panorama section is proud to showcase two brilliant films – ‘Manusangada’ and ‘Pimpal’ from different language industries at the IFFI Goa 2017 and present on the occasion were the movie directors, Amshan Kumar and Gajendra Ahire, respectively to discuss the response received by the audience and the IFFI Goa experience.



 

Amshan Kumar is the National award winning filmmaker and had several award winning titles to his credit. Gajendra Ahire has 46 films to his credit and he is one of those rare filmmakers whose films have been shortlisted seven times in the Indian Panorama Section of the International Film Festival of India.

 

Amshan Kumar said, “This is my second visit to IFFI as the director of the film featured in the Indian Panorama section. IFFI has been going from strength to strength over the years but the film will be shown twice – once at the Indian Panorama section and once for the general audience. I’ve made documentaries mostly but this is my second feature film born out of the experience born out of the experience in the rural areas. Whenever I go to villages, I ask them the problems they face but I was surprised to know that they wanted a burial site. So Manusangada is a story based on that.”



 

Gajendra added, “My association with IFFI goes back a long way. It was in 2004 when my Marathi film Not Only Mrs Raut was showcased at the festival and since then I have been attending the prestigious film festivals. I’ve watched several films and I’ve learnt a lot as a student. I’ve understood new format of cinema also. It’s a growing learning experience.


Manusangada is one on the final list of 26 feature films that have been selected to the Indian Panorama section of the 48th International Film Festival of India, held in Goa from November 20 to 28. It’s the only Tamil film that has been selected for screening at the Indian Panorama.

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

Nitesh Tiwari, Writer & Director of the film ‘Dangal’ conducted a master-class with the writers of his film, – Piyush Gupta and Nikhil Mehrotra on Day 4 of IFFI Goa 2017, sharing their experience of working on Dangal and the thought process behind writing the movie.  

 

Addressing the film enthusiast, students and media, Nitesh said, “The master-class is an effort to try and reconnect what we went through while making ‘Dangal’. What we went through and what our thought process was when we started writing Dangal. We honestly had no idea that we would be becoming part of something which is going to be loved so much and remembered for years.”

 

The master class proved to be an eye-opener for the aspiring students of cinema and film buffs as the casual conversation provided good insights of the storytelling experience. Co-written by Piyush and Nikhil, the script of Dangal was written fearlessly as the subject was extremely unconventional.  

 

Another point to be noted during the master-class was the fact that the emphasis was given upon the storytelling and the characters. The makers also paid attention to the fact that the audience should be highly entertained and engaged, as it’s a commercial feature film and not just end up being a documentary. Further, they noted that research has been a key part, which gave not only information but raw material for scenes. Further, he elaborated about the audience centric approach has been applied holistically not only while writing but editing as well.

 



 

The conversation steered to one of the most prominent scenes in the movie, wherein Mahavir Singh (Aamir Khan’s character) loses to his daughter. One of the biggest reasons why the superstar chose to put on weight was this scene. No other scene in the film was so pivotal. If his character Mahavir is not fat, unfit, old and breathless during the fight it would look so unconvincing that Geeta defeats her father.

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

Under the section ‘Indian Panorama – Meet The Directors’ on Day 4 of the IFFI 2017, filmmakers Ali Asgari & actor Simon Al-Bazoon spoke about their respective films, ‘Disappearance’ and ‘The Other Side of Hope’.



 

‘Disappearance’ (2017) is an Iranian drama film which had its world premiere at the 74th Venice International Film Festival and later screened at the Discovery Section at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival. During a dramatic night, two young lovers run from hospital to hospital seeking help for complications they encounter after their first time. 

 

Filmmaker Ali Asgari said, “I love to make realistic films with a human connection. This film is based on a real story and we had also shot a documentary on the same subject. First movies were all about entertainment but today we've grown and are looking to not just entertain through our films but also communicate"".

 

Winner of the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, ‘The Other Side of Hope’ intertwines the stories of two itinerant protagonists: Khaled, a young Syrian refugee who drifts into Helsinki harbour as a stowaway; and Wikström, a travelling salesman turned restaurateur, who finds Khaled sleeping outside his diner and hires him as a cleaner and dishwasher.

 



 

Simon-Al-Bazoontold (Actor) told media that, in order to prepare for the role he did a lot of research. He was a translator and volunteered at the Refugee Welcome Federation, where he learnt a lot of stories and interacted with the refugees at the camp.

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

                One of the five best comedy Hindi films of all time, ‘Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron’ (1983) – featuring a plethora of seasoned actors including the late Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Satish Shah, Satish Kaushik, Neena Gupta and Pankaj Kapoor was screened in the Homage/Tribute Section of the late filmmaker Kundan Shah and also popularly known for Nukkad series.



 

The press conference was attended by internationally renowned film director Sudhir Mishra along with actors Satish Kaushik, Neena Gupta and writer-director Ranjit Kapoor who featured in the film and enthralled the crowd sharing memorable moments shooting the classic comedy.

 

Sudhir Mishra told, “It’s strange that we are talking about Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron but Kundan is not here amongst us. The movie was his crazy idea. Satish and I were the youngest babies of the film crew. Ranjit Kapoor was the legend. We were known as Ranjit Kapoor’s friends. He was a cult director of theatre before we even ventured into the medium. Kundan inspired us to do what we could in Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron when it was made. We found ourselves as creative individuals through Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron.”

 



Satish Kaushik added, “It’s a special day because we are here to pay tribute to a passionate filmmaker. I know him ever since I came to Mumbai in 1979 and then through the film institute days. He had a mind which was different from others. He was quirky, mad and passionate about cinema. The cinema in him was very polished though he never paid attention to the way he used to look, dress and converse. When I was having a conversation with Ranjit Kapoor at his place, Kundan Shah was also there and that’s when I got the offer to be the co-writer of the film. It was my good luck that I got the opportunity to work with him.”

 

Ranjit Kapoor said, “Few days we had given a tribute to the film at NFDC in Mumbai and before that we did it for Om Puri as well. The tribute process for the movie will keep happening forever till the cast of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron is alive. The movie was his directorial debut and mine as a writer and the association I share with Kundan is divine. He had a streak of madness in him.”

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

                 A panel discussion with the theme - ‘Young Filmmakers of India: Emerging Voices and Narratives’ with Karthik Subbaraj, R S Prasanna, Bhaskar Hazarika, & Raja Krishna Menon, brilliantly moderated by writer-filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari started off on Day 4 of IFFI 2017. 



Bollywood has witnessed a new crop of brilliant storytellers over the past few years and these new cinematic voices are unique in the manner in which they employs accessible methods to tell socially rooted stories that exists beyond India’s dynamic metropolitan centers. This panel compromise of few of these successful and path-breaking filmmakers who have in the recent past made far reaching content driven films with unconventional tales set in real places and among the people. 

Ashwiny made her directorial and writing debut with critically-acclaimed movie ‘Nil Battey Sannata’, Tamil remake of ‘Amma Kannaku’ and also the romantic comedy ‘Bareilly Ki Barfi’. Talking about the new emergence of new storytellers, she said, “Over the last few years, Hindi cinema industry has witnessed various filmmakers who came from outside and just with their stories made their mark in the industry. The stories that they have showcased are fearless and the time has come when the audience has started accepting such stories without bothering about the actors featuring in it.” 

“After making three films, I’ve ealized that it’s not easy to go out and tell your own stories. But now there are producers waiting for filmmakers like us who wants to say good stories,” she adds. 

Bhaskar Hazarika says, “Subtitles work because if people in India are watching Korean films, they can watch a Manipuri film too with subtitles, except that as filmmakers we have to be conscious that we cannot have very dialogue-heavy films, because we can’t make people read all the time. So we try to do films which have less dialogue but the scenes explain a lot. I struggled for five-six years in Bombay and I realized the problem is that Hindi is not my first language. I was not able to convert my stories for the Hindi-speaking audience. Which is when I went back home and I started working in Assamese and funnily enough now when I meet producers, they advise me to make films in all Indian languages because they tend to travel more.”   

Says R. S Prasanna, “It all goes back to the fact that there’s a lot of potential to being jobless. When you’re jobless, you’re walking around film festivals without being a filmmaker which is what I was, before I did Kalyana Samayal Saadham, that’s the best phase of my life. You’re training together with friends, hopping from one film to another, you’re criticizing other filmmakers. That’s the best high you can ever get. Thanks to Tamil cinema, a movie like Kalyana Samayal Saadham could happen because it is independently produced and released in a very small manner. Because word of mouth it picked up. Also because I was interacting with real people on the ground. I had not assisted anybody. I don’t come from the industry. It’s only an outsider who can possibly think of crazy ideas.”

 



 

Raja Krishna Menon says, “The film that got me really noticed is Barah Aana as a festival film. When I made the film, I thought there was a story and I thought I had to tell it and I told it in the best way I could. It was called a festival and art-house film. I was shocked because I never meant to make it like that. But I heard a very interesting review which said that this is exactly Manmohan Desai except that it’s garbed in reality. So I think when you go into reality people start accepting it. The film is about an under-dog and the treatment makes it interesting. It gets slotted very early and once it gets slotted it gets very difficult switch that slot. So I think that is changing hugely. You can tell a story even though you may not have the best production quality. But the stories are coming out. As the stories are coming out, producers are learning if there are 100000 people who want to watch it on YouTube there must be others out there who could be interested as well. We are breaking barriers.”  

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

                IFFI 2017 hosts their annual showcasing of a special curated selection of 7 award winning films, namely Panfilov’s 28,The Second Mother,The Heart of Madness, Ayanda, Soulmate, Kaasav and Where has the Time Gone as part of the BRICS Film package.



The award winning films will be screened through the course of the festival as was done for the first time at the last IFFI.

Among the films being showcased is the much talked about anthology film ""Where Has Time Gone?"" headlining directors such as Walter Salles, Alexey Fedorchenko, Madhur Bhandarkar, Jahmil X.T. Qubeka and Jia Zhangke, which was also presented at the Busan International Film Festival.

Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, who represented India at BRICS, today spoke at the press conference today about the BRICS filmmaking programme, the anthology film and his experience at China, the country that hosted BRICS this year.

 

Madhur Bhandarkar said, ""It was an honour to be in the company of such fine filmmakers, whom I really admire for so many years. It's also an honour to be attached to ""Where Has Time Gone"" and to represent the country on such an esteemed platform. It was a great moment for me that the film received so much appreciation when we screened it at Busan and a day before in Goa."" Adding that, "" It's challenging to make a short film and convey a message in 17 minutes. It was such a great experience working on this film and meeting filmmakers from across the world, who brought their own flavour to the film"".

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                48th IFFI Goa has section on ‘Accessible India’ featuring two films ‘Secret Superstar’ & ‘Hindi Medium’, which were screened at IFFI, 2017. Saksham – a Delhi-based organization has added audio description and same language subtitling in these movies to make movies accessible to all including people who cannot see or hear.



 

‘Team Saksham’ interacted with media in a press conference today. The press conference was attended by Ms Rummi K Seth (Managing Founder Trustee - Saksham), Mr Dipendra Manocha (Founder Trustee – Saksham), Mr Narendra Joshi (Audio-descriptor and scriptwriter) and Mr Taha Haaziq (Member Secretary, Sanjay Centre For Special Education, Goa) who have played an important role in creating and filming of these versions of these movies in the international film festival.

 

Rummi Seth said, “This conference is special and different from the ones you have been a part of. This interesting project was started way back in 2005. If you sit and watch a film with your eyes closed what would you see as such except dialogues. During the screening of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last year, special scenes where there were no dialogues, a blind person won’t know what is happening. We have a voice-over and a scriptwriter Mr Narendra and we all sit and decide as to what needs to be written to fill that space.”

 

Dipendra Manocha adds, “This accessibility of movies is all about inclusion. As a blind person, the question to me is do we have the right to go to the movie halls like everybody else or not. If we have the right then we are entitled to use every facility available to us. Physically challenged people may have some kind of limitation in terms of walking, sitting, speaking, etc. This is an initiative to help such people participate in it and be part of the active society. This effort of accessible movies is just a step towards that direction.”



Speaking about technical challenges while working on the concept, Narendra Joshi told media that, “The challenge is to create emotions in the spaces between the dialogues for the disabled ones to keep going with the flow while watching a movie. We have around 300-400 spaces during the entire movie watching experience. In 3 or 5 seconds, you need to figure out what is the important part that would help a visually impaired to know the scene better. The script which we work for the entire movie needs to be reworked once the entire process is done. We started the initiative with Mr Amitabh Bachchan’s movie Black and were met with a huge success.”

 

Audio description is a method to add audio narration describing what is being shown on the screen. This description is added in the silent gap between dialogues and it’s extremely important for people with visually challenged people or low vision and helps them to appreciate all parts of the movie

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.  IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

                International Film Festival of India (IFFI) is the biggest platform for young filmmakers, said Dr Shreyans Jain, Film-maker. Dr Jain was speaking at Open Forum organized by Federation of Film Socities of India in IFFI at Goa today. Bharat Mirle and N. Vidyasankar from Karnataka, Luong Dinh Dung from Vietnam were also participated in the Open Forum.

“Film is the medium which affects masses and classes”, said Dr Shreyans Jain. Sharing his experience about film making, he said that now he is beginner in film making field. So far he made two short films and two feature films. Dr Jain is now working on Marathi Film “Sai Aalo Payi Payi” (story about devotes of Saibaba).

Luong Dinh Dung from Vietnam, who is a Director and Producer of film ‘Father and Son’, expressed happiness over the response to the film in IFFI. He said that it is very difficult for an independent filmmaker to make film in Vietnam. That is one of the reasons we bring the film here in IFFI, he said.  It took ten years to make ‘Father and Son’, he told.



N. Vidyasankar, Festival Director, Bengaluru International Film Festival told that modern technology changed the scenario, but still we need modern technology driven culture. Globally film infrastructure changed very drastically. When Indian Film goes abroad, the first thing that comes is technological values. In our country, we need to change the educational system. Need to make children learn of technology about Cinema, he said.  Creation and film construction is very important, he further said.

Bharat Mirale, Filmmaker from Karnataka, said that In International Film Festival of India ‘Film-Bazar’ is a great exposure to young film makers. Now technology is playing vital role in promoting films. Technology change is for the betterment of films, he said. People come to know in detail about the films through various technological platforms. Though, technological scenario is changing a lot economics of the film remains the main concern, he said.

                Academy Award and BAFTA winning sound recordist and mixer, Craig Mann today conducted a special Master Class at the 48th International Film Festival of India. The Master Class was aimed at discovering new ways to utilize sound to its fullest potential to help bring filmmakers' vision to the screen.

With over 15 years of sound industry experience under his belt, Craig Mann has worked on several popular films including Insidious (2010), Paranormal Activity 4 (2012), and Whiplash (2014), for which he won the Oscar for Sound Mixing and BAFTA for Sound. The award winning recordist and mixer is also a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At the Master Class, Craig Mann took the delegates through how he turned his lifelong passion into a game changing career move, as he began experimenting with recording sound effects and music even while in high school.



Craig Mann told, ""Having worked in the field of sound recording and mixing, I’ve realized the importance of sound in motion pictures. Sound supports a good story and it’s very important. It also determines certain emotions that you want certain scenes to convey."" 

Talking about his journey that led him to being one of the leading names in sound design he added, ""While my parents pushed me to study as they believed sound engineering wouldn't help me much in terms of making money, I was determined to take it forward. I’ve worked as a light assistant at one of the well-known post production houses in Canada and also learnt TV and film mixing"".

The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa. IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

Rohan Parushram Kanawade, who directed ‘Khidkee’, shared his experience about the film. The film is about Madhu, a middle aged homemaker whose life revolves around taking care of paralytic husband. Her only distraction is Ashwin, a youngster who lives in an opposite building. Ashwin is a writer who is frequently drawn to his living-room window through which he observes Madhu.



Amartya Bhattacharya, National Film Awardee for cinematography, who directed ‘Khynikaa’ (The Lost Idea)talked about his film while interacting with media at IFFI 2017. His film is a tale of two men, a poet & a painter claiming possession over a same idea, in a rural village portrayed as a wonderland. They soon realize that an idea is no ones’ possession and it is not wise to rely on fate for judgment.

                Open Forum, a Federation of Film Societies initiative, was inaugurated today at IFFI, 2017. The 29th edition at the 48th International Film Festival of India opened the platform with a discussion on the New Challenges in Organising Film Festivals. The initiative has been at the forefront of hosting discussions, deliberating important film topics since the first in 1988 in Thiruvananthapuram



At the inaugural, Sunit Tandon, Festival Director IFFI, recalled fond memories of being part of the first Open Forum in 1988. He vividly remembered the poster designed by the renowned G Ravindran and also highlighted the history of the federation. He wished the Federation all the success and was certain the discussions will prove to be enlightening.

Kiran Shantaram, Filmmaker and President of the Federation of Film Societies of India said that the Open Forum is conducted to know ‘what to watch and how to watch’. In context of the topic of discussion, he noted that doing the festival individually was a difficult task. Inadequate infrastructure and lack of funds are major constraints for organising Films festivals. Film Festivals of International level could not be possible without the government’s proactive support, he added.



The details of the consorted work undertaken by the Academy with the State were briefed by Rajendra Singh Babu, Chairman, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, Bengaluru. He announced the upcoming 10th edition of the festival dates as 22 Feb to March 2. Further, the festival will not be confined only to Bangalore alone, but Mysore too will be included in the festival ambit. The closing ceremony will be held in the spectacular environs of the Mysore Palace.

The next speaker New York based journalist Samantha Sartori who brings her extensive knowledge of covering film festivals was grateful to be present and was ‘really impressed with the festival’. Amit Agarwal, Head, International Alliances, Global Film Festivals, Noida,  noted that while organising a festival is easy in the digital age,  he questioned the presence of good infrastructure and planning. He pointed to Cannes as an example where the team commenced planning for the next one on the day after the festival ended.

In the International Film Festival of India in Indian Panorama section ‘Meet - the Directors of Non-Feature Films’ was organized today. Shri Ajay Kurane, Director Baluta (Marathi), Anik Dutta, Director Meghnadbod Rohosyo (Bengali), Rima Das, Director, Village Rock stars (Assamese), Lipika Singh Darai, The Waterfall (English) interacted with the media.



 

Rima Das, who directed Village Rock Stars, shared her experience about the film. The film is about the children in villages without any resources but they dream high. Though they are out of resources they celebrate their life. “Mumbai experience helped a lot to get the story on screen’ said, Rima Das. The story of the film revolves around the Dhunu, 10 year old girl who lives in remote part of Assam amidst raging depravation. A free spirit, she firmly believes in the power of her grand dreams. Her widowed mother struggles to make ends meet but, despite the poverty, Dhunu is determined to form a rock band with the boys in her village and wants to be the proud owner of a guitar. She remains undeterred in the face of gender discrimination, the lack of support from the boys and a society that threatens to pull her back. 

 



 

Anik Dutta, Director of Benglai non-feature film Meghnadbod Rohosyo said that it is not easy exploring the complex urban relationships through non-feature films. He said that there is a good future of non-feature films in India. The story of Meghnadbod Rohosyo is about a Chingi a mute girl. Her father an Indian army officer loses his life while on duty. Chingi lives with her mother and grandfather nurturing vivid memories of her father, his teachings and the gift of a tri-colored pinwheel that she spends most of her time with. When the statue installed in her father’s memory is demolished, Chingi takes it upon herself to restore her family’s pride. However, a shocking revelation awaits the family.

 

Marathi non-feature film Baluta is about barter system. Ajay Kurane, Director said that the story inspired from WhatsApp Message. Women empowerment is what everybody talks but when it comes to reality it is totally different, said Ajay Kurane. In rural Maharashtra it is never imagined that woman being a barber. Despite all odds Shantabai, accepts the traditional job to meet the both ends. Shantabai, a young woman, mother of four daughters, loses her husband and is on her own without family support. Baluta is her tale of struggle, bravery and most of all, the self-belief of a woman who defies all odds and proves to the world that stereotype is just another word.

 

Rima Das, Director of The Waterfall while sharing her experiences about the non-feature film said, “We are moving away from nature where we belong. There is always a conflict of development and Environment”.  On a visit to his cousin Nilu’s beautiful hill town, city kid Karan immediately takes to the deep forests, he marvels at the bounty of nature in the small town. He soon learns that the waterfall they visited will soon be destroyed to make way for development projects. Deeply disturbed, Karan finds himself in deep contemplation about the conflicting progress of development and importance of conserving nature.

                 ‘Children’s Films in Indian Cinema’ was the discussed on day two of IFFI- 2017 by the panelist Prasoon Joshi, CEO-CBFC; Nitesh Tiwari, Director & Film Maker; Rajiv Chilaka, Founder and Managing Director of Green Gold Animation & Ms Devika Prabhu, Executive director of programming for Disney. The experts of this special panel threw the light on the importance of the making of a film for children and young adults. They also run through the ways in which the sententious strand of cinema can gather heft and a momentum in our rapidly changing times. The state of children’s cinema has witnessed many ups and downs over the years but it has never lost its relevance nor has it lost its appeal as the source of entertainment. This panel discussion was curated by Vani Tripathi, Member, Steering Committee of IFFI 2017 and Mr. Sunit Tandon, Director IFFI 2017.

 Prasoon Joshi, who moderated the panel discussion along with Nitesh Tiwari, Rajiv Chilaka and Devika Prabhu started off brilliantly by pointing out a valid question, that if there is a difference between a film about children and a film for children? Whether the Children’s’ films are about children or for the children?  To which, Nitesh Tiwari replied that, it depends on the content, subject and the intention with which film is made. Further, Mr. Tiwari said that, the movie like ‘Taare Zaameen Par’, focused on education which was portrayed in an entertaining and lighthearted manner. Commercial success and lack of creativity is what’s stopping filmmakers to make movies for kids. It is sad that the production budget is now decided not according to the script but according to who stars in it.” he added.

 



 

On talking about thinking a special way of making films for children, Nitesh added that, the movie ‘Chillar Party’ which he directed was predominantly made thinking, that it will be consumed by kids more than the adult audience but the movie was loved by all. When one makes films thinking more about children, one needs to make the film in a certain way and add certain elements. Further he added that we need to make more films for children but it should also resonate with the people of all age groups.

 Dr Rajiv Chilaka, the Founder and Managing Director of Hyderabad-based Green Gold Animation and the creator of cartoon TV programs including ‘Krishna Cartoon Series’ and ‘Chhota Bheem’, said that, the kids’ world is a fantastic world and expressed happiness that a lot of people have gathered here for a session about children’s cinema. He mentioned that the 50 percent of the television audience is below the age group of 14, so there’s a huge market for children’s content and we should try making more films for everyone, especially children which everyone should enjoy. He added that they have made four animation films and the kids who came to the theatre enjoyed it and the movies got high TRPs.

 The 48th Edition of IFFI will take place till 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa. IFFI is India’s biggest and Asia’s oldest film festival, making it one of the most prestigious in the world.

While Sridevi, one of the Indian film industry's most iconic leading ladies, inaugurated the Indian Panorama section of Asia’s biggest film festival, the International Film Festival of India. A special press conference was today held for the two opening films of India Panoram, Section, ‘Pushkar-Puran’ and ‘Pihu’, was attended by the respective directors Kamal Swaroop and Vinod Kapri and child artist, Myra Vishwakarma.

Piquing the curiosity of everyone in attendance was the film, ‘Pihu’ which revolves around a 2-year-old who fails to wake her unresponsive mother and takes to exploring the spacious apartment looking for food while periodically distracted from her chores by nervous phone calls from her father who is trying to reach his wife. Keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats, the movie showed much promise inciting gasps and laughter as the suspense gradually heightens in the plot.

Talking about the film, director Vinod Kapri said, “Pihu is a special film not because its protagonist is a two-year-old child and also not because she is the only character in the film, but maybe because the whole crew and the child's family lived in the same apartment for a while to get her attuned to the film. It’s a great opportunity to showcase my film at IFFI Goa 2017.” He added that having platform of IFFI 2017 for independent filmmaker like him is a honor and morale booster.



The next opening film also garnered much intrigue as after helming cult film “Om Dar-B-Dar”, filmmaker Kamal Swaroop returned to cinema after three decades with Pushkar-Puran, a film about Lake City Pushkar in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. The movie showcases how in the month of Karthik, the city turns into a mirage-like fair, with villagers, folk artists, musicians, cattles, camels, horses, ferris-wheels and merry-go-rounds.  

Speaking before the screening of the film, director Kamal Swaroop said, “Thank you to everybody, the jury, IFFI organizers. I have liked the festival very much. I am lucky. This is my second opening film in the Panorama.”Further, He told media that as he being a resident at Ajmer, his film is not only emanating from imagination but his own experiences too.

                After unveiling the special edition of FTII Academic Journal ‘Lensight’ at IFFI Goa 2017 on day two (21st November, 2017), Showman of Hindi cinema Subhash Ghai enthralled the film aspirants and students at the masterclass doling out valuable advice to them on honouring their craft and making a mark in their respective fields at IFFI Goa 2017.



 

The veteran filmmaker had the audience in splits during the heart-to-heart conversation at the masterclass discussing his struggle as a filmmaker, facing failure and revealed interesting anecdotes that went into the making of his musical blockbusters including Kalicharan, Vidhata, Khalnayak and Karma among several other subjects.

 



 

Starting the conversation with ‘what next’, the filmmaker touched upon several topics related to his personal and professional life that inspired everybody present at the auditorium. From selling 6 stories to top producers in one year to making Saudagar in 11 months despite controversies on the rift between Dilip Kumar and Rajkumar to stating the fact that 2017 has not been a fruitful year for Hindi cinema, Subhash Ghai’s conversation with the crowd was quite a revelation.

 

The filmmaker has been a regular at IFFI Goa in the past offering his valuable contribution to the festival organisers.

 

The 48th Edition of IFFI is scheduled from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) Pune released a special issue of its quarterly academic journal LENSIGHT in Panaji, Goa today to coincide with the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa.



 

Subhash Ghai, renowned film maker and FTII alumnus launched the October-December 2017 issue of the prestigious journal on film and media which has been standing out for its scholarly content since last 26 years. Bhupendra Kainthola, Director FTII Pune and Amit Tyagi (Dean Films) were present at the launch.

 

""LENSIGHT journal publishes articles and research papers by film scholars, researchers, academicians and various other subject experts in the field from India and abroad. There's a need to have more such journals to broaden and deepen the understanding of cinema"", said Subhash Ghai in his address.

 



 

Addressing the event, Bhupendra Kainthola said, ""The theme that each practitioner resonates with is the universally important question of Reality and Imagination. This is what we deal with in Cinema, where the real challenge lies and also the joy of creation. This makes it a unique exercise in understanding the process, with its pains, joys, sorrows, difficulties in a transparent and vulnerable way, opening an intimate space for dialogue between the makers, and the lovers of cinema who wish to always know more.""

 

Rajula Shah, FTII alumna has guest edited the issue. A sensitive film maker Rajula's work falls in the interstice of poetry, cinema and anthropology. She doodles, writes, makes books, installations, web portals and tends towards the constantly evolving, changing, mutating forms of creative practice.

 

 Says Rajula Shah, ""This being the academic journal of the film school, we have kept it focused on the ‘process’, ‘learning’, the ‘making’ of a film and a filmmaker. For this reason, it becomes imperative that we have the practitioners writing about it rather than the critics or theoreticians. Cinema has so many dimensions, that there is hardly anything that falls outside the domain of a filmmaker. And this issue has tried to project the multi-faceted aspect by inviting diverse voices from Film Direction, to Cinematography, Sound, Music, Art et al.”

 

‘LENSIGHT’ was launched in 1991 initially with a focus on technical articles to enlighten technicians about new technology and equipment used in filmmaking and video productions. It was repositioned in 2008 with emphasis on film-related articles especially on aesthetic values.

 

The special issue has diaries and notebooks of prolific makers, as testimony of their everyday practice. It also has essays, memoirs, articles, specially written. The contributors hail from our FTII's luminous alumni that include expats like Nandini Bedi, and important voices like RV Ramani as also musician of the high stature of Moushumi Bhowmik and even a neuroscientist based in the US. Hansa Thapliyal, Amit Dutta and Payal Kapadia, a current student at FTII whose film THE AFTERNOON CLOUDS was India's only entry to Cannes this summer.

 

The frames running on the edge of both pages are from early cinema and contemporary cinema, a wish to bring in the cinematic movement in to print, a remembering of a pre cinema device, in the manner of a flipbook that delights young and old equally.

                After showcasing the movie, ‘Beyond the Clouds’ at the opening ceremony of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2017, the cast and crew of the movie featuring actors Ishaan Khatter and Malavika Mohanan, producers Punit Goenka (Zee Entertainment Enterprise, MD & CEO), Shareen Mantri, Kishore Arora, Reza Tashakkori and Sujay Kutty (Zee Studios Business Head) and director Majid Majidi attended the press conference of their film on 21st November, 2017. 

‘Beyond the Clouds’ is an extension of Majidi's cinematic beliefs, the roots of which lie in human values, love, friendship and family bonding. 

The film is a story of a brother and sister like Children of Heaven, with the difference being that the siblings are grownups and tackle greater conflicts with the backdrop of the bustling city of Mumbai. The film is a vindication of Majid Majid’s firm view that human emotions have no barriers of language and geography. 

The acclaimed Iranian filmmaker, who is also the recipient of several prestigious awards, has made a film out of this country, an experience which he describes as “one waiting for years to happen”. 

Majid Majidi says, “Working with the exceptionally talented cast and crew of India in ‘Beyond the Clouds’ has been an amazing experience. Ishaan and Malavika has done full justice to their characters and portrayed them very well. The subject of ‘Beyond the Clouds’ has got a universal appeal and I hope the subject resonates with audiences across the globe after its release.” 

Ishaan Khatter informs, “It was a great learning and interesting experience working with all the stalwarts associated with ‘Beyond the Clouds’ including Majidi sir, Anil Mehta sir, Vishal Bhardwaj sir and A R Rahman sir. It’s indeed a strong team to be working with. Mr Majidi has the strong leadership qualities. It is incredibly empowering in the sense that there was so much to learn from all these talented people. For instance, working with Vishal sir and speaking his dialogues was surreal. Everybody worked in tandem with the same goal – to satisfy Majidi sir’s vision as a filmmaker.” 

Sujay Kutty, Zee Studios Business Head, said, “Zee Studios has completed 25 years and it was a great experience collaborating with ‘Beyond the Clouds’ and what you see on screen is something extra ordinary with brilliant artists being part of the film including Vishal Bhardwaj, A R Rahman, Anil Mehta and our lovely cast Ishaan Khatter and Malavika Mohanan. We want to create content which people across the globe would like to see. The opening ceremony was brilliant and people really appreciated our film and we will strive to make such films.” 

Malavika Mohanan said, “When it comes to working with a filmmaker like Majid Majidi, there was nothing to think about. What he brings to the screen is simply outstanding. So it was a no-brainer. I am a lover of cinema and passionate about it. I would like to portray interesting roles on screen and something that would challenge me as an actor. It was a blessing.” 

The 48th Edition of IFFI is scheduled from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.

                The 219th meeting of the Central Board of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) held in New Delhi yesterday under the chairmanship of Union Minister of labour & Employment Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar.



Following where are the key decisions of the Board:-

a)     The Board took note of the 10 requests from ineligible establishments for waiver of damages during the period May 20, 2017 to September 30, 2017 which were earlier rejected by EPFO.

b)    The Central Board started investing in Equity Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from August 2015. The Accounting Policy for valuation and accounting of equity investments were prepared in consultancy with IIM Bangalore.  The observations of the CAG were also incorporated in the accounting policy. The same was approved by the Central Board.

c)   Present decentralized system of EPFO for making payment to its beneficiaries involves higher cost of transactions, delays in recredits in case of failed transaction and does not provide for AADHAAR enabled payments.  Hence, EPFO proposed to move towards the Centralised Payment System using National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) platform.  The benefits of the proposed system are:-

·         Funds will be transferred on the same day to the beneficiaries through NPCI platform.

·         Office may reconcile the transaction status on T+0 basis.  This will result in early recredit in the accounts of beneficiaries in the case of failed transactions.

·         Availability of the facility of AADHAAR enabled transfer of funds.

·         Transaction cost by way of bank charges will also come down.

The Board gave in-principle approval for the same.

The Central Board also took note of the recent IT based initiatives of EPFO for better services to its stakeholders:-

(1)      Online Adhaar Verified UAN allotment to any citizen at Unifed Portal:  Universal Account Number (UAN) is mandatory for filing the returns and depositing the contributions.  However, the establishments face difficulties in seeding Aadhaar details of the employees.  To obviate this difficulty, an open functionality has been introduced through which any citizen / present prospective employee can generate his/her UAN on the basis of Aadhaar and link his KYC details. The registration facility is available at Member Interface in the Unified Portal (https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/).  It being an online facility, there is no need to submit any physical documents.

(2)      Introduction of Online request functionality to EPF Subscribers for correction in Name, DoB and Gender: 

In line with the decision of Government for digital India, a functionality has been developed where member can give online request to  his/her employer at Member Interface in the Unified Portal (https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/) for correction in Name, DoB and Gender. 

EPFO is committed to strengthen the e-governance system to bring more transparency and to provide better services to its stakeholders. EPFO has already launched a number of e-governance initiatives such as Electronic Challan-cum-Return, Member  e-passbook, payment through National Electronic Fund Transfer, Online Registration of Establishments, Mobile governance, Online receipt of claims, Auto transfer of Accounts etc.

                As per the provisions laid down, pensioners under Employees’ Pension Scheme, 1995 are required to submit Life Certificate annually in the month of November each year. From 2016 facility has been provided for submission of Jeevan Parmaan digitally as authentication for proof of identity of the individual pensioners.

In order to obviate the difficulties faced by the pensioners in submission of Jeevan Parmaan in the month of November 2017 following has been decided:

1) Those pensioners who have already submitted Jeevan Parmaan digitally for the previous year need not essentially submit digital Jeevan Parmaan for the current year. If they face any difficulty in doing so, they may submit paper based life certificate to the concerned pension drawing bank branches or can submit Jeevan Parmaan digitally as per their convenience.

2) Those who have not submitted Jeevan Parmaan digitally even once should submit Jeevan Parmaan digitally in the month of November 2017. The facility of submission of Jeevan Parmaan digitally are available in all offices of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), pension disbursing banks and common service centre’s. Further, digital Jeevan Parmaan has been made available in the UMANG App of EPFO.

3) Life Certificate in physical form may be accepted from such pensioners who have genuine reason for non submission of digital Jeevan Parmaan and such reason should be recorded by pensioner while submitting the life certificate.

Suitable instructions to the field offices on above lines have already been circulated for compliance so that no pensioner faces any difficulty in this regard.

                “Our Country has highest youth population in the world and every youth want jobs. Coming generations will not forgive us if urgent steps are not taken in the direction of employment generation”. These views were expressed by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour & Employment, while addressing the experts in a brain storming session on employment generation strategies organized by VV Giri National Labour Institute (VVGNLI) in Noida today. He said our Ministry do not directly creates employment but creates suitable environment to facilitate employers and employees. He further added that our government and Ministry are moving in right direction on the path to skill development and employment generation. He also referred to the historic decision of Demonetisation which has yielded lot of good results during the last one year. Shri Gangwar said beneficiaries of EPFO and ESIC have increased to one crore in the last one year. At the occasion Shri Gangwar also released four publications published by VVGNLI and inaugurated the renovated seminar block of the institute.





Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Smt. M. Sathiyavathy said that 10 million youngsters are added every year in the race to search a job. Unfortunately, many youngsters are lacking skill to get a job in the market. She added that government is constantly trying to fill up this gap. About 1.17 crore youth have been trained in various skills in recent past and 920 job fairs were organized to get these youths placed in industries and institutions. Referring to the important legislation of 26 weeks of maternity leave to pregnant lady workers, she said that many employers are not willing to give this paid leave of 26 weeks. Experts should suggest remedies regarding this also, she added.

Director General, VVGNLI, Dr. H. Srinivas welcomed experts from ILO, NITI Ayog, University of Delhi, Institute of Human Development, Ministry of Agriculture and WCD and other institutions and expressed the hope that some fruitful, practical suggestions will come from the exercise and can be handed over to Ministry of Labour and Employment for further consideration and implementation.

                Following is the text of the speech made by Minister of State for Law & Justice and Corporate Affairs, Sh. P.P. Chaudhary on the occasion of National Law Day:

""We are celebrating 68 years of the adoption of our Constitution – Constitution Day is a fitting occasion to consider the role of the Judiciary in our democracy.

Courts do not have, what Alexander Hamilton called the “power of the sword or the purse”. They draw their strength not from any police power, but from the moral authority of their judgement. Even unpopular decisions are respected because the judiciary is seen as being the ultimate repository of moral authority.

Today’s sessions will aim to analyse the challenges facing judicial functioning, and what is important for the judiciary to continue to retain its moral authority and thereby remain a legitimate and relevant democratic institution"".

JUDICIAL REVIEW

The first session – on “Judicial Review and Parliamentary Democracy” – will address the relationship between the Judiciary and Parliament.

While each of the three branches of government plays its own role, it is important that the role be understood in a constitutional sense to be more of a balance than a check. This institutional balance is key to democracy. There must be a healthy tension between the three branches for democracy to survive, but for democracy to function and to thrive, each branch must also have faith and belief in the other.

When the Executive or Legislature cross constitutional boundaries, the Judiciary’s role is to bring them back within those boundaries. Therefore, by definition, the judiciary’s post is at the boundaries of power, not at its core.

Some people today ask whether the judiciary is in fact beginning to play a double role, substituting Parliamentary judgement with its own. I am not referring now to issues at the boundaries of Parliamentary power but I am referring to questions that fall into the core of Parliamentary power – in the zone of policy. The first session will consider this issue.

COLLEGIUM SYSTEM

The next session is on “Appointments to higher judiciary – constraints of collegium system and the reforms ahead”. In mandating an independent judiciary, our Constitution mandates a guarantee of justice. But this guarantee of justice can only be fulfilled when there is a guarantee of a certain quality of justice. Is our current system of judicial appointments helping fulfil this constitutional guarantee? This is what the session will focus on.

 Not just sceptics, but even supporters of the collegium system admit its flaws. In the recent NJAC decision, even majority judges recognized that all is not well with the collegium system. I am only quoting a majority judge from that decision when I say that the “Collegium system lacks transparency, accountability and objectivity.”

These aspects of transparency and accountability, and whether the collegium system is best suited to provide them, is important to consider and ponder on.

DELAYS IN JUSTICE DELIVERY

The third session focuses on reforms for overcoming delays in justice delivery.

The judiciary has a role in protecting democracy and promoting constitutional government. But it has another role. It is a provider of an essential service to society: and as a supplier of an essential service, it is important to ask whether the consumers of that service are satisfied.

Society comes to its courts for remedies and resolution. If the courts are not perceived to be a true form of recourse, of remedy or resolution, society suffers. When society does not find remedies in its court, or when it begins to believe that a recourse to court is impractical or inaccessible, that is when vigilantism and corruption begin and the rule of law erodes. There is no sense of justice when common citizens are given judgements several years after the cause.

Nothing is more important today, and no single reform is desired more widely, than the reduction of judicial delays.

It is worth considering what creative solutions there can be to minimize judicial delays. One such solution may be that of “pre-litigation mediation”. Many jurisdictions around the world have successfully reduced litigation and court backlogs by offering dispute resolution through this process. In order to promote “pre-litigation mediation”, it may be necessary to institutionalise this process and create and enforce standards to help it achieve its objective. This can be done by establishing a professional body of mediators, whose qualification, standards, and regulation may be prescribed by a statute.

Another aspect worthy of consideration may be the reduction of the administrative work imposed on our judges today so that they may spend their valuable time on judicial work. One example of this is the administration of legal aid, which currently requires the involvement of the judiciary, whereas the provision of legal aid should best be left to the Executive as the Executive already has the means and the reach to administer legal aid.

JUDICIAL ACTIVISM

Finally, the eminent participants will also deliberate on the “Scope of Judicial Powers and judicial activism”.Judicial activism by itself is a necessary outcome of judicial independence, and may be lauded especially when it is undertaken to protect those who may not otherwise have ready access to justice. But quite apart from this, is another species of judicial activism where the judiciary is also stepping into areas which are strictly speaking in the realm of policy.

 It is a fundamental principle of governance that decisions should, as far as possible, be predictable and not disruptive. When judicial activism and review wades into policymaking, sometimes its consequences can be disruptive. This needs to be avoided if possible.

CONCLUSION

In the theme of each of these sessions is a common thread – that of accountability. If judicial independence is a pillar of our democracy, then judicial accountability is the base of that pillar. Without accountability there can be no legitimacy.

Those in government and those outside it are both fully aware of the fickle nature of power, and are fully aware that a strong and independent judiciary is necessary for everyone. We must do everything possible to preserve the moral authority and legitimacy of our judiciary.

I believe that deliberations and discussions during the celebrations would help us in strengthening our constitutional values. I look forward to the deliberations.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the revision in the salaries, gratuity, allowances, pension etc. of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts and retired Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts. It follows the implementation of recommendations of the 7thCentral Pay Commission in respect of Civil Servants. 

The approval will pave the way for necessary amendments in the two laws viz. Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958 and High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954, which govern the salaries of Chief Justice of India (CJI), Judges of Supreme Court of India, Chief Justices and all Judges of High Courts. 

The increase in the salary and allowances etc. will benefit 31 Judges of Supreme Court of India (including the CJI) and 1079 Judges(including the Chief Justices) of High Courts. Besides, approximately 2500 retired Judges will also be benefited on account of revision of pension/gratuity etc. 

Arrears on account of revised salaries, gratuity, pension and family pension w.e.f 01.01.2016 will be paid as one time lump sum payment. 

Background: 

Salaries, gratuity, pension, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court are governed by the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958. Salaries etc. of Judges of High Courts are governed by High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954. An amendment in the Acts is required whenever there is any proposal for revision of salaries/pension gratuity, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts. Therefore, Government proposes to move a Bill in the Parliament in the ensuing Session for amendment in the relevant Acts for giving effect to the revision of salaries and allowances.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved continuation of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary beyond 12th Five Year Plan i.e. from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2020 to be implemented in a Mission Mode through National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms with an estimated outlay of Rs.3,320 crore.

The Cabinet also approved setting up of an on-line monitoring system with geo-tagging by the Department of Justice enabling data collection on progress, completion of court halls and residential units under construction, including for future projects as well as better asset management and formulation of norms and specification of court halls and residential units to be constructed under Scheme for implementation throughout the country for future.

Benefits from the Scheme: 

The Scheme will increase the availability of suitable number of Court Halls and Residential Accommodations for Judges / Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts all over the country including at District, Sub-District, Taluka, Tehsil and Gram Panchayat and Village levels. This will help in improving the functioning and performance of the Judiciary across the country in reaching out to every citizen.

Financial assistance:

The central assistance is provided to the State Governments / UT Administrations under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary for construction of court halls and residential units for Judicial Officers / Judges of District and Subordinate Courts. The funds sharing pattern for Centre and State is 60:40 in respect of States other than North Eastern and Himalayan States. The funds sharing pattern is 90:10 in respect of North Eastern and Himalayan States; and 100% in respect of Union Territories. This will help for completion of on-going projects for construction of 3,000 court halls and 1,800 residential units for judicial officers of District and Subordinate Courts.

Monitoring of the Scheme

An on-line monitoring system will be set up by the Department of Justice enabling data collection on progress, completion of court halls and residential units under construction as well as better asset management.

Regular meetings of the Monitoring Committee may be organised in various States with State Chief Secretaries and PWD officials to enable speedy and good construction. It may also be monitored if the funds released by the Centre are released without delay onward to PWD by the State Governments.

Background:

Central Government augments the resources of the States in this regard through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for development of infrastructure facilities for Judiciary which is being implemented since 1993-94. The central assistance is provided to the State Governments / UT Administrations under the Scheme for construction of court halls and residential units for Judicial Officers / Judges of District and Subordinate Courts.

                A high level delegation of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) comprising its President, Prof. Qiuming Cheng; Prof. S C Finney, Secretary General; and Prof. H Kitazato, Treasurer visited India during 20-24 November 2017 to discuss the preparatory aspects of the 36th International Geological Congress (IGC) to be held in Delhi, India in the year 2020.

Described as the Olympics of Geosciences, the IGCs are held quadrennially under the aegis of the IUGS through a process of global bidding. India won the bid in 2012 at Brisbane, Australia to host the Congress in 2020. The win is a remarkable achievement as the event makes a come back to the Indian soil after nearly 6 decades much to the excitement of the entire geoscientific community.

The event is being jointly funded by the Ministry of Mines and Ministry of Earth Sciences with the active support of the Indian National Science Academy (INSA), and the Science Academies of the other neighbouring co-host countries, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The delegation, during its visit, inspected the India Expo Mart Limited, the venue for the event and expressed its satisfaction over the facilities available and its convenient location. The team described the state-of-the-art Centre as impressive, and equipped in all respects to host the mega Congress which has conventionally an attendance to the tune of 6000 delegates.

The Government today announced the trajectory for achieving its targets of commissioning 175 GW of Renewable Energy (RE), 100 GW of solar generating capacity and 60 GW of wind power, by 2022.    

Addressing the gathering, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy , Shri Raj Kumar Singh said that there was a long pending demand form the Industry to declare the RE roadmap of the Government. Hence, today with the declaration of this trajectory, the Government has clearly spelt out its plan of speeding up of RE installation in the country and strengthening the RE manufacturing base in India. 

Shri Singh informed that to encourage the Make in India in RE sector, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) is working out the scheme and going to issue an Expression of Interest (EoI) to the Industry, for establishing domestic Manufacturing facilities to the tune of 20GW, in the near future. Further, the MNRE is exploring innovative ways to achieve additional installed RE capacity through Floating Solar Power Plants over dams , Offshore Wind Energy Systems and Hybrid Solar-Wind power systems, which may provide over 10GW additional capacity. The MNRE team of experts has already surveyed the Bhakra Nangal dam for floating solar power plants and off-shore Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for wind power plants, the Minister added. 

Expressing confidence of comfortably achieving a rather conservative RE target of 175GW by 2022 and even exceed it, along with providing 24x7 affordable, clean and efficient power for all, Shri Singh said that all these targets would be positively achieved with the cooperation of the States in ensuring that their power utilities/ DISCOMS remain financially viable. The Centre has provided all the required support, including funds under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), to the States to ensure 24x7 Power for All by strengthening the intra-State transmission networks and by ensuring mandatory presence of metered connections. The Ministry is in talks with the States to ensure 100% metered connections through Smart/Pre-paid meters, Shri Singh added. 

Talking about issues in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), Shri Singh made it very clear that the sanctity of the PPAs have to be ensured and they would have to be mandatorily honoured. The Ministry is in constant talks with State Governments, including Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, to ensure the same. Talking about the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), the Minister that these obligations are mandatory and need to be adhered to strictly. 

Elaborating the RE Development road map , Shri Anand Kumar, Secretary MNRE, said that for achieving 100 GW solar power target by 2022, the Ministry, along with the States, would lay out bids for ground mounted solar parks for 20 GW in 2017-18, out of which 3.6 GW have already been bid out, 3 GW will be bid out in December 2017, 3 GW will be bid out in January 2018, 5 GW in February 2018 and 6 GW in March 2018.  30 GW will be bid out in 2018-19 and 30 GW in 2019-20.  

Further, Shri Kumar informed that against the target of 60 GW for wind power, 32 GW have already been commissioned.   The Central Government in participation with the State Governments intends to issue bids of cumulative capacity of about 8 GW this year. Out of this, 5 GW (including present 2 GW) have already been bid out, 1500-2000 MW will be bid out in January 2018 and 1500-2000 MW in March 2018. A total of 10 GW will be bid out in the financial year 2018 and 10 GW in 2019, leaving a margin of 2 years for commissioning of projects. Further adding to this, Shri Kumar informed that the Ministry would soon be issuing the Wind Bidding Guidelines. 

Shri Kumar also said that with wind power tariffs becoming competitive and State DISCOMs encouraged to buy more of Renewable Energy power, the Government has doubled the auction capacity for the third national level wind auction from 4GW last year to around 9GW in the current year. Regarding clarity on GST rates on Solar panels, Shri Kumar said that the MNRE is in talks with the Ministry of Finance and in the next 7-10 days all the issues would be resolved. 

The present scheme of Wind Power Auction is for setting up of 2000 MW Wind Power Project connected to Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS). The bidder can bid for a minimum capacity of 50 MW and maximum up to 400 MW.  The projects under this scheme are expected to be commissioned towards the end of 2019.  

On the occasion, Power Sale Agreements (PSA) for purchase of wind power under second wind auction with States were also signed with Solar Energy Corporation of India with utilities of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Punjab, Goa and Odisha. The reverse auction for SECI-II wind bid was conducted on 4th October 2017, which resulted in very competitive tariff of Rs.2.64/2.65 per unit.   

  It may be mentioned that the winners of SECI II wind bid namely Renew Power (250 MW at Rs.2.64/unit), Orange (200 MW at Rs.2.64/unit), Inox (250 MW at Rs.2.65/unit), Green Infra (250 MW at Rs.2.65/unit) and Adani Green (50 MW at Rs.2.65/ unit) would be setting up wind power plants in states of Gujarat, TN and MP to sell power to these utilities.  PPAs with these winners are expected to be signed shortly.   

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Praveen Kumar, Additional Secretary MNRE, Shri K.S. Popli, CMD IREDA, Shri J.S. Swain, MD SECI and other senior officers of the Ministry and State Governments.

                A Curtain Raiser Event for the Founding Ceremony of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was held at Bonn, Germany yesterday.

Speaking at the event, Shri Anand Kumar, Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India hoped that, in the spirit of affirmative action, developed countries will earmark a percentage of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) towards solar energy projects in developing countries. He suggested that Multilateral Development Banks and other financial institutions provide wholehearted support for solar projects through low cost finance, and research & technology institutions worldwide try their utmost to bring the cost of solar power and storage within the reach of all. Shri Kumar also invited corporates and other institutions to support solar energy development and deployment in every possible manner.

Recalling that the ISA initiative is the vision of Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Kumar reaffirmed Indian Government’s continued support for the ISA. He also spoke about the Government plans to increase the share of renewable energy in India’s energy mix, especially towards achieving cumulative installed renewable power capacity of 175GW by 2022.

Secretary, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, Shri C.K. Mishra, underlined the need for visualising solar energy in the context of sustainable development goals. He emphasised upon the need for arranging technologies, finance and capacity building for solar energy projects, as well as for developing storage technologies. He also suggested that there is a need to work in the areas of renewable power evacuation and application of off-grid solar energy.

Interim Director General of the ISA, Shri Upendra Tripathy, informed that ISA will become a treaty-based international intergovernmental organisation on 6 December 2017. 44 countries have already signed the ISA treaty, and many more are set to join. He spoke on the ISA’s three ongoing programmes: facilitating affordable finance for solar, scaling up solar applications for agriculture, and promoting solar mini-grids in Member Nations. The discussions also covered the ISA’s Common Risk Mitigation Mechanism (CRMM) project, aimed at de-risking investments into solar energy projects in developing countries, and thereby, encouraging flow of funds into the sector.

Speaking at the occasion, H.E. Ségolène Royal, Special Envoy for the implementation of the ISA, Government of France, emphasised upon five key points to accelerate global solar deployment: setting concrete goals, developing and leveraging common tools, enhancing projects, establishing decentralised PV solutions, and forging new partnerships that capitalise on complementary capabilities.

The ISA was jointly launched on 30 November 2015 by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, and then-President of France, H.E. François Hollande, on the side lines of the UNFCCC Conference of Parties 21 (CoP21) at Paris, France. The ISA is a treaty-based alliance of 121 prospective solar-rich Member Nations situated fully or partially between the Tropics, and aims at accelerating development and deployment of solar energy globally.

                The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) today recommended convening of Winter Session of Parliament this year from December 15, 2017 to January 5, 2018, subject to exigencies of government business. This was informed by the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Shri Ananthkumar to media persons after the meeting of CCPA.

Shri Ananthkumar further stated that the ensuing Winter Session will have a total of 14 sittings over a duration of 22 days.

The meeting was chaired by Union Minister for Home Affairs Shri Rajnath Singh to discuss legislative agenda for the coming session of Parliament.

Talking to media persons, Shri Ananthkumar noted that it is not unprecedented that the schedule of the Parliament Session has been decided so as to avoid any overlap with the Assembly Elections in the States. This practice has been followed on many occasions by different Governments in the past. Shri Ananthkumar appealed to all Political Parties for fruitful and constructive discussions on important Bills and ensure smooth functioning of both the Houses of the Parliament.

Answering a question on Triple Talaq & the National Commission for Backward Classes, Shri Ananthkumar stated that it is a strong desire of the people of India that Parliament should legislate on these two important issues and the Government is committed to respond to this desire.

Three Bills are to be taken up in the coming Winter session to replace three Ordinances viz.,

1. The Goods & Services Tax (Compensation to States) Ordinance, 2017 (promulgated on 02.09.17)

2. Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017

3. Indian Forest (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017

Parliament will also discuss the Supplementary Demands for Grants in this Winter Session.

The areas of intersection between the CIC and the CVC were dealt with in the lecture delivered by Shri Mathur, explaining the traditional roots of ethics and probity in public service. The experience of Western countries with the concept of the Right to Information/Freedom of Information was explained in detail. Shri Mathur said that more than 100 countries comprising about 78 percent of the world’s population is covered by such legislation. 

He said that some areas where transparency could help in improving governance include tender committee deliberations and decisions regarding major contracts; defence procurement processes, from framing of specifications to procurement decisions; ownership and possession of land; and settlement dues of retiring employees. Shri Mathur further said, a case was made for inclusion of a clause for transparency and accountability in all laws being formulated. 

Other suggestions for improving transparency and accountability included digitization of all cutting edge service delivery processes; digitization of records; RTI appeals and public grievances to be used as an input into improvement of organizations as well as for vigilance; data mining; and suo moto disclosure by government agencies. Shri Mathur expressed the need for some preventive vigilance projects to be implemented in selected organizations on a pilot basis, for improvement of the working of organizations. 

Vigilance Commissioners Shri Rajiv and Dr. TM Bhasin were present on the occasion. 

The lecture was also attended by full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR as well as CMDs, Directors and other officers of Government Ministries / Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Nationalized Banks, and other Organizations.

                The Central Information Commission (CIC) is organising its 12th Annual Convention on ‘Right to Information’ on December 06, 2017 here. The Vice President Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu will inaugurate the Convention and deliver the inaugural address at the Annual Convention.

 The CIC had last held its Annual Convention on 7th and 8th November last year. The Convention is held to commemorate the inception of the Right to Information Act, 2005 and takes stock of the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) Act around the country. The Convention is attended by all State Information Commissions besides stakeholders from all across the country.

 This year the Convention follows two seminars held in May and July this year, to discuss ‘Implementation of the RTI Act, 2005’ and ‘Land Records and RTI Act’ respectively.

 The CIC has invited well researched original presentations, including case studies from academicians, practitioners, researchers, NGOs/civil society groups, students and other stakeholders to cover three subjects namely ‘Suo-motu disclosures’, ‘Record keeping’ and ‘Emerging issues in implementation of RTI Act’ for the Convention.

 The interested persons have been requested to send presentations to Joint Secretary (Law) in the Commission along with the information about the full name and the contact details of the presenter. The presentations may be submitted to jslaw-cic[at]gov[dot]in before November 30, 2017, specifying the subject as “Seminar on Implementation of RTI Act, 2005”.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

 



 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 

1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during October, 2017 was 1889.67 TMT which is 3.88% lower than the monthly target but 0.93% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-October, 2017 was 13191.66 TMT which is 1.79% lower than target for the period but 2.25% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:

Ø Natural decline/increase in water cut in wells of matured fields of western offshore and less than estimated production from wells in SHP and NQO area due to de-optimization of wells. 

Ø Production from B-193 cluster in western offshore restricted due to high back pressure in B-193 export pipeline due to choking in the line. 

Ø Production from NBP field in western offshore affected due ESP related issues. 

Ø Frequent power shut downs in Mehsana, Ahmedabad & Assam hampered artificial lift operations.

Ø Unexpected ceasure of more flowing wells in Mehsana Asset.

Ø Wells closed for cluster drilling/ rig movements in Assam and Ahmedabad.

 

1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during October, 2017 was 286.90 TMT which is 9.50% lower than monthly target but 4.09% higher than production in October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-October, 2017 was 1980.50 TMT which is 9.53% lower than target for the period but 5.32% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.

Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

 

1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2017 was 861.68 TMT which is 4.58% lower than the monthly target and 4.57% lower than October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2017 was 5890.83 TMT which is 5.48% lower than target for the period and 6.98% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Around 120 wells are closed due to various reasons like high water cut, require work-over-job, etc. in RJ-ON-90/1

Ø  Bhagyam production is improving over last few months but reservoir is still underperforming vis-à-vis by Management Committee approved profile.

Ø  Production stopped from Guda and Kaameshwari-W due to non-availability of tankers from July 2017 onwards

Ø  Mangala production hampered due to power fluid pump tripping during Oct’17.

Ø  CY-ONN-2002/2: Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.

Ø  CB-ONN-2004/2: Underperformance of wells.

 

Natural Gas

2.             Natural gas production during October, 2017 was 2808.82 MMSCM which is 4.28% lower than the target for the month but 1.95% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-October, 2017 was 19221.73 MMSCM which is 5.13% lower than target for the period but 4.02% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of October, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-October, 2017 was 13693.21 MMSCM which is 1.27% lower than the cumulative target and 8.45% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.Restricted gas production from B- series cluster due to non-availability one Process gas Compressor at  MNP Complex under MH Asset.

 

2.2        Natural gas production by OIL during October, 2017 was 243.25 MMSCM which is 3.55% lower than the monthly target and 1.03% lower than October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-October, 2017 was 1724.51 MMSCM which is 1.80% lower than the cumulative target but 0.25% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Shut down of few non-associated gas well at various instances due to environmental problem.

Ø  Inability of customers to offtake gas from time to time due to plant breakdown at customer end.

 

2.3        Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2017 was 547.60 MMSCM which is 18.68% lower than the monthly target and 3.31% lower when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2017 was 3804 MMSCM which is 17.96% lower than the cumulative target and 7.94% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC).

Ø  Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field and 1 well in MA Field in KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL).

Ø  Sohagpur West: Underperformance of CBM wells. Sales hampered due to IFFCO Unit partial Shutdown (RIL).

Ø  Raniganj East (CBM Block): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs (ESSAR).

Ø  AAP-ON-94/1: Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML. Well shutdown due to low consumer demand during October, 2017 (HOEC).

                A consultative workshop on New National Policy on Biofuels & Pradhan Mantri Ji- Van Yojana (VGF for 2nd Generation Ethanol Bio Refineries) was organised here today by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for inviting suggestions for drafting a suitable roadmap for Biofuels in India. The workshop was organised as the government is promoting Biofuels with an objective to reduce dependency on import of crude oil, savings in foreign exchange, provide better remuneration for the farmers and address growing environment concerns in the light of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Commitment at COP 21. 

During the day long workshop 5 Working Groups on 1-G Ethanol, 2-G Ethanol, Biodiesel, Municipal Solid Wastes to Fuel & Bio-CNG comprising of all the stakeholders (producers, bankers and buyers) deliberated issues related to their segment in detail and came up with many constructive suggestions and inputs. 

Minister of Petroleum and natural Gas, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in his speech said that 1-G and 2-G Ethanol, Biodiesel, MSW to Fuel and Bio-CNG together with Methanol(DME) have huge potential in augmenting economic growth, generating employment and doubling farmers’ income. He said this will be instrumental in achieving the target of 10% import reduction by 2022 set by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

He said, during the workshop many constructive suggestions related to feedstock management, technology, capacity augmentation, fiscal incentives and Supply chain management were received. Shri Pradhan said he is happy to share that all the technologies are indigenously developed in India and will immensely boost Make In India campaign.

                Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan inaugurated a first-of-its-kind Petrochemical Investors Conclave in Bhubaneswar today in the presence of Shri Shashi Bhusan Behera, Minister of Finance and Excise, Govt. of Odisha, Shri Prafulla Samal, Minister of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Govt. of Odisha, and other dignitaries. Over 750 delegates attended the Conclave. 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Pradhan said that India’s petrochemicals sector is going through a golden period, with growth rates of 14-15% per annum. Odisha, with ready availability of raw material from Paradip Refinery and other units from all over the country, skilled, low-cost manpower, port infrastructure & rail connectivity and a large regional market, must fully utilise the opportunity to create investment opportunities in the downstream industries such as Plastic Park and Textiles Park in the State. 

Highlighting the developmental vision of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for Eastern India, Shri Pradhan said that accelerated development of Eastern States is one of the top priorities of the Govt of India. While the per capita consumption of plastics in India is only 10 kg as compared to the world average of 32 kg, it is much lower at 5 kg in Eastern India, he said. The Petrochemical Investors Conclave has been organised to create a new inspiration and a new eco-system for the growth of petrochemicals sector in the State of Odisha, and generate wealth for a new generation of entrepreneurs, while at the same time creating employment opportunities for the youth of the State on a large scale, he said. 

Sri Pradhan complimented Indian Oil Corporation and IDCO (Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha) for signing an MoU at the Conclave to collaborate in the setting up of a Plastics Park at Paradip. IndianOil is setting up a 700 KTA (kilo tonnes per annum) Polypropylene unit at Paradip Refinery, to be commissioned in 2018, to serve as a mother plant for downstream polymer/plastics ancillary units. 

Shri Pradhan also complimented IOC and Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai for signing on MoU to set up a campus of ICT in Bhubaneswar to be hosted by IOC. 

Indian Oil Corporation has signed another MoU with MCPI Ltd. for setting up a Textiles Park in Odisha. With the coming up of an MEG (Mono Ethylene Glycol) Unit at Paradip Refinery and availability of PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) in the East, the polyester downstream industry can flourish very well in Eastern Region as well, Shri Pradhan said. By achieving synergy of cotton fibre with polyester fibre to promote and popularise synthetic textiles, the Textiles Park will primarily benefit Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs), with employment  potential of around 22 lakhs, he added. 

Shri Pradhan hoped that the Conclave, with the theme “Purvodaya - The Dawn of New Investment Opportunities in Eastern India,” would serve as an effective platform for young investors to interact with business leaders of the petrochemicals industry, Government functionaries, financial institutions, supply chain professionals as well as incubators in the academia at one place. He complimented the organisers for setting up an Investor Facilitation Lounge to clarify issues raised by prospective investors on the spot. 

Shri Pradhan announced that CIPET will set up a technology service centre in Paradip to support the development of Plastic units there. 

Shri Pradhan also inaugurated an exhibition set up at the Conclave venue. The exhibition, with over 35 exhibitors, focussed on how the petrochemicals sector caters to a number of other sectors, by providing raw material for clothing, housing, construction, furniture, automobiles, household items, toys, agriculture, horticulture, irrigation and packaging to medical appliances. 

Mr. Rajeev Kapoor, Secretary, Dept. of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC), Govt. of India, who also spoke on the occasion, said that the Department is in the process of developing a master plan for the petrochemicals sector in India to serve as a road map for the next 15-20 years. 

Mr. Tony Potter, Vice President (Asia Pacific), IHS Market, in his presentation in the inaugural session, said that India’s polymers demand is projected to grow from 13 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) currently to 55-60 MMTPA by the year 2040. Therefore, it is very important that the country’s investments in petrochemical plants keep pace with the rising demand to avoid imports in the coming years, he said. 

Petrochemicals can be a major national economic driver, according to Mr. Vipul Tuli, CEO, Sembcorp India. Looking into the future, petrochemicals will not only be an attractive but a crucial and profitable growth area for Indian refiners, he added. 

Prof. GD Yadav, Vice Chancellor, Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) , Mumbai, in his presentation, elaborated on the scope of chemical and petrochemical industries in Eastern India and the role of academic institutions in nurturing the entrepreneurs and acting as incubators for promising start-ups. 

Earlier, welcoming the gathering, Mr. Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IndianOil, said that the oil industry in India is going in for Refinery-Petrochemicals integration on a big scale to capitalise on the huge opportunities available both in India and abroad. This would lead to assured refinery product uptake, assured feedstock availability, major savings in investments in view of shared utilities, infrastructure and logistics, and resultant savings in operating costs, leading to improved GRMs. 

Senior officials of the Ministries of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Chemicals & Fertilisers, Government of India; CEOs of oil & gas sector companies; and other dignitaries are participating in the event with a host of eminent speakers making presentations during the conclave.

                The Government of India has been making concerted efforts to reduce vehicular emissions and improve fuel efficiencywith an aim to reduce the carbon footprints and keep a healthy environment. India has followed the regulatory pathway for fuel quality and vehicle emissions standards termed as Bharat Stage (BS).

The Ministry of Petroleum and natural Gas has successfully introduced the BS-IV grade transportation fuels across the country w.e.f April 1st 2017. With the launch of BS-IV grade fuel, a new era of clean transportation fuels has begun which will benefit all citizens of our country by substantially reducing pollution levels. Migration to BS-IV grade fuels shows India’s resolve to cut down emissions.

As a next step in this direction, Government in consultation with stakeholders has decided to meet international best practices by leapfrogging directly from BS-IV to BS-VI grade by 1stApril, 2020, skipping BS-V altogether. Oil refining companies are making huge investments in fuel up gradation projects to produce the BS-VI grade fuels.

Taking into account the serious pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas,Petroleum Ministry in consultation with Public Oil Marketing Companies has decided for preponement of BS-VI grade auto fuels in NCT of Delhi w.e.f 01.04.2018 instead of 01.04.2020. OMCs have also been asked to examine the possibility of introduction of BS-VI auto fuels in the whole of NCR area w.e.f 01.04.2019.

This measure is expected to help mitigate the problem of air pollution in NCT of Delhi and surrounding areas.

                A first of its kind premier Cyclothon event was flagged off from New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium today. Organized under the dynamic leadership of, Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, the Cyclothon attracted around 5000 participants from all walks of life including officials from various Ministries and the Oil Industry, Sports personalities, Celebrity star Farhan Akhtar, school and college children cycling professionals, amateurs and housewives. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, himself lead the 5 km Green Ride amidst great excitement and fan-fare to create awareness for cycle.

The genesis of this Cyclothon lay in Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeal to people in his monthly radio show Mann Ki Baat about avoiding the use of petrol & diesel for one day in the week to conserve fuels and contribute towards Nation building.  The promotion of cycling through this event is aimed at instilling socio-environmental consciousness among citizens towards the larger aim of conserving foreign exchange on fuel imports.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that benefits of cycling are not only limited to protect environment or fuel conservation but it also carries huge health and fitness dividends. He further said that judicious use of various forms of energy and its conservation is a matter of vital importance to all of us for the betterment of our society and healthy environment. He said that conservation is a collective responsibility of all of us. It will be possible only when the industries, individual citizens, organizations, Oil Companies and the Government share a collective responsibility of petroleum conservation to conserve the available resources of energy and create a cleaner environment for the future generations.

Shri Pradhan appealed to all citizens to join in the movement for conserving the finite petroleum resources through practicing simple, easily implementable tips while using petroleum products in cooking, transport, agriculture and industries to extract maximum utilization and efficiency. It also helps us to save money and mitigate the adverse social, economic and environmental impacts associated with oil production and consumption which include air pollution, global warming, water pollution, dependence on import etc. Minister urged to all citizens to come together and work for building a nation that is green, environmentally clean and pollution free.

Based on the distance to be covered, the Cyclothon featured four categories – Elite (Men – 45 km/women-27 km), Amateur (27 km), Open and the popular Green Ride. While the Elite and Amateur categories were for serious cyclists, the 9 km Open and the 5 km Green Rides allowed participants the experience the joy of cycling, while promoting fuel conservation, with the underlying message of reducing excessive dependency on oil for a cleaner and greener environment.

The winner in the Elite (Men’s) category was Satbir Singh, while the Elite Women’s championship was won by T Manorama Devi. Over 4500 cyclists participated in the Green ride amidst an atmosphere of gaiety and revelry, with almost all comfortably completing the 5 km stretch. 

The Cyclothon under the banner of Saksham Pedal Delhi was organized by Petroleum Conservation & Research Association (PCRA), and supported by the oil companies viz. IOCL, BPCL, HPCL, ONGC, GAIL, OIL, MRPL, CPCL, NRL and IGL with technical guidance from Cycling Federation of India. Another 76 such cyclothons are planned Pan-India over the next 2 months to sensitize the country to adopt the ideology of conservation for a greener environment.

                Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan concluded 2-day visit to Bangkok today where he participated in the 7th Asian Energy Ministers’ Round Table organised by International Energy Forum (IEF). India is the current Chair of the IEF which is the largest inter-governmental organisation in the field of oil and gas comprising 72 member countries, accounting for 90% of global supply and demand of oil and gas. Members include developing, developed, OPEC, Non-OPEC and G20 countries. 18 of the G20 countries are members of IEF. 

During the visit, Shri Pradhan met his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Thailand, Bahrain, Brunei, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Kuwait, Yemen and other countries. Speaking at a Plenary session on Natural Gas, he highlighted the importance of overcoming market and policy hurdles and move to a flexible, transparent and non-discriminatory global LNG trading regime which would expedite ushering in the golden age of gas. He also highlighted efforts of the government to move to a gas based economy and the avenues for FDI in building infrastructure for gas including LNG terminals, pipelines, CGD etc. He highlighted the unprecedented leap of 30 places made by India in the ease of doing business and also how PM Ujjwala Scheme can be a model to be adopted in developing countries of Asia and Africa. 

Minister Pradhan held a detailed bilateral meeting with the Saudi Energy Minister Mr. KHALID AL-FALIH. The Saudi Minister congratulated for India gaining 30 positions in World Bank Ease of Doing Business index. The two Ministers reviewed entire gamut of oil and gas cooperation between the two countries. 

Shri Pradhan met Mr. U WIN KHIANG, Minister of Energy and Electricity of Myanmar. He expressed keenness to closely collaborate with India and learn from Indian experience on meeting consumer requirement of petroleum products. 

Shri Pradhan invited the Ministerial counterparts to attend the IEF Ministerial meeting which India will host in New Delhi on 10-12 April, 2018. The event is expected to be attended by above 50 energy ministers, heads of international organizations like OPEC, IEA, IGU and CEOs of Global oil majors. This would be the largest congregation in the oil and gas sector at the Ministerial level. 

The Minister visited a Skill Development Centre in Bangkok. He also addressed the India-Thai Chamber of Commerce,a 50-year-old prestigious body, where he elaborated the economic successes of last 40 months and PrimeMinister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of New India. He appealed the Indian origin business persons to remain connected to India through whichever way possible.

                Following is the text of the speech titled “Natural Gas : Overcoming Market and Policy Hurdles to the Golden Age of Gas” delivered by Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan at the Plenary Session of 7th Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable at Bangkok, Thailand on 2st November, 2017.  

“I welcome all the participants to this deliberation on natural gas. Five years ago, in 2012 the International Energy Agency had predicted that Natural Gas is poised to enter a golden age.  I believe that Natural Gas, despite being a clean and green fuel with significant potential, is yet to achieve its rightful place in global energy markets. The main obstacles are lack of adequate infrastructure, market imperfections and uncompetitive practices which prevent global population from fully benefitting from the benefits of gas. 

Coming to India, our gas uptake is less 6.5% of India’s primary energy basket against a global average of more than 24%. Government of India has envisioned to increase the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030.  

India is currently the world’s fourth-largest importer of LNG, behind Japan, South Korea and China. Last year, India imported approximately 19 Million metric tons of LNG, an increase of around 15% over the previous year. India also has domestic gas production of almost the same amount. Fertilizer, Power & City Gas Distribution are the three main sectors which contribute to the natural gas demand in India. In coming years, industrial sectors such as refinery and petrochemicals, ceramics and glass, cement, steel and sponge iron, paints and dyes, chemicals and auto manufacturing are expected to give a boost to natural gas demand in the country. 

Friends, we have taken several far-reaching measures in India to increase domestic production of gas and also to promote the usage of gas. We have introduced pricing and marketing freedom for gas producers in future exploration bidding rounds. India is developing a Natural Gas Trading Exchange where both imported LNG and domestically produced gas can be traded. We are looking to increase the consumption of natural gas through policy measures in each micro segment of consumption. 

We are expanding the LNG re-gasification capacity on both East and West Coast of India. With additional six new re-gas terminals, we are targeting to increase our LNG regas capacity to above 50 MMTPA by 2022. We are working to develop National Gas Grid by constructing an additional 15,000 kms of Natural Gas Pipelines. India is aggressively scaling up its City Gas Distribution networks. We are also preparing a road map for using imported LNG, as a fuel for railways, Coastal shipping, inland navigation and long-haul road transportation. 

In this meeting of Energy Ministers from Asia, I will like to mention that India, as a regional economic hub, is also keen to develop a South Asian gas grid connecting important neighbours such as Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, etc.  Indian companies are also trying out innovative models like small scale LNG to cater to countries like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

Indian companies have signed long-term contracts for around 22 MMTPA from different supply sources across world such as Qatar, Australia, Russia, USA etc. They have signed contracts linked to different indices such as Henry Hub, crude oil index etc. In order to reduce the delivered cost of LNG to Indian market, Indian importers have adopted innovative approaches like time swap of volumes, destination swaps and contract on Free on Board basis. 

The global natural gas market is undergoing a major transformation driven by new supplies coming from the United States, Australia and Qatar are also ramping up their production while new suppliers such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Egypt, Israel, Canada and Cyprus are expected to enter the LNG market in the coming years. It is expected that more than 100 MMTPA of new liquefaction capacity is expected to come on-stream in the period 2017-2020, mainly from Australia and the US. With this, all industry players will need to adjust their operating models. They should expect softer prices, more short-term trades, and demands for contractual flexibility. 

Let me turn to Asian markets which are most relevant for this event.  Although Asia is the largest natural gas-consuming region and accounts for 70% of global LNG imports, the region lacks a transparent LNG pricing benchmark. Asian LNG consumers have historically relied on long-term contracts to guarantee the security of supply because they lack indigenous natural gas resources and have limited access to pipeline trade. 

Globally, we are seeing winds of change. The traditional ways of doing business, based on destination-restricted, oil-indexed long-term contracts are gradually disappearing. These are now making room for enhanced flexibility and interconnectivity, promoting a more liquid, competitive and transparent marketplace. In our view, in today’s oversupplied market with increasing number of exporting countries, it is important for producers to understand the perspective of consumers, demand centres and the changes that have taken place in these demand centres. Many buyers have also started insisting the sellers to provide for destination flexibility so that the LNG may be delivered to different terminals. 

Two weeks back, I was in Tokyo attending the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference where Japan announced that it will invest US 10 billion dollars to expand the LNG market in Asia, and provide opportunities for developing 500 skilled human resources over next five years. This is an interesting development and generally indicates how important Asian LNG demand is to the growth of natural gas industry across the world. 

While this will be a small digression from the topic on Natural Gas, I would like to cite a success story of Energy Justice in India. Under a scheme called Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, we have distributed 30 million LPG cooking gas connections to poor households with government subsidy. Multilateral organizations like the UN Women, the World Bank and others have shown great interest in our LPG schemes and delegations from several countries have approached us to know about our experience and initiatives. I personally believe this is a good replicable model in most of the Asian and African countries. 

We also have to change the collective consciousness and public perception about natural gas. In this direction, we have launched an initiative called Gas4India in collaboration with industry bodies. Natural gas is the natural choice for green economy, and will complement our huge program of 175 Gigawatts of solar, wind and other renewable energy. 

In conclusion, I wish to say that it is in our mutual interest to usher in and expedite the golden age of gas. For this, both producers and consumers should join hands to promote flexible and transparent global markets for gas and promote infrastructure for Natural Gas. This will help not only our economies but also promote the quality of life of our people. 

I take this opportunity to invite you to attend the IEF Ministerial Meeting scheduled to be held in Delhi on April 10-12, 2018 which India has the proud privilege to host. The Ministerial Meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss contemporary issues in energy including a prominent focus on Gas.”

                “I am privileged to be here for this important event which brings together Ministers from several crucial countries as far as energy is concerned. Asia has some of the largest producers as well as the largest consumers of energy. I am glad that IEF regularly organizes the Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable. I attended the last edition of Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable at Doha in 2015. I am happy that many of my distinguished friends from several countries are also here today for this important dialogue. Such meetings allow regional focus on key areas on the energy landscape.

IEF, in my view, is the most representative International Organization on Energy as its membership accounts for 90% of global supply in oil and gas. The 72 members are spread over six continents. IEF therefore, provides the best global platform, to both producers and consumers, to deliberate on global energy issues. This is the only organization where there are no entry barriers for any country to join. I have also seen it work closely with other organizations such as OPEC, IEA and International Gas Union (IGU). I also note that 18 of the Member countries of G20 are members of IEF. It is, therefore, important that IEF plays a much more prominent role in its engagement with G20 countries.

It is apt and timely that the theme for this event is about the transition in global energy markets. I took over as the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India about 40 months back. When I reflect on this period, I feel that we are on the cusp of a transition. In the last few years, we have seen low oil prices, increasing role of gas in the energy mix, abundant supply of gas, new players entering both the oil and gas market, loosening up of the inflexible LNG market and the rise of renewables and EVs.

As it should be in a perfect market economy, there are today a very large number of producers of oil and gas across the globe promoting free market pricing. This has led to a shift of the traditional centre of gravity in the world of oil and gas. The role of OPEC is gradually changing from price determination to price stabilization. While the world is witnessing this phenomenal change, it is in our mutual interest to play a constructive role in promoting responsible pricing, building infrastructure, removing distortions such as Asian Premium for oil and destination clause and oil price linkage for gas.

Friends, even as we deliberate on the transition in global energy markets, I would exhort the learned gathering here to also think over what innovations and collaborations can be done in the technology domain to pursue our shared objectives. Over the past couple of years, the term 4th Industrial Revolution has been much talked about. We all have read and heard that the 4th Industrial Revolution will be triggered by ideas, smart thinking and fusion of technologies across physical, digital and biological domains and will fundamentally alter our way of life as we know it today. Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, 3D Printing, Nano sensors, Energy Storage, Driverless Cars – there are so many technologies which, we are told, will eventually reshape our world.

I can not but help notice that despite being one of the world’s leading economies till the 17th century, India missed the first three industrial revolutions, largely due to colonization and its aftereffects. Even as we talk about the 4th industrial revolution, it is pertinent to remember that till today, about 17% of the world population, or about 1.3 billion people, do not have access to electricity, which largely powered the 2nd Industrial Revolution. Likewise, even today about 50% of people globally are deprived of internet access which is one of the key drivers of the 3rd industrial revolution. So, even as India aspires to lead the world in the 4th wave of industrial revolution, a large cross-section of its population, as in other developing countries of Asia, is yet to reap the full benefits of the 2nd and the 3rd industrial revolutions. This is where, I believe, the defining role of this dialogue sets in. I am confident that this platform would also provide an opportunity to direct our efforts to promote Energy Access, Energy Efficiency, Energy Sustainability and Energy Security, as articulated by Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi.

India will host the next IEF Ministerial Meeting in New Delhi on April 10-12, 2018. After receiving inputs from Member countries, we are in the process of drawing up a rich and engaging schedule for the event. I will soon be sending you formal invitations. Meanwhile, I take this opportunity to invite all of you to the Ministerial meeting in New Delhi and add value to this event. I look forward to seeing you all in Delhi soon. ”

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the revision in the price of ethanol under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme for supply to the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies. The revised price of ethanol would be fixed at Rs.40.85/- per litre under EBP and will be applicable for the forthcoming sugar season 2017-18. GST and transportation charges will also be payable additionally. The revised price will be applicable during ethanol supply period from 1st December 2017 to 30th November, 2018.

The approval will facilitate the continued policy of the Government in providing price stability and remunerative prices for ethanol suppliers. It will also help in reducing dependency on crude oil imports, saving in foreign exchange and benefits to the environment.

Background:

In order to augment the supply of ethanol, the Government in December, 2014, decided to administer the price of ethanol under EBP Programme. The Government fixed the delivered price of ethanol during ethanol supply year 2014-15 & 2015-16 in the range of Rs.48.50 to Rs.49.50 per litre including Central/State Government taxes and transportation charges. It improved significantly the supply of ethanol from 38 crore litres during ethanol supply year 2013-14 to 111 crore litres during 2015-16.

This price was re-examined for ethanol supply year 2016-17 in the context of firming of sugar prices and falling crude prices and consequent under-recoveries of OMCs. The Ex-Mill price was revised to Rs.39/- per litre. Additionally, Central/State Government taxes and transportation charges were payable. It is estimated that for ethanol supply year 2016-17, about 65 crore litres of ethanol will be procured.

Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 which has been extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union Territories to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also sought to reduce import dependency for energy requirements.

However, since 2006, OMCs were not able to receive offers for the required quantity of ethanol against the tenders floated by them due to various constraints like State Specific issues, Supplier related issues including Pricing issues of ethanol.

OMCs have to start the ethanol procurement process for the upcoming sugar season 2017-18 for which ethanol pricing under EBP Programme needs to be decided.

                The Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) was launched in Manipur today, by Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri R.K. Singh and Shri N. Biren Singh, Chief Minister of Manipur. A total of approximately 1.75 lakh households (1.62 lakh rural households and 0.13 lakh urban households) of Manipur are proposed to be included under the Scheme. 

Addressing the media at the function, Shri R.K. Singh said that Manipur is the fastest reforming state in Power sector in the country and the Manipur Government is performing well in terms of power sector in the State. 

Shri R.K. Singh further said that it is the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to provide electricity to every household of the country. Now the Government would come to people’s doorstep to provide power connection to every household. This is such a scheme where the poorest of the poor can afford electricity in their homes. The Minister promised that people would get 24x7 power supply by March, 2019. For achieving this target, the Government has already given obligation to private companies to provide 24x7 power supply to every household, he added. 

Union Minister also assured that the Government of India would provide the required financial assistance for strengthening and improvement of infrastructure in the power sector in Manipur. Monetary assistance had already been extended for procuring of transformers, meters etc. to strengthen the power sector in the State, he added. 

On the occasion, Shri N. Biren Singh said that under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Saubhagya Scheme would transform the lives, especially poorest of the poor by providing power supply to every household of the country. 

It may be noted that Saubhagya is a scheme launched to achieve universal household electrification in all parts of the Country at a cost of Rs. 16,320 crore including Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) of Rs. 12,320 crores from Government of India. Keeping in view the role of electricity in human and socio-economic development, Government of India has formulated the scheme to ensure last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified urban and rural households in the country. All States and Union Territories of the country are required to complete household electrification in their respective jurisdiction by 31st March, 2019. 

Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), a Navaratna CPSE under the Ministry of Power has been appointed as the nodal agency for coordinating the implementation of the scheme. The prospective beneficiary households for free electricity connections under the scheme will be identified using Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 data. 

The launch ceremony was held in the august presence of Shri. Th. Biswajit Singh, Minister for PWD/R&D & PR/ Comm. & Ind/Power/Admn. Reforms and Training/I.P.R., Government of Manipur, and other senior officers representing the Union Ministry of Power and the State Government.

                The first edition of the International Symposium to Promote Innovation & Research in Energy Efficiency (INSPIRE 2017) was kicked off in Jaipur today. The five-day symposium is being organized by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in partnership with The World Bank, and Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE). 

INSPIRE 2017 is an International Conference that brings together various stakeholders such as policy makers, innovators, financiers, influencers to showcase best practices in the sector. It provides a platform for energy efficiency community to discuss energy efficiency policies, market transformation strategies, emerging technologies, delivery and business-model driven transformations. The event is further designed to provide global and national thought-leaders and implementers to expand perspectives on energy efficiency and spur ideas and solutions that will help leverage the full potential of energy efficiency and bring its multiple co-benefits to the fore. 

The highlight of the symposium is the high-level deliberations driven by policy makers and experts from Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), The World Bank Group, The Energy Institute (TERI), International Energy Agency (IEA), Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), USA and representatives of the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) - a high-level global forum to promote policies and programmes that advance clean energy technology. 

Several global organizations like the Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, International Finance Corporation, The World Bank, International Energy Agency, International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, Clean Energy Ministerial, Copenhagen Center on Energy Efficiency, GIZ, will also share their perspectives at INSPIRE. 

Dr. John Roome, Senior Director, The World Bank Group while expressing concern on mitigating climate change said that India is the third largest energy consumer in the world. In India, the World Bank is proud to be partnering with EESL on a major $300 million programme, which is a long term low cost loan. This builds on our ongoing engagements with EESL and other agencies. The next five years will be critical for if we want a world that we would like our children to live in. And bold action on Energy Efficiency will be a key part of that action. 

Shri Saurabh Kumar, Managing Director, EESL said that INSPIRE 2017 intends to create a platform for deliberations and sharing of best practices around energy efficiency policy solutions, high-impact research, innovative financing and implementation that are driving large scale market transformations in India and across the globe. The event has brought together over 350 participants from 13 countries across North America, Asia, Europe and Middle East. 

During the inaugural session, a mobile app for EESL’s various programmes was launched. This app will allow consumers to connect with the organisation for its various programmes, lodge complaints and track real time complaint status. Further, citizens can now access the real-time status of Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) dashboard at state, district and Urban Local Body (ULB) levels across the country. 

On the occasion, Shri Ashok Jain, Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan said that focused initiatives and commitments in green energy are evident in our times. Energy efficiency will be the key in mitigation of climate challenge. India’s unified action plan for climate change outlines many steps which simultaneously advance India's development and climate change-related objectives. Rajasthan has large industries in cement and textile sectors. Under the PAT scheme, the designated industrial consumers were given targets, of which 58, in the first cycle, overachieved these targets. This demonstrates the due significance the State of Rajasthan gives to energy efficiency. 

Shri Abhay Bakre, Director General, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, said that INSPIRE is very crucial at this juncture. This 5-day conference will cover all the questions in the field of energy efficiency, ideate and discuss on the topic for solutions. 

Through an innovative market-led approach towards energy efficiency, India has charted its progress towards being a low-carbon economy, through implementation of large scale zero subsidy initiatives like Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA), Street lighting National Programme, Electric vehicles, Smart Meter programme, Solar Rooftop projects etc.

                On the 2nd Anniversary of Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) today, the Government of India signed four Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) under the Scheme with the State of Nagaland and with Union Territories (UTs) of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli & Daman & Diu for operational improvements. These State/UTs have joined only for operational improvement and shall not undergo financial restructuring/issue of bonds under the scheme. With the above, UDAY club has now grown to 27 states and 4 UTs.



 

An overall net benefit of approximately Rs. 551 crores, Rs. 18 crores, Rs. 13 crores and Rs. 10 crores respectively would accrue to the State of Nagaland & UTs of Andaman & Nicobar, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu by opting to participate in UDAY, by way of cheaper funds for capex, reduction in AT&C and Transmission losses, interventions in energy efficiency, etc. during the period of turnaround.

 

The MoU paves way for improving operational efficiency of the Electricity Departments/DISCOM of the State/Union Territory. Through compulsory distribution transformer metering, consumer indexing & GIS mapping of losses, upgrade/change transformers, meters etc., smart metering of high-end consumers, feeder audit etc. AT&C losses and transmission losses would be brought down, besides eliminating the gap between cost of supply of power and realisation.

 

While efforts will be made by the States/UTs to improve their operational efficiency, and thereby reduce the cost of supply of power, the Central Government would also provide incentives to the State/UTs for improving power infrastructure and for further lowering the cost of power. The Central schemes such as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Power Sector Development Fund or such other schemes of Ministry of Power (MoP) and Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) are already providing funds for improving power infrastructure and additional/priority funding would be considered under these schemes, if the State/UTs meets the operational milestones outlined in the scheme.

 

Demand Side interventions in UDAY such as usage of energy-efficient LED bulbs, agricultural pumps, fans & air-conditioners and efficient industrial equipment through PAT (Perform, Achieve, Trade) would help in reducing peak load, flatten load curve and thus help in reducing energy consumption in the State/UTs. Further, with improved efficiency, they would be in a better position to fund their capex at cheaper rates for Power infrastructure development/improvement in the State/UTs.

 

The ultimate benefit of signing the MOU would go to the people of these state/UTs. Reduced levels of AT&C losses would mean lesser cost per unit of electricity to consumers. Further, an operationally healthy DISCOM/Electricity Department would be in a position to supply more power. The scheme would also allow speedy availability of cheaper power to households in the State/UTs that are still without electricity. Availability of 24*7 cheaper, round the clock power would boost the economy, promote industries/tourism, thereby improving employment opportunities for the people of these State/UTs.

                Shri R.K. Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, launched the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – ‘Saubhagya’ Web Portal here today. The portal can be accessed at http://saubhagya.gov.in.

 Addressing the media during the event, Shri Singh said that the Saubhagya Dashboard is a platform for monitoring household electrification progress, which would disseminate information on Household Electrification Status (State, District, village-wise), Household Progress on live basis, State-wise Target vs Achievement, Monthly Electrification Progress, etc.

The Minister said that achieving electrification of 4 crore households is a big challenge, nevertheless the Government is committed to achieve this target by December 2018, with the cooperation of all the States. This would, in turn, bring about a huge improvement in the Quality of Life of the Citizens of India. The Government is bringing a change in the Power ecosystem in the Country by pushing towards mandatory metering of all new electrical connections through pre-paid or smart meters. This would make paying of electricity bills viable for the poor, reduce power losses and increase compliance in paying electricity bills, Shri Singh said.

 Talking about the Saubhagya Portal, the Minister said that through this online platform every State would feed in the current status of progress of electrification works, hence enabling the creation of a system of accountability for the State utility/ DISCOM and help in increasing their viability. Further, Seven States including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Mizoram, Nagaland, Chhattisgarh and Assam have given their requirements to the Power Ministry for funds under the Saubhagya Scheme, which would be released soon for aiding the respective electrification works, Shri Singh added.

 The Saubhagya web-portal has a feature on village electrification camps and in line with that, DISCOMs will organize camps in villages/cluster of villages for facilitating on-the-spot filling up of application forms and to complete requisite documentation to expedite release of electricity connections to households, Shri Singh informed. Further, all States have been asked to announce the schedules of the village camps to be held and hence create awareness among the people about the one-stop facility for getting electricity connections.

 DISCOMs/ State Power Department will also adopt the innovative mechanism through dedicated web-portal/Mobile App for collection/consolidation of data in electronic form including collection of application form for obtaining electricity connections. The details of consumers viz., Name and Mobile number/Bank account/Driving License/Voter ID etc., as available, would be collected by the DISCOMs.

On the sidelines of the Saubhagya Web portal launch, Shri Singh also informed that the Ministry has directed NTPC to mix straw/ crop residue pellets with coal, upto 10%, for power generation in all of its Thermal Power Plants. This step would reduce crop residue burning in agriculture dominated States like Punjab, Haryana etc. and hence reduce air pollution that is currently being experienced. The Minister further said that this step would give the farmers a monetary return of Rs. 5500/ tonne of crop residue and hence create a market for it. The infrastructure for sourcing the crop residue from farmers is being set up and NTPC would soon be issuing tenders in this regard. The Ministry is in talks with all State Governments to make this step mandatory for all the Thermal Power Plants in their jurisdiction, Shri Singh added.

 

BACKGROUND OF SAUBHAGYA SCHEME

 ‘Saubhagya’ scheme was launched by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi on 25th September, 2017 with an outlay of Rs. 16,320 Crores including Budgetary Support of Rs. 12,320 Crores. Under Saubhagya scheme, all willing households in rural areas and poor families in urban areas are given free electricity connections. There are around 4 Crore un-electrified households in the country and they are targeted for providing electricity connections by December 2018.

Till recently, the focus of electrification has been on village electrification through creation of village electricity infrastructure for all households and providing free electricity connections to poor household families in rural areas. Now, Saubhagya has come into existence for providing free electricity connections to all households (both APL and poor families) in rural areas and poor families in urban areas. 

 Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC) is the Nodal Agency for the operationalization of the scheme throughout the country. Union Ministry of Power with the support of the States is taking all concerted efforts to fulfill the dream of Hon’ble Prime Minister of seeing Electrified, Bright and Vibrant India with all households having access to electricity connections.

EESL’s projects, under one of the largest funding by GEF till date, will mitigate 60 million tonnes of CO2eq

 

UN Environment’s ‘District Energy in Cities’ Initiative already identified $600 million of Energy Efficiency projects across 5 cities in India

 

Recognizing India’s efforts towards a low emission-economy and focusing on energy efficiency programmes, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has now partnered with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), under Ministry of Power, for the project ‘Creating and Sustaining Markets for Energy Efficiency’, here today.The project will receive a composite funding of $454 million comprised of the GEF grant of $20 million and co-financing of $434 million in the form of loans and equity, including a $200 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). EESL further proposes Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF) for sustainable funding mechanism of energy efficiency projects in the country.

 

The EERF mechanism will support the ‘proof of concept’ investments for the new technologies of super-efficient ceiling fans, tri-generation technologies & smart grid-applications and ultimately scaling up energy efficiency financing and programme development to help cover initial investment costs of identified energy efficiency programmes like street lighting, domestic lighting, five-star rated ceiling fans and agricultural pumps, in the country. This unique model will help in addressing the upfront risks of new technologies. Further, the accrued savings from these technologies can then be used to finance additional projects, which would allow capital to revolve as a sustainable funding mechanism.

 

The GEF project further brings together many technical and financing partners including United Nations Environment (UN Environment), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) which aims to mitigate 60 million tons of CO2 eq (carbon dioxide equivalent), that will enable a total direct energy savings of 38.3 million GJ by 2022 and 137.5 million GJ by 2032. (1 GJ = 277.778 kWh)

 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Secretary, Ministry of Power, said that currently around two-thirds of total power generation capacity in India is based on fossil fuels. By 2030, India is committed to achieve 40% of the installed capacity based on clean energy sources. To achieve this target, it is imperative to create awareness in the citizens, especially among youth, to encourage energy efficiency measures like use of electric vehicles, energy efficient building codes etc., he added.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Anil Kumar Jain, Additional Secretary Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, said that the overall size of energy efficiency market in India is estimated to be $23 billion. Initiatives like these seek to tap that market by implementing an innovative business model that is scalable, flexible, embraces different and emerging technologies and has incentives for all stakeholders.

 

Ms Naoko Ishii, Chairperson and CEO, GEF said that with the strong leadership of EESL and the Government of India, the penetration of these clean energy technologies will help India leapfrog to a more sustainable future while helping reduce local and global emissions.

 

Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of India Resident Mission of ADB, said that ADB will partner EESL to implement energy efficiency projects in India to facilitate sustainable growth by addressing climate change issues, boosting the economy and generating greater employment in the country.

 

Mr. Geordie Codville of the UN Environment said that the project is aimed at scaling up energy efficiency efforts to achieve India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) goals and ultimately the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

 

EESL also has its sights set on district cooling systems which can reduce energy demand for cooling by up to 50 percent. EESL has partnered with UN Environment’s District Energy in Cities Initiative, which has already identified $600 million of projects across five cities in India.

 

GEF is an international partnership of 183 countries, international institutions, civil society organizations and the private sector that addresses global environmental issues. The funding announcement was made at the launch of the GEF-6 fund which supports two projects – ‘Creating Markets for Energy Efficiency’ and ‘District Energy in Cities’.

 

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Raj Pal, Economic Advisor, Ministry of Power, Shri Saurabh Kumar, MD, EESL and other senior officers of the Ministry and PSUs under it.

Backgrounder:-

1. UPI 

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing & merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the ""Peer to Peer"" collect request which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience. 

Initially many banks have offered their own UPI applications for the customers creating little confusion among them on which UPI app to be used. For convenience of the users, a UPI App called BHIM has been developed by GOI. 

2. BHIM 

BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) is a Mobile App developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), based on the Unified Payment Interface (UPI). BHIM is inter-operable with other Unified Payment Interface (UPI) applications and bank accounts.

                In order to manage the train operations in upcoming foggy season 2017-18, Ministry of Railways has devised a detailed plan for cancellation & frequency reduction etc. of trains traversing through fog affected area. The Cancellation, Partial Cancellation Reduction in Frequency and Diversion of trains mentioned in the list (given below) will be done with effect from 1st December 2017 to 13thFebruary 2018.



The advanced cancellation etc., is being done, so that, passengers may plan their journeys accordingly. In case of cancellation etc., full refund of fare will be given to the affected passengers. The passengers are advised to check the status of the train before undertaking their journey. The status of these trains will also be communicated to the passengers on their respective registered mobile numbers.

During the fog, the visibility becomes very low and trains have to run on a highly-restricted speed to ensure safety of the passengers which leads to considerable delays in the movement of trains.

The status of these trains will be monitored periodically keeping in view the intensity of fog and decisions to restore some of the trains may be taken, as and when operationally feasible.

                To improve passenger experience, Ministry of Railways decided to upgrade Premium Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains under Project ‘Swarna’. With improved passenger amenities, aesthetics and hygiene standards, Country’s first Swarn Rajdhani (Train no 12313 New Delhi – Sealdah Rajdhani Express) was launched in New Delhi today i.e. 29th November, 2017 at New Delhi Station. Member, Rolling Stock Shri Ravindra Gupta was especially present to introspect the revamped rake.



 

Under Project Swarna, a detailed programme to significantly improve passenger experience on Rajdhani & Shatabdi trains has been planned in the following 10 dimensions:

        i.            Coach Interiors

      ii.            Toilets

    iii.            Onboard cleanliness

    iv.            Punctuality

      v.            Catering

    vi.            Linen

  vii.            Staff Behaviour

viii.            Security

    ix.            Onboard entertainment

      x.            Real Time Feedback

 

For this programme, Ministry had formed nine teams of two officers each from Railway Board to monitor the progress of work under each dimension of Project Swarna. 14 Rajdhani trains & 15 Shatabdi trains have been selected for the first phase of this Project.

The first revamped rake of Rajdhani under the project was rake of Sealdah Rajdhani (12314 New Delhi-Sealdah) which was launched today from New Delhi.

 

Salient Features of Ist Swarn Rajdhani :

 

Base on extensive research, the following features have been introduced on Sealdah Rajdhani:

 

a)      Complete interior painting to an aesthetic International colour scheme and LED lighting to improve illumination.

 

b)      Better hygiene by providing ‘auto janitor’ system in toilets.

 

c)      Health faucets, stainless steel wash basins improved soap dispenser and better quality dustbins, carefully chosen locations for ergonomic convenience.

 

d)     Night signage for easy identifications of berth nos. for enroute entraining passengers.

 

e)      Blanket covers for First AC passengers of two different colours to ensure separate cover in to and fro journey.

 

f)       Built in ladders for First AC passengers for easy access to upper berth.

 

g)      CCTV cameras in doorway area and aisles to monitor any suspect activity with data storage.

 

h)      New design magazine bags with extra pocket for mobile for fitting changing life style.

 

i)        LED lighting over mirrors.

j)        Vinyl wrapping of toilet doors for improved aesthetics.

 

k)      Epoxy coating in toilets, provisioning of extra mats in toilet to improve hygienic standards and to give a dry toilet to the passengers with improved cleanliness

 

l)        Polished commodes and basins to make them odour free in every trip.

 

m)    3 pilot coaches in service to gather passenger feedback and assess journey worthiness.

 

An expenditure about Rs. 35 lakhs has gone into this rake which translates into less than Rs.2 lakh per coach.

 

 

Under Project Swarna, Zonal Railways were given a free hand to develop and innovate to create aesthetic and passenger friendly coach interiors on running rakes to establish new standards in passengers comfort. A target budget of Rs. 50 lakh per rake was allowed for this purpose. The list of Rajdhani and Shatabdi under this project is given below:

                In a major strategy to reduce the cost of its electrictraction energy bill, Indian Railways (IR) has succeeded in achieving a cumulative saving of ₹5636 cr. from April, 2015 to October, 2017against the “Business As Usual” (BAU) mode by procuring power directly under Open Access arrangements. This cumulative figure is likely to further go up to ₹6927 cr. by the end of the current financial year i.e. by March, 2018, which is around ₹thousand crores more than the stipulated target.

The estimated savings on these accounts indicates that in ten years (2015-’25), these initiatives can generate a cumulative saving of about ₹41,000 cr. in electric traction bill, which has been named as IR’s Mission 41K.

With a view to effect savings in its huge energy bill, Indian Railways took lot of innovative initiatives in arranging procurement of power under open access. It may be pointed out that the Electricity Act 2003 conferred Deemed Licensee status on IR due to its involvement in generation, transmission & distribution of energy from the time electricity came to India. Accordingly, IR had been working to get this provision of Electricity Act operational; however it didn’t come through for quite some time due to various factors.

Later, however, Minister of Railways, took up this task with fresh impetus and subsequently a strategy was drawn. In line with this, Indian Railway approached Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) for issue of necessary guidelines to all State Transmission Utilities (STUs) and State Load Dispatch Centers (SLDCs) to facilitate Open Access to Indian Railways on existing transmission network as Deemed Licensee.

Finally, IR’s vision of drawing electrical energy as deemed licensee was realized on 26th Nov.’15 when it started drawing about 200 MW power on Central Railway from Ratnagiri Gas Power Pvt. Ltd. {RGPPL - Gas based power plant} in Maharashtra. This was for the first time that IR had drawn energy under open access as a distribution licensee using state distribution network. IR contracted about 500 MW from RGPPL for consumption in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, M.P., and Jharkhand for meeting its electric traction power requirement. The flow of power in all these four States was completed by 22nd Jan.’16. IR also contracted 50 MW through open tender for taking power on its own transmission network from Dadri to Kanpur, which started flowing from 1st Dec.’15. Further in the current year flow of power started in the state of Rajasthan from 1st Jan’2017, in Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) area from Aug’17 and in the states of Haryana and Karnataka from Oct’17.

With continuous efforts from Ministry of Railways and the support provided by Govt. of India including PMO office, on date Electric traction power is presently being sourced through Open Access route in 7 states (Maharashtra, Gujarat, M.P, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana and Karnataka) and DVC area.Moreover, the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have also agreed to permit Railway for flow of power though Open access route which is likely to start by next year. The talks of Indian Railways with remaining states are going on for procuring power through open access route.

As on date out of total requirement of about 2000MW of IR for Electric traction power more than 1000MW is flowing under Open Access. This has reduced the average cost of power in these states where power is flowing under Open Access to about ₹5.00 from earlier cost of more than ₹7.00 per unit.

Immediate benefits that will accrue to Indian Railways by procuring energy as a distribution licensee, and its impact in improving financial performance of IR were enumerated in IR’s Mission 41K document.The estimated savings on these accounts indicates that in ten years (2015-’25), these initiatives can generate a cumulative saving of about ₹41,000 cr. in electric traction bill, which has been named as IR’s Mission 41K.

These savings will be utilized for taking up Electrification of balance Rail network as part of Mission Electrification. This will further reduce the diesel bill and multiply the savings in energy bill, taking it to about ₹10,500 Cr. per annum in next few years on 100% electrification of IR network.

With success in reducing electric traction bill substantially, mission of bringing down operational cost of Railways has already started taking shape. In due course of time, this will also give shape to the directive of Hon’ble Prime Minister that Railways should play a dominant role in meeting transport needs of the nation in an economical manner, de-congest highways, create more jobs with expansion of rail network and reduce India’s dependence on imported fuel.

This humble beginning with cutting input costs will strengthen financial resilience of Railways, improve its resource mobilization, and enable shifting of traffic from road to rail by making it more attractive. Making these savings happen by 2025 will be a real tribute to Indian Railways when it will be celebrating its centenary year of electric traction on Indian Railways.

Commissioning of Electronic Interlocking System was Accomplished in Record Time Ensuring Minimum Traffic Disruptions and Passenger Inconvenience
 

Electronic Interlocking System at Kharagpur Junction will Ensure Smooth Movement of Trains over South Eastern Railway

India’s largest state of the art, Electronic Interlocking (EI) system of 800 routes has been commissioned at Kharagpur station in West Bengal on 19thNov2017 at 18:12 hrs. This EI system, also one of the largest in the World, replaces the old Route Relay Interlocking system with 423 routes.   

Kharagpur Junction in West Bengal, a gateway to the Eastern Metropolis of Kolkata from the South and the West, is one of the most important Railway stations of Eastern India. Everyday this station deals around 116 pairs of Mail/Express, goods and suburban trains with thousands of passengers.

Final work of commissioning was taken up during a block of 12 hours. Preparations for commissioning of this Electronic Interlocking commenced about 18 months back and involved hundreds of thousands of man-hours of installation and testing. Generally, work of this nature and magnitude, involving major yard remodeling, is commissioned by resorting to non-interlocked working for several days, resulting in severe disruption of railway traffic and public inconvenience from cancellation and late running of trains. To avoid such a situation, innovative planning was done for commissioning the work in a traffic block of 12 hours, thereby ensuring bare minimum traffic disruptions and passenger inconvenience. It speaks volumes of the planning and preparation by South Eastern Railway that commissioning was finally achieved in 10 hours i.e. two hours ahead of stiff target of 12 hours.

The commissioning of the new Electronic Interlocking has integrated (i) two additional platforms at Kharagpur Junction (ii) 3rd line from Howrah side and 2nd line from Adra side at Kharagpur Junction. Besides, it has ensured operation of down goods departure yard from the main Electronic Interlocking system at Kharagpur Junction.

To ensure highest level of availability and flexibility, this EI has been provided in a distributed manner with the interlocking distributed over 9 zones interconnected with highly reliable Optical Fibre Cables (OFC) in a ring configuration. This has also resulted in major reduction in use of copper cables which is not only unreliable, difficult to maintain, prone to theft but also costly. Facility has been provided for the setting of routes and clearing of signals from electronic Video Display Unit (VDU) using “Mouse & Key Board”.   

With the commissioning of EI system at Kharagpur Junction the movement of trains over South Eastern Railway will get eased up considerably and result in improved punctuality of Mail/Express trains and increase in average speed of goods trains

                Under the direction of Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal, a comprehensive plan for imparting training to all employees of Indian Railways is being prepared with a view to upgrade skill & knowledge. This comprehensive training programme named as “Project Saksham” will help boost productivity and efficiency. 

Under this plan, all employees in each zone will be put through a week’s training in skills and knowledge relevant to their work area over next one year. A communication to this effect from Chairman Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani, has been sent to all General Managers of zonal railways and railways production unit. 

General Managers have been advised that such priority training need should be quickly identified for each category of employees (employees can be grouped into their work areas) based on the needs of respective zone. Identification of training needs and formulation of planned training calendar will be required to be completed by December 31st, 2017, ensuring that each employee is imparted training. 

It has been emphasized that while continuous learning and education/training has been an integral philosophy and approach of the Railways, there is a need to do a concentrated capsule of training for all employees in a short period of time to boost their productivity and efficiency. This training programme will fulfill this need. 

With growing rail network, new trains, different high quality services designed by the railways and the promise of the government to deliver superior and safe rail services and growing expectation of our passengers and commuters for better amenities and services, it is imperative that the railway employees rise to the occasion to deliver on the promise. Employees can and do deliver only when they have the right skills, knowledge and the mindset to deliver to the new standards of excellence that the organization hold from them all. This training will help achieve these objectives. 

This training shall be a five-day on the job training or as classroom training in Railway Training Centre depending on the nature of training. However, the reporting managers of all employees receiving training need to be actively involved in the Pre-training and post training process to ensure that the benefits of training get reflected on the job performance and there is improvement within a short time after the training is imparted. The focus of all such training has to be to ‘make a difference’ to the job performance of all departments and employees and thus Indian Railways. 

The training, as per the calendar, must be completed within 9 months. You may personally monitor the completion of the plans and their progress. The zone must also devise a few metrics to monitor the impact of Project Saksham. 

This training will not only upgrade skill of each of the employees but also go a long-way in improving the performance of the Indian Railways.

Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, the Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh & the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, in an historical event today flagged off  Cross Border Train between India & Bangladesh, the Kolkata-Khulna Bandhan Express through video conference from Kolkata station. The leaders unveiled jointly an e-plaque to inaugurate the following:

(i)   Second Bharirab & Titas Railway Bridges  in Bangladesh,

(ii)   International Rail Passenger Terminus with End-to-End Immigration and Customs Clearance Facilities (for the passengers of Maitree Express and Bandhan Express) at Kolkata station. 

Shri Sudip Bandyopadhya, Member of Parliament & Chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways, Smt. Mala Saha, MLA, Shri Harindra Rao, General Manager, Eastern Railway, Mr. Toufique Hassan, Dy. High Commissioner, Bangladesh Deputy High Commission, Kolkata were also present to grace the occasion at Kolkata station. 

In his address, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that the close connection and understanding between two countries requires connectivity between the people across the border and Maitree Express and Bandhan Express trains will further add to connectivity between India and Bangladesh and strengthen and strengthen our bonding.He underlined the fact that India has emerged as the most trusted partner of Bangladesh by undertaking and completing a series of developmental projects in Bangladesh.

The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, lauded the initiative and expressed hope that there would be more such initiatives for increasing rail link & connectivity between the two countries. She also highlighted the fact that it would result in reducing the journey time for the passengers of Maitree and Bandhan Express trains with the introduction of International Passenger Rail Terminus with End-to-End Immigration and Customs Clearance Facilities.

The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee said that this new Passenger Train link between Kolkata & Khulna will strengthen the ties between two countries. She expressed happiness on introduction of the new train between the two countries & recollected the traditional bonding with Bangladesh.

The Bandhan Express train is the second train to be flagged off after the introduction of Maitree Express’ between Kolkata and Dhaka Cantonment stations in April, 2008. It covers the distance between Kolkata and Khulna through Petrapole & Benapole route to cater to the demands of the people from both the countries to enhance the connectivity.

The Bandhan Express will be a weekly service on every Thursday. The Kolkata - Khulna Bandhan Express (13129 Up) will depart from Kolkata at 07.10 hrs.(IST) and arrives at Khulna at 12:30 hrs.(BST) on the return journey the Khulna-Kolkata Bandhan Express ( 13130 Down) will depart from Khulna at 13.30 hrs. (BST) and arrive at Kolkata at 18.10 hrs.(IST) on the same day. The immigration and Customs checks will take place at Kolkata International Passenger Terminal for the Indian side and at Benapol border station for Bangladesh side.

The journey time of Maitree Express from Kolkata to Dhaka will be 08 hrs.25mts while from Dhaka to Kolkata it will take 08 hrs.15mts. The journey time would be reduced by 2 hours. It will depart from Kolkata at 7.10 hrs.(IST) (on Mon, Tue, Fri & Sat) and arrive at Dhaka at 16.05 hrs.(BST) instead of earlier arrival at Dhaka at 18.05 hrs.(BST). On the return journey it will depart from Dhaka at 08.15 hrs.(BST) (on Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun)  instead of earlier departure from Dhaka at 08.10 hrs. (BST) and arrive at Kolkata at 16.00 hrs.(IST) instead of earlier arrival at Kolkata at 18.10 hrs.(IST).

In order to  reduce the en-route journey time of the passengers of the existing Kolkata – Dhaka Cantt. Maitree Express and newly introduced Kolkata – Khulna Bandhan Express, Ministry of Railways, with the coordination of Department of Immigration & Customs has opened an International Rail Passenger Terminus at Kolkata station with proper infrastructure and facilities of end-to-end immigration. With this new facility at Kolkata Terminal, the passengers of Maitree Express and Bandhan Express will be immensely benefitted.

The second Bhairab Bridge and Titas Bridge in Bangladesh built under the assistance of Government of India are two of the most important projects in Bangladesh for infrastructure and rolling stock development. The one kilometer long second Bhairab Railway Bridge was built over the mighty Meghna river at a cost of around USD 75 millions by Indian contractors and consultants. Similarly, the Titas bridge over river Titas in Eastern Bangladesh was built with a cost of around USD 25 million. Both these bridges are on the main Chittagong to Dhaka Trunk Rail Line which will help in faster movement of both passenger and freight trains of Bangladesh.

Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion: 

“इस प्रसारण से जुड़े सभी लोगों को, और विशेषकर बांग्लादेश में रहने वाले सभी भाइयों और बहनों को नमस्कार।

कुछ दिन पहले दोनों देशों में दीपावली, दुर्गा पूजा और काली पूजा के महोत्सव मनाए गए। 

मैं दोनों देशवासियों को इस festival season की शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ।

मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि video conference के माध्यम से आपसे एक बार फ़िर मिलने का अवसर मिला।

आपके स्वास्थ्य के लिए हमारी शुभकामनाएं आपके साथ हैं।

मेरा शुरू से ही मानना रहा है कि पड़ोसी देशों के leaders के साथ सही मायने में पड़ौसियों जैसे संबंध होने चाहिए। 

जब मन किया तो बात होनी चाहिए, visits होने चाहिए। 

इस सबमें हमें protocol के बंधन में नहीं रहना चाहिए।

कुछ समय पहले हमने South Asia Satellite के launch के समय इसी प्रकार video conference की थी।

पिछले वर्ष हमने मिल कर Petrapole ICP का उद्घाटन भी इसी प्रकार किया था।

और मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि आज हमारी connectivity को मज़बूत करने वाले महत्वपूर्ण projects का उद्घाटन हमने video conference के माध्यम से किया।

Connectivity का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण आयाम है हमारी people-to-people connectivity. 

और आज international passenger terminus के उद्घाटन से कोलकाता-ढाका मैत्री express और आज शुरू हुई कोलकाता-खुलना बंधन express के यात्रियों को काफी सुविधा होगी।

इससे उन्हें न सिर्फ़ customs और immigration में आसानी होगी, बल्कि उनकी यात्रा के समय में भी 3 घंटे की बचत होगी।

मैत्री और बंधन, इन दोनों rail सुविधाओं के नाम भी हमारे shared vision के अनुरूप हैं।

जब भी हम connectivity की बात करते हैं, तो मुझे हमेशा आपके pre-1965 connectivity बहाल करने के vision का ख़याल आता है।

मुझे बहुत ख़ुशी है कि हम इस दिशा में क़दम-दर-क़दम निरंतर आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

आज हमने दो rail पुलों का भी उद्घाटन किया है। लगभग 100 million dollars की लागत से बने ये पुल बांग्लादेश के rail network को मजबूत करने में सहायक होंगे।

बांग्लादेश के विकास कार्यों में विश्वस्त साझेदार होना भारत के लिए गर्व का विषय है। 

मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि हमारे 8 billion dollars के concessional (कनसे-शनल) finance के commitment के अंतर्गत projects पर अच्छी प्रगति हो रही है।

Development और Connectivity दोनों एक साथ जुड़े हुए हैं, और हम दोनों देशों के बीच जो सदियों पुराने एतिहासिक links हैं, विशेष रूप से पश्चिम बंगाल और बांग्लादेश के लोगों के बीच, उन्हें मजबूत करने की दिशा में आज हमने कुछ और क़दम उठाए हैं।

मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि जैसे-जैसे हम अपने संबंध बढ़ाएंगे और लोगों के बीच रिश्ते मज़बूत करेंगे, वैसे वैसे हम विकास और समृद्धि के नए आसमान भी छूएंगे।

इस काम में सहयोग के लिए मैं प्रधानमंत्री शेख हसीना जी का, और मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी जी का हृदय से आभार प्रकट करता हूं।

धन्यवाद।

Apart from these, many companies and individuals have agreed to take on projects from the list of over 200 projects for which private funding has been sought.

There are projects worth more than Rs.10,000 crore for development of ghats, crematoria, waterbodies, parks, sanitation facilities, public amenities and river front which need additional funding. Projects worth over Rs 2500 crore, available for private funding have been published as a booklet and are also available on the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) website as an e- booklet.

This MOU will also establish the terms on which such assistance can be provided.

The decision to sign the MoU follows from Shri Gadkari’s last visit to London in May this year, during which he finalized bilateral cooperation arrangements between Transport for London(TFL) and Indian Ministry of Road Transport & Highways to cover a wide range of transport mobility solutions and associated activities in urban environment.

During his visit to London Shri Gadkari will also address a session of the International Maritime Organization. He also addressed Indian business leaders in UK, urging them to cooperate in the Namami Gange project of the Government.

                Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that the Centre has approved projects of value of more than one Lakh crore rupees for  Tamil Nadu.

These projects will cover the Highways, Shipping and Port and for finding a permanent solution to the irrigation and drinking water requirements of the state.

The Minister was addressing a joint press conference with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Shri Edappadi K. Palaniswami after a review meeting of Central and State government.

Shri Gadkari, announced 40,000 crore rupees worth of Road and Highway projects approved at the meeting today. He outlined the proposed projects with details of the financial outlay.

The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Eddapadi K. Palaniswamy said that the meeting was fruitful and thanked the Union Minister for largely accepting projects and programmes put forward by the state government.

Union Minister of State for Finance and Shipping, Shri P. Radhakrishnan and Tamil Nadu Transport Minister Shri. M.R.Vijayabhaskar, senior officials of Centre and State governments also attended the meeting.

Focussing on the decongestion of Chennai Traffic, Shri Gadkari said Three New Elevated Corridors have been approved first being the Tambaram- Chengelpatu at a cost of 2250 crores, Poonamalee- Maduravoyal Corridor with an outlay of 1500 crores and the Tiruvallur Corridor budgeted at 1000 crore. He also said that Tambaram- Vandalur ,Vandalur -Guduvanchery section of the Highway will be upgraded to 8 lane Highway with a budget of 72 crores which will also solve the traffic congestion at the Tambaram -Perungalathur bridge.

The Chennai- Bengaluru Expressway is being taken at a projected cost of 20,000 crore rupees and will boost industrialisation and development activities along the Express way. The Minister requested the state Government to earnestly take up land acquisition, shifting of utilities to help timely starting of the project.

The Minister said to ease the congestion in the extended suburban areas of Chennai, approval has been given for six laning of the Koyambedu- Poonamalee -Wallajahpet road at a cost of 1500 crores.

Listing the new projects to be awarded this year, Mr Gadkari said Tiruchi-Chidambaram Highway project is being taken up with a budgeted outlay of 4000 crore, while the Villupuram- Nagapattinam section is being upgraded at a cost of 6000 crore rupees. Other projects to be approved include Chennai- TADA (500 crore). 

Elaborating on the Bhartmala project that links port terminals to the hinterland, he said six projects are being taken up the major one being Nagapattinam to Tuticorin (355 kms ), Madurai- Kollam (62kms) Vellakoil-Erode (71kms), Madurai-Natham (38kms), Madurai -Theni(44kms) and Musiri -Namakkal (44kms). Along with these, the ring road development will be taken up in Madurai, Tiruchi and Salem.

Rs. 2000 crore has also been sanctioned to the State PWD to develop the Dindigul-Kottampati road into a National Highway. 1300 kms of State Highways are being upgraded to National Highways in the state. The state highways being upgraded include Perambalur- Attur (55kms), Salem-Vanniyampadi (141kms),  Thoppur- Mettur-Erode (85kms),Tirupur-Ottanchatiram (91kms).

 In a bid to, reduce traffic accidents, the Centre is funding 2300 crore rupees to take preventive measures in 61 identified black spots where there are frequent accidents take place.

The Minister said the DPR for Madurai, Coimbatore and Salem bus ports – terminals with the latest facilities like an airport will be prepared and the report will be submitted soon.

On the Shipping front, the Minister said Tamil Nadu is only state with three major ports and said these would be enhanced to facilitate exports and industrialisation, and value addition under the Sagarmala programme.

Coal movement from Orissa through Paradip to Ennore and Tuticorin will significantly reduce the logistics cost of coal. He hoped to improve the coal handling productivity in all three ports. Coastal movement of petroleum products, LPG and automobiles is the lifeline of the industry of Tamil Nadu. Referring to Tuticorin port, shri Gadkari said the depth is to be increased from the present 14m to 16.5 meters at a cost of Rs.3000 crore rupees and this would help the port to handle 1,30,000 tonnage vessels from the present capacity of 60,000 tonnage ships. This would reduce the logistic cost by 30 percent.

He said coastal movement of containers from Chennai to Puducherry will commence soon and this would reduce the congestion on this road sector.

The Minister said a Passenger ferry services between Kanyakumari and Rameshwaram and between Kanyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram are being planned and urged private operators to come forward and participate in the project, stating that the centre would provide full support.

Coastal berths are being built at Cuddalore at a cost of Rs 115 crore and similar facilities are coming at Chennai and Tuticorin ports.

The Minister said that as the Prime Minister has assured a doubling of income of farmers by 2022, the present NDA government has taken up the interlinking of river projects and has given priority to the water scare southern states. The Minister said Water resources ministry has therefore decided on transfer of surplus Godavari river waters to the Cauvery via the Krishna and Pennar Rivers. He said a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu will be convened soon to discuss the project.  Initially about 300tmc of water is proposed to be lifted from Godavari river upstream of Pollavaram project and would be released into the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam on River Krishna. Further the water would be taken from Krishna upto Somasilam project on river Pennar and from there to Grand Annaicut on the Cauvery.

                Following the upgrade of India's sovereign rating from Baa3 positive to Baa2 stable on 16th November 2017, Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the issuer ratings of National Highways Authority of India to Baa2 from Baa3 and revised outlook to stable from positive. The ratings of NTPC, NHPC and GAIL have also been upgraded. 

According to Moody’s ""The upgrade in ratings for NTPC, NHPC, NHAI and GAIL follows the upgrade of the Indian sovereign rating and reflects the strategic importance of these entities to the country, as well as their close operational and financial links with the government,"" 

It was only about a month back on October 9th that Moody’s had assigned a first time Baa3 rating to NHAI. The upgrade to Baa2 has come for NHAI in a very short time. 

Meanwhile, a report of the global rating agency CRISIL issued on 16th November 2017 has also said that reforms by NHAI have resulted in a steep decline in the percentage of high risk highways projects from 53 percent two years back to 21 percent now. The reforms that have made this possible include quicker approvals, loan support for languishing projects, termination of stuck projects and their subsequent re-awarding, and affording a change in sponsor. According to CRISIL about 80 % of the operational portfolio comprising nearly 100 BOT projects are at low risk today in terms of debt servicing. 

The CRISIL report also acknowledges that NHAI reforms have resulted in doubling of highways construction rate from 12 km per day in 2015 to 23 km per day in 2017. It says, the awarding of contracts is expected to sustain given the announcement and subsequent implementation of Bharatmala project. 

The CRISIL report goes on to say that with the improved ground situation both debt and equity investors are showing more interest in the road sector.

                The Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has reiterated the Government’s commitment for speedy  completion of highways projects in Delhi NCR  in order to decongest the region and cut down vehicular pollution levels by nearly 50 percent. Shri Gadkari did an on the spot inspection of one such project - the Delhi – Meerut Expressway project today, and briefed media persons near Akshardham temple on NH 24.

Speaking on the occasion he   said that the first package of the Delhi – Meerut Expressway project stretching from Akshardham Temple to Delhi-UP border  will be ready by December this year.  The 9 km, 14 lane highway is being completed in a record time of 14 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months. This is also the first national highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5 metre wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only. Shri Gadkari said this highway will be developed further upto Lucknow, and will be a lifeline for the people of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. The highway will also reduce traffic congestion on the Delhi – Meerut route, which in turn will lower the pollution levels in the region, he said.

 Shri Gadkari further said that work on the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways around Delhi is also going on at full speed, and the former is likely to be ready before 26th of January next year.  Once the  NH-24 and the two peripheral expressways are ready, vehicles destined for neighbouring states will be able to bypass Delhi and this will reduce pollution by 50 percent.

 The Minister also said that projects worth Rs 40,000 crore are being undertaken to decongest Delhi. These include plans for Dhaula Kuan stretch, Dwarka Expressway and a Ring Road for Delhi the cost for which will be borne jointly by the Centre and Delhi Government.

 Apart from speedy construction of highways the Ministry is also taking other steps to check pollution arising from the highways sector. These include actively promoting the use of bio fuel driven vehicles  and electric vehicles, greening of highways, covering construction sites to contain dust and promoting the use of waterways. He added that tenders have been issued for dredging of river Yamuna and linking Delhi and Agra through waterways.

 Emphasizing that ecology, economy and development should go side by side, Shri Gadkari said that these projects will pave the way for development, employment generation, cleaner atmosphere and hassle free travel for people.

                Work has begun for setting up Logistics Parks at Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Surat and Guwahati 
 

Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, has reiterated the Government’s commitment for  providing world class transport and logistics infrastructure in the country within  to support the  growth of economic activity. He  was addressing a session on Opportunity in Infrastructure, Logistics Technology and Equipment in the World Food India 2017 conference in New Delhi today.

Shri Gadkari informed that the rate of construction of National Highways has gathered considerable momentum.  The country had just 96,000 km of NH three years back, but this has grown to nearly 1.7 lakh km, and will soon reach a length of 2 lakh km. This will provide more farmers in remote areas with access to markets for their produce .

The Minister further said that   44 Economic Corridors and 24 Multi Modal Logistics Parks have been planned under the Government’s flagship programme Bharatmala. These are being planned on the hub and spoke model to facilitate efficient movement of freight along routes of economic importance. The Multi Modal Logistics Parks are being planned as centres of freight aggregation with warehousing, cold storage and other such facilities. These parks will be built on NH outside cities, so they will help reduce traffic congestion and also reduce pollution. Shri Gadkari informed that work has already begun for setting up Logistics Parks at Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Vijaywada, Surat and Guwahati. The Economic Corridors and Multi Modal Logistics Parks will facilitate faster movement of farm produce to food processing centres and to markets. This will raise the income of farmers, give a boost to the food processing industry and create a large number of jobs.

Shri Gadkari also said that the Sagarmala Programme of the Shipping Ministry will also be contributing to the growth of the country’s food economy in a big way. 14 Coastal Economic Zones have been planned under this programme. Two mega food   processing parks are being planned at Kakinada and Satara and a cost of Rs 140 Crores. Support is being given to fishermen under the programme to develop their skills and raise their productivity. Facility for processing, grading and packaging of fish will be developed at Paradeep Port. In addition to this, 111 waterways are being developed as National Waterways. River Ganga, Brahmaputra, Barak are already under development. Water transport will reduce logistics costs, which in turn will benefit the food processing industry. The development of River Ganga and Brahmaputra for transport will also make it easier to move our produce to Bangladesh. Further, the efficiency of the 12 major ports has been growing rapidly, and they have been making profits consistenty over the last three years. Dry ports are being developed at Jalna, Vidarbha and Nasik to begin with. The availability of ports will give a boost to movement of goods.

In addition to developing the road and water transport infrastructure, Shri Gadkari informed that the government is also giving priority to developing micro or drip irrigation in the water deficient regions of the country. 13 river linking projects are also on the anvil of which three will be done within three months. All these projects will improve the availability and  utilization of water and raise agricultural productivity.

                Hon’ble Prime Minister launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) on 20th November, 2016 from Agra.  A target of completing one crore new houses by 31st March, 2019 was set. Of these, 51 lakh houses are to be completed by 31st March, 2018.

To meet the challenge of assisting 51 lakh Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) beneficiaries in construction of their homes by March, 2018, the Ministry of Rural Development, in partnership with the State Governments, has taken many steps, including setting month-wise target for completion of houses. The target for completion of 10 lakh houses by November, 2017 has been achieved on 29th November, 2017, i.e. before the appointed date for completion of 10 lakh houses. It is expected that 15 lakh houses will be completed by 31st December 2017; 25 lakh houses by 31st January, 2018; 35 lakh houses by 28th February, 2018 and 51 lakh houses by 31st March, 2018.

Towards meeting the target of construction of 51 lakh houses by March, 2018, while 56.90 lakh beneficiaries have been sanctioned houses, 51.39 lakh beneficiaries have received 1st instalment, 31.03 lakh beneficiaries have nearly reached roof-cast levels and for 16.05 lakh beneficiaries the house construction is nearing completion. States like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, who have highest number of PMAY-G beneficiaries, are on course for completion of PMAY-G houses within the prescribed time-frame.

The faster completion of quality houses has been assisted by payment of assistance directly into the beneficiary account through IT-DBT platform. To ensure good quality of house construction, Rural Mason Trainings have been organized to facilitate availability of trained masons in the rural areas. Space technology and IT platforms are being used to monitor complete cycle of house construction, right from identification of beneficiary to construction stages of houses to completion and each stage is being geo-tagged. States have taken adequate steps to ensure continuous availability of construction material at reasonable prices so that the pace and quality of construction is not adversely affected.

PMAY-G houses with facilities like toilet, LPG connection, electricity connection, drinking water etc., are changing the countryside at a faster pace. While in some states houses under PMAY-G are coming up in clusters / colonies (generally for landless beneficiaries), at other places they are being constructed on the beneficiary’s land. House designs prepared by UNDP-IIT, Delhi or by the concerned states have been made available to beneficiaries to choose the house designs that they like. Bouquet of house designs has resulted in technically sound houses of different designs coming up in rural areas which are a treat to watch.

The progress of PMAY(G) is in public domain and can be seen by any one on awaassoft.nic.in  with geo-tagged photographs and complete details of beneficiaries and payments made to them.

                Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) on 11th October, 2014. This was aimed at improving the wellbeing of selected Gram Panchayats (GPs) through convergence of programmes under the overall guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The Yojana is about improving access to public services and community action for social and economic development so that these villages become role models worth emulation by neighboring Gram Panchayats. A total of 19732 new projects taken up as part of the Village Development Plan in SAGY villages have been completed and another 7204 are under implementation.

703 Hon’ble Members of Parliament selected their GPs and focused on overall development with community participation in these Gram Panchayats. In many States, the support of State Government facilitated convergence in programmes and activities leading to many significant improvements in indicators of social development like Open Defecation Free (ODF), 100% immunization, 100% enrolment in ICDS Centers etc. The implementation was given a thrust by States such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In other States also, initiatives were taken to improve the quality of life in the selected Gram Panchayats. As a result, an overall increase of 13% - 19% has been found in SAGY villages with regard to immunization, farmers with Soil Health Cards, women brought into SHGs and new Jan Dhan accounts.

Every Hon’ble Member of Parliament is expected to develop 3 (three) Gram Panchayats by March 2019. Presently, work is going on in 1235 Gram Panchayats. There was no timeline decided regarding selection of third Gram Panchayat. An analysis of performance of 35 development indicators in these villages shows that there has been a significant increase in provision of houses, internal village roads, household electrification, household latrines and piped water supply in many of the villages selected under SAGY. Of the data analyzed for 649 SAGY Gram Panchayats, it was found that 330 of them have reported 100% immunization in 0 to 6 age group, 300 have reported that every child has received ICDS services, 128 Gram Panchayats have become Open Defecation Free, 284 Gram Panchayats have reported no malnutrition in Grade-III or Grade-IV category and 445 Gram Panchayats have reported 100% coverage in provision of mid-day meals. Many social events like health camps, youth mobilization camps, yoga camps, plantation drives, women self-help groups, camps for support for differently abled persons etc. were organized by the initiatives of Hon’ble Members of Parliament.

Every SAGY Gram Panchayat has drawn up a Village Development Plan which is under implementation through convergence and additional prioritization by Central and State Governments. As many as 21 central schemes have already amended their guidelines or enabled priority for the SAGY Gram Panchayats. Most SAGY villages now have been taken up by State Governments as a part of Mission Antyodaya for significant improvement in sustainable livelihoods of poor households in these Gram Panchayats. All these Panchayats have been ranked for intervention to remove development gaps through a partnership of Central, State and Local Governments. It is envisaged that all these selected SAGY Gram Panchayats will have much better indicators on parameters ranging from physical infrastructure to human development and economic activities by March, 2019.

                Hon’ble Prime Minister launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) exactly one year ago on 20th November, 2016 from Agra. A target of completing one crore new houses after beneficiary registration, geo-tagging and account verification by 31st March, 2019 was set. Of these, 51 lakh houses had to be completed by 31st March, 2018.

After the launch, it took few months to complete the process of beneficiary registration, geo-tagging, account verification etc. 55.85 lakh houses have already been sanctioned and work is under progress. Nearly 30 lakh of these houses have reached roof level of construction and 15 lakh of these houses are at finalization level. As on 20th November, 2017, 9.03 lakh houses have already been completed. It is expected that 10 lakh PMAY(G) homes will be completed by 30th November, 2017, 15 lakh houses by 31st December 2017, 25 lakh houses by 31st January, 2018, 35 lakh houses by 28th February, 2018 and 51 lakh houses by 31st March, 2018. States like Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and West Bengal have completed a large number of houses.

New designs, local construction material, use of technology through rural mason training, geo-tagging of assets and payment directly into the account of beneficiary through IT-DBT platform have ensured transparent, hassle-free and quality programme implementation. All States and UTs are trying very hard to facilitate beneficiaries to complete their homes on time. The use of Socio Economic Census (SECC 2011), validation by Gram Sabha and use of Space Technology for geo-tagging has ensured that there are least inclusion errors and it is only the homeless and those living in one kuccha room with kuccha roof or two kuccha rooms with kuccha roof are the beneficiaries of this pro-poor programme. Technology has been used to empower the poor. The homes are designed by the best of institutions after studying the existing local design typologies and are constructed by beneficiaries as per their need. These homes are not only changing the rural landscape but also bringing about a social transformation in villages across the country. The poor are getting safe homes and can live with dignity with facilities like toilet, LPG connection, electricity connection, drinking water facility etc. The governance reforms under PMAY(G) and the impact of higher demand of steel and cement on growth is being studied by the National Institute of Public Finance & Policy, New Delhi. The Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee will undertake a study on actual use of new designs, impact of rural mason training, local materials and new technologies under PMAY(G). A study on social transformation is being commissioned separately to understand the impact of a good housing programme. The progress of PMAY(G) can be seen by any person on Awaassoft.nic.in platform with geo-tagged photographs and complete details of beneficiaries and payments made to them.

                The Government in the year 2017-18 provided highest ever allocation of Rs. 48,000 crores at BE stage for MGNREGA. In the year, the allocation to the Department also crossed more than One lakh crores for all programmes put together at Rs. 1,05,442 crores. The Ministry of Rural Development has been able to ensure payment of wages to the workers within 15 days in 85 percent of the cases as compared to only 37 percent in 2015-16 and 42 percent in 2016-17 on account of increased allocation for MGNREGA at BE Stage.

The second phase of releases to the states, which starts in September of every year depends on States fulfilling conditions specified in General Financial Rules, which relate to complete financial scrutiny including submission of audited report for the previous financial year. This was reiterated by the Government to the States repeatedly in the past few months. The Ministry of Rural Development has already released second installment for MGNREGA wage payment and material payment to the States which have submitted their audited statements on account for year 2016-17. Over the last ten days funds have been released to Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim and Tamil Nadu. Release of funds to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are being processed as the papers have been received very recently. Funds for wage payments and other activities would be released to the States immediately on receipt of audited statements of account, once they are found in order. In a good monsoon year, demand for MGNREGS wage employment slows down in the August to November period. Due case has been taken to ensure fund flows in States and Districts that have deficient rainfall. The Government is committed to maintaining high level of timely payment and additional funding, if required, would be provided for MGNREGA at the time of supplementary budgets.

It is also pertinent to point out that in the overall development strategy for rural areas, Central Government has also significantly increased it allocation under DAY-NRLM, PMGSY, PMAY(G) and all other initiatives. A record number of one crore new houses under PMAY(G) are to be completed by December, 2018. By March, 2018, 51 lakh such houses will be completed. Already nearly eight lakh houses are complete and work is going on in the remaining 43 lakh houses at an advanced stage. PMGSY now spends nearly Rs. 29,000 crore a year including State share. Through significant speeding up of implementation, nearly 85 percent of the eligible habitations (population of 500 in plain areas and 250 in hill areas) have already been connected by all weather road. This was at 57 percent three and a half years ago. The target of 100 percent connectivity by March, 2019 is being rigorously followed and is likely to be nearly achieved. Under DAY-NRLM, thrust has been on livelihood diversification and current level of SHG bank linkage is over Rs. 47 thousand crore, which is more than double the amount where it stood two and half years ago. Other rural development initiatives are also generating employment in rural areas and it is for this reason that real wage rates in Rural India have registered a significant increase. Resources under Swachh Bharat Mission, Fourteenth Finance Commission and many other initiatives for rural areas are also contributing to higher availability of wage employment in rural areas.

                The 33rd Asia Pacific Metrology Program General Assembly and Related Meetings 2017 (APMP GA 2017) are being held at CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi during November 24 -December 01, 2017.  



 

            On this occasion, a symposium on “Indian Strategy for Quality Infrastructure” was inaugurated by  Minister of Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan. President, International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) Dr. Milton Martin, presided over the function. Chairperson, Asia Pacific Metrology Program(APMP) Dr. T. Toshiyuki and several other dignitaries were also present.

 

CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, (CSIR-NPL) is the National Metrology Institute (NMI) of India and has responsibility of realization, establishment, maintenance and dissemination of Indian Primary Standards to the nation, at par to the international level, through R & D and most up-to-date technologies. This has been mandate by the Act of Parliament.

As the NMI, CSIR-NPL is responsible for the highest level of time and frequency measurements in India, maintenance and dissemination of Indian Standard Time (IST) and keeping it traceable to the International organizations including International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).

International Atomic Time, TAI is the coordinated reference time established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) at Paris and it is not a physical clock. It is a system time or a “paper clock”, calculated using more than 450 clocks in approximately 75 laboratories around the globe as a weighted mean value.  Universal Coordinated Time or UTC is also derived based on atomic time, but its time is adjusted by 1sec after certain time to keep it in phase with Universal Time, UT, which is based on the Earth’s rotation around its own axis. A time scale is defined by a starting point and is thereafter continuously accumulated in time units. CSIR-NPL maintains a timescale to realize its local UTC, known as UTC (NPLI) which is traceable BIPM. 

The present timescale consists of five high performance Cesium clocks, one active Hydrogen Maser and those are contributing to International Atomic Time (TAI) maintained by BIPM.  CSIR-NPL providing time and frequency traceability link to different sectors within the country using different advanced technologies like Two-way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) and Common View Global Navigational Satellite System (CVGNSS). Over several decades CSIR-NPL also providing a service of IST dissemination through internet and telephone for the use of public and government sectors. 

Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), CSIR-NPL is providing Time and Frequency Traceability from the National Time Scale of CSIR-NPL to IRNWT-I and IRNWT-II of ISTRAC/ISRO for synchronizing Indian regional navigational satellite system (NAVIC) with the IST. Additionally, the accurate time as per the international standard has many more applications in advanced technologies and sciences. As for example navigation, meteorology, surveillance, electronic transaction, online trade and so on relies on IST at various accuracy levels from few ns to few 100 ms. Upcoming state of the art scientific activity, LIGO India, a very large baseline radio telescope and neutrino detection experiment also requires accurate time synchronization.

India’s indigenously developed global positioning system called NavIC, has been   configured to synchronize its clocks to time provided by the CSIR-NPL.  Till recently, the satellites on the NavIC managed by ISRO, relied on US-based GPS system.  The linking with CSIR-NPL will aid in high precision satellite based communication, precise guidance of missiles and navigation.

The event is being attended by.more than 350 delegates from 31 countries around the world.

                In order to combat the growth of green house gas emission, the world is fast moving to the increased use of renewable energy sources.  However, there is increased concern that high penetration of renewable energy can cause disruptions in the existing power network due to their intermittent nature.  Technology solutions are, therefore, needed to address the challenges related to development design, integration, operation and management of grids which allows use of upto 100 percent renewable energy.

 

            Mission Innovation challenge on Smart Grids is collectively working to enable future smart grids powered by renewables.  20 participating countries with India, Italy and China as Co-lead are working together to realise this aspiration.  An international workshop is being organised during 16-19th November, 2017 at New Delhi to define research priorities and develop action plan for time bound action for realisation of these objectives. 

 

The Technical meeting of the event was inaugurated by Secretary-DST on 16th November, 2017 in presence of several dignitaries including Directors of IIT-Delhi and IIT-Roorkee. The participating countries Australia, China, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, India, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, United States of America , United Kingdom will present the status on smart grids.  With this background, the participants will deliberate on research needs and potential for collaboration in the domains of regional grids, distribution grids, micro-grids and cross innovations.  The modalities for greater private sector participation and enabling mechanisms will also be discussed besides incentivising the performing research activities.  The participating countries will resolve on future action plan and finalise technical contours of the Mission Innovation. A panel discussion with industrial experts is also planned.    

 

The Public Workshop of the event will be held on 18th November, 2017 where the outcomes of brainstorming session would be disseminated to the larger stake holder forum.   The Minister of State for Science, Technology and Earth Sciences, Shri Y.S.Chowdary, and Minister for Power, Shri R.K.Singh will inaugurate the exhibition showcasing achievements of industrial as well as R&D communities in the area.  Both the Ministers will share their perspectives on the topic and will be supplemented by representatives from Co-lead countries as well as Directors of IITs (Delhi, Kanpur and Roorkee). 

 

A Report on “Mission Innovation Smart Grids” activities, strategies and vision will also be released.  India’s collaborative programmes with United States and United Kingdom on the theme will also be formally launched.  The Forum will adopt New Delhi Declaration and as an initial step in this direction, collaboration agreement between RSC Italy and IIT-Roorkee, India will be signed.

                Tissue Culture Industries, Farmers and Mission Directors of State Horticulture Mission/ Senior Officials of Horticulture Department in the State’s dealing with tissue culture plants/quality planting material interacted at a Stakeholder Meet on “National Certification System for Tissue Culture Raised Plants (NCS-TCP)” to identify the way forward to realize the full potential of this certification system which in unique, dynamic and comprehensive in nature.

Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology conducted the meetin New Delhi today to create awareness among all the Stakeholders particularly key Officials from Centre and State Government’s Agriculture and Horticulture Departments.

In his keynote address,Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Shri. S. K. Pattanayakstressed on a system in which all tissue culture material would be procured from accredited laboratories and the need for participation of states in such a system. He said that lndia is doing very well in tissue culture research and that scientific institutions of international repute is now open for Indian scientists for new research. He underlined the need for fund for popularization of tissue culture from the Ministry of Agriculture.

In his inaugural address, Secretary Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Professor K VijayRaghavan, highlighted the strong foundation of partnership between farmers and scientific community and added the need to have a well articulated project for new improved varieties for horticulture. Since India is the only country to develop this certification system, Professor VijayRaghavan pointed out that this progress can be used for building capacities in the neighbouring countries and that it would be an important step in science diplomacy.

Highlighting the structure and current status of NCS-TCP and the impact it has made on production of quality materials in different states, Dr RenuSwarup, Senior Advisor, DBT stressed on the need for popularising tissue culture plants across India by 2020 and enlisting the participation of the states in the process.

Government of India established the “National Certification System for Tissue Culture Raised Plants (NCS-TCP)” authorizing Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology as the Certification Agency vide the Gazette Notification dated 10thMarch 2006 under the “Seeds Act, 1966” for ensuring production and distribution of quality tissue culture planting materials.

With increasing demand for agricultural, forestry, plantation and horticulture crops, the demand for high quality, high yielding, disease free planting stock has been increased significantly over the last two decades. Conventional propagation method which includes sowing of seeds, propagation by cutting, layering etc suffers from the inherent limitations in the number that can be produced, non-uniformity of quality and incidence of diseases. Plant Tissue Culture has emerged as an important biotechnology and commercially viable tool to multiply elite varieties of high quality, disease free and high yielding plants rapidly in the laboratory irrespective of the season of the year. In India the tissue culture Industry is growing at a rate of 15% per annum.

The purpose of NCS-TCP is to ensure production and distribution of quality tissue culture planting materials. NCS-TCP isa unique quality management system, first of its kind in the world which ensures recognition of Tissue Culture Production Facility for the production of quality planting material and certification of end products.

NCS-TCP has made significant impact in the last one decade of its implementation. Currently, around 80 Companies are recognized. Two Referral Centre’s andfive Test Laboratories are accredited under this system. The recognized companies are eligible for getting their planting material certified from the Accredited Test Laboratories. So far, more than 275 million Tissue Culture plants have been certified through this system.

                Science and Technology Ministers of India and UK reviewed the progress made in the India-UK partnership in science, technology and innovation which has been significantly intensified under the Newton-Bhabha programme. Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr. Harsh Vardhan, had a meeting with UK Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation Mr. Jo Johnson in New Delhi today.

Based on the shared principles of co-funding, co-development and co-creation multiple agencies both in India and UK are seamlessly contributing to the multifaceted cooperation which covers the three strands of people, project and translational research partnerships. Both the Ministers reiterated the spirit and essence of the Newton-Bhabha program which underlines that the scientific knowledge creation and its application is directed for the welfare of both the nations. In this context, Dr. Harsh Vardhan remarked that “harnessing science and technology for a better future of our people is the new spirit which drives the present Indo-UK cooperation.”

In November 2016, UK was the partner country in the Technology Summit which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Theresa May. Speaking in the event, our PM had remarked “today, the world is at an inflection point where technology advancement is transformational and it is vital that India and the United Kingdom, two countries linked by history, work together to define the knowledge economy of the 21st century”. Towards achieving this goal several major initiatives have been recently launched as a part of the multifaceted collaboration in STI between India and the UK. These include projects on Energy Efficient Building Materials as a part of green initiative with co-investment of £ 8.4 million. Indo-UK Clean Energy Virtual Centre has been established with leading academic centres in India and UK to work on advanced R&D in Solar Energy, Storage and Grid Networks.

The two Ministers welcomed the release of the scoping Indo-UK report on Antimicrobial Resistance which has been prepared to launch a virtual research centre to address the increasingly serious threat to public and animal health in both countries. To study the impact of atmospheric pollution on Human Health a programme has been launched and first campaign for taking observation in Delhi is scheduled to begin soon.

Under Industrial R&D programme India and UK have made visible progress with support to 10 joint projects led by industries from both sides towards co-development of Clean Technologies and Affordable Healthcare devises.

In the meeting between the Science Ministers, it was also informed that the India-UK Frontiers of Science Symposium is planned for summer of 2018 in UK which will bring the future science leaders across disciplines for brainstorming the future direction of the bilateral cooperation.

                Mr President, Secretary General, Your Excellencies, distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

At the outset, I would like to congratulate the new President and his team on their election yesterday. It is indeed an honour and privilege to stand here today to share with this distinguished audience regarding our maritime heritage and the initiatives taken by our Government in the maritime sphere. 

India’s ancient trade and cultural ties with Mesopotamia, Mediterranean rim countries; South East Asia, China, Middle East and Africa are testimonial to our rich maritime heritage. India has a large coastline of 7500 Kms., inland waterways of 20,000 Kms., over 200 major and minor ports and increasing ship building, ship repair and ship recycling facilities. 

India is also strategically located in the corridor through which substantial part of the east-west seaborne traffic flows.India has about one thousand four hundred vessels with Gross Tonnage of about 12.2 million. In addition, India has a large number of inland and near-coastal vessels. Nearly 90% of India’s overseas trade by volume is carried through ships of which 92% is carried by foreign flag vessels. 

With the Indian economy poised to grow faster, our Government is alive to the possibility of a quantum jump in the maritime activities on the Indian Coasts. We are upgrading our infrastructure and reforming the regulatory framework for ease of doing business. SAGARMALA, our flagship programme launched in 2015 for port led development, has four limbs, namely, port modernization and new port development; port connectivity; port led industrialization; and port community development. Under this programme, 6 new major ports, 150 projects to modernize existing ports including construction of new berths, and 130 projects in rail & road sectors for last mile connectivity have been identified requiring investment of $100 BILLION by 2025, of which, about 40 BILLION dollars already stands spent. 111 inland waterways fit for river navigation have been identified, of which 32 will be developed in the first phase at an estimated investment of $800 million. These projects provide major investment opportunities for the International Community. 

Distinguished delegates, India has benefitted immensely from the free and frank deliberations and exchange of ideas in IMO. As we expand our maritime activities, the guidance of IMO will become even more valuable. India has been one of the founder members of IMO and has been part of the IMO Council since then, except in 1983-84. In Category B of the Council, India represents the developing world and the nations with the largest share in international sea borne trade. 

Dr.C.P. Srivastava, IMOs longest serving Secretary General from 1974 to 1989 remains the most important face of India’s commitment to the IMO’s activities. His contribution in establishing World Maritime University, Sweden, International Maritime Academy, Italy, and International Maritime Law Institute, Malta will always be remembered. 

The world’s premier ship recycling facility is located at Alang Sosiya, in Gujarat, where nearly half of the world’s scrapped ships are recycled. To make ship recycling industry safe for its workers and the surrounding environment, a draft legislation to implement the Hong Kong Convention is now undergoing pre-legislative consultations and I am confident that we would ratify this convention in not so distant future. 

India has more than Four Hundred Thousand seafarers who are the preferred choice for specialized vessels. India provides the services of its expert manpower for Member State Audit Scheme, Goal Based Standards (GBS), and Working Groups etc. Capt. Radhika Menon, from India became the first woman in the world to receive IMO’s Award for Exceptional Bravery, 2016. 

Distinguished delegates, 

India is a key player in the space technology with the distinction of launching into orbit a record breaking 104 nano satellites, from a single rocket on 14th Feb, 2017. I am happy to note, that application of “Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System or IRNSS” in the maritime field is being pursued in IMO. I am sure, the maritime community will benefit with the induction of this additional new facility. India became the largest contributor to IOPC Funds this year, and has accepted the position of Vice Chair of the Executive Committee of the IOPC Funds and is in its Joint Audit Body. 

The Maritime India Summit, 2016 was attended by 5000 delegates from 42 countries. India has signed agreements on Maritime Transport with 27 countries and many more will follow. India remains an observer member of the Arctic Council. 

The Indian Naval ships and aircrafts continue to escort merchant ships of all nations in the Gulf of Aden. Even though there have been no successful hijackings of commercial vessels since May 2012, in the waters east of 65 degrees longitude, India continues to participate in all global forum to eradicate piracy in the Somalia region. India has been elected as a Co-chair for Working Group 1 of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS). 

India has an efficient and vigilant Search and Rescue (SAR) set-up and has made commendable efforts to rescue seafarers in distress situations in the Indian SAR area, covering the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. The launch of IRNSS will further strengthen our SAR efforts. 

Distinguished delegates, 

India is committed to contribute to various efforts & initiatives of the IMO for a safe, efficient, clean and secure maritime transportation for the benefit of mankind. India is hereby putting forward her candidature for a re-election to the Council of the IMO in Category-B representing the developing countries and countries with the largest interests in international sea borne trade. In the event of India being re-elected, it would rededicate herself, with renewed commitment towards the development of the objectives of IMO, and leverage the opportunity to further strengthen the implementation of the IMO instruments, for the accelerated & sustained growth of the global maritime community. 

Thank you.

                A world class Center of Excellence in Maritime and Ship Building (CEMS) is being set up by Ministry of Shipping in collaboration with  Siemens and Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) under the Ministry’s flagship Sagarmala Programme. CEMS will have  campuses at Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai, and will provide industry-relevant skill development, equip students with employable engineering and technical skills in the port and maritime sector and contribute to the Government of India’s ambitious Sagarmala programme. Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation had announced this at an event in Cochin last week. 

CEMS is being set up to meet the domestic skill requirement in ship design, manufacturing, operating and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO),  and  aims to become an international nodal centre in South Asia, attracting students from neighboring countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia for skill development in the Port and Maritime sector. 

This initiative also adds to the Make in India and Skill India efforts in the maritime sector. CEMS will provide skilled manpower to make vessels for inland waterways, ships, fishing boats and other ancillary manufacturing sectors. 

Siemens-a private sector entity is contributing technology, expertise and 87% funding for the center which is being made at a cost of Rs 766 crore.This is the first time such an in-kind grant is being made by Siemens in India. Siemens has also worked with state governments in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh on skilling initiatives. 

The Ministry of Shipping’s financial contribution is towards capex for procuring of machinery, creation of classrooms, workshop and labs etc., and is a one time-non recurring grant of 50.07 crore. An equivalent amount has been raised by Indian Register of Shipping. The land and building for Vishakhapatnam campus has been provided by Indian Maritime University (IMU) and that for Mumbai campus by IRS. 

CEMS will be run by Siemens for two years and thereafter by a Special Purpose Vehicle (a Section 8 nonprofit Company) promoted by IRS. Siemens will handhold this SPV in the third year. CEMS will have a unique hub and spoke delivery model providing industry relevant courses and creating a self sustaining platform. The training will be of two types: full time and co-curricular training (i.e along with regular courses in ITI and polytechnics and engineering colleges). The centre would operate on an open technology platform and provide scalable, modular and independent self learning interactive modules based on Digitally Advanced Interactive System. The total capacity of the COE is 10,512 students per year and the centre will offer paid courses for both domestic and international students but with fees far less than the current fees in the market. 

It is expected that CEMS will become a global  hub for quality skill development in the port and maritime sector and provide skilled manpower for India’s ship building and repair industry.

                The Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that Cochin is all set to become a global ship repair hub. He was speaking at Cochin today, after laying the  foundation stone for a Rs 970-crore International Ship Repair Facility (ISRF) for Cochin Shipyard Limited. The facility is being built at Cochin Port Trust where CSL has leased out a 40-acre plot for the project.



The International Ship Repair facility will be a State of the Art facility that can handle a major chunk of small and medium sized vessels plying in India. CSL will set up a ship lift system of size 130 m x 25 m with lifting capacity of 6000 tonnes and 6 work stations. The facility can repair up to 85 vessels, and CSL will thereby  be almost doubling the number of ships that can be repaired every year.             

Pointing out that this facility will help  boost India’s share in commercial ship repair market, Shri Gadkari said that the industry will also generate about 6000 direct and indirect jobs, besides giving rise to a number of ancillary industries in the state, thus having a multiplier effect on employment and economy.

Shri   Gadkari also inaugurated the conference Build The Ship – 2017 organized by the Ministry of Shipping in Cochin today.  The event deliberated upon  the recommendations of a study regarding the growth strategies  for promotion of Shipbuilding, Ship Design, Ship Repair and Marine Ancillaries in India.

 

At the conference the Minister  announced the start of Center of Excellence in Maritime and Shipbuilding(CEMS), a start up in skill development for maritime and shipbuilding sector. CEMS will have campuses at Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai. It is being set up by the Ministry of Shipping in collaboration  with  Siemens under the flagship programme Sagarmala. CEMS will provide industry-relevant skill development, equip students with employable engineering and technical skills in the port and maritime sector and contribute to the Government of India’s ambitious Sagarmala programme. It will help  meet the domestic skill requirement in ship design, manufacturing, operating and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and  aims to become an international nodal centre in South Asia, attracting students from neighboring countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia for skill development in the Port and Maritime sector. This initiative will also add  to the Make in India and Skill India efforts in the maritime sector. Shri Gadkari unveiled  the logo of CEMS at the launch event in Cochin today.

                The Ministry of Shipping has taken up projects worth Rs 2,302 crore for financial assistance under the Coastal Berth Scheme of the flagship Sagarmala Programme. The Ministry, after due appraisal in consultation with NITI Aayog and Department of Expenditure, has extended the period of the scheme for three years, upto 31st March, 2020 and expanded its scope to cover capital dredging at Major Ports and preparation of DPR for coastal berth project, in Oct 2017.

The projects under Coastal Berth Scheme of the flagship Sagarmala Programme are distributed over eight states with the highest number of projects in Maharashtra (12 projects), Andhra Pradesh & Goa (10 projects), Karnataka (6 projects), Kerala and Tamil Nadu (3 projects), Gujarat (2 projects) and West Bengal (1 project). Out of the 47 projects, 23 projects worth Rs 1075.61 crore have been sanctioned for total financial assistance of Rs 390.42 crore and Rs 230.01 crore has been released to Major Ports, State Maritime Boards and State Governments. The remaining 24 projects are under various stages of development and process of approval.

The most recent beneficiaries of the scheme were Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and Karnataka Government respectively for developing coastal infrastructure at Jawahar Lal Nehru Port, Karwar Port and Old Manglore Port. Rs 25 crore were sanctioned for construction of coastal berth (270m x 30m) at JNPT . Rs 114.4 crore were sanctioned for Karnataka Government for extension of the existing Southern breakwater by 145 metres, construction of a new North breakwater of 1160 metres, construction of coastal berths at Karwar port and construction of coastal berth an capital dredging at Old Manglore port .

The Coastal Berth Scheme aims to provide financial support to ports or state governments for creation of infrastructure for movement of cargo and passenger by sea or national waterways. The admissible financial assistance from Central Government is 50% of the total cost of the project subject to: (i) a maximum of Rs 25 crore for projects relating to construction/up-gradation of coastal berths by Major/Non-Major Ports, (ii) a maximum of Rs 10 crore for construction of platforms/jetties for hovercrafts & seaplanes by Ports/State Governments & passenger jetties in National Waterways and islands by State Governments, (iii) a maximum of Rs 15 crore for mechanization of berths by Major/Non-Major Ports (iv) a maximum of Rs 50 crore for capital dredging of Major Ports/operational Non-Major Ports ; and (v) a maximum of Rs 50 crore for construction of breakwater for existing and Greenfield Ports. The financial assistance will also be provided for the preparation of DPRs for the projects to be considered under this scheme. The construction of passenger jetties also includes construction of terminal building and allied infrastructure. The balance expenditure has to be incurred by the respective Ports/ concerned State Governments (including State Maritime Boards) from their own resources.

Once completed, the projects will help to promote coastal shipping and increase its share in domestic cargo movement in India. Better infrastructure for coastal shipping will decongest rail and road network besides ensuring cost competitive and effective multi-modal transportation solution. The country has high potential to use coastal shipping for its internal cargo movement given its 7500 kms long coastline.

                The share of water based transport in modal mix to double by 2025 under Sagarmala



The Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari digitally flagged off a consignment of 230,000 tonnes of steel cargo from Vizag port to Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Kochi through coastal shipping route today. Speaking on the occasion the Minister informed that Rastriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) was, till now, transporting its products to 22 stockyards through road and rail mode. Coastal transportation of these products will now help save 380 million tonne km of rail transportation per annum and bring down logistics costs, he said. This is especially significant since RINL has doubled its production capacity to 6.3 million tonnes per annum, and to cater to the increased volumes it is important to economize on transportation costs to be globally competitive. The Minister further urged all other manufactures to make use of coastal shipping for transporting goods as this can be a key enabler for reduction of logistics cost for domestic and EXIM trade of India.

Coastal movement has been on RINL’s radar for a long time because of its proximity to the ports and to ease the pressure from the over optimized road and rail systems.  RINL recently finalised a one year Multi Modal Transportation contract covering end to end logistics from plant at Visakhapatnam to its stockyards at Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Kochi. The Rs.75 crores annual contract has been awarded to the consortium led by M/s Shreyas Shipping & Logistics Ltd, Mumbai, a member of Transworld Group, Dubai. The contract involves taking delivery of material from plant, shifting by road to VPT or GPL, shipping the material by sea to a port near the stockyard and finally delivering the material to RINL Stockyard. The quantities expected to be transported are 90000 T, 75000 T and 60000 T to Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Kochi stockyards respectively.

 

Movement of cargo through coastal shipping has inherent advantages over land modes of transport such as road and rail as it is more cost effective, causes much less pollution, reduces congestion on land and can cater to huge parcel sizes .   In view of this, Government of India has initiated several measures for promoting coastal movement.  The Sagarmala project is one of the strategic and customer-oriented initiatives to modernize India's ports to augment coastal movement so that ports become drivers of economic growth. Globally countries such as China and Netherlands have achieved a modal share of 24% for coastal shipping and inland water navigation.  Increasing the share of coastal shipping and inland navigation in the transport modal mix is one of the key objectives of the Sagarmala Project.  Sagarmala programme envisages to double current share of coastal shipping in India’s overall modal mix from 6% to 12% by 2025.

The Government has taken several steps to promote coastal shipping. Vishakhapatnam Port Trust has totally removed CHD levy on steel cargo from earlier 265% to boost shipment of steel cargo. 40% concession on vessel related and cargo related charges are applicable for such coastal movement. For coastal movement through RoRo vessels, 80% concession on vessel related and cargo related charges are applicable in Indian Ports. As a result of the efforts by the government, container tonnage has increased from 351276 DWT in 2015 to 654883 DWT as on 31st October 2017, a positive increase of 86%. 14 Indian flag container fleet with DWT of 31,846 have been added after the tax on bunker fuel for Indian flag container vessels was abolished in 2015.  21 projects worth Rs. 729.6 Cr have been provided financial assistance of Rs. 205 Cr under the Coastal Berth scheme in Sagarmala to promote the development of dedicated infrastructure for coastal shipping of goods and passengers across India’s Major and Non-Major ports.

Shri Gadkari said that this new era of transport will give a boost to the economy, encourage industrial growth, create more employment and raise the GDP of the country.

Chaudhary Birendra Singh, Union Minister of Steel was also present at Vizag Port. He lauded the efforts of the Shipping Ministry in ensuring that ports and waterways ably support the transport requirements of the steel industry. He said that the growth of ports would help the steel industry immensely.

                To promote Government of India’s ambitious ‘Make in India’ programme and to encourage domestic shipbuilding by providing a level playing field vis-a-vis foreign shipyards, the Government had approved the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy for Indian Shipyards in December 2015. This policy provides Rs. 4000 Crores financial assistance to shipyards for 10 years for contracts secured between 01.04.2016 and 31.03.2026 (including these dates).

 

The Shipyards Association of India had raised certain issues with regard to the previous web application which had been launched in June 2016 for processing applications for financial assistance under the policy. The Ministry of Shipping held a series of consultations with the stakeholders and has now rolled out an updated version of the web application, along with an amended set of guidelines, for applying under the policy.

 

Under the amended guidelines, increased numbers of days are now available with the shipyards to apply under the policy, as well as to obtain and submit valuation reports. The updated web application also generates a wider choice of international valuers by whom the valuation of a vessel can be carried out.

 

The upgraded version of the web application will be administered and monitored by the Directorate General of Shipping, Mumbai.

A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed here today between National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Tourism and Hospitality Sector Skill Council (THSC) with Airbnb, the world’s leading community-driven hospitality company.   The MoU will provide hospitality skills training to hospitality micro-entrepreneurs in India.   Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri  Dharmendra Pradhan said, “We believe that this partnership will help to augment Skill India Mission by bringing in global best practices for the training of small hospitality entrepreneurs. The domestic tourism has immense potential in India and this partnership will benefit the ecosystem by creating opportunities for women and youth.  We will extend all possible cooperation to make India a tourism hotspot.”

Regional Director of Policy for India, Southeast Asia and ANZ, Mr. Brent Thomas said, “This partnership will help to create more skilled, digitally-literate hospitality entrepreneurs - especially among the women and those in underserved areas - who can create a homestay in every home, offer authentic experiences in every Indian locality and help spread the benefits of tourism”.  

The signing of MoU is in line with the Government’s endeavor to promote entreprenuership under the Government’s Skill India Programme. NSDC is the implementation arm of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. 

Through the partnership, the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Airbnb, NSDC and THSC will work together to create an accredited skill development module for hospitality entrepreneurs offering homestay facilities, unique accommodations and local experiences.

Building on Airbnb’s commitment to support Skill India Mission by creating 50,000 hospitality entrepreneurs in India, the MoU signed today aims to empower more citizens, including those in rural and underserved areas to join the ‘alternate accommodation’ sector and pursue new livelihood opportunities by sharing their homes.

 

 

Under the terms of the MoU, the parties agree to:


	ESTABLISH occupation standards and competency matrices for job roles and develop the courses for hospitality entrepreneurs offering homestay and facilities, other unique accommodations and local experiences for travellers;
	CREATE standards for certification and accreditation as per the requirements and global benchmarks of Tourism and Hospitality industry for hospitality entrepreneurs offering homestay facilities, other unique accommodations and local experiences for travellers;
	SET the framework for long-term Council-Industry partnership;
	STRENGTHEN the Skilled Labour Pool required by Tourism and Hospitality industry.

                Embarking on an ambitious mission to empower Indian youth with skill training and employability, the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE)today hosted the National Entrepreneurship Awards 2017 marking the completion of three glorious years of its inception today.  The awards were conferred in the august presence of Minister of Finance and Minister of Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Ambassador of Japan to India Shri Kenji Hiramatsu, Secretary MSDE Dr K.P Krishnan and Managing Director & CEO, ICICI Bank Ltd Ms Chanda Kochhar.



 

 

Congratulating all the entrepreneurs recognized by MSDE this year and highlighting the challenges of limited job creation capacity, Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley said, “India has a much younger population versus other advance economies. This is a huge opportunity for us to scale up and skill our workforce and reap our demographic dividend and service economies. Conventionally our focus was on awarding degrees with always a debate on how we link them to jobs. Over a period of time we have realised that we need to skill our youth for these jobs.”

 

He further added “Conventionally people were skilled according to their communities but as economies develop and there is advent of technology, we need to realize the importance of reskilling and upskilling, to bridge the demand supply gap. As the economy expands, a specialized skilled workforce is the need to the hour. “

 

“The Strength of India’s economy will be entrepreneurship. We have to ensure that we do not restrict the youth. We let them unleash their energy, allow them to move away from the beaten track and build new ideas for the new India,” he further added.

 

Speaking on the occasion Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, said, “India has become an emerging market for global investors and entrepreneurship can majorly contribute to the country’s economy. Skill development and entrepreneurship form the basis for the growth of any country. Our endeavour is to empower our youth and equip them with the right skill sets and create a conducive environment to help them build sustainable business solutions/model. In the years to come, entrepreneurship will be the key to attain a double-digit GDP.”

 

“A stable business environment, market-oriented reforms like raising of FDI caps, implementation of GST, and key initiatives like Make in India, Mudra Yojana, Stand up India and Start Up India are encouraging aspiring and ambitious Indians. The youth should leverage them,” he further added.

Sharing his message MoS MSDE Shri Anantkumar Hegde said, “For thousands of years, the nation’s economy was run on what our people made or produced with their hands – be it clothing from weavers or items from potters and blacksmiths or produce from farmers. All these were based on the inherent entrepreneurship capabilities of the people of our great land. It is this entrepreneurial spirit the Government aims to tap into and bring the best out of our people. To achieve this goal, numerous programs have been launched encouraging entrepreneurship, including funding programs and other initiatives that can handhold entrepreneurs during the early years.”               

 

The National Entrepreneurship Awards (NEA) was instituted by MSDE in 2016 to encourage a culture of entrepreneurship across the country. This year the second edition of awards were conducted which saw participation from 2880 applicants out of which 45 were shortlisted; and finally 15 winners across defined categories, were announced and awarded. Winners were given a cash award of Rs 5 lakh (enterprises and individuals) and Rs. 10 lakhs (organizations/institutes) along with a certificate and trophy recognizing their efforts of being the change agents in India’s development.

 

The foundation day ceremony was well attended by senior delegates from the ministry, members of the Skill Sector Councils, leaders from Corporate India; successful and budding entrepreneurs among others.

 

On this occasion, National Quality Assurance Framework (NQAF) Manuals were released by National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) which will provides the benchmarks or quality criteria which the different organizations involved in education and training must meet in order to be accredited to provide education and training/skills activities.

 

Further, to encourage development of entrepreneurial skills among school students, course module on entrepreneurship was released for class IX and X.   Capturing success stories of entrepreneurs who have walked the extra mile to initiate positive changes, a compilation handbook ‘Swalamban ki Ore’ was also jointly released by National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD) and Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE).

                Union Minister for Social Justice & Empowerment Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot has headed the country’s delegation to attend the High Level Inter-Governmental Mid-point Review Meeting of Asia and Pacific Decade for Persons with Disabilities, 2013-2022 in Beijing from 27th November to 1st December, 2017.  The delegation includes Secretary of the Department and other senior officers.  This meeting is being organized by United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) in cooperation with Government of China.

The main objective of the meeting is to review the progress made by the member States during the decade at the mid-point in 2017 with regard to Incheon Strategy ‘to make the right real’ for persons with disabilities in Asia and Pacific.  Incheon Strategy has been adopted to achieve the goals mentioned in UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Another objective of the meeting is to discuss the future policy action for building disabilities-inclusive societies in the region, bearing in mind the synergies between the Incheon Strategy and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The Union Minister, while making India’s statement at the Mid-Point Review Meeting, stated that India is committed to the principle of unity in diversity and the goal of inclusive development encompassing all segments of society including persons with disabilities.  He invoked provisions of Indian Constitution which guarantees freedom, justice and equality to all individuals.  He mentioned that India has enacted a new law namely ‘Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016’ in line with the provisions of UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The law guarantees a number of rights and entitlements such as right to equality and non-discrimination, community life, protection from violence and inhuman treatment, access to justice, home and family and reproductive rights.  It mandates the provincial Governments to take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy their rights equally with others.  Some of the important affirmative actions under the said law include four per cent reservation in Government-aided higher educational institutes and five per cent reservation in poverty alleviation schemes and allotment of land for housing, setting up of business at concessional rate of interest, etc.

Shri Gehlot also mentioned that the Prime Minister of India has coined the word “Divyangjan”, i.e., “Persons with Divine Abilities” to address “Persons with Disabilities”.  Use of the word “Divyangjan” aims at uplifting societal status, promoting non-discrimination and instilling a positive attitude about their lives and capabilities in the society.

He also spoke about Accessible India Campaign which is a flagship programme launched to create barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities.  The campaign targets creation of physical and virtual infrastructure truly accessible to and inclusive of the persons with disabilities, and making public buildings, transport system and information and communication technologies accessible on a wide scale.  The Government is pursuing the programme with the States so as to achieve the target within a given timeframe.

The Union Minister stated that India remains committed to building an enabling environment for the persons with disabilities, to enable them to enjoy their rights equally with others, and to realize their full potential.  We are open to sharing best practices and international cooperation for empowerment and inclusion of persons with disabilities.

 He urged the member States to utilize this opportunity of mid-point review of the Asia Pacific Decade for persons with disabilities and come out with practicable National and Regional action plans to achieve the goal of inclusion of persons with disabilities in the mainstream society.  India would stand with the efforts made in this regard.

 In conclusion, Shri Gehlot that he is looking forward to finalization of Beijing Declaration which will pave the way for better implementation to achieve empowerment and inclusion of persons with disabilities.

ANNEXURE

Methodology of Estimation

 

(1)    Taxes on products at current prices

 

Taxes on products for compiling GDP include both GST and non-GST revenue.   GST revenue based on GSTR filings as provided by Central Board of Excise and Customs, Department of Revenue, Ministry Finance has been used. This include CGST, SGST, UTGST, IGST (domestic and imports), Cess (Domestic and Imports). The non- GST revenue include Central and State excise duties,  custom duties and sales tax on goods outside the tax base of GST like Crude oil, Petrol, Diesel, ATF& Natural gas and Alcohol for human consumption etc.

 

(2)    Taxes on products at constant prices

Present methodology of compiling constant price estimates of taxes on products by volume extrapolation has been adopted in line with the methodology prescribed under of System of National accounts, 2008. Volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes.

 

(3)    Estimating GVA from trade sector.

GVA from Trade sector is estimated using an index of turnover based on Sales tax. With introduction of GST, sales tax data is now subsumed under GST. In the GSTR-3B returns that are now being filed, total outward taxable supplies is available without HSN/SAC codes. This taxable value of outward supplies is inclusive of both services and goods.  Sales Tax/VAT is imposed on sale or purchase of goods. Till such time the taxable value of goods supplied become available from tax records, a comparable estimate of turn over based on sales tax will have to be estimated.  Following three approaches to project likely sales tax collection were examined.

 

(a)    Ratio of  Sales tax collected on specific products like  POL  which are outside the tax base of GST and the total sales tax  collected from 2014-15 onwards  were examined.  It was observed that the ratios were by and large stable. Using this relationship, likely sales tax collection for second quarter of 2017-18 was projected.   

 

(b)    Forecasting quarterly sales tax data for Q2 2017-18  based on  regression of  Sales tax on value of output of commodity producing sectors available from 2011-12 onwards. To account for seasonal fluctuations, seasonal dummy variables were used.

 

(c)    Estimating sales tax collection by using nominal growth in output of commodity producing sectors that are taxed.

 

 

The above three approaches were placed before the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS). The ACNAS recommended using an average of estimates obtained by adopting three approaches.

                The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), in collaboration with UNICEF, organised a two-day Regional Workshop on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on 2-3 November, 2017 in Guwahati. This Workshop is the fourth in the series of five Regional Workshops being organised for sensitisation of States on SDG Monitoring Framework. 

Speaking at the inaugural session, Chief Statistician of India and Secretary, MoSPI, Dr. T.C.A Anant, sharing the salient features of the SDGs and enhanced need for continuous and holistic monitoring, stressed that the SDGs have brought in a new set of responsibilities and challenges for the country’s Statisticians. SDGs require monitoring at National and State level in additional to the Global Monitoring by United Nations. The Workshop helped in identifying good practices from States’ implementation and monitoring of SDGs, so that other States can adopt/replicate these practices. He mentioned that MoSPI would be working in close collaboration with the State Governments to strengthen systems in measuring and monitoring SDG progress. 

While informing the States on the work in progress, Dr. Anant said, “The National SDG Indicators are being finalised following an elaborate consultation process with Ministries in Central Government, State Governments and other stake holders. It is a dynamic framework and a system to refine the framework also will be in place”. He also stressed the need for more investment in Data infrastructure in view of the new demand for data to monitor SDGs. 

Addressing the Workshop, Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Assam, Shri V B Pyarelal stated that the State of Assam is one of the first states to adopt SDGs as a policy for States development plans. He said detailed plans are in place to implement SDGs upto the grassroots level. They have established a Centre for SDGs to coordinate the SDG activities in the State Government and also foster research in collaboration with reputed institutions. 

Additional Director General, MoSPI, Shri Pravin Srivastava highlighted the salient features of the National Monitoring framework. He said the national SDG indicators will help the States to align their developmental schemes with the SDG goals and to build capacity to improve monitoring on progress of the national indicators. He also emphasised the need for strengthening the statistical system in the states using open standards so that there is regular data flow from States to monitor the SDGs using technological solutions to harness the data revolution in view of the SDGs. 

Policy, Planning and Evaluation (PPE) Specialist, UNICEF Delhi, Shri K D Maiti, informed that the Regional Workshop at Guwahati is the fourth such Regional Workshops. “These workshops would be helpful in developing a shared system of monitoring SDG progress at the national and state level” he added. 

The two days Workshop was attended by senior officers from the States of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. The outcome of the Workshop is to come up with documentation on the various initiatives being taken by the States towards SDG implementation and to share best practices.

                Alloy Steels Plant (ASP) of the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) today received the ""BEST PERFORMANCE VENDOR - 2017"" award from Ordnance Factory, Medak (OF-M) for indigenization, development and supply of import substitute steel plates. The steel plates in two categories, for which SAIL received the award, were supplied by Durgapur-based ASP, the special steels plant of SAIL. The award was received by Shri AK Patra, DGM I/c (Research & Control Lab.)/ SAIL-ASP, at the Ordnance Factory’s Vendors’ meet held in Medak. 

Plates made with two special-grade varieties of low- and medium-carbon steels developed at SAIL-ASP as import substitutes were supplied to OF-M for meeting the specific property requirements of defence applications, such as muzzle brake for cannons/barrels installed in infantry fighting amphibious vehicles and their bottom parts. Muzzle brake is a component that is fitted on top of the cannon or barrel that redirects propellant gases to counter recoil and unwanted rising of the barrel/cannon during rapid fire. Apart from meeting stringent chemical properties, the plates developed by SAIL-ASP also excel in matching physical attributes of plates like excellent surface finish and formability along with meeting the specified properties as stipulated in heat-treated conditions. 

SAIL-ASP has a diverse product portfolio of over 400 grades catering to critical end-use by strategic sectors such as Defence, Railways, Automobiles, Power plants and heavy engineering & manufacturing industries. For Defence applications, the plant manufactures high impact-resistant steels (armour-grade steels) and customized steels for naval applications. SAIL-ASP also has capability for manufacturing a variety of stainless steels products also. 

SAIL is pioneering the ‘Make in India’ campaign by producing world-class steel products in various categories and partnering the Make in Steel - Make in India vision of the Ministry of Steel. SAIL steel has been used in various prestigious national projects like the Dhola-Sadiya bridge, Sardar Sarovar Dam, Metro projects in various cities, Chenani-Nashri tunnel, Pamban railway sea bridge, Bandra-Worli sea link, etc. The company is increasing the share of value-added products in its product-mix to meet specific requirements of customers.

                Focusing predominantly on value added products, Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) is looking forward to offer an array of differentiated and quality products in market while focusing on value along with volume. During interaction with employees at SAIL’s Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) on Tuesday, Chairman, SAIL, Shri PK Singh said, in the prevailing stiff market competition, value addition to our products and processes along with tailoring the product quality and attributes in line with market demands rather producing only volume can be a game changer for us. He added that the state-of-the-art 1 MTPA (million tonne per annum) capacity Medium Structural Mill (MSM) installed at DSP is capable of producing world-class structural steel products which have a high demand for various on-going and upcoming infra and construction projects in India. Shri Singh also added that with Railways switchover to LHB coaches in a phased manner in next few years, wheels for new LHB railway coaches are in advanced stages of validation at DSP and the metallurgical testing of the wheels has already been completed.

At DSP, MSM is producing Parallel Flange Beams, Joists, Channels and Angles, which are primarily used by infrastructure and construction segments and considering the pick-up in infrastructure projects, metro connectivity, accelerated construction activities, Shri Singh said “These products are all expected to translate into increased demand for such value added Structurals. The Company is also tapping world market for exporting its products where there is a demand for these.’’ DSP is a plant designed to produce 7.5 lakh tonnes of Semis, where SAIL-DSP in association with R&D and Centre for Engineering & Technology (CET) will tap the huge market for special grade semis by targeting to produce 90% semis as special steel grades and tie up for value added products of special steel. The semis would also explore possibilities in transmission line towers (TLT) and forging areas, he said.

Emphasizing the importance of Research & Development and improving Project Designing, he said that, RDCIS and Centre for Engineering & Technology would contribute more in developing value-added products for the Plant.

                The Aadi Mahotsav, a celebration of the spirit of Tribal Culture, Craft, Cuisine and Commerce, came to a glittering conclusion at Dilli Haat, New Delhi, on the evening of 30th November, 2017. Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Shri Jual Oram was the Chief Guest at the closing ceremony of Aadi Mahotsav. Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs Ms. Leena Nair was specially present to grace the occasion. Managing Director, TRIFED Shri Pravir Krishna and other senior officials were also present on the occasion.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jual Oram expressed his happiness at the successful conduct of the Mahotsav. The Minister stated that through its 15 days of engagement with lacs of Delhi residents, the Mahotsav had shown to them the exquisite craftsmanship of tribal artisans. This event explored new horizons for tribals. The focus is on how tribals can get the good prices for their products. New Franchise and tie ups with e- commerce portals like Snapdeal and Amazon can boost their business. More outlay for TRIFED seems possible through the encouragement of public in this event. Minimum Support Price for tribal products is on the agenda. The Minister congratulated the Ministry and TRIFED for the wonderful arrangements made, which had won the hearts of all the participating Tribals and Delhites alike. 

 

The Secretary, Tribal Affairs, Ms. Leena Nair in her welcome speech thanked the Minister for his leadership and direction for organising the Aadi Mahotsav which gave a platform for almost 800 tribal artisans to showcase and sell their products in the big commercial world of Delhi. She stated that transactions of over Rs. 4.00 crores had been done by the tribals. She thanked all the Tribal Artisans and participants who had participated in the Mahotsav and hoped that they will continue to progress and benefit from the Government schemes. TRIFED would continue to showcase and promote their art before the Country and the World. 

 

Union Minister for Tribal Affairs, Shri Jual Oram launched TAM Squash- a non alcoholic drink developed by TRIFED & IIT-Delhi. The non alcoholic drink is made up of Tamarind, Mahua & Aawla. It is refreshing and good for overall health.

 

Later, Shri Jual Oram gave away the awards to the best performing groups and Regions in various categories like Textiles, painting, pottery, cane and bamboo, jewellery, metal, organic and natural food, popular cuisines and TRIFED regional offices.

 

 

Tribal artisans, for the first time in the history of Dilli Haat, engaged in digital transactions for which card readers were provided to all. The Minister commended TRIFED for introducing digital transactions and almost 30% of the transactions were through this route. All the Tribal Artisans were trained for using card readers by a special team from SBI. 

 

TRIFED has also entered into e-commerce transactions and TRIFED in future could sell the products through Amazon, Snapdeal, Flipkart and GEM (a Government of India portal of e-commerce) for which preparations are on. It is expected that sales on these portals should commence by January, 2018. 

 

A special scheme to provide loans from National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC) was also introduced during the Aadi Mahotsav. Each of the tribal entrepreneurs was interviewed with regard to their requirement of loan for expansion of their business. 106 cases are being considered and examined for providing loans at a special rate of 6% to tribal men and 4% for tribal women. 

 

The Tribal Artisans logged a sale of more than Rs.1.60 Crores during the fortnight, which is a record for this event by a long distance. TRIFED purchased goods worth Rs.2.50 crores from the Artisans for sale through its showrooms. The total sale of tribal artisans during the Mahotsav was Rs. 4.10 Crores. This is a very heartening feature for the tribal artisans who are extremely happy and have promised to participate in all future Mahotsavs with the same zeal. 

 

The success of the Mahotsav has encouraged M/o Tribal Affairs to organise another 15 such Mahotsavs in other State capitals of the Country in the coming months. TRIFED has invited Tribal artisans to display and sell their craft and cuisine at all these places. The next Mahotsav will begin in Jaipur from 1st December, 2017 and Bhopal from 16th December, 2017 followed by other States, finally concluding by middle of March, 2017.

 

Stage programs of tribal dances and folk songs conducted daily were a great attraction every evening. 85 Tribal Chefs from 25 states showcased tribal delicacies like Banjara Biriyani from Telangana, Khodiya Roti and Chicken from Orissa and delightful vegetarian and Non-vegetarian preparations from North East, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat and other States. The people of Delhi greatly relished them. Keeping in view the great demand for these preparations, it has been decided to continue these stalls at Tribes India, Mahadev Road. 

 

The Mahotsav organised at Dilli Haat, INA; Dilli Haat, Janakpuri, Central Park Rajiv Chowk, Baba Kharak Singh Marg, New Delhi had attracted more than 3 lakh people who enjoyed shopping, dining and the tribal cultural 2 programmes. North Central Zone Cultural Centre (NCZCC) brought almost 450 tribal artists from 25 States of the Country to present exquisite tribal dances, display of Martial arts and folk music. 

 

The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu inaugurated ‘Aadi Mahotsav’ - a fortnight long Tribal Festival with the theme of ‘A Celebration of the Spirit of Tribal Culture, Cuisine and Commerce on 16 Nov 2017 at New Delhi. The Union Minister of State for Home, Shri Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Sudarshan Bhagat; the Vice Chairperson, National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, Smt.

Speaking on the occasion the The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the tribal development is an important component to achieve the object of inclusive development (Sabka Vikas). He said that this festival will prove very useful to introduce this wonderful cultural heritage to all over India and the world. He further said that another advantage through this festival can be that the objects and artifacts made by tribals will have an opportunity to sell them and get financial benefits. Their efficiency will be rewarded in the form of economic prosperity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals. He further said that the tribes must be drawn to the mainstream, but at the same time it is important to ensure that their culture remains intact. Adivasis are the aboriginals and their way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Government seeks to promote interaction between the tribal artisans and the mainstream designers from reputed design organizations. He further said that events such as this Aadi Mahotsav are very important in this regard.  The Government has formed the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (Trifed) for achieving this, he added.

 

The Vice President congratulated the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED organizers of this Aadi Mahotsav. He invited the tribal artisans to make the best use of this opportunity to forge links with other artisans and market drivers.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Today, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the tribal brothers on the auspicious occasion of Aadi Mahotsav. Tribals are very dear, heartwarming people of Bharat Mata. Adivasi brothers and sisters have favored the life of our country with their melodious and joyful music, joy of pleasure, unique handicrafts.

 

This festival will prove very useful to introduce this wonderful cultural heritage to all over India and the world. Another advantage through this festival can be that the objects and artifacts you make will have an opportunity to sell them and you will also be able to get financial benefits. Your efficiency will be rewarded in the form of economic prosperity.

 

I hope that all of you will be able to take full advantage of this opportunity. I urge you to continue the effort that way so far you have preserved your cultural heritage. This is an invaluable heritage. It is very important to promote, disseminate and increase it. In this endeavor, the government is supporting and will give tribute to artistic creative enthusiasm, giving special attention to it.

 

The tribes constitute over 8% of the country’s population. This is a very significant number. In real terms it corresponds to over 10 crore Indians.  The national object of inclusive development (Sabka Vikas) includes the development of tribes as an important component. Our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals.

 

The Government has always treated the tribes with a special concern.  However, there are unique challenges in the field of tribal development.  This is because the tribes must be drawn to the mainstream, but at the same time it is important to ensure that their culture remains intact.

 

The attitude of urban mainstream towards the tribes is often characterized by a belief that we have a lot to teach the tribes to help them to develop. What we generally tend to forget is that in fact the tribes have a lot to teach urban India.  When we deal with the tribes, we must always keep an open mind.  We must maintain our humility.

 

What is special about the tribes? As the name of this event suggests, it is the ‘adi’ factor that is important about them. Adivasis are the aboriginals. Their way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity. The greatness of the tribes lies in this that they have managed to retain the primal skills and their natural simplicity. Their creations have a timeless appeal. The crudest tribal handicraft instantly touches a chord in all of us. This is also particularly true of tribal music and dance.

 

The tribes of India have a wide range of handicrafts. These include hand-woven cotton, wool and silk fabrics, woodcrafts, metal craft, terracotta, bead-work, masques and other objects. They also produce compelling paintings.

 

Government has rightly recognized the need to channel the artistic talents towards income generation. It is for this reason that the Government seeks to promote interaction between the tribal artisans and the mainstream designers from reputed design organizations. The idea is to expand the product range and designs. The synergy between these two can generate marketable products of art and handicraft for the top-end global market.

 

Single items of bell-metal produced by the late Jaideo Baghel of Kondagaon in Bastar sold for as much as five lacs of rupees! This only points to the fact that on the one hand there are skills in the tribal pockets of India, and on the other hand there is high-end demand in our cities and in the international market.

 

The need is to put two and two together for a win-win result. Events such as this Aadi Mahotsav are very important in this regard.  The Government has formed the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (Trifed) for achieving this.

 

I am happy that Trifed is doing significant work in this direction and have now embraced e-commerce and digital platforms to take the business forward.

 

Apart from handicrafts, the tribes gather from the forests a range of forest produces. These include various tree-borne products like flowers, fruits, seeds, barks and leaves; and various insect produces like honey.  All these are completely organic products.

 

We know that organic food products command a premium price. Trifed must tap this premium market which is a niche market. And, more importantly, Trifed must ensure that the benefit of higher prices accrues to the tribal. I understand that the scheme of minimum support price for forest produces has been expanded to cover all states and twenty four key products. The scheme now needs to be implemented in full earnestness.

 

I congratulate the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED organizers of this Aadi Mahotsav. I invite the tribal artisans gathered here to make the best use of this opportunity to forge links with other artisans and market drivers. I am happy to see the enthusiasm here and the colourful festive atmosphere. I hope in the times to come we will see more of such events.

Shri Jual Oram, Minister for Tribal Affairs  welcoming the Vice President stated that it was important to promote the trade of Tribal Artisans and to this effect the  Ministry had launched a number of programmes including Friends of Tribes Cards, opening of Franchises outlets and given a big push to Retail Trade through exhibitions and opening of new retail outlets.  He said that the Ministry was targeting to achieve a target of  Rs. 100 crores in sales of tribal products to raise tribal incomes. TRIFED has achieved a turnover of Rs. 20 Crore in the sale of tribal products this year. TRIFED has also entered  the Electronic and Digital era and signed MoUs with leading e-commerce portals including GeM, a Government of India portal for e-commerce.   Tribes India outlets accept payments by credit card and swipe machines to promote digital transactions.  Tribals in Aadi Mahotsav have been trained for use of modern retail machines.

 

Shri Sudarshan Bhagat, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs  in his address stated that there was a need to promote MSP for MFP in the country so that the tribals get a fair price and the Ministry is making all out efforts for the same.  He stated that there is a great potential  for value addition  in this scheme including in his own State, Jharkhand and in the rest of the Country.  The scheme had the potential to double and triple the tribal incomes. He also said that every year we celebrate Birsa Munda’s anniversary but this year we have celebrated it by organizing Aadi Mahotsav.

 

Ms. Leena Nair, Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs welcomed the guests and stated that it was a Red Letter Day for the Ministry and TRIFED.  The Vice President of India’s presence has invigorated us and we rededicated ourselves to the service of tribal brothers and sisters.  Aadi Mahotsav, I am sure will prove to be a real celebration of the spirit of Tribal Culture, Cuisine and Commerce.  Pravir Krishna, MD, TRIFED thanked the guest.

The tribes of India have a wide range of handicrafts. These include handwoven cotton, wool and silk fabrics, woodcrafts, metal craft, terracotta, bead-work, masques and other objects. They also produce compelling paintings. It is true that the tribes did not develop these arts and handicrafts for the market. They developed them for their own captive use. But we all live in a changing world. Nobody can remain unaffected by these changes. Not even the tribes. Like all of us, the tribes too now need cash for sundry purposes. It is therefore important that their natural skills must be channelled to promote their sources of income.

TRIBES India proudly informs the signing of MOUs with Amazon, Snapdeal, Flipkart, PayTM and GEM, a Government of India Portal for e-commerce of the tribal products.  Besides TRIBES India has also has its own e-com portal www.eshop.tribesindia.com.

 

The Mahotsav is an effort to take tribal commerce to the next level of digital and electronic transactions.  The Mahotsav apart from exotic handicrafts will also  showcase the electronic and digital skills of the tribals as a special attraction.

BACKGROUNDER

MSP for MFP Scheme for providing a fair and equitable deal to the tribals.

Minor Forest Produce (MFP) is a major source of livelihood for tribals who belong to the poorest of the poor section of society. The importance of MFPs for this section of the society can be gauged from the fact that around 100 million forest dwellers depend on MFPs for food, shelter, medicines and income. It provides them critical subsistence during the lean seasons, particularly for primitive tribal groups such as hunter gatherers, and the landless. Tribals derive 20-40% of their annual income from MFP .This activity has strong linkage to women’s financial empowerment as most of the MFPs are collected and used /sold by women. MFP sector has the potential to create about 10 million workdays annually in the country.

 

Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for socio economic development of tribals like introduction Forest Rights Act, 2006 (Section- 3), PESA Act, 1996 (Section -4),  and has been implementing schemes for development of MFP by providing financial support to State TDCCs and TRIFED for market development of MFPs.  Recognizing the critical importance which MFPs hold for tribals and the potential to generate large scale employment opportunities empowering the tribals, Government of India introduced an ambitious scheme of providing fair price for the MFP collected by tribals through Minimum Support Price (MSP).

 

The scheme was ready for implementation in March 2014 after a series of studies conducted by the Planning Commission since 2007 (Haque Committee & Sudha Pillai Committee) the recommendation of which supports providing support price to MFP gatherers, enhance their income level and ensure sustainable harvesting of MFPs. The MSP scheme seeks to establish a framework to ensure fair prices for the produce collected by them, assurance of buying at a particular price, primary processing, storage, transportation etc. while ensuring sustainability of the resource base. It is a holistic scheme for development of MFP trade and covers 24 non-nationalized / non-monopolized MFPs namely, Karanj Seed, Mahua Seed, Sal Leaf, Sal Seed, Lac (Rangini & Kusumi), Chironjee, Wild Honey, Myrobalan, Tamarind, Gums (Gum Karaya), Kusum Seed, Neem Seed, Puwad Seed, Baheda, Hill Broom Grass, Shikakai, Guggul (exudate), Bael(dried & without crust), Nagarmotha, Palash Kesuda(Flower), Shatavari(dried), Madhunashini, Kalmegh,  Tamarind(de-seeded). The scheme is applicable for implementation in all the States across India. Any de-nationalized MFP / items removed from the purview of monopoly procurement in future will also qualify for coverage under the Scheme. Similarly, any nationalized / monopolized procurement MFP will disqualify for coverage under the Scheme.   However, if any State willingly wants any nationalized items to be included in MSP, then it shall have to change its nationalized status accordingly. 

 

The focus is on setting up the basic infrastructure at the village Haat Bazzar where the tribal brings his forest produces on head loads. Due emphasis is to be given to primary value addition at the village level and secondary and tertiary value addition in PPP mode at the next level. Government of India extends financial support towards part of working capital requirement of State Implementing Agencies in the form of Revolving Funds and also share losses, if any, with the State Govts. in the ratio of 75:25. It is expected to increase quantum of MFP procurement substantially thereby benefitting tribal people. The Scheme also envisages training of tribal MFP gatherers on sustainable harvesting and value addition activities including facilitation for marketing of the produces so that natural resources can be optimally utilized in a sustainable manner.

 

The scheme seeks to institutionalize various medium & long term aspects of sustainable collection, value addition, market infrastructure development, knowledge base expansion of MFPs, market intelligence development etc. Strengthening the bargaining power of Gram Sabhas / Panchayats and their involvement shall also be addressed and taken care of during implementation of the scheme.

 

The scheme aims to touch the lives of tribal people involved in collection of MFPs across all the States and help optimum utilization of natural resources in a sustainable manner. This scheme will be an important milestone in economic development of tribals.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari has called upon Indian business leaders in UK to come forward and cooperate with the Indian Government in its Namami Gange project to clean the river Ganga. Addressing a gathering of business leaders in London yesterday Shri Gadkari said that while Nirmal Ganga is the foremost priority for the Government, people’s participation is also vital for maintaining the river’s pristine glory. 

Shri Gadkari said that there are projects worth more than Rs.10,000 crore for development of ghats, crematoria, waterbodies, parks, sanitation facilities, public amenities and river front development which need additional funding. He informed that projects worth over Rs 2500 crore, available for private funding have been published as a booklet and are also available on the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) website as an e-booklet .The Minister appealed to the business leaders to select projects of their choice for funding. He said the list of projects is only illustrative and will be updated. As of now there are projects in the category of development of ghats and crematoria, modernisation of existing ghats. development of Smriti Vans (tree plantation at select places of choice), in-situ treatment of drains by using innovative technologies such as bioremediation and modular sewage treatment plants. 

Talking about the work being done by the Government for ensuring Nirmal Ganga Shri Gadkari said that more than 119 ghat projects have already been taken up in five states at the cost of Rs.650 Crore. NMCG has taken up the execution of various sewerage infrastructure projects. 97 towns have been identified along the main stream of river Ganga, for generating 3603 Mld (estimated for year 2035) of sewage treatment capacity. The existing sewage treatment capacity in these towns is 1580 Mld. In the first phase, 85 sewerage projects have been taken up in 55 of these 97 towns. These projects will create another 1424 Mld STP capacity at a cost of Rs. 11105 Cr. In the remaining 42 towns, fresh interventions are not required either due to interventions already taken up under other schemes or due to low pollution load / impact. 

Shri Gadkari further informed that the Government is spending more than Rs.20,000 crore on sewage treatment to ensure Nirmal Ganga. Ten major towns contribute almost 64% of present sewage generation of the 97 identified above, The towns are Haridwar, Kanpur, Allahabad, Farrukhabad, Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Kolkata, Howrah and Bally. All requirements of sewage treatment infrastructure in these 10 towns have been fully addressed. 18 of the 85 projects undertaken have been completed, creating 151 mld STP capacity which is presently in operation. 35 projects are under progress and other 32 projects are under various stages of tendering. This will create an additional sewage treatment capacity of 1273 mld. 

Following Shri Gadkari’s appeal some business leaders gave their commitments for projects in Patna and Kanpur. More such commitments and MoUs in this regard are slated to be signed during a Namami Gange Road Show being organized on November 29,2017 in London. A large number of NRIs, PIOs are expected to join this session. Shri Gadkari expressed the hope that he expects commitment of more than Rs. 2000 crores from business leaders during this road show.

                River Ganga has been an unceasing source of livelihood for more than 40 percent of India’s population. It has been unconditionally providing for our needs and has been the very essence of spirituality. In order to acknowledge the river’s importance and celebrate its magnificence, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) organised a cultural evening – “Ek Shaam Ganga ke Naam” yesterday in New Delhi. On this date in 2008, Ganga was declared as the National River of India.

  Intended to evoke Ganga consciousness, the event was attended by hundreds of people from all walks of life including bureaucrats, academicians, researchers, artists, students, teachers, water and river experts, engineers, media, and other stakeholders. The purpose of the evening was to bring all stakeholders together for a wonderful cause of Ganga rejuvenation and forge ahead in unison. Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Amarjit Singh also graced the occasion.

 Addressing the gathering, Director General, National Mission for Clean Ganga, Shri UP Singh said: “Ganga is not just a water resource; it is linked deeply with the sentiments of millions of people. It is essential to rid the river of pollution. While the government is working hard to rejuvenate the river, the participation of people is of utmost importance.”

 The main attraction of the event was an enthralling dance drama – Namami Gange – produced by Padma Bhushan Dr. Saroja Vaidyanathan. The performance, a Bharatnatyam recital, depicted river Ganga’s story with the contemporary relevance. The dance drama while illustrating the endurance the river observes, called for urgency to restore this flowing lifeline to its pristinity. The act beautifully captured the necessity of public participation in clean Ganga campaign, which under Namami Gange programme, has picked up pace. The audience witnessed in awe as the story of Ganga was told in a beautiful way.

The dance drama was preceded by a singing performance on popular songs on Ganga. Shri Partha Purshotam Dutta, his wife Smt. Binapani Dutta and their band charmed the audience by presenting the songs in their own unique style.

 The evening began with a dance-ballet by the students of Heritage Public School on Namami Gange theme song that has been composed and sung by Trichur Brothers. It depicted an episode of Indian mythology where King Bhagirath does Tapasya to bring Ganga on earth to give salvation to his ancestors and Lord Shiva locks Ganga in his tresses before releasing it only after Bhagirath’s plea. The brilliant performance of the students of  5th to 9th standard left the audience mesmerized.

  Mother Ganga is lifeline of millions of people, sustains several aquatic species, and has been embracing us from times immemorial. It is our duty to play our part in ensuring that a nirmal and aviral Ganga continues to be with us in times of joy and sorrow. Under Namami Gange programme, no stone is being left unturned to take clean Ganga message to masses. However, the herculean task of cleaning river Ganga cannot be realised without unwavering public participation.

                Union Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has extended the term of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal by six months upto May 02, 2018.

Cauvery is an inter‐State basin having its origin in Karnataka and flowing through Tamil Nadu and Puduchery before outfalling in Bay of Bengal. The sharing of waters of the Cauvery has been the source of a serious conflict between the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The genesis of this conflict rests in two agreements in 1892 and 1924 between the erstwhile Madras Presidency and Kingdom of Mysore.

In this regard, Government of India on June 02, 1990 constituted the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) to adjudicate the water dispute regarding inter‐state river Cauvery and the river valley thereof among the States of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry.

The Tribunal was asked to submit its report by August 05, 2005.The term of the tribunal was extended for one year upto August 06, 2006 and again for six months upto Februay 05, 2007.

CWDT gave its report and decision u/s 5(2) of the ISRWD Act, 1956 on February 05, 2007. The party States and Central Govt filed application for clarification/further guidance u/s 5 (3) of the above said Act on April 27, 2007, April 30, 2007 and May 03, 2007 and the Tribunal had to submit a further report within one year from May 03,2007. The Central Govt. on the requests made by the tribunal from time to time extended the period of the submission of the said further report upto November 02, 2017. Now the tribunal has again sought an extension and hence the Govt. has extended the period upto May 02,2018.

Meanwhile, the Party States also filed Special Leave Petition (SLPs) against the above mentioned report and decision of the Tribunal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court on May 05, 2007 granted Special Leave in the matter.

A Protem Supervisory Committee was constituted for implementation of the final order dated February 5, 2007 as notified vide Notification dated February 19, 2013. The Supervisory Committee consists of the Secretary, Union Ministry of Water Resources as Chairman and the Chief Secretaries of the respective States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Union Territory of Puducherry as Members. So far eight meetings of this Committee have been held on June 01,2013, June 12,2013, July 15,2013, November 08,2013, September 28,2015, September 12,2016, September 19,2016 and February 17,2017 at New Delhi.

Decision of CWDT has been challenged by party States of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala before Supreme Court by filling Civil Appeals. Supreme Court in its order dated December 09,2016 directed that these Civil Appeals are maintainable and the matter is sub judice in the court.

                The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi launched an intensive training program for Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Master Trainers, in New Delhi today. This capacity building program is being organized by National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD) of the WCD Ministry which will ultimately train approximately twenty thousand EWRs covering nearly 50 EWRs from each district by March, 2018. 

Addressing the participants at the inauguration of the program, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that this is an historic step since for the first time ever an initiative of this scale has been taken up to train EWRs who will go out and administer the villages professionally. It is regrettable that not many women sarpanches and EWRs come forward to take up their responsibilities and mostly allow their husbands to take the lead. So, they remain ‘sarpanchanis’ in name only, the Minister added. She said that training two lakh women sarpanches across the country will help bring following important changes: 


	It will help to create model villages.
	It will help prepare women as political leaders of the future. 


The training program will include simple engineering skills will give them an insight into women’s issues as well as focus on education and financial matters, Smt Maneka Gandhi explained. The Minister disclosed that awards will be given to the Master Trainers to those who have succeeded in empowering EWRs of their areas. The Minister also appreciated the initiatives taken by some states to specify certain minimum education level for sarpanches and panchayat members. 

The Capacity building of Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) is critical to empower women to participate effectively in the governance processes. This will help them assume the leadership roles expected of them and guide their villages towards a more prosperous future.  About 150 master trainers and 450 EWRs attended today’s program.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development is initiating an extensive training programme through National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD) of the Ministry with an objective of empowering Elected Women Representatives(EWRs). This Capacity Building Programme will be inaugurated by the Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi on 27th November, 2017 in the presence of Minister of State for Women and Child Development Dr. Virendra Kumar. Around 500 EWRs and nearly 200 master trainers from different corners of the country will be attending this session of the programme. 

The Capacity building of Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) is critical to empower women to participate effectively in governance processes. This will help them assume the leadership roles expected of them and guide their villages towards a more prosperous future. 

The 73rd amendment to the Constitution of India has bestowed Panchayats with functional, financial and administrative powers and responsibilities for overall development, and this is a great opportunity for women to participate in nation-building. 

Empowered EWRs can ensure the percolation of knowledge, awareness and legal empowerment. This training programme of WCD Ministry will ultimately train approximately 20,000 EWRs, covering approximately 50 EWRs from each district. They will serve as catalysts for social change and function as peer facilitators in the field.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for expansion of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao for a Pan India reach covering all the 640 districts (as per census 2011) of the Country to have a deeper positive impact on Child Sex Ratio. Expansion under BBBP has been approved based on the successful implementation in 161 districts. 

The Scheme was launched by the Prime Minister on 22nd January, 2015 at Panipat, Haryana as a comprehensive programme to address the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues of empowerment of women over a life-cycle continuum. The CSR, defined as number of girls per 1000 boys in the age group of 0-6 years, declined sharply from 976 in 1961 to 918 in Census 2011. However there was no systematic response or comprehensive advocacy strategy to arrest and curb this disturbing trend. The Government recognized the challenge of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR), as a telling indicator of gender discrimination towards girl child, requiring immediate attention and action and launched BBBP scheme in 2015. 

Currently the scheme is being implemented as a tri-ministerial, convergent effort of Ministries of Women and Child Development, Health & Family Welfare and Human Resource Development with focus on awareness and advocacy campaign, multi-sectoral action in select 161 districts, enabling girls' education and effective enforcement of Pre-Conception & Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PC&PNDT) Act. The specific objectives of the scheme include preventing gender biased sex selective elimination; ensuring survival and protection of the girl child and ensuring education and participation of the girl child. At the Central level, Ministry of Women and Child Development is the nodal ministry for the programme. At the State level, Chief Secretaries heads the State Task Force (STF) with representation of Department of WCD, Health and Education to monitor the implementation of the scheme. The District Collectors/Deputy Commissioners (DCs) lead and coordinate action of all departments for implementation of BBBP at the District level. 

The programme will be completing 3 years shortly and in this short duration, BBBP has been well-received and favourable trends are visible in many of the districts. The latest reports as per HMIS data of MoHFW for 161 BBBP districts indicate that for the time period between April-March, 2015-16 & 2016-17, an improving trend in Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) is visible in 104 districts, 119 districts have reported progress in first trimester registration against the reported Anti Natal Care registrations and 146 districts have reported improvement in institutional deliveries. 

Looking at the encouraging results of implementation in 161 districts and magnitude/criticality of the problem and its spread across the country, it has been realized that no district can be left out of BBBP ambit if a real dent is to be made on overall CSR. Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved the expansion for Pan India Coverage with a proposed outlay of Rs. 1132.5 Crore from 2017-18 to 2019-20, to be funded 100% by the Central Government. Out of 640 districts, BBBP is currently getting implemented in 161 districts. The expansion would include Multi sectoral intervention in 244 districts in addition to existing 161 districts. 235 districts are to be covered through Alert District Media, Advocacy and Outreach, thus covering all the 640 districts of the Country.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for expansion of the schemes of Ministry of Women and Child Development under Umbrella Scheme ""Mission for Protection and Empowerment for Women"" for a period 2017-18 to 2019-20. CCEA has also given approval to the new scheme called ‘Pradhan Mantri Mahila Shakti Kendra', which will empower rural women through community participation to create an environment in which they realize their full potential. Expansion under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has also been approved based on the successful implementation in 161 districts.

The financial outlay during 2017-18 to 2019-20 will be Rs.3,636.85 crore with a Central Share of approximately Rs.3,084.96 crore.

Benefits of the Scheme:

The approved sub-schemes are social sector welfare schemes especially for care, protection and development of women. It will also aim at improvement in declining Child Sex Ratio; ensuring survival. & protection of the girl child; ensuring her education, and empowering her to fulfil her potential. It will provide an interface for rural women to approach the government for availing their entitlements and for empowering them through training and capacity building. Student volunteers will encourage the spirit of voluntary community service and gender equality. These students will serve ""agents of change"" and have a lasting impact on their communities and the nation.

Major activities of the Umbrella Scheme:

The new scheme ""Pradhan Mantri Mahila Shakti Kendra (PMMSK)"" is envisaged to work at various levels. While, National level (domain based knowledge support) and State level (State Resource Centre for Women) structures will provide technical support to the respective government on issues related to women, the District and Block level Centres will provide support to PMMSK and also give a foothold to BBBP in 640 districts to be covered in a phased manner.

Community engagement through Student Volunteers is envisioned in 115 most backward districts as part of the PMMSK Block level initiatives. Student volunteers will play an instrumental role in awareness generation regarding various important government schemes/ programmes as well as social issues. More than 3 lakh student volunteers from local colleges will be engaged in this process, while association with NSS/NCC cadre students will also be an option for contributing to nation building as responsible citizens. This will provide an opportunity to Student Volunteers to participate in the development process by bringing change in their own communities and ensuring that women are not left behind and are equal partners in India's progress.

The outcome based activities of student volunteers will be monitored through web based system. On completion, certificates for community service, will be displayed on national portal for verification and can also be used as resource /asset for the participating students in future.

Expansion and intensification of efforts have also been approved for Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) through sustained nation-wide Advocacy and Media Campaign in 640 districts and focused multi-sectoral action .in selected 405 districts. All low CSR districts shall be taken up in the first year itself under BBBP. To provide support to working women 190 more Working Women Hostels to accommodate approximately 19,000 additional working women will be set up. Additional Swadhar Grehs have been approved to provide relief and rehabilitation of approximately 26,000 beneficiaries.

To provide comprehensive support to women affected by violence, One Stop Centres (OSCs) will be established in 150 additional districts during the period. These one stop Centres will be linked with women helpline and will provide 24 hour emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence both in public and private space across the country. A unique initiative involving engagement of Manila Police Volunteers (MPVs) on a voluntary basis in States/UTs will. also be done to create public-police interface, which will be expanded to 65 districts covering all States /UTs.

Monitoring and Evaluation of the Scheme:

One common Task Force shall be created at National, State and district level for planning, reviewing and monitoring all the sub-schemes in this Umbrella, with the objective of ensuring convergence of action and cost efficiency. Every scheme shall have a set of clear, focussed target set forth in the guidelines, aligned with SDGs. Mechanism for monitoring of outcome based indicators for all the sub-schemes as suggested by NITI Aayog will be put in place. The schemes will be implemented through the States/UTs and Implementing Agencies. All the sub-schemes have inbuilt monitoring structure at the Central Level, State, District and Block level.

                The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has said that the Government of India is fully committed to continue working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 to eliminate child labour. The Minister was making the country statement at the plenary session of the 4th Global Conference on Sustained Eradication of Child Labour at Buenos Aires in Argentina today. The conference has been organized jointly by Government of Argentina and International Labour Organization (ILO). The country statement brings out the government and national position on the subject of child rights and child labour. 

Giving details, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that India in fully committed towards the prevention, reduction and eventual elimination of child labour through policy & legislation reforms, stable economic growth, respect for labour standards, universal education and social protection initiatives. 

The most comprehensive step taken by the Government of India is the amendment in the Child Labour Act of 1986, the Minister said. This amendment prohibits employment of children below the age of 14 in any occupation whatsoever. It also prohibits the employment of children in the age group of 14 - 18 years in any hazards occupation. Smt Maneka Gandhi further explained that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 treats child labourers as “children in need of care and protection” and empowers the district level Child Welfare Committees to ensure their overall welfare. 

The WCD Minister said that the National Food Security Act 2013 and Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaranty Act 2005 are two other critical legislations which provide a safety network to vulnerable communities and play a pivotal role in the prevention of child labour and are world’s biggest social protection measures ever taken by any nation. The WCD Minister also highlighted the role played by Child helpline (Childline-1098) which is the world’s biggest facility for rescue of children in distressed situation. 

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi disclosed that to prevent commercial sexual exploitation of children, the government of India is in the process of bringing a new legislation on trafficking which focuses not only on the punitive measures but also on prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked person. She congratulated the Government of Argentina and ILO for organizing the conference successfully.

                A one day National Seminar on Adoption was held today as curtain raiser to the Children's Festival ""Hausala 2017"" being celebrated as Child Right's Week by the Ministry of Women & Children Development. Organized by Central Adoption Resources Authority, the seminar was inaugurated by the Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Dr. Virendra Kumar. Nearly 300 participants including senior officers of WCD Ministry, CARA, State WCD officials, SARAs, adoption agencies, Child Welfare Committees, District Child Care Protection Units among others attended the seminar.

In his inaugural address, the Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Dr Virendra Kumar, lauded the efforts of adoption agencies and said that it is commendable that they have chosen to work in this area which requires a lot of sensitivity and dedication. Dr. Virendra Kumar said that the States play a pivotal role in adoption since CARA has to coordinate the process of adoption with the help of State governments and State agencies. While some states are performing well, others have not shown good progress, but it is very important for everybody to undersand the need for love, care and affection among the children living in Child Care Institutions and give proper attention to adoption, he said.

Dr. Virendra Kumar said that there are 18000 Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) registered with CARA and 55-60% of those parents have expressed desire to adopt a girl child. The people are now celebrating the girl child and we believe that it is the outcome of the popularity of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme launched by the Prime Minister. He said that the adoption of physically and mentally challenged children still remains a weak area and mostly foreign PAPs have expressed their desire to adopt them. The Minister said that the government will soon launch the process of categorizing and ranking adoption agencies on the basis of their performance. The best performing agencies will be rewarded and projected as role model.

Joint Secretary, WCD, Smt Astha Saxena Khatwani said that being brought up in a family is the right of every child. Even the new JJ Act lays emphasis on providing non-institutional care to orphan/abandoned children. So all the stake holders have to remain pro-active in the process of adoption to ensure a loving and caring home for every orphan child. Secretary CARA, Shri Deepak Kumar gave the details and objectives of the seminar.

The purpose of the seminar was to discuss the issues and concerns pertaining to adoption programme, the role of SARAs, DCPUs & CWCs, legislations governing adoption in the country and strategies to further streamline the Adoption Programme and; sharing of Good Practices and way ahead to regulate and expedite the adoption process. The seminar deliberated upon issues pertaining to adoption legislations, implementation issues of the adoption programme, counselling & preparation of older children for adoption and best practices being adopted by various agencies.

A large number of activities are being organized as part of ""Hausala 2017"" including Bal Sansad, Bal Utsav, Athletics meet and sports event, painting competition, speech writing among others. The objective of the ""Hausala 2017"" is to provide an opportunity for children residing in Child Care Institutions, a platform for expression, participation and recreation. The festival is being organized from 15th to 20th November, 2017.

                WCD Minister Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi today launched a comprehensive SHe-Box online complaintManagement System for women working in both public and private organizations to lodge complaints of sexual harassment at workplace. The SHe-Box was launched in New Delhi today to ensure the effective implementation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (the SH Act), 2013.



The new SHe-Box portal offers the facility of making online complaints of sexual harassment at workplace to all women employees in the country including government and private employees. Those who have already filed a written complaint with the concerned Internal Complaint Committee (ICC) or Local Complaint Committee (LCC) constituted under the SH Act are also eligible to file their complaint through this portal.

Launching the online facility, the WCD Minister, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that this is a historic step since it is probably the first ever time that the government of any country has launched an online portal to receive complaints of sexual harassment at workplace. The government is completely committed to provide a safe and fair environment to working women. It is for this reason that the WCD Ministry has made efforts to make the setting up of Internal Complaint Committees mandatory at all workplaces, the Minister explained. She said that the WCD Ministry has also produced a manual and has organized training programmes for Internal Complaint Committees and in the next significant step, the SHe-Box has been launched to provide platform to aggrieved women to make their complaints directly so that suitable action is taken to redress their grievances. These complaints will be monitored by the WCD Ministry, Smt Maneka Gandhi assured.

SHe-Box portal is an effort to provide speedier remedy to women facing sexual harassment at workplace. Once a complaint is submitted to the portal, it will be directly sent to the ICC/LCC of the concerned employer. Through this portal, WCD as well as complainant can monitor the progress of inquiry conducted by the ICC/LCC. This is a proactive step taken by MWCD in the wake of the worldwide social media campaign #MeToo, where women have related their experience of facing sexual harassment and abuse. The portal can be accessed at the link given below:

Link to the SHe-Box portal: http://shebox.nic.in/

Users of SHe-Box also have the option of interacting with Ministry of WCD through this portal, with an assured time-bound response. The portal also provides information on 112 institutions empaneled by MWCD to conduct training/workshops on the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace. It also has the option for resource persons and institutions willing to contribute to training on this subject in various organisations to submit their applications. SHe-Box will provide a platform to these empanelled institutes/organisations to share their capacity building activities with the Ministry which in turn will be able to monitor the activities of these institutes/organizations so empanelled from across the country.

The Ministry has published a Handbook and Training Module on the SH Act to provide information about the provisions of the Act in easy to use practical manner. The private organizations are encouraged to customize the Training Module as per their extant service rules and disciplinary procedures prescribed therein.

Ensuring the dignity and safety of women must be first priority for any digital society. Towards realisation of the vision of the Digital India programme, the Ministry is promoting utilisation of information and communication technology to achieve the goal of gender equality and women empowerment. It is an effort to utilise the digital space to enable speedier response to the complaints of women against sexual harassment at workplace.

                Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (Independent Charge) Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore here today released the India Youth Development Index and Report 2017.  The objective of constructing the India Youth Development Index (YDI) 2017 is to track the trends in Youth Development across the States. The Index enables recognizing the high and low performing states, identifies the weak domains and informs the policy makers the priority areas of intervention for youth development in the states.

The Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development (RGNIYD), Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, an Institute of National Importance has come out with Youth Development Index and Report 2017. This is a pioneering attempt made by the Institute in 2010 which it followed up with the India Youth Development Index in 2017. 

Constructing Youth Development Index for the year 2017 was done using the latest definition of youth as used in National Youth Policy – 2014 (India) and World Youth Development Report of Commonwealth (15 – 29 years) as well as using the Commonwealth Indicators in order to facilitate Global comparison. 

In the India Youth Development Index 2017, the first five dimensions are retained same as that of Global YDI. The indicators and weights have been modified based on the availability of data at sub-national level and the importance of the indicators in explaining Youth Development with the aim of capturing the multidimensional properties that indicate progress in youth development at the sub-national level i.e., state level. Global YDI is different from YDI constructed for India in one unique way; YDI for India adds a new domain, social inclusion, to assess the inclusiveness of societal progress as structural inequalities persist in Indian society. This construction helps to identify the gaps that require intensification of policy intervention. 

This report is of immense value to enable comparisons across geographical areas and categories, as human development index has done in comparing the development situation across regions, nations and localities. The index also measures the achievements made besides serving as an advocacy tool for youth development and facilitates to identify priority areas for development of Policy and Interventions. 

As an effective decision – support tool, the YDI-2017 will enable the policy makers track the national and the regional progress as well setbacks in youth development policies, planning, priority identification and implementation strategies. Besides providing insights to suggest alternatives and options, it also aids in judicious allocation of resources. 

Director, RGNIYD Prof. (Dr)Madan Mohan Goel made a presentation before the   Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Col. Rathore. Secretary, Youth Affairs Dr. A. K. Dubey was also present on the occasion.

                NITI Aayog in collaboration with the European Union delegation to India have released the Strategy on Resource Efficiency at a function in the capital today. The report included in action plan for promoting resource efficiency in India. The strategy paper was unveiled by the Principal Adviser to NITI Aayog, Shri Ratan P.Watal, Indian resource panel member Dr. Tishyarakshit Chatterjee, Ms. Henriette Faergemann, EU Counsellor, Environment, Energy & Climate change. A large number of experts, academicians and delegates participated in the event. 

Mr. Ratan P. Watal, Principal Advisor, NITI Aayog, mentioned that sustainability is a global priority and SDGs commitment and 11th Five year plan clearly enunciate importance of Resource efficiency (RE). Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy are important goals and central principles for achieving sustainable development. Resource efficiency very simply put is making more with fewer materials. In practice, through a life-cycle approach, it leads to minimizing impact on environment & the associated societal burdens, transforming ‘waste’ into ‘resources’ fostering circular economy, and strengthening resource security. 

Ms. Henriette Faergemann, EU Counsellor, Environment, Energy & Climate change mentioned that it is evident the RE agenda in India has gained not only national priority during the EU-India summit in October this year but also in the G 20 RE dialogue in Berlin, Germany on November 27, 2017. EU will support the GoI, especially MoEFCC and NITI Aayog in implementing the RE strategy. 

Dr. Tishyarakshit Chatterjee, Indian Resource Panel member and former Secretary MoEFCC highlighted that this strategy is the first policy document to emphasize resource productivity in the country. Mr. Sachin Joshi, COO of CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development, said that the RE Strategy emphasizes on Sustainable Public Procurement (SSP) as an action agenda which will be the market transformation tool to transform to a resource efficient economy. 

The document is developed with the recommendations from the Indian Resource Efficiency Programme (IREP), launched by the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Indian Resource Panel (InRP) in April 2017. The work on Resource Efficiency Strategy and proposed plan of action (core and medium term) will be supported for its implementation by the European Union (EU) funded Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI) led by GIZ in the consortium with TERI, CII and Adelphi. NITI Aayog has provided key support in positioning this document for public consultation, and charting the way forward. 

Backgrounder

India’s large population, rapid urbanization and expanding industrial production have led to exploitation of available limited natural resources with concerns regarding resource depletion and future availability becoming more pronounced. Ensuring resource security requires and integrated, concerted and collaborative approach in order to fulfill the needs of a vast and growing population. Also, the environmental burdens emanating due to resource extraction, utilization and disposal, including land degradation, biodiversity loss, as well as air and water pollution remain of great concern, Enhancing resource efficiency (RE) and promoting the use of secondary raw materials (SRM) is a pertinent strategy to address these challenges and reduce dependence on primary resource.

BACKGROUND:

The Constitution of India envisages and mandates India to be a country governed by the rule of law. It provides that the Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and all the three wings of the government, i.e., the legislative, the executive and the judiciary must derive their authority only from the Constitution. The founding fathers of India accomplished what seems to be impossible to rest of the world -to establish a country - that too with vast diversity-  following letter  and spirit of the law and implement the Rule of Law. In all intricate matters such as the protection of human rights, equal treatment before the law, protection against excessive arbitrariness etc, the Constitution of India has provided sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure that the Rule of Law has to be prevailed.

Any law that is made by the legislative has to be strictly in conformity with the Constitution failing which it will be declared invalid as provided under Article 13 (1). Article 21 provides a further check against arbitrary executive action by stating that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law. Article 14 ensures that all citizens are equal and that no person shall be discriminated on the basis of sex, religion, race or place of birth, finally it ensures that there is separation of power between the three wings of the government and the executive and the legislature have no influence on the judiciary and vice versa. By these methods, the Constitution fulfils all the requirements of Dicey’s theory to be recognized as a country following the Rule of Law.

It is expected that the two day long deliberations at the would provide a platform to the leading lights of our country to reflect upon the guiding principles enshrined in the constitution of India and the commitment of India’s democracy to the rule of law.

                In a significant step towards realisation of vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India for creation of a New India by 2022, Government of India has identified 115 backward districts for rapid transformation by 2022. Today, i.e. on November 24, detailed briefing of these Prabhari officers was held under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary, Sri P.K. Sinha in CSOI, Chanakyapuri. Besides Prabhari officers, meeting was also attended by Secretaries of important central Ministries.

For each of the Districts, senior level official of Government of India at the rank of Additional secretary and Joint secretary have been nominated as Prabhari officer.

In his key note address, Shri P.K. Sinha expressed his confidence that nominated officers would accept this challenge and would succeed in their mission. Terming this as an important initiative of making difference in the lives of millions of citizens in these districts, he advised the Prabhari officers to immediately form team with State representatives and bring convergence in their effort. Mentioning that fund is not a constraint in this programme as already, large funds are available under different Schemes. He advised the officers to also explore the availability of funds in District Mineral funds, wherever available for this purpose. In addition, he advised them to use flexi-fund which are significant in amount and are available under different Schemes of the Government. As per him, the officers should take it as a challenge and congratulated them to be given this opportunity to contribute in creation of a New India by 2022.

Speaking on the occasion, CEO, Niti Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant emphasised that for dramatic improvement in Human Development Index, transformation of these backward districts is urgently required. He stated that Govt of India is committed to make all round efforts to achieve these objectives in partnership with States. He advised the Prabhari officers to assist the District administration in articulation of their vision for 2022, in ensuring the convergence of the efforts of central and state government and in establishing a robust mechanism for capturing improvement in key outcomes in the district. He mentioned that Niti Aayog has entered into a MoU with Government of Andhra Pradesh which has taken some major initiatives in creating the real time monitoring system in the State. This would facilitate replication of such mechanism in other districts.

Presentations were also made by team of Andhra Pradesh officials that proposed a plan for rolling out such monitoring mechanism. It was also emphasised that third party validation of key performance indicators in the field of education, health and nutrition, basic infrastructure including roads, electricity, household toilets, agriculture and irrigation is necessary for fine-tuning the strategy at district level. CEO, Niti Aayog informed that Niti Aayog is working with many agencies in getting such surveys done so that the programme focuses on key outcomes.

Shri Rajiv Gauba, Home Secretary stated that if these districts are transformed, there would be tremendous improvement in security environment of the country. He emphasised that while 35 Districts have been selected on the basis of reported violence by Left Wing Extremism, 55 districts out of 115 are affected by Left Wing extremism and another 15, including districts in J&K and North East are affected by terrorism. Advising the Prabhari officers to bring convergence in the development efforts of different Ministries and state Governments and the schemes specially launched by Home Ministry in these districts, he felt that it is a great opportunity to ensure rapid development in the country.

                In keeping with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a New India by 2022, Government has embarked upon a major policy initiative for the rapid transformation of 115 backward districts across the country. Senior Government officials in the rank of the rank of Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary have been designated as Prabhari Officers or the in-charge to coordinate the efforts of the Centre and the states in addressing the specific developmental needs of the districts.

 The First meeting of the Prabhari Officers entrusted with the responsibility to co-ordinate the efforts of the Centre and the States towards rapid transformation of 115 backward districts across the country will be held tomorrow on Friday, the 24th November. Cabinet Secretary, PKSinha will chair the meeting with the CEO of the NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant. Secretaries of key Ministries would also attend this session. Home Secretary will also brief the Prabhari Officers. Among the 115 backward districts, 35 are affected by Left Wing Violence. Shortly after this event, meeting of representatives of the State Governments and Prabhari officers is being organised to ensure that transformation of backward district in India is carried out by a dedicated team of Central and State governments.                

 Background:

 The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given a Vision for a new and vibrant India by 2022, the year when India celebrates its 75th year of Independence. Inclusive development and improving the liveability of all are integral part of this vision. One of the initiatives in this regard is to make a dramatic improvement in overall socio-economic development of backward districts. The strategy envisaged is to adopt a focussed approach, ensure convergence of efforts of the Central, State and local Government and establish a real time monitoring mechanism to focus on outcomes that matter to common people in these districts beside giving rise to a virtuous cycle of economic development.  

 A total of 115 districts have been identified for this purpose on the basis of objective criteria. Such criteria include education, health, nutrition basic infrastructure like rural road connectivity, rural household electrification, access to potable water and individual toilets etc. These districts include 35 districts which are affected by violence by Left Wing Extremists. Besides, while selecting these districts, it has been ensured that Ministries of Government of India, implementing social sector Scheme would select at least one most backward districts in every State for extending the reach of the programme in different part of the country. Improvement in one district is likely to spur similar growth in neighbouring districts through demonstration effect.      

 Under this initiative, for all these 115 districts, senior level Government officers (Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary) have been nominated as Prabhari officers. It has been envisaged that using their experience, these officers would form a team with representatives of the State Governments and would also act as a bridge between Centre and the State. States have been accordingly requested to nominate senior level functionary for each district. States are the main drivers of this program.

The 8th edition of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) is being co-hosted by the United States and India in Hyderabad, November 28-30, 2017, for which 1,500 individuals have been selected to participate. This is the first time the Summit is being held in South Asia. Since 2010, the GES has travelled to Washington D.C., Istanbul, Dubai, Marrakech, Nairobi, Kuala Lumpur, Silicon Valley.

The Summit will be inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Advisor to the President of USA, Ivanka Trump will lead the U.S. contingent to the summit, which will highlight the theme of “Women First, Prosperity for All” and focus on supporting women entrepreneurs and fostering economic growth globally. The Summit will focus on four areas viz. Energy & Infrastructure; Digital Economy & Financial Technology; Health & Life Sciences and Media & Entertainment.

Approximately one third of the selected entrepreneurs are from the United States, one third are from India, and one third are from other countries around the globe.  These 1,500 participants include nearly 300 investors and ecosystem supporters who will catalyze investment and networking at the Summit.  Here are a few key facts on this impressive, diverse group.

 


	Women will represent 52.5 percent of entrepreneurs, investors and ecosystem supporters at GES 2017.  This is the first time that women have been the majority of participants at a GES.
	Women from 127 countries are participating. 10+ countries will be represented by an all-female delegation, including Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
	Overall, participants hail from 150 countries and territories across the world.
	The American entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem supporters come from 38 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
	Indian entrepreneurs from the length and breadth of the country will join GES and connect with entrepreneurs and investors from around the world.
	31.5 percent of entrepreneurs at GES are 30 years or younger.
	The youngest entrepreneur is 13 and the oldest entrepreneur is 84.


 

This year’s Summit will have a wide range of speakers from diverse and interesting backgrounds. Prominent speakers from more than 35 countries would share their insights and outlook for the future of technology, innovation, entrepreneurship. International industry leaders such as John Chambers, Prem Watsa, Marcus Wallenberg will be sharing their perspective on varied topics.

For many of us, the most interesting stories will come from the entrepreneurs who are carving a space for themselves, going off the beaten track. Anousheh Ansari, the Iranian-American space traveler will share her experience of what it was like to revolutionize the space industry by opening it to private sector participation. Equally fascinating would be to hear Sibongile Sambo’s journey from a rejected flight attendant to founding her own aviation company.

Exceptional and path-breaking MIT professors Carlo Ratti and Danielle Wood will share their insights on imminent technology disruptions and related trends in global entrepreneurship. Prominent Indian entrepreneurs such as Anu Acharya and Radhika Agarwal will discuss scaling tech-enabled startups, while leading investors Vani Kola and Shanti Mohan will share their experience with entrepreneurs looking to take the next leap.

In the session on entrepreneurship in sports, Chatri Sityodtong who gave up his career as an investment banker to pursue his passion in sports, will share the stage with Sania Mirza who has brought India laurels in tennis and Pullela Gopicahnd who has taken badminton to great heights. Renowned chef, Vikas Khanna, will share his journey of founding and running Michelin-starred restaurants in New York.

Other pioneering Indian entrepreneurs who will speak at the GES include Ritesh Agarwal, the 24-year-old founder of unicorn startup OYO Rooms; Sonam Wangchuk, a renowned engineer and education reformer from Ladakh and inspiration for the character Phunsukh Wangdu in Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots, and Piyush Pandey, the most illustrious name in advertising and a Padma Shree Awardee, among others. 

The Summit would offer different formats for interaction amongst the participants from panel discussions, networking opportunities and pitch events.

“For India, this summit holds a special place as we are more intensely focused than ever before to give entrepreneurs the opportunities and ecosystem to help them thrive,” said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, the government's think tank. “We have been encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship through various programs be that Start-Up India, Make in India or the Atal Innovation Mission. This Summit will help us showcase our incredible potential to the world.”

A virtual exhibition through a multi-touch interactive wall, sensor-enabled touch screens, rotoscope mural technology and physical displays will showcase over 100 innovative start-ups, products, services and processes that are transforming the Indian and global landscape.

In the lead up to the Summit, we have enabled a series of events from Hackathons to pitch competitions, held not just in India, but around the world. More than 500 Indian entrepreneurs applied for participating in the pitching competition, and we have shortlisted 35 candidates who will have the opportunity to present their ideas to the world’s top investors. It is an unparalleled opportunity for a big breakthrough for them, which will give them not just funding, but the mentoring support they need.

                NITI Aayog Vice Chairman, Dr. Rajiv Kumar, today released a proposal to develop electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Delhi. The proposal was drafted by AC2SG in collaboration with NITI Aayog. 

The proposal for the quick pilot could be used to provide a structure for EV infrastructure rollout in the Gurgaon-IGI-South Delhi-Noida corridor. This planning will make the actual rollout easier and faster and also save cost on the deployment. The planning process is based on a five-step process; 1) project kickoff, 2) formation of ""long list"" of locations, 3) streamlining and timing, 4) documentation and 5) wrap-up 

This proposal for developing the pilot includes 55 locations with 135 charging stations of which 46 are DC quick charging stations and 89 are slower AC charging stations. This deployment would require co-operation with state governments, selected government authorities and companies as well as some private enterprises (e.g. DIAL at IGI, DLF Mall). 

The plan includes a deployment timeline with first installations in November 2017. 

The plan is implementable, it includes a large number of stations. Further expansion of this in Delhi NCR and other cities in India is something to be considered based on the experience from this ""Quick pilot"".

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 4(1) read with Section 4(2)(c) of the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) for its assurance to the broadcasters of Indian Premier League (IPL) that BCCI shall not organize, sanction, recognize, or support another professional domestic Indian T20 competition that is competitive to IPL, for a sustained period of ten years. 

After a detailed investigation by the DG, CCI found that BCCI enjoys a dominant position in the market for organisation of professional domestic cricket leagues/ events in India. Based on the nature of activities performed, BCCI has been held as an enterprise and thus, would come under the purview of the Act. While recognising the role of sports federation in taking measures to serve the integrity or development of the sport, CCI held that the impugned restriction had no nexus to the legitimate interest of cricket in the country. Rather, the restriction was pursued to enhance the commercial interest of the bidders of IPL broadcasting rights and the consideration in turn received by BCCI. Therefore, the impugned restriction has been held to be in contravention of Section 4(1) read with Section 4(2)(c) of the Act. Accordingly, CCI directed that: 

(a) BCCI shall cease and desist from indulging into the conduct that is found to be in contravention of Section 4 of the Act; 

(b) BCCI shall not place blanket restriction on organisation of professional domestic cricket league/ events by non-members. This shall, however, not preclude BCCI from stipulating conditions while framing/ modifying relevant rules for approval or while granting specific approvals, that are necessary to serve the interest of the sport. Such changes shall entail norms that underpin principles of non-discrimination and shall be applied in a fair, transparent and equitable manner; 

(c) Having done the above, BCCI shall issue appropriate clarification regarding the rules applicable for organisation of professional domestic cricket leagues/ events in India, either by members of BCCI or by third parties, as well as the parameters based on which applications can be made and would be considered. Besides, BCCI shall take all possible measure(s) to ensure that competition is not impeded while preserving the objective of development of cricket in the country ; and

(d) BCCI shall file a report to the Commission on the compliance of the aforesaid directions from (a) to (c) within a period of 60 days from the receipt of CCI’s order. 

A penalty of INR 52.24 crore has also been imposed on BCCI for indulging into the anticompetitive conduct. 

A copy of the CCI’s order passed in Case Nos. 61 of 2010 has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.

The Competition Commission of India (‘Commission’) has found the All Kerala Chemist and Druggist Association (‘AKCDA’) and its District Units at Thrissur and Kasargod to be in contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘Act’). Four stockists (wholesalers) in the State of Kerala had alleged that AKCDA and its district level associations were insisting the requirement of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) prior to the appointment of any stockists, in contravention of the provisions of Section 3 of the Act, despite cease and desist orders of the Commission in earlier cases involving similar issues. It was contended that the practice of NOC simply changed from written approvals to verbal threats and was also being given in the form of congratulatory/appreciation letters to avoid any sanctions under the Act. 

 

After getting the matter investigated by the Director General (‘DG’), the Commission has found that AKCDA and its District Units at Thrissur and Kasargod were indulging in the anti-competitive practice of insisting NOC prior to the appointment of new stockists by pharmaceutical companies. This case once again highlights the persistent attempts of anti-competitive conduct by Chemist & Druggist Associations who, despite various orders by the Commission in similar cases and wide publicity through a press notice issued by the Commission with respect to the NOC practice, have not abstained from indulging in such anti-competitive conduct. The Commission found that with a view to hide their apparent anti-competitive behaviour, these associations were insisting the NOC requirement through different nomenclatures.

 

Based on the evidence collected by the DG during investigation in this case, the Commission concluded that AKCDA and its District Units at Thrissur and Kasargod have been indulging in the practice of NOC prior to the appointment of stockists by pharmaceutical companies, which was limiting and controlling the supply of drugs in the State of Kerala, in violation of the provisions of Section 3(1) read with 3(3)(b) of the Act.

 

Further, the Commission has also found office bearers of AKCDA and its District Units at Thrissur and Kasargod, namely Shri A.N. Mohan Kurup (President, AKCDA), Shri Thomas Raju (General secretary, AKCDA), Shri O.M. Abdul Jaleel (Treasurer, AKCDA), Shri V. Anver (President, Thrissur District Unit, AKCDA), Shri Rajesh A.B. (Secretary, Thrissur District Unit, AKCDA) and Shri Venugopala S. (President, Kasargod District Unit, AKCDA), responsible under Section 48 of the Act, for their involvement in the anti-competitive practice.

 

Accordingly, AKCDA, its District Units at Thrissur and Kasargod, and their office bearers named above, have been directed to cease and desist from indulging in the practice of insisting NOC prior to stockist appointment. Further, the Commission imposed a monetary penalty of Rs. 4,78,545/-, calculated at the rate of 10 % of the average income of AKCDA, under the provisions of Section 27 of the Act. Penalties of Rs. 59,434/- and Rs. 53,889/-, calculated at the rate of 10% of their average income, were also imposed upon Thrissur and Kasargod District Unit of AKCDA, respectively. In addition, monetary penalties were imposed on the office bearers of AKCDA and its District units at Thrissur and Kasargod, at the rate of 10% of their respective incomes.
