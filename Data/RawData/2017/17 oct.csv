                आजादी के 75 वर्ष पूर्ण होने पर देशवासियों को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं। बहुत-बहुत बधाई। न सिर्फ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का हर कोना, लेकिन दुनिया के हर कोने में आज किसी न किसी रूप में भारतीयों के द्वारा या भारत के प्रति अपार प्रेम रखने वालों के द्वारा विश्‍व के हर कोने में यह हमारा तिरंगा आन-बान-शान के साथ लहरा रहा है। मैं विश्‍वभर में फैले हुए भारत प्रेमियों को, भारतीयों को आजादी के इस अमृत महोत्‍सव की बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। 

आज का यह दिवस ऐतिहासिक दिवस है। एक पुण्‍य पड़ाव, एक नई राह, एक नये संकल्‍प और नये सामर्थ्‍य के साथ कदम बढ़ाने का यह शुभ अवसर है। आजादी के जंग में गुलामी का पूरा कालंखड संघर्ष में बीता है। हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का कोई कोना ऐसा नहीं था, कोई काल ऐसा नहीं था, जब देशवासियों ने सैकड़ों सालों तक गुलामी के खिलाफ जंग न किया हो। जीवन न खपाया हो, यातनाएं न झेली हो, आहूति न दी हो। आज हम सब देशवासियों के लिए ऐसे हर महापुरूष को, हर त्‍यागी को, हर बलिदानी को नमन करने का अवसर है। उनका ऋण स्‍वीकार करने का अवसर है और उनका स्‍मरण करते हुए उनके सपनों को जल्‍द से जल्‍द पूरा करने का संकल्‍प लेने का भी अवसर है। हम सभी देशवासी कृतज्ञ है, पूज्‍य बापू के, नेता जी सुभाष चंद्र बोस के, बाबा साहेब अम्‍बेडकर के, वीर सावरकर के, जिन्‍होंने कर्तव्‍य पथ पर जीवन को खपा दिया। कर्तव्‍य पथ ही उनका जीवन पथ रहा। यह देश कृतज्ञ है, मंगल पांडे, तात्‍या टोपे, भगत सिंह, सुखदेव, राजगुरू, चंद्रशेखर आजाद, अशफाक उल्ला खां, राम प्रसाद बिस्मिल अनगिनत ऐसे हमारे क्रांति वीरों ने अंग्रेजों की हुकुमत की नींव हिला दी थी। यह राष्‍ट्र कृतज्ञ है, उन वीरांगनाओं के लिए, रानी लक्ष्‍मीबाई हो, झलकारी बाई, दुर्गा भाभी, रानी गाइदिन्ल्यू, रानी चेनम्‍मा, बेगम हजरत महल, वेलु नाच्चियार, भारत की नारी शक्ति क्‍या होती है। 

भारत की नारी शक्ति का संकल्‍प क्‍या होता है। भारत की नारी त्‍याग और बलिदान की क्‍या पराकाष्‍ठा कर सकती है, वैसी अनगिनत वीरांगनाओं का स्‍मरण करते हुए हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी गर्व से भर जाता है। आजादी का जंग भी लड़ने वाले और आजादी के बाद देश बनाने वाले डॉ. राजेन्‍द्र प्रसाद जी हों, नेहरू जी हों, सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल, श्‍यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी, लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री, दीनदयाल उपाध्‍याय, जय प्रकाश नारायण, राम मनोहर लोहिया, आचार्य विनाबाभावे, नाना जी देशमुख, सुब्रह्मण्‍यमभारती, अनगिनत ऐसे महापुरुषों को आज नमन करने का अवसर है।

हम आजादी की जंग की चर्चा करते हैं तो हम उन जंगलों में जीने वाले हमारे आदिवासी समाज का भी गौरव करना हम नहीं भूल सकते हैं। भगवान बिरसा मुंडा, सिद्धू कान्हू, अल्लूरी सीताराम राजू, गोविंद गुरू, अनगिनत नाम हैं जिन्‍होंने आजादी के आंदोलन की आवाज बनकर के दूर-सदूर जंगलों में भी.... मेरे आदिवासी भाई-बहनों, मेरी माताओं, मेरे युवकों में मातृभूमि के लिए जीने-मरने के लिए प्रेरणा जगाई। ये देश का सौभाग्‍य रहा है कि आजादी की जंग के कई रूप रहे हैं और उसमें एक रूप वो भी था जिसमें नारायण गुरू हो, स्‍वामी विवेकानंद हो, महर्षि अरविंदो हो, गुरुदेव रविन्‍द्र नाथ टैगोर हो, ऐसे अनेक महापुरुष हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने में, हर गांव में भारत की चेतना को जगाते रहे। भारत को चेतनमन बनाते रहे। 

अमृत महोत्‍सव के दौरान देश ने.... पूरे एक साल से हम देख रहे हैं। 2021 में दांढी यात्रा से प्रारंभ हुआ। स्‍मृति दिवस को संवरते हुए हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर जिले में, हर कोने में देशवासियों ने आजादी के अमृत महोत्‍सव के लक्ष्‍यावृद्धि कार्यक्रम किए। शायद इतिहास में इतना विशाल, व्‍यापक, लंबा एक ही मकसद का उत्‍सव मनाया गया हो वो शायद ये पहली घटना हुई है और हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने में उन सभी महापुरुषों को याद करने का प्रयास किया गया जिनको किसी न किसी कारणवंश इतिहास में जगह ने मिली या उनको भूला दिया गया था। आज देश ने खोज-खोज करके हर कोने में ऐसे वीरों को, महापुरुषों को, त्‍यागियों को, बलिदानियों को सत्‍या‍वीरों को याद किया, नमन किया। अमृत महोत्‍सव के दरम्यिान इन सभी महापुरुषों को नमन करने अवसर रहा। कल 14 अगस्‍त को भारत ने विभाजन विभिषिका स्‍मृति दिवस भी बड़े भारी मन से हृदय के गहरे घावों को याद करते हुए उन कोटि-कोटि जनों ने बहुत कुछ सहन किया था, तिरंगे की शान के लिए सहन किया था। मातृभूमि की मिट्टी से मोहब्‍बत के कारण सहन किया था और धैर्य नहीं खोया था। भारत के प्रति प्रेम ने नई जिंदगी की शुरूआत करने का उनका संकल्‍प नमन करने योग्‍य है, प्रेरणा पाने योग्‍य है। 

आज जब हम आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव मना रहे हैं तो पिछले 75 साल में देश के लिए जीने मरने वाले, देश की सुरक्षा करने वाले, देश के संकल्‍पों को पूरा करने वाले; चाहे सेना के जवान हों, पुलिस के कर्मी हों, शासन में बैठे हुए ब्‍यूरोक्रेट्स हों, जनप्रतिनिधि हों, स्‍थानीय स्‍वराज की संस्‍थाओं के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों, राज्‍यों के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों, केंद्र के शासक-प्रशासक रहे हों; 75 साल में इन सबके योगदान को भी आज स्‍मरण करने का अवसर है और देश के कोटि-कोटि नागरिकों को भी, जिन्‍होंने 75 साल में अनेक प्रकार की कठिनाइयों के बीच भी देश को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए अपने से जो हो सका वो करने का प्रयास किया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

75 साल की हमारी ये यात्रा अनेक उतार-चढ़ाव से भरी हुई है। सुख-दु:ख की छाया मंडराती रही है और इसके बीच भी हमारे देशवासियों ने उपलब्धियां की हैं, पुरुषार्थ किया है, हार नहीं मानी है। संकल्‍पों को ओझल नहीं होने दिया है। और इसलिए, और ये भी सच्‍चाई है कि सैंकड़ों सालों के गुलामी के कालखंड ने भारत के मन को, भारत के मानवी की भावनाओं को गहरे घाव दिए थे, गहरी चोटें पहुंचाई थीं, लेकिन उसके भीतर एक जिद भी थी, एक जिजीविषा भी थी, एक जुनून भी था, एक जोश भी था। और उसके कारण अभावों के बीच में भी, उपहास के बीच में भी और जब आजादी की जंग अंतिम चरण में था तो देश को डराने के लिए, निराश करने के लिए, हताश करने के लिए सारे उपाय किए गए थे। अगर आजादी आई अंग्रेज चले जाएंगे तो देश टूट जाएगा, बिखर जाएंगे, लोग अंदर-अंदर लड़ करके मर जाएंगे, कुछ नहीं बचेगा, अंधकार युग में भारत चला जाएगा, न जाने क्‍या—क्‍या आशंकाएं व्‍यक्‍त की गई थीं। लेकिन उनको पता नहीं था ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की मिट्टी है, इस मिट्टी में वो सामर्थ्‍य है जो शासकों से भी परे सामर्थ्‍य का एक अंतरप्रभाव लेकर जीता रहा है, सदियों तक जीता रहा है और उसी का परिणाम है, हमने क्‍या कुछ नहीं झेला है, कभी अन्‍न का संकट झेला, कभी युद्ध के शिकार हो गए। 

आंतकवाद ने डगर-डगर चुनौतियां पैदा कीं, निर्दोष नागरिकों को मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। छद्म युद्ध चलते रहे, प्राकृतिक आपदाएं आती रही, सफलता विफलता, आशा निराशा, न जाने कितने पड़ाव आए हैं। लेकिन इन पड़ाव के बीच भी भारत आगे बढ़ता रहा है। भारत की विविधता जो औरों को भारत के लिए बोझ लगती थी। वो भारत की विविधता ही भारत की अनमोल शक्ति है। शक्ति का एक अटूट प्रमाण है। दुनिया को पता नहीं था कि भारत के पास एक inherent सामर्थ्य है, एक संस्कार सरिता है, एक मन मस्तिष्क् का, विचारों का बंधन है। और वो है भारत लोकतंत्र की जननी है, Mother of Democracy है और जिनके जहन में लोकतंत्र होता है वे जब संकल्प कर के चल पड़ते हैं, वो सामर्थ्य दुनिया की बड़ी-बड़ी सल्तनतों के लिए भी संकट का काल लेकर के आती है। ये Mother of Democracy, ये लोकतंत्र की जननी, हमारे भारत ने सिद्ध कर दिया कि हमारे पास एक अनमोल सामर्थ्य है।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

75 साल की यात्रा में आशाएं, अपेक्षाएं, उतार, चढ़ाव सब चीज के बीच में हरेक के प्रयास से हम जहां तक पहुंच पाए पहुंचे थे, और 2014 में देशवासियों ने मुझे दायित्व दिया। आजादी के बाद जन्मा हुआ मैं पहला व्यक्ति था जिसको लाल किले से देशवासियों को गौरवगान करने का अवसर मिला था। लेकिन मेरे दिल में जो भी आप लोगों से सीखा हूँ। जितना आप लोगों को जान पाया हूं मेरे देशवासियों, आपके सुख दुख को समझ पाया हूँ । देश की आशा अपेक्षाओं के भीतर वो कौन सी आत्मा बसती है, उसको जितना मैं समझ पाया हूं, उसको लेकर के मैंने अपना पूरा कालखंड  देश के उन लोगों को empower करने में खपाया। मेरे दलित हो, शोषित हो, पीड़ित हो, वंचित हो, आदिवासी हो, महिला हो, युवा हो, किसान हो, दिव्यांग हो, पूर्व हो, पश्चिम हो, उत्तर हो, दक्षिण हो, समुद्र का तट हो,

हिमालय की कन्दराएँ हो, हर कोने में महात्मा गांधी का जो सपना था आखिरी इंसान की चिंता करने का, महात्मा गांधी जी की जो आकांक्षा थी अंतिम छोर पर बैठे हुए व्यक्ति को समर्थ बनाने की, मैंने अपने आप को उसके लिए समर्पित किया है, और उन 8 साल का नतीजा और आजादी के इतने दशकों का अनुभव आज 75 साल के बाद जब अमृत काल की ओर कदम रख रहे हैं, अमृत काल की ये पहली प्रभात है तब मैं एक एैसे सामर्थ्य को देख रहा हूं। और जिससे में गर्व से भर जाता हूं।

देशवासियों, 

मैं आज देश का सबसे बड़ा सौभाग्य ये देख रहा हूं। कि भारत का जनमन आकांक्षित जनमन है। Aspirational Society किसी भी देश की बहुत बड़ी अमानत होती है। और हमें गर्व है कि आज हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में, हर समाज के हर वर्ग में, हर तबके में, आकांक्षाएं उफान पर हैं। देश का हर नागरिक चीजें बदलना चाहता है, बदलते देखना चाहता है, लेकिन इंतजार करने को तैयार नहीं है, अपनी आंखों के सामने देखना चाहता है, कर्तव्‍य से जुड़ कर करना चाहता है। वो गति चाहता है, प्रगति चाहता है। 75 साल में संजोय हुए सारे सपने अपनी ही आंखों के सामने पूरा करने के लिए वो लालयित है, उत्‍साहित है, उतावला भी है। 

कुछ लोगों को इसके कारण संकट हो सकता है। क्‍योंकि जब aspirational society होती है तब सरकारों को भी तलवार की धार पर चलना पड़ता है। सरकारों को भी समय के साथ दौड़ना पड़ता है और मुझे विश्‍वास है चाहे केन्‍द्र सरकार हो, राज्‍य सरकार हो, स्थानीय स्‍वराज्‍य की संस्‍थाएं हों, किसी भी प्रकार की शासन व्‍यवस्‍था क्‍यों न हो, हर किसी को इस aspirational society को address करना पड़ेगा, उनकी आकांक्षाओं के लिए हम ज्‍यादा इंतजार नहीं कर सकते। हमारे इस aspirational society ने लंबे अरसे तक इंतजार किया है। लेकिन अब वो अपनी आने वाली पीढ़ी को इंतजार में जीने के लिए मजबूर करने को तैयार नहीं हैं और इसलिए ये अमृत काल का पहला प्रभात हमें उस aspirational society के आकांक्षाओं को पूरा करने के लिए बहुत बड़ा सुनहरा अवसर लेकर के आई है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

हमने पिछले दिनों देखा है एक और ताकत का हमने अनुभव किया है और वो है भारत में सामूहिक चेतना पुनर्जागरण हुआ है। एक सामूहिक चेतना का पुनर्जागरण आजादी के इतने संघर्ष में जो अमृत था, वो अब संजोया जा रहा है, संकलित हो रहा है। संकल्‍प में परिवर्तित हो रहा है, पुरुषार्थ की पराकाष्ठा जुड़ रही है और सिद्धि का मार्ग नजर आ रहा है। ये चेतना, मैं समझता हूं कि चेतना का जागरण ये पुनर्जागरण ये हमारी सबसे बड़ी अमानत है। और ये पुनर्जागरण देखिए 10 अगस्‍त तक लोगों को पता तक नहीं होगा शायद कि देश के भीतर कौन सी ताकत है। लेकिन पिछले तीन दिन से जिस प्रकार से तिरंगे झंडे को लेकर के तिरंगा की यात्रा को लेकर करके देश चल पड़ा है। बड़े-बड़े social science के experts वे भी शायद कल्‍पना नहीं कर सकते कि मेरे भीतर के अंदर कि मेरे देश के भीतर कितना बड़ा सामर्थ है, एक तिरंगे झंडे ने दिखा दिया है। ये पुनर्चेतना, पुनर्जागरण का पल है। ये लोग समझ नहीं पाएं हैं। 

जब देश जनता कर्फ्यू के लिए हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का हर कोना निकल पड़ता है, तब उस चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। जब देश ता‍ली, थाली बजाकर के corona warriors के साथ कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर के खड़ा को जाता है, तब चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। जब दीया जलाकर के corona warrior को शुभकामनाएं देने के लिए देश निकल पड़ता है, तब उस चेतना की अनुभूति होती है। दुनिया कोरोना के काल खंड में वैक्सिन लेना या न लेना, वैक्सिन काम की है या नहीं है, उस उलझन में जी रही थी। उस समय मेरे देश के गांव गरीब भी दो सौ करोड़ डोज दुनिया को चौंका देने वाला काम करके दिखा देते हैं। ये ही चेतना है, ये ही सामर्थ्य है इस सामर्थ्य ने आज देश को नई ताकत दी है।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयों-बहनों 

इस एक महत्‍वपूर्ण सामर्थ्य को मैं देख रहा हूं जैसे aspirational society, जैसे पुनर्जागरण वैसे ही आजादी के इतने दशकों के बाद पूरे विश्‍व का भारत की तरफ देखने का नजरिया बदल चुका है। विश्‍व भारत की तरफ गर्व से देख रहा है, अपेक्षा से देख रहा है। समस्‍याओं का समाधान भारत की धरती पर दुनिया खोजने लगी है दोस्‍तों। विश्‍व का यह बदलाव, विश्‍व की सोच में यह परिवर्तन 75 साल की हमारी अनुभव यात्रा का परिणाम है।

हम जिस प्रकार से संकल्‍प को लेकर चल पड़े है दुनिया इसे देख रही है, और आखिरकार विश्‍व भी उम्‍मीदें लेकर जी रहा है। उम्‍मीदें पूरी करने का सामर्थ्‍य कहां पड़ा है वो उसे दिखने लगा है। मैं इसे स्‍त्री शक्ति के रूप में देखता हूं। तीन सामर्थ्‍य के रूप में देखता हूं, और यह त्रि-शक्ति है aspiration की, पुनर्जागणरण की और विश्‍व के उम्‍मीदों की और इसे पूरा करने के लिए हम जानते हैं दोस्‍तों आज दुनिया में एक विश्‍वास जगने में मेरे देशवासियों की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका है। 130 करोड़ देशवासियों ने कई दशकों के अनुभव के बाद स्थिर सरकार का महत्‍व क्‍या होता है, राजनीतिक स्थिरता का महत्‍व क्‍या होता है, political stability दुनिया में किस प्रकार की ताकत दिखा सकती है। 

नीतियों में कैसा सामर्थ्‍य होता है, उन नीतियों पर विश्‍व का कैसे भरोसा बनता है। यह भारत ने दिखाया है और दुनिया भी इसे समझ रही है। और अब जब राजनीतिक स्थिरता हो, नीतियों में गतिशीलता हो, निर्णयों में तेजी हो, सर्वव्‍यापकता हो, सर्वसमाजविश्‍वस्‍ता हो, तो विकास के लिए हर कोई भागीदार बनता है। हमने सबका साथ, सबका विकास का मंत्र लेकर हम चलें थे, लेकिन देखते ही देखते देशवासियों ने सब‍का विश्‍वास और सबके प्रयास से उसमें और रंग भर दिए हैं। और इसलिए हमने देखा है हमारी सामूहिक शक्ति को, हमारे सामूहिक सामर्थ्‍य को हमने देखा है। आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव जिस प्रकार से मनाया गया, जिस प्रकार से आज हर जिले में 75 अमृत सरोवर बनाने का अभियान चल रहा है, गांव-गांव के लोग जुड़ रहे हैं, कार्य सेवा कर रहे हैं। अपने प्रयत्‍नों से अपने गांव में जल संरक्षण के लिए बड़ा अभियान चला रहे हैं। और इसलिए भाईयों-बहनों, चाहे स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान हो, चाहे गरीबों के कल्‍याण का काम हो, देश आज पूरी शक्ति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। 

लेकिन भाईयों-बहनों हम लोग आजादी के अमृतकाल में हमारी 75 साल की यात्रा को उसका गौरवगान ही करते रहेंगे, अपनी ही पीठ थपथपाते रहेंगे, तो हमारे सपने कहीं दूर चले जाएंगे। और इसलिए 75 साल का कालखंड कितना ही शानदार रहा हो, कितने ही संकटों वाला रहा हो, कितने ही चुनौतियों वाला रहा हो, कितने ही सपने अधूरे दिखते हो उसके बावजूद भी आज जब हम अमृतकाल में प्रवेश कर रहे हैं अगले 25 वर्ष हमारे देश के लिए अत्‍यंत महत्‍वपूर्ण है और इसलिए जब मैं आज मेरे सामने लाल किले पर से 130 करोड़ देशवासियों के सामर्थ्‍य का स्‍मरण करता हूं, उनके सपनों को देखता हूं, उनके संकल्‍प की अनुभूति करता हूं तो साथियों मुझे लगता है आने वाले 25 साल के लिए हमें उन पंचप्रण पर अपनी शक्ति को केंद्रित करनी होगा। अपने संकल्‍पों को केंद्रित करना होगा। अपने सामर्थ्‍य को केंद्रित करना होगा। और हमें उन पंचप्रण को लेकर के, 2047 जब आजादी के 100 साल होंगे आजादी के दिवानों के सारे सपने पूरे करने का जिम्‍मा उठा करके चलना होगा। 

जब मैं पंचप्रण की बात करता हूं तो पहला प्रण अब देश बड़े संकल्‍प लेकर ही चलेगा। बहुत बड़े संकल्‍प लेकर के चलना होगा। और वो बड़ा संकल्‍प है विकसित भारत, अब उससे कुछ कम नहीं होना चाहिए। बड़ा संकल्‍प- दूसरा प्रण है किसी भी कोने में हमारे मन के भीतर, हमारी आदतों के भीतर गुलामी का एक भी अंश अगर अभी भी कोई है तो उसको किसी भी हालत में बचने नहीं देना है। अब शत-प्रतिशत, शत-प्रतिशत सैंकड़ों साल की गुलामी ने जहां हमें जकड़ कर रखा है, हमें हमारे मनोभाव को बांध करके रखा हुआ है, हमारी सोच में विकृतियां पैदा करके रखी हैं। हमें गुलामी की छोटी से छोटी चीज भी कहीं नजर आती है, हमारे भीतर नजर आती है, हमारे आस-पास नजर आती है हमें उससे मुक्ति पानी ही होगी। ये हमारी दूसरी प्रण शक्ति है। तीसरी प्रण शक्ति, हमें हमारी विरासत पर गर्व होना चाहिए, हमारी विरासत के प्रति क्‍योंकि यही विरासत है जिसने कभी भारत को स्‍वर्णिम काल दिया था। और यही विरासत है जो समयानुकूल परिवर्तन करने आदत रखती है। यही विरासत है जो काल-बाह्य छोड़ती रही है। नित्‍य नूतन स्‍वीकारती रही है। और इसलिए इस विरासत के प्रति हमें गर्व होना चाहिए। चौथा प्रण वो भी उतना ही महत्‍वपूर्ण है और वो है एकता और एकजुटता। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों में एकता, न कोई अपना न कोई पराया, एकता की ताकत, ‘एक भारत श्रेष्‍ठ भारत’ के सपनों के लिए हमारा चौथा प्रण है। और पांचवां प्रण, पांचवां प्रण है नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य, नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य, जिसमें प्रधानमंत्री भी बाहर नहीं होता, मुख्‍यमंत्री भी बाहर नहीं होता वो भी नागरिक है। नागरिकों का कर्तव्‍य। ये हमारे आने वाले 25 साल के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए एक बहुत बड़ी प्रण शक्ति है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

जब सपने बड़े होते हैं, जब संकल्‍प बड़े होते हैं तो पुरुषार्थ भी बहुत बड़ा होता है। शक्ति भी बहुत बड़ा मात्रा में जुड़ जाती है। अब कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता है कि देश उस 40-42 के काल खंड को याद कीजिए, देश उठ खड़ा हुआ था। किसी ने हाथ में झाड़ू लिया था, किसी ने तकली ली थी, किसी ने सत्‍याग्रह का मार्ग चुना था, किसी ने संघर्ष का मार्ग चुना था, किसी ने काल क्रांति की वीरता का रास्‍ता चुना था। लेकिन संकल्‍प बड़ा था ‘आजादी’ और ताकत देखिए बड़ा संकल्‍प था तो आजादी लेकर रहे। हम आजाद हो गये। अगर संकल्‍प छोटा होता, सीमित होता तो शायद आज भी संघर्ष करने के दिन चालू रहते, लेकिन संकल्‍प बड़ा था, तो हमने हासिल भी किया। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों

अब आज जब अमृत काल की पहली प्रभात है, तो हमें इन पच्‍चीस साल में विकसित भारत बना कर रहना है। अपनी आंखों के सामने और 20-22-25 साल के मेरे नौजवान, मेरे देश के मेरे सामने है, मेरे देश के नौजवानों जब देश आजादी के 100 साल मनाएगा। तब आप 50-55 के हुए होंगे, मतलब आपके जीवन का ये स्‍वर्णिम काल, आपकी उम्र के ये 25-30 साल भारत के सपनों को पूरा करने का काल है। आप संकल्‍प ले करके मेरे साथ चल पड़िए साथियों, तिंरगे झंडे की शपथ ले करके चल पड़िए, हम सब पूरी ताकत से लग जाएं। महासंकल्‍प, मेरा देश विकसित देश होगा, developed country होगा, विकास के हरेक पैरामीटर में हम मानवकेंद्री व्‍यवस्‍था को विकसित करेंगे, हमारे केंद्र में मानव होगा, हमारे केंद्र के मानव की आशा-आकांक्षाएं होंगी। हम जानते हैं, भारत जब बड़े संकल्‍प करता है तो करके भी दिखाता है।

जब मैंने यहां स्‍वच्‍छता की बात कही थी मेरे पहले भाषण में, देश चल पड़ा है, जिससे जहां हो सका, स्‍वच्‍छता की ओर आगे बढ़ा और गंदगी के प्रति नफरत एक स्‍वभाव बनता गया है। यही तो देश है, जिसने इसको करके दिखाया है और कर भी रहा है, आगे भी कर रहा है; यही तो देश है, जिसने वैक्‍सीनेशन, दुनिया दुविधा में थी, 200 करोड़ का लक्ष्‍य पार कर लिया है, समय-सीमा में कर लिया है, पुराने सारे रिकॉर्ड तोड़ करके कर लिया है, ये देश कर सकता है। हमने तय किया था देश को खाड़ी के तेल पर हम गुजारा करते हैं, झाड़ी के तेल की ओर कैसे बढ़ें, 10 प्रतिशत इथेनॉल ब्लेडिंग का सपना बड़ा लगता था। पुराना इतिहास बताता था संभव नहीं है, लेकिन समय से पहले 10 प्रतिशत इथेनॉल ब्लेडिंग करके देश ने इस सपने को पूरा कर दिया है।

भाइयों-बहनों,

ढाई करोड़ लोगों को इतने कम समय में बिजली कनेक्‍शन पहुंचाना, छोटा काम नहीं था, देश ने करके दिखाया। लाखों परिवारों के घर में ‘नल से जल’ पहुंचाने का काम आज देश तेज गति से कर रहा है। खुले में शौच से मुक्ति, भारत के अंदर आज संभव हो पाया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

अनुभव कहता है कि एक बार हम सब संकल्‍प ले करके चल पड़ें तो हम निर्धारित लक्ष्‍यों को पार कर सकते हैं। Renewable energy का लक्ष्‍य हो, देश में नए मेडिकल कॉलेज बनाने का इरादा हो, डॉक्‍टरों की तैयारी करवानी हो, हर क्षेत्र में पहले से गति बहुत बढ़ी है। और इसलिए मैं कहता हूं अब आने वाले 25 साल बड़े संकल्‍प के हों, यही हमारा प्रण, यही हमारा प्रण भी होना चाहिए। 

दूसरी बात मैंने कही है, उस प्रण शक्ति की मैंने चर्चा की है कि गुलामी की मानसिकता, देश की सोच सोचिए भाइयो, कब तक दुनिया हमें सर्टिफिकेट बांटती रहेगी? कब तक दुनिया के सर्टिफिकेट पर हम गुजारा करेंगे? क्‍या हम अपने मानक नहीं बनाएंगे? क्‍या 130 करोड़ का देश अपने मानकों को पार करने के लिए पुरुषार्थ नहीं कर सकता है। हमें किसी भी हालत में औरों के जैसा दिखने की कोशिश करने की जरूरत नहीं है। हम जैसे हैं वैसे, लेकिन सामर्थ्‍य के साथ खड़े होंगे, ये हमारा मिजाज होना चाहिए। हमें गुलामी से मुक्ति चाहिए। हमारे मन के भीतर दूर-दूर सात समंदर के नीचे भी गुलामी का तत्‍व नहीं बचे रहना चाहिए साथियों। और मैं आशा से देखता हूं, जिस प्रकार से नई राष्‍ट्रीय शिक्षा नीति बनी है, जिस मंथन के साथ बनी है, कोटि-कोटि लोगों के विचार-प्रवाह को संकलित करते हुए बनी है और भारत की धरती की जमीन से जुड़ी हुई शिक्षा नीति बनी है, रसकस हमारी धरती के मिले हैं। हमने जो कौशल्य पर बल दिया है, ये एक ऐसा सामर्थ्‍य है, जो हमें गुलामी से मुक्ति की ताकत देगा।

हमने देखा है कभी-कभी तो हमारा टेलेंट भाषा के बंधनों में बंध जाता है, ये गुलामी की मानसिकता का परिणाम है। हमें हमारे देश की हर भाषा पर गर्व होना चाहिए। हमें भाषा आती हो या न आती हो, लेकिन मेरे देश की भाषा है, मेरे पूर्वजों ने दुनिया को दी हुई ये भाषा है, हमें गर्व होना चाहिए।

मेरे साथियों,

आज डिजिटल इंडिया का रूप हम देख रहे हैं। स्टार्ट अप देख रहे हैं। कौन लोग हैं? ये वो टैलेंट है जो टीयर-2, टीयर-3 सीटी में किसी गांव गरीब के परिवार में बसे हुए लोग हैं। ये हमारे नौजवान हैं जो आज नई-नई खोज के साथ दुनिया के सामने आ रहे हैं। गुलामी की मानसिकता हमें उसे तिलांजलि देनी पड़ेगी। अपने सामर्थ्य पर भरोसा करने होगा। 

दूसरी एक बात जो मैंने कही है, तीसरी मेरी प्रणशक्ति की बात है वो है हमारी विरासत पर। हमें गर्व होना चाहिए। जब हम अपनी धरती से जुड़ेंगे, जब हम अपनी धरती से जुड़ेंगे, तभी तो ऊंचा उड़ेंगे, और जब हम ऊंचा उड़ेंगे तो हम विश्व को भी समाधान दे पाएंगे। हमने देखा है जब हम अपनी चीजों पर गर्व करते हैं। आज दुनिया holistic health care की चर्चा कर रही है लेकिन जब holistic health care की चर्चा करती है तो उसकी नजर भारत के योग पर जाती है, भारत के आयुर्वेद पर जाती है, भारत के holistic lifestyle पर जाती है। ये हमारी विरासत है जो हम दुनिया का दे रहे हैं। दुनिया आज उससे प्रभावित हो रही है। अब हमारी ताकत देखिए। हम वो लोग हैं जो प्रकृति के साथ जीना जानते हैं। प्रकृति को प्रेम करना जानते हैं। आज विश्व पर्यावरण की जो समस्या से जूझ रहा है। हमारे पास वो विरासत है, ग्लोबल वार्मिंग की समस्याओं के समाधान का रास्ता हम लोगों के पास है। हमारे पूर्वजों ने दिया हुआ है। 

जब हम lifestyle की बात करते हैं, environment friendly lifestyle की बात करते हैं, हम life mission  की बात करते हैं तो दुनिया का ध्यान आकर्षित करते हैं। हमारे पास ये सामर्थ्य है। हमारा बड़ा धान मोटा धान मिलेट, हमारे यहां तो घर-घर की चीज रही है। ये हमारी विरासत है, हमारे छोटे किसानों के परिश्रम से छोटी-छोटी जमीन के टुकड़ों में फलने फुलने वाली हमारी धान। आज दुनिया अंतराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर millet year मनाने के लिए आगे बढ़ रही है। मतलब हमारी विरासत को आज दुनिया, हम उस पर गर्व करना सीखें। हमारे पास दुनिया को बहुत कुछ देना है। हमारे family values विश्व के सामाजिक तनाव की जब चर्चा हो रही है। व्यक्तिगत तनाव की चर्चा होती है, तो लोगों को योग दिखता है। सामुहिक तनाव की बात होती है तब भारत की पारिवारिक व्यवस्था दिखती है। संयुक्त परिवार की एक पूंजी सदियों से हमारी माताओं-बहनों के त्याग बलिदान के कारण परिवार नाम की जो व्यवस्था विकसित हुई ये हमारी विरासत है। इस विरासत पर हम गर्व कैसे करें। हम तो वो लोग हैं जो जीव में भी शिव देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नर में नारायण देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नारी का नारायणी कहते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो पौधे में परमात्मा देखते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो नदी को मां मानते हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जो हर कंकर में शंकर देखते हैं। ये हमारा सामर्थ्य है हर नदी में मां का रूप देखते हैं। पर्यावरण की इतनी व्यापकता विशालता ये हमारा गौरव जब विश्व के सामने खुद गर्व करेंगे तो दुनिया करेगी। 

भाईयों बहनों,

हम वो लोग हैं जिसने दुनिया को वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् का मंत्र दिया है। हम वो लोग हैं जो दुनिया को कहते हैं ‘एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति।’ आज जो ‘holier than thou’ का संकट जो चल रहा है, तुझसे बड़ा मैं हूँ, ये जो तनाव का कारण बना हुआ है दुनिया को एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति का ज्ञान देने वाली विरासत हमारे पास है। जो कहते हैं सत्य एक है जानकार लोग उसको अलग-अलग तरीके से कहते हैं। यह गौरव हमारा है। हम लोग हैं, जो कहते हैं यत् पिण्डे तत् ब्रह्माण्डे, कितनी बड़ी सोच है, जो ब्रह्माण्ड में है वो हर जीव मात्र में है। यत् पिण्डे तत् ब्रह्माण्डे, यह कहने वाले हम लोग हैं। हम वो लोग हैं जिसने दुनिया का कल्याण देखा है, हम जग कल्याण से जन कल्याण के राही रहे हैं। जन कल्याण से जग कल्याण की राह पर चलने वाले हम लोग जब दुनिया की कामना करते हैं, तब कहते हैं- सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः। सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः। सबके सुख की बात सबके आरोग्य की बात करना यह हमारी विरासत है। और इसलिए हम बड़ी शान के साथ हमारी इस विरासत का गर्व करना सीखे, यह प्रण शक्ति है हमारी, जो हमें 25 साल के सपने पूरा करने के लिए जरुरी है। 

उसी प्रकार से मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

एक और महत्वपूर्ण विषय है एकता, एकजुटता। इतने बड़े देश को उसकी विविधता को हमें सेलिब्रेट करना है, इतने पंथ और परंपराएं यह हमारी आन-बान-शान है। कोई नीचा नहीं, कोई ऊंचा नहीं है, सब बराबर हैं। कोई मेरा नहीं, कोई पराया नहीं सब अपने हैं। यह भाव एकता के लिए बहुत जरुरी है। घर में भी एकता की नींव तभी रखी जाती है जब बेटा-बेटी एकसमान हो। अगर बेटा-बेटी एकसमान नहीं होंगे तो एकता के मंत्र नहीं गुथ सकते हैं। जेंडर इक्वैलिटी हमारी एकता में पहली शर्त है। जब हम एकता की बात करते हैं, अगर हमारे यहां एक ही पैरामीटर हो एक ही मानदंड हो, जिस मानदंड को हम कहे इंडिया फर्स्ट मैं जो कुछ भी कर रहा हूँ, जो भी सोच रहा हूँ, जो भी बोल रहा हूँ इंडिया फर्स्ट के अनुकुल है। एकता का रास्ता खुल जाएगा दोस्त। हमें एकता से बांधने का वो मंत्र है, हमें इसको पकड़ना है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है, कि हम समाज के अंदर ऊंच-नीच के भेदभावों से मेरे-तेरे के भेदभावों से हम सबकी पुजारी बनें। श्रमेव जयते कहते हैं हम श्रमिक का सम्मान यह हमारा स्वभाव होना चाहिए। 

लेकिन भाइयों-बहनों,

मैं लाल किले से मेरी एक पीड़ा और कहना चाहता हूँ, यह दर्द मैं कहे बिना नहीं रह सकता। मैं जानता हूँ कि शायद यह लाल किले का विषय नहीं हो सकता। लेकिन मेरे भीतर का दर्द मैं कहाँ कहूँगा। देशवासियों के सामने नहीं कहूँगा तो कहाँ कहूंगा और वो है किसी न किसी कारण से हमारे अंदर एक ऐसी विकृति आयी है, हमारी बोलचाल में, हमारे व्यवहार में, हमारे कुछ शब्दों में हम नारी का अपमान करते हैं। क्या हम स्वभाव से, संस्कार से, रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में नारी को अपमानित करने वाली हर बात से मुक्ति का संकल्प ले सकते हैं। नारी का गौरव राष्ट्र के सपने पूरे करने में बहुत बड़ी पूंजी बनने वाला है। यह सामर्थ्य मैं देख रहा हूँ और इसलिए मैं इस बात का आग्रही हूँ।

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों,

मैं पांचवीं प्रणशक्ति की बात करता हूँ। और वो पांचवीं प्रणशक्ति है-नागरिक का कर्तव्य। दुनिया में जिन-जिन देशों ने प्रगति की है। जिन-जिन देशों ने कुछ achieve किया है, व्यक्तिगत जीवन में भी जिसने achieve किया है, कुछ बातें उभर करके सामने आती हैं। एक अनुशासित जीवन, दूसरा कर्तव्य के प्रति समर्पण। व्यक्ति के जीवन की सफलता हो, समाज की हो, परिवार की हो, राष्ट्र की हो। यह मूलभूत मार्ग है, यह मूलभूत प्रणशक्ति है।

दुनिया में जिन-जिन देशों ने प्रगति की है, जिन-जिन देशों ने कुछ achieve किया है। व्‍यक्तिगत जीवन में भी जिसने achieve किया है। कुछ बातें उभर करके सामने आती है। एक अनुशासित जीवन, दूसरा कर्तव्‍य के प्रति समपर्ण। व्‍यक्ति के जीवन की सफलता हो, समाज की हो, परिवार की हो, राष्‍ट्र की हो, यह मूलभूत मार्ग है। यह मूलभूत प्रणशक्ति है और इसलिए हमें कर्तव्‍य पर बल देना ही होगा। यह शासन का काम है कि बिजली 24 घंटे पहुंचाने के लिए प्रयास करे, लेकिन यह नागरिक का कर्तव्‍य है कि जितनी ज्‍यादा यूनिट बिजली बचा सकते है बचाएं। हर खेत में पानी पहुंचाना सरकार की जिम्‍मेदारी है, सरकार का प्रयास है, लेकिन ‘per drop more crop’ पानी बचाते हुए आगे बढ़ना मेरे हर खेत से आवाज़ उठनी चाहिए। केमिकल मुक्‍त खेती, ऑर्गेनिक फार्मिंग, प्राकृतिक खेती यह हमारा कर्तव्‍य है। 

साथियों, चाहे पुलिस हो, या पीपुल हो, शासक हो या प्रशासक हो, यह नागरिक कर्तव्‍य से कोई अछूता नहीं हो सकता। हर कोई अगर नागरिक के कर्तव्‍यों को निभाएगा तो मुझे विश्‍वास है कि हम इच्छित लक्ष्‍य को प्राप्‍त करने में समय से पहले सिद्धि प्राप्‍त कर सकते हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

आज महर्षि अरबिंदों की जन्‍म जयंती भी है। मैं उस महापुरूष के चरणों में नमन करता हूं। लेकिन हमें उस महापुरूष को याद करना होगा जिन्‍होंने कहा था स्‍वदेशी से स्‍वराज, स्‍वराज से सुराज। यह उनका मंत्र है हम सबको सोचना होगा कि हम कब तक दुनिया के और लोगों पर निर्भर रहेंगे। क्‍या हमारे देश को अन्‍न की आवश्‍यकता हो, हम out source कर सकते हैं क्‍या? जब देश ने तय कर लिया कि हमारा पेट हम खुद भरेंगे, देश ने करके दिखाया या नहीं दिखाया, एक बार संकल्‍प लेते हैं तो होता है। और इसलिए आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत यह हर नागरिक का, हर सरकार का, समाज की हर ईकाई का यह दायित्‍व बन जाता है। यह आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत यह सरकारी एजेंडा, सरकारी कार्यक्रम नहीं है। यह समाज का जन आंदोलन है, जिसे हमें आगे बढ़ाना है।

मेरे साथियों, आज जब हमने यह बात सुनी, आजादी के 75 साल के बाद जिस आवाज़ को सुनने के लिए हमारे कान तरस रहे थे, 75 साल के बाद वो आवाज़ सुनाई दी है। 75 साल के बाद लाल किले पर से तिरंगे को सलामी देने का काम पहली बार Made In India तोप ने किया है। कौन हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी होगा, जिसको यह बात, यह आवाज़ उसे नई प्रेरणा, ताकत नहीं देगी। और इसलिए मेरे प्‍यारे भाई-बहनों में आज मेरे देश के सेना के जवानों का हृदय से अभिनंदन करना चाहता हूं। मेरी आत्‍मनिर्भर की बात को संगठित स्‍वरूप में, साहस के स्‍वरूप में मेरी सेना के जवानों ने सेना नायकों ने जिस जिम्‍मेदारी के साथ कंधे पर उठाया है। मैं उनको जितनी salute करूं, उतनी कम है दोस्‍तों। उनको आज मैं सलाम करता हूं। क्‍योंकि सेना का जवान मौत को मुट्ठी में ले करके चलता है। मौत और जिंदगी के बीच में कोई फासला ही नहीं होता है, और तब बीच में वो डट करके खड़ा होता है। और वो मेरे सेना का जवान तय करे कि हम तीन सौ ऐसी चीजें अब list करते हैं जो हम विदेश से नहीं लाएंगे। हमारे देश का यह संकल्‍प छोटा नहीं है। 

मुझे इस संकल्‍प में भारत के ‘आत्‍मनिर्भर’ भारत के उज्‍जवल भविष्‍य के वो बीज मैं देख रहा हूं जो इस सपनों को वट वृक्ष में परिवर्तित करने वाले हैं। Salute! Salute! मेरे सेना के अधिकारियों को Salute. मैं मेरे छोटे छोटे बालकों को 5 साल 7 साल की आयु के बालक, उनको भी Salute करना चाहता हूं। उनको भी सलाम करना चाहता हूं। जब देश के सामने चेतना जगी, मैंने सैंकड़ों परिवारों से सुना है, 5-5, 7 साल के बच्‍चे घर में कह रहें हैं कि अब हम विदेशी खिलौने से नहीं खेलेंगे। 5 साल का बच्‍चा घर में विदेशी खिलौने से नहीं खेलेंगे, ये जब संकल्‍प करता है ना तब आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत उसकी रगों में दौड़ता है। आप देखिए पीएलआई स्‍कीम, एक लाख करोड़ रुपया, दुनिया के लोग हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में अपना नसीब आजमाने आ रहे हैं। टेक्‍नोलॉजी लेकर के आ रहे हैं। रोजगार के नये अवसर बना रहे हैं। भारत मैन्‍यूफैक्चिरिंग हब बनता जा रहा है। आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत कि बुनियाद बना रहा है। आज electronic goods manufacturing हो, मोबाइल फोन का manufacturing हो, आज देश बहुत तेजी से प्रगति कर रहा है। जब हमारा ब्रह्मोस दुनिया में जाता है, कौन हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी होगा जिसका मन आसमान को न छूता होगा दोस्तों। आज हमारी मेट्रो coaches, हमारी वंदे भारत ट्रेन विश्‍व के लिए आकर्षण बन रहा है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

हमें आत्‍मनिर्भर बनना है, हमारे एनर्जी सेक्‍टर में। हम कब तक एनर्जी के सेक्‍टर में किसी और पर dependent रहेंगे और हमें सोलार का क्षेत्र हो, विंड एनर्जी का क्षेत्र हो, रिन्यूएबल के और भी जो रास्‍ते हों, मिशन हाइड्रोजन हो, बायो फ्यूल की कोशिश हो, electric vehicle पर जाने की बात हो, हमें आत्‍मनिर्भर बनकर के इन व्‍यवस्‍थाओं को आगे बढ़ाना होगा। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

आज प्राकृ‍तिक खेती भी आत्‍मनिर्भर का एक मार्ग है। फर्टीलाइज़र से जितनी ज्‍यादा मुक्ति, आज देश में नेनो फर्टीलाइज़र के कारखाने एक नई आशा लेकर के आए हैं। लेकिन प्राकृ‍तिक खेती, केमिकल फ्री खेती आत्‍मनिर्भर को ताकत दे सकती है। आज देश में रोजगार के क्षेत्र में ग्रीन जॉब के नए-नए क्षेत्र बहुत तेजी से खुल रहे हैं। भारत ने नीतियों के द्वारा ‘स्‍पेस’ को खोल दिया है। ड्रोन की बहुत दुनिया में सबसे प्रगतिशील पॉलिसी लेकर के आए हैं। हमने देश के नौजवानों के लिए नए द्वार खोल दिए हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे भाईओ-बहनों, 

मैं प्राइवेट सेक्‍टर को भी आह्वान करता हूं आइए... हमें विश्‍व में छा जाना है। आत्‍मनिर्भर भारत का ये भी सपना है कि दुनिया को भी जो आवश्‍यकताए हैं उसको पूरा करने में भारत पीछे नहीं रहेगा। हमारे लघू उद्योग हो, सूक्ष्‍म उद्योग हो, कुटीर उद्योग हो, ‘जीरो डिफेक्‍ट जीरो इफेक्‍ट’ हमें करके दुनिया में जाना होगा। हमें स्‍वदेशी पर गर्व करना होगा। 

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों, 

हम बार-बार लाल बहादुर शास्‍त्री जी को याद करते हैं, जय जवान-जय किसान का उनका मंत्र आज भी देश के लिए प्रेरणा है। बाद में अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जी ने जय विज्ञान कह करके उसमें एक कड़ी जोड़ दी थी और देश ने उसको प्राथमिकता दी थी। लेकिन अब अमृतकाल के लिए एक और अनिवार्यता है और वो है जय अनुसंधान। जय जवान-जय किसान-जय विज्ञान-जय अनुसंधान- इनोवेशन। और मुझे मेरे देश की युवा पीढ़ी पर भरोसा है। इनोवेशन की ताकत देखिए, आज हमारा यूपीआई-भीम, हमारा डिजिटल पेमेंट, फिनटेक की दुनिया में हमारा स्‍थान, आज विश्‍व में रियल टाइम 40 पर्सेंट अगर डिजिटली फाइनेशियल का ट्रांजेक्‍शन होता है तो मेरे देश में हो रहा है, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान ने ये करके दिखाया है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

अब हम 5जी के दौर की ओर कदम रख रहे हैं। बहुत दूर इंतजार नहीं करना होगा, हम कदम मिलाने वाले हैं। हम ऑप्टिकल फाइबर गांव-गांव में पहुंचा रहे हैं। डिजिटल इंडिया का सपना गांव से गुजरेगा, ये मुझे पूरी जानकारी है। आज मुझे खुशी है हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के चार लाख कॉमन सर्विस सेंटर्स गांवों में विकसित हो रहे हैं। गांव के नौजवान बेटे-बेटियां कॉमन सर्विस सेंटर चला रहे हैं। देश गर्व कर सकता है कि गांव के क्षेत्र में चार लाख Digital Entrepreneur का तैयार होना और सारी सेवाएं लोग गांव के लोग उनके यहां लेने के लिए आदी बन जाएं, ये अपने-आप में टेक्‍नोलॉजी हब बनने की भारत की ताकत है।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

ये जो डिजिटल इंडिया का मूवमेंट है, जो सेमीकंडक्‍टर की ओर हम कदम बढ़ा रहे हैं, 5जी की ओर कदम बढ़ा रहे हैं, ऑप्टिकल फाइबर का नेटवर्क बिछा रहे हैं, ये सिर्फ आधुनिकता की पहचान है, ऐसा नहीं है। तीन बड़ी ताकतें इसके अंदर समाहित हैं। शिक्षा में आमूल-चूल क्रांति- ये डिजिटल माध्‍यम से आने वाली है। स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य सेवाओं में आमूल-चूल क्रांति डिजिटल से आने वाली है। कृषि जीवन में भी बहुत बड़ा बदलाव डिजिटल से आने वाला है। एक नया विश्‍व तैयार हो रहा है। भारत उसे बढ़ाने के लिए और मैं साफ देख रहा हूं दोस्तों ये Decade, मानव जाति के लिए tecahade का समय है, टेक्‍नोलॉजी का Decade है। भारत के लिए तो ये tecahade , जिसका मन टेक्‍नोलॉजी से जुड़ा हुआ है। आईटी की दुनिया में भारत ने अपना एक लोहा मनवा लिया है, ये tecahade का सामर्थ्‍य भारत के पास है।

हमारा अटल इनोवेशन मिशन, हमारे incubation centre, हमारे स्‍टार्टअप एक नया, पूरे क्षेत्र का विकास कर रहे हैं, युवा पीढ़ी के लिए नए अवसर ले करके आ रहे हैं। स्‍पेस मिशन की बात हो, हमारे Deep Ocean Mission की बात हो, समंदर की गहराई में जाना हो या हमें आसमान को छूना हो, ये नए क्षेत्र हैं, जिसको ले करके हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

हम इस बात को न भूलें और भारत ने सदियों से देखा हुआ है, जैसे देश में कुछ नमूना रूप कामों की जरूरत होती है, कुछ बड़ी-बड़ी ऊंचाइयों की जरूरत होती है, लेकिन साथ-साथ धरातल पर मजबूती बहुत आवश्‍यक होती है। भारत की आर्थिक वि‍कास की संभावनाएं धरातल की मजबूती से जुड़ी हुई हैं। और इसलिए हमारे छोटे किसान-उनका सामर्थ्‍य, हमारे छोटे उद्यमी-उनका सामर्थ्‍य, हमारे लघु उद्योग, कुटीर उद्योग, सूक्ष्‍म उद्योग, रेहड़ी-पटरी वाले लोग, घरों में काम करने वाले लोग, ऑटो रिक्‍शा चलाने वाले लोग, बस सेवाएं देने वाले लोग, ये समाज का जो सबसे बड़ा तबका है, इसका सामर्थ्‍यवान होना भारत के सामर्थ्‍य की गारंटी है और इसलिए हमारे आर्थिक विकास की ये जो मूलभूत जमीनी ताकत है, उस ताकत को सर्वाधिक बल देने की दिशा में हमारा प्रयास चल रहा है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियों 

हमारे पास 75 साल का अनुभव है, हमने 75 साल में कई सिद्धियां भी प्राप्‍त की हैं। हमने 75 साल के अनुभव में नए सपने भी संजोए हैं, नए संकल्प भी लिए हैं। लेकिन अमृत काल के लिए हमारे मानव संसाधन का आप्टिमम आउटकम कैसे हो? हमारी प्राकृतिक संपदा का आप्टिमम आउटकम कैसे हो? इस लक्ष्य को लेकर के हमें चलना है। और तब मैं पिछले कुछ सालों के अनुभव से कहना चाहता हूँ। आपने देखा होगा, आज अदालत के अंदर देखिए हमारी वकील के क्षेत्र में काम करने वाली हमारी नारीशक्ति किस ताकत के साथ नजर आ रही है। आप ग्रामीण क्षेत्र में जनप्रतिनिधि के रूप में देखिए। हमारी नारीशक्ति किस मिजाज से समर्पित भाव से अपनी गांवों की समस्याओं को सुलझाने में लगी हुई हैं। आज ज्ञान का क्षेत्र देख लीजिए, विज्ञान का क्षेत्र देख लीजिए, हमारे देश की नारीशक्ति सिरमौर नजर आ रही है। 

आज हम पुलिस में देखें, हमारी नारीशक्ति लोगों की सुरक्षा की जिम्मेदारी उठा रही है। हम जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में देखें, खेल-कूद का मैदान देखें या युद्ध की भूमि देखें, भारत की नारी शक्ति एक नए सामर्थ्य, नए विश्वास के साथ आगे आ रही है। मैं इसको भारत की 75 साल की जो यात्रा में जो योगदान है, उसमें अब कई गुना योगदान आने वाले 25 साल मैं मेरी नारीशक्ति का देख रहा हूं, मेरी माताओं–बहनों का मेरी बेटियों का देख रहा हूं, और इसलिए ये सारे हिसाब–किताब से ऊपर है। सारे आपके पैरामीटर से अतिरिक्त है। हम इस पर जितना ध्यान देंगे, हम जितने ज्यादा अवसर हमारी बेटियों को देंगे, जितनी सुविधाएं हमारी बेटियों के लिए केंद्रित करेंगे, आप देखना वो हमें बहुत कुछ लौटाकर करके देंगी। वो देश को इस ऊंचाई पर ले जाएगी। इस अमृत काल में जो सपने पूरे करने में जो मेहनत लगने वाली है, अगर उसमें हमारी नारी शक्ति की मेहनत जुड़ जाएगी, व्यापक रूप से जुड़ जाएगी तो हमारी मेहनत कम होगी हमारा समय सीमा भी कम हो जाएगा, हमारे सपने और तेजस्वी होंगे, और ओजस्वी होंगे, और दैदीप्यमान होंगे 

और इसलिए आइये साथियों,

हम जिम्मेदारियों को लेकर आगे बढ़ें। मैं आज भारत के संविधान के निर्माताओं का भी धन्यवाद करना चाहता हूं कि उन्होंने जो हमें federal structure दिया है, उसके स्पिरिट को बनाते हुए, उसकी भावनाओं का आदर करते हुए हम कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर के इस अमृतकाल में चलेंगे तो सपने साकार होकर के रहेंगे। कार्यक्रम भिन्न हो सकते हैं, कार्यशैली भिन्न हो सकती है लेकिन संकल्प भिन्न नहीं हो सकते, राष्ट्र के लिए सपने भिन्न नहीं हो सकते। 

आइए हम एक ऐसे युग के अंदर आगे बढ़ें। मुझे याद है जब मैं गुजरात का मुख्यमंत्री था। केंद्र में हमारे विचार की सरकार नहीं थी, लेकिन मेरे गुजरात में हर जगह पर मैं एक ही मंत्र लेके के चलता था कि भारत के विकास के लिए गुजरात का विकास। भारत का विकास हम कहीं पर भी हों, हम सबके मन मस्तिष्क में रहना चाहिए। हमारे देश के कई राज्य हैं, जिन्होंने देश को आगे बढ़ाने में बहुत भूमिका अदा की है, नेतृत्व किया है, कई क्षेत्रों में उदाहरणीय काम किए हैं। ये हमारे federalism को ताकत देते हैं। लेकिन आज समय की मांग है कि हमें cooperative federalism के साथ-साथ cooperative competitive federalism की जरूरत है, हमें विकास की स्पर्धा की जरूरत है। 

हर राज्‍य को लगना चाहिए कि वो राज्‍य आगे निकल गया। मैं इतनी मेह‍नत करूंगा कि मैं आगे निकल जाऊंगा। उसने यह 10 अच्‍छे काम किए हैं मैं 15 अच्‍छे काम कर के दिखाऊंगा। उसने तीन साल में पूरा किया है मैं दो साल में कर के दिखाऊंगा। हमारे राज्‍यों के बीच में हमारी service सरकार की सभी इकाइयों के बीच में वो स्‍पर्धा का वातावरण चाहिए, जो हमें विकास की नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने के लिए प्रयास करे।

मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों,

इस 25 वर्ष का अमृतकाल के लिए जब हम चर्चा करते हैं, तब मैं जानता हूं चुनौतियां अनेक है, मर्यादाएं अनेक हैं, मुसीबतें भी हैं, बहुत कुछ है, हम इसको कम नहीं आंकते। रास्‍ते खोजते हें, लगातार कोशिश कर रहे हैं लेकिन दो विषयों को तो मैं यहां पर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। चर्चा अनेक विषयों पर हो सकती है। लेकिन मैं अभी समय की सीमा के साथ दो विषयों पर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। और मैं मानता हूं हमारी इन सारी चुनौतियों के कारण, विकृतियों के कारण, बिमारियों के कारण इस 25 साल का अमृत काल उस पर शायद अगर हमने समय रहते नहीं चेते, समय रहते समाधान नहीं किए तो ये विकराल रूप ले सकते हैं। और इसलिए मैं सब की चर्चा न करते हुए दो पर जरूर चर्चा करना चाहता हूं। एक है भ्रष्‍टाचार और दूसरा है भाई-भतीजावाद, परिवारवाद। भारत जैसे लोकतंत्र में जहां लोग गरीबी से जूझ रहे हैं जब ये देखते हैं, एक तरफ वो लोग हैं जिनके पास रहने के लिए जगह नहीं है। दूसरी ओर वो लोग हैं जिनको अपना चोरी किया हुआ माल रखने के लिए जगह नहीं है। यह स्थिति अच्‍छी नहीं है दोस्तों। और इ‍सलिए हमें भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ पूरी ताकत से लड़ना है। पिछले आठ वर्षों में direct benefit transfer के द्वारा आधार, mobile इन सारी आधुनिक व्‍यवस्‍थाओं का उपयोग करते हुए दो लाख करोड़ रुपये जो गलत हाथों में जाते थे, उसको बचाकर के देश की भलाई के लिए लगाने में हम सफल हुए। जो लोग पिछली सरकारों में बैंकों को लूट-लूट कर के भाग गए, उनकी सम्‍पत्त्यिां जब्‍त कर के वापिस लाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। कईयों को जेलों में जीने के लिए मजबूर कर के रखा हुआ है। हमारी कोशिश है जिन्‍होंने देश को लूटा है उनको लौटना पड़े वो स्थिति हम पैदा करेंगे।

भाईयो और बहनों, अब भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ मैं साफ देख रहा हूं कि हम एक निर्णायक कालखंड में कदम रख रहे हैं। बड़े-बड़े भी बच नहीं पाएंगे। इस मिजाज के साथ भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ एक निर्णायक कालखंड में अब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान कदम रख रहा है। और मैं लाल किले की प्राचीर से बड़ी जिम्मेवारी के साथ कह रहा हूं। और इसलिए, भाईयों-बहनों भ्रष्‍टाचार दीमक की तरह देश को खोखला कर रहा है। मुझे इसके खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़नी है, लड़ाई को तेज करना है, निर्णायक मोड़ पर इसे लेकर के ही जाना है। तब मेरे 130 करोड़ देशवासी, आप मुझे आर्शिवाद दीजिए, आप मेरा साथ दीजिए, मैं आज आप से साथ मांगने आया हूं, आपका सहयोग मांगने आया हूं ताकि मैं इस लड़ाई को लड़ पाऊं। इस लड़ाई को देश जीत पाए और समान्‍य नागरिक की जिंदगी भ्रष्‍टाचार ने तबाह करके रखी हुई है। मैं मेरे इन समान्‍य नागरिक की जिंदगी को फिर से आन, बान, शान के लिए जीने के लिए रास्‍ता बनाना चाहता हूं। और इसलिए, मेरे प्‍यारे दशवासियों यह चिंता का विषय है कि आज देश में भ्रष्‍टाचार के प्रति नफरत तो दिखती है, व्‍यक्‍त भी होती है लेकिन कभी-कभी भ्रष्‍टाचारियों के प्रति उदारता बरती जाती है, किसी भी देश में यह शोभा नहीं देगा। 

और कई लोग तो इतनी बेशर्मी तक चले जाते हैं कि कोर्ट में सजा हो चुकी हो, भ्रष्‍टाचारी सिद्ध हो चुका हो, जेल जाना तय हो चुका हो, जेल गुजार रहे हो, उसके बावजूद भी उनका महिमामंडन करने में लगे रहते हैं, उनकी शान-ओ-शौकत में लगे रहते हैं, उनकी प्रतिष्‍ठा बनाने में लगे रहते हैं। अगर जब तक समाज में गंदगी के प्रति नफरत नहीं होती है, स्‍चछता की चेतना जगती नहीं है। जब तक भ्रष्‍टाचार और भ्रष्‍टाचारी के प्रति नफरत का भाव पैदा नहीं होता है, सामाजिक रूप से उसको नीचा देखने के लिए मजबूर नहीं करते, तब तक यह मानसिकता खत्‍म होने वाली नहीं है। और इसलिए भ्रष्‍टाचार के प्रति भी और भ्रष्‍टाचारियों के प्रति भी हमें बहुत जागरूक होने की जरूरत है। 

दूसरी एक चर्चा मैं करना चाहता हूं भाई-भतीजावाद, और जब मैं भाई-भतीजावाद परिवारवाद की बात करता हूं तो लोगों को लगता है मैं सिर्फ राजनीति क्षेत्र की बात करता हूं। जी नहीं, दुर्भाग्‍य से राजनीति क्षेत्र की उस बुराई ने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की हर संस्‍थाओं में परिवारवाद को पोषित कर दिया है। परिवारवाद हमारी अनेक संस्‍थाओं को अपने में लपेटे हुए है। और इसके कारण मेरे देश के talent को नुकसान होता है। मेरे देश के सामर्थ्‍य को नुकसान होता है। जिनके पास अवसर की संभावनाएं हैं वो परिवारवाद भाई-भतीजे के बाद बाहर रह जाता है। भ्रष्‍टाचार का भी कारण यह भी एक बन जाता है, ताकि उसका कोई भाई-भतीजे का आसरा नहीं है तो लगता है कि भई चलो कहीं से खरीद करके जगह बना लूं। इस परिवारवाद से भाई-भतीजावाद से हमें हर संस्‍थाओं में एक नफरत पैदा करनी होगी, जागरूकता पैदा करनी होगी, तब हम हमारी संस्‍थाओं को बचा पाएंगे। संस्‍थाओं के उज्ज्वल भविष्‍य के लिए बहुत आवश्‍यक है। उसी प्रकार से राजनीति में भी परिवारवाद ने देश के सामर्थ्‍य के साथ सबसे ज्‍यादा अन्‍याय किया है। परिवारवादी राजनीति परिवार की भलाई के लिए होती है उसको देश की भलाई से कोई लेना-देना नहीं होता है और इसलिए लालकिले की प्राचीर से तिरंगे झंडे के आन-बान-शान के नीचे भारत के संविधान का स्‍मरण करते हुए मैं देशवासियों को खुले मन से कहना चाहता हूं, आइये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की राजनीति के शुद्धिकरण के लिए भी, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की सभी संस्‍थाओं की शुद्धिकरण के लिए भी हमें देश को इस परिवारवादी मानसिकता से मुक्ति दिला करके योग्‍यता के आधार पर देश को आगे ले जाने की ओर बढ़ना होगा। यह अनिवार्यता है। वरना हर किसी का मन कुंठित रहता है कि मैं उसके लिए योग्‍य था, मुझे नहीं मिला, क्‍योंकि मेरा कोई चाचा, मामा, पिता, दादा-दादी, नाना-नानी कोई वहां थे नहीं। यह मन:स्थिति किसी भी देश के लिए अच्‍छी नहीं है।

मेरे देश के नौजवानों मैं आपके उज्ज्वल भविष्‍य के लिए, आपके सपनों के लिए मैं भाई-भतीजावाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई में आपका साथ चाहता हूं। परिवारवादी राजनीति के खिलाफ लड़ाई में मैं आपका साथ चाहता हूं। यह संवैधानिक जिम्‍मेदारी मानता हूं मैं। यह लोकतंत्र की जिम्‍मेदारी मानता हूं मैं। यह लालकिले के प्राचीर से कही गई बात की ताकत मैं मानता हूं। और इसलिए मैं आज आपसे यह अवसर चाहता हूं। हमने देखा पिछले दिनो खेलों में, ऐसा तो नहीं है कि देश के पास पहले प्रतिभाएं नहीं रहीं होंगी, ऐसा तो नहीं है कि खेल-कूद की दुनिया में हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के नौजवान हमारे बेटे-बेटियां कुछ कर नहीं रहे। लेकिन selection भाई-भतीजेवाद के चैनल से गुजरते थे। और उसके कारण वो खेल के मैदान तक उस देश तक तो पहुंच जाते थे, जीत-हार से उन्‍हें लेना-देना नहीं था। लेकिन जब transparency आई योग्‍यता के आधार पर खिलाडि़यों का चयन होने लगा पूर्ण पारदर्शिता से खेल के मैदान में सामर्थ्‍य का सम्‍मान होने लगा। आज देखिए दुनिया में खेल के मैदान में भारत का तिरंगा फहरता है। भारत का राष्‍ट्रगान गाया जाता है। 

गर्व होता है और परिवारवाद से मुक्ति होती है, भाई भतीजावाद से मुक्ति होती है तो यह नतीजे आते हैं। मेरे प्‍यारे देशवासियों यह ठीक है, चुनौतियां बहुत है, अगर इस देश के सामने करोड़ों संकट है, तो करोड़ों समाधान भी हैं और मेरा 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों पर भरोसा है। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासी निर्धारित लक्ष्‍य के साथ संकल्प के प्रति समर्पण के साथ जब 130 करोड़ देश‍वासी एक कदम आगे रखते हैं न तो हिन्‍दुस्‍तान 130 कदम आगे बढ़ जाता है। इस सामर्थ्‍य को लेकर के हमें आगे बढ़ना है। इस अमृतकाल में, अभी अमृतकाल की पहली बेला है, पहली प्रभात है, हमें आने वाले 25 साल के एक पल भी भूलना नहीं है। एक-एक दिन, समय का प्रत्‍येक क्षण, जीवन का प्रत्‍येक कण, मातृभूमि के लिए जीना और तभी आजादी के दीवानों को हमारी सच्‍ची श्रं‍द्धाजलि होगी। तभी 75 साल तक देश को यहां तक पहुंचाने में जिन-जिन लोगों ने योगदान दिया, उनका पुण्‍य स्‍मरण हमारे काम आयेगा।

मैं देशवासियों से आग्रह करते हुए नई संभावनाओं को संजोते हुए, नए संकल्‍पों को पार करते हुए आगे बढ़ने का विश्‍वास लेकर आज अमृतकाल का आरंभ करते हैं। आजादी का अमृत महोत्‍सव, अब अमृतकाल की दिशा में पलट चुका है, आगे बढ़ चुका है, तब इस अमृतकाल में सबका प्रयास अनिवार्य है। सबका प्रयास ये परिणाम लाने वाला है। टीम इंडिया की भावना ही देश को आगे बढ़ाने वाली है। 130 करोड़ देश‍वासियों की ये टीम इंडिया एक टीम के रूप में आगे बढ़कर के सारे सपनों को साकार करेगी। इसी पूरे विश्‍वास के सा‍थ मेरे साथ बोलिए 

जय हिन्‍द। 

जय हिन्‍द। 

जय हिन्‍द।

भारत माता की जय,

भारत माता की जय, 

भारत माता की जय

वंदे मातरम, 

वंदे मातरम, 

वंदे मातरम,

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद!

                His Excellency Mr Paolo Gentiloni, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 30, 2017). 

Welcoming the Prime Minister of Italy to India, the President said that his visit is taking place 10 years after the visit of Prime Minister Prodi. And this visit holds very special significance for India-Italy engagement, as the two countries will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2018. 

The President added that India and Italy are ancient civilisations and have interacted with each other for ages. He stated that the economic partnership between India and Italy is strong. However, there is potential to do more. India’s reform initiatives, including efforts at ease of doing business and GST, offer business opportunities to Italian companies. Infrastructure development in India itself is a US $ 1 trillion opportunity. India is keen to leverage Italian technology and investment for its growth and development. He was happy to note that Italian companies want to participate in the railways, auto, renewable energy and food processing sectors in India. He stated that Indian companies are also looking for opportunities in Italy. 

The President said many commonalities bind India and Italy. Our relations are anchored in the shared values of democracy and rule of law. We have a large Indian diaspora in Italy. India deeply appreciates Italy’s recognition of their contribution to socio-economic progress. Our people-to-people connect is ever growing. There are over 2000 Indian students in Italy today. With so much that we share and jointly aspire for, our ties must continue to strengthen. 

The President said we are very happy that Italy would be participating at the World Food India 2017 as a ‘Focus Country’. He stated that Italy is known to be the design capital of the world. He commended the personal initiative of Mr Gentiloni to celebrate the ‘Day of Italian Design in the World’. He added that this year the event, held in over 100 cities across the globe, was a big success. And we look forward to jointly celebrating the event in India next year.

He will begin his visit to the State by offering prayers at the Shri Manjunatha Swamy Temple at Dharmasthala. He will address a public meeting, and distribute RuPay cards to beneficiaries at the Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project, at Ujire. This will enable the Self Help Groups to begin cashless digital transactions. 

The Prime Minister will then travel to Bengaluru, where he will address the gathering at the Dashamah Soundarya Lahari Parayanotsava Mahasarmapane. 

The Soundarya Lahari is a set of shlokas composed by Adi Shankaracharya. The event has been organized for the mass chanting of these shlokas in unison. 

Later in the day, at Bidar, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the Bidar - Kalaburagi New Railway Line. He will also address a public meeting.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Sister Nivedita organised by the Ramakrishna Mission in New Delhi today (October 28, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Swami Vivekananda was one of those who shaped our modern national consciousness. He rediscovered Indian values not only for us but for the world. He was a true cultural ambassador, as became so apparent during his visit to Chicago in 1893 for the Parliament of Religions.

The President said that Swami Vivekananda combined spiritualism and scholarship, idealism and practical thinking. His legacy is reflected in the Ramakrishna Mission, which is itself 120 years old and has grown from strength to strength. It has established an institutional rigour and a culture of enlightenment and integrity. This has allowed it to undertake social and public welfare programmes in very difficult conditions and locations.

The President said that the Ramakrishna Mission’s education and health-care initiatives, its schools and hospitals, can be found all over the country. In parts of the Northeast and in our frontier state of Arunachal Pradesh, the Ramakrishna Mission has been a pioneer institution. In Maoist-troubled Chhattisgarh, he had seen the dedication with which the Ramakrishna Mission has worked among very poor and underprivileged tribal communities in Narayanpur.

The President said that Indian culture and spiritualism have attracted people from other countries for centuries. Buddhist monks from China came to Nalanda. Today, the appeal of Yoga and of Vipasanna to people across the world – and the response to International Yoga Day – is another example. Sister Nivedita was part of this tradition, and came to India and to Swamiji for enlightenment. And yet she was different. She did not come and learn a little and leave. She learnt a lot – and stayed on. She made India her life’s mission. And though born in Ireland, she became an Indian nation builder.

1.       I am very happy be here for the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita. This is my first visit to the Ramakishna Mission since taking over as President of India, but the Mission and its work are very familiar to me. I have visited this place several times before. In my individual capacity, I have been drawn to the teachings of Ramakrishna Paramhansa and Swami Vivekananda. They have inspired me to visit the Dakhineswar Temple and Belur Math near Kolkata. As such, in many respects today I am among friends.

 

2.       Swami Vivekananda was one of those who shaped our modern national consciousness. He rediscovered Indian values not only for us but for the world. He was a true cultural ambassador, as became so apparent during his visit to Chicago in 1893 for the Parliament of Religions.

 

3.      Swami Vivekananda was more than just a monk and a spiritual leader. He was an institution builder and a nation builder. A few days ago, I was fortunate to visit and interact with scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (or IISc) in Bengaluru. I learnt that the origins of IISc lay in a conversation that Swami Vivekananda and Jamshetji Tata had had while travelling on the same ship to the United States.

 

4.      Swamiji was going for the Parliament of Religions. Jamshetji Tata was going in search of a technologist who could help him build a steel plant in India and so fulfil his dream of setting up a major industrial facility in our country. Both men were travelling with a vision of a new and better India. They got to know each other on the ship. During their conversations, Swamiji urged Jamshetji to set up a world-class scientific research institution in India. Even while travelling to America for an important conference, his mind was on our country and its needs – and its future.

 

5.      Swami Vivekananda combined spiritualism and scholarship, idealism and practical thinking. His legacy is reflected in the Ramakrishna Mission, which is itself 120 years old and has grown from strength to strength. It has not been dependent on any one individual but has established an institutional rigour and a culture of enlightenment and integrity. This has allowed it to undertake social and public welfare programmes in very difficult conditions and locations.

 

6.      The Mission’s education and health-care initiatives, its schools and hospitals, can be found all over the country. What is laudable is that the monks and volunteers of the Ramakrishna Mission have gone to the very homes of the most marginalised communities.

 

7.      In parts of the Northeast and in our frontier state of Arunachal Pradesh, the Ramakrishna Mission has been a pioneer institution. In Maoist-troubled Chhattisgarh, I have seen the dedication with which the Ramakrishna Mission has worked among very poor and underprivileged tribal communities in Narayanpur. This is a remarkable and genuine example of public service – of seva in the true sense of the word.

 

8.      I sometimes feel a visit to Narayanpur and an experience of the work that the Ramakrishna Mission does there should be part of the training of our young civil servants. They will witness nation building in action.

9.      The external achievements of the Ramakrishna Mission are only a reflection of its inner calling and the wisdom of its spiritual mentors. Sadhus and monks at the Ramakrishna Mission may have relinquished the world’s pleasures and treasures, but they have not relinquished knowledge and enlightenment.

 

10.  They are learned people and make a constant effort to keep learning. It is not uncommon to find highly educated swamis and sadhus in the Ramakrishna Mission, including some with doctorates and PhDs. They equate spiritualism with a higher knowledge and set an example for the rest of us. Their honesty in the management of institutions too is absolutely beyond reproach.

 

11.  It was such attributes that drew Sister Nivedita to Swami Vivekananda and led to her accepting him as her guru. She was born in Ireland and came to India at a time when both our countries were under colonial rule. They were trying to regain not just political freedom but cultural freedom too.

 

12.  There were many interactions between Irish and Indian political leaders in that period – but the bond that connected Swamiji and Sister Nivedita was unique. They wrote letters to each other that showed their commitment to certain values, as well as to a dignified friendship between a guru and a disciple.

 

13.  Two excerpts from Swami Vivekananda’s letters to Sister Nivedita, written in Sanskrit, are worth quoting. They give us a glimpse to his thinking and his philosophy – and to the ethos of the Ramakrishna Mission.

 

14.  In the first letter Swamiji tells Sister Nivedita that his life’s mantra is: वज्रादपि कठोराणि मृदूनि कुसुमादपि 

This translates to “Tougher than rocks; more tender than flowers”. It points to Swamiji’s ability to balance the idealism of his work with the practical aspects of everyday life.

 

15.  In the second letter, Swamiji impresses upon Sister Nivedita that: नहि कल्याण कृत्कश्चित् दुर्गतिं तातगच्छति

Or: “A person who does good to others, never meets a bad end …”

 

16.  Actually, both these quotations from Swamiji define what has remained the Ramakrishna Mission’s essential approach to this very day.

 

Friends

17.  Sister Nivedita’s original name was Margaret Noble. True to her name, she served India with nobility. She was a pioneer in girls’ education in India and in providing health services to the poor. She was a westerner who embraced India wholeheartedly, and lived and died with the well-being of India and Indians on her mind and in her heart.

 

18.  Indian culture and spiritualism have attracted people from other countries for centuries. Taxila’s famous university, where among others Kautilya is believed to have taught, is said to have drawn students from Babylon and Greece. Buddhist monks from China and other countries came to Nalanda. Today, the appeal of Yoga and of Vipasanna to people across the world – and the response to International Yoga Day – is another example.

 

19.  Sister Nivedita was part of this tradition, and came to India and to Swamiji for enlightenment. And yet she was different. She did not come and learn a little and leave. She learnt a lot – and stayed on. She made India her life’s mission. And though born in Ireland, she became an Indian nation builder.

 

20.  On her 150th birthday, I pay my heartfelt tributes to her. And I wish the Ramakrishna Mission the very best in its service to our people.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the valedictory function of the diamond jubilee celebrations of High Court of Kerala in Kochi today (October 28, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Kerala High Court is known for sensitivity to people’s rights and civil liberties. The judgements of this High Court have contributed to deepening the traditions of democracy and civic freedom in our country. This High Court is a pioneer in supporting environmental and ecological norms and standards. It has given important verdicts, including on the right of the people for clean air; the right of the people for clean water; the right of the people for healthy surroundings; assigning the supply of safe drinking water to citizens in adequate quantity as the primary constitutional responsibility of the state and banning of smoking in public places. 

The President said that the judiciary is one of India’s most valued and respected institutions. Its fearless and independent functioning and stature has enhanced India’s credibility in the democratic world. Every Indian is proud of the judiciary and respects its verdicts and its commitment to the values that embody our nationhood. 

The President said that our legal system, with an independent judiciary as its bedrock, is an essential part of our nation building process. It acts as a corrective and it upholds the sanctity of the law and of natural justice. And it functions as the guardian of the ethical principles underlying the Constitution. This makes everybody connected with the process of justice delivery a nation builder. 

The President said that delay in justice delivery is a pressing concern in our country. Often those who suffer are among the poorest and most underprivileged in our society. We must find mechanisms to ensure quick disposal of cases. We could all consider an approach that makes adjournments the exception in an emergency situation rather than a tactic to prolong court proceedings. 

The President said that our common citizens have that sacred trust and faith that the judiciary will ever stand by them, and never let them down. He was confident that the judiciary will always live up to the high expectations that our people have of it.

                1.                  This is my second visit to Kerala since becoming President of India, but it is the first time I am visiting Kochi in my current capacity. As an individual with a background in the legal profession, I am doubly happy to be here for the closing function of the diamond jubilee of the Honourable High Court of Kerala.

 

2.                  This Honourable High Court has a glorious tradition of 60 years. Its origins are in the Travancore High Court, which existed for a span of 67 years. It then merged with the Cochin High Court to form the Travancore-Cochin High Court in 1949. After the re-organisation of states in 1956, Kerala came into existence on November 1, 1956. This followed the merger of the Travancore-Cochin State and the erstwhile Malabar District of the Madras Presidency. It also led to the creation of the Honourable Kerala High Court.

 

3.                  Some truly great jurists have served as judges in this Honourable High Court. The first lady High Court judge of the country, Justice Anna Chandy, became a judge here in 1959. This was exceptional for its times. It was as much as six years later, in 1965, that Judge Elizabeth Lane became the first woman judge of the High Court in Britain. Therefore, in giving representation to women judges, the Indian judiciary was ahead of many other countries. The first lady judge of the Honourable Supreme Court of India, Justice M. Fathima Beevi, too was from the Honourable Kerala High Court. Justice K.G. Balakrishnan from the Honourable Kerala High Court became the Chief Justice of India in 2007.

 

4.                  Who can forget Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, a judge of remarkable humanistic values and the conscience keeper of the legal fraternity in our country? In 1968, he became a judge in this Honourable High Court. Later he left an indelible imprint on our national life while he was at the Honourable Supreme Court. He is remembered and cherished as a role model to this day.

 

5.                  The Honourable Kerala High Court is known for sensitivity to people’s rights and civil liberties. The members of the Bar include and have included many legal luminaries. The judgements of the Honourable High Court have contributed to deepening the traditions of democracy and civic freedom in our country. For example, a Full Bench of the Honourable High Court held that the calling of a “bandh” that was backed by explicit or implicit threats of violence was illegal. This Honourable High Court is a pioneer in supporting environmental and ecological norms and standards. It has given important verdicts, including on:

1)             The right of the people for clean air

2)             The right of the people for clean water

3)             The right of the people for healthy surroundings

4)             Assigning the supply of safe drinking water to citizens in adequate quantity as the primary constitutional responsibility of the state

5)             Banning of smoking in public places

 

6.                  The judiciary is one of India’s most valued and respected institutions. Its fearless and independent functioning and stature has enhanced India’s credibility in the democratic world. Every Indian is proud of the judiciary and respects its verdicts and its commitment to the values that embody our nationhood. The constitutional framework rests on the three pillars of the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. Our Constitution is perhaps the best document in the world in laying down the balance between the roles of these three institutions.

 

Friends

7.                  Delay in justice delivery is a pressing concern in our country. Often those who suffer are among the poorest and most underprivileged in our society. We must find mechanisms to ensure quick disposal of cases. We could all consider an approach that makes adjournments the exception in an emergency situation rather than a tactic to prolong court proceedings. We must find a way forward. And I am happy to note that the Judiciary in moving ahead in this direction.

 

8.                  It is important to not only take justice to the people, but also to make it understandable to litigating parties in a language they know. High Courts deliver judgements in English, but we are a country of diverse languages. The litigant may not be conversant with English and the finer points of the judgement may escape him or her. The litigating parties will thus be dependent on the lawyer or another person to translate the judgement. This can add to time and cost.

 

9.                  Perhaps a system could be evolved whereby certified translated copies of judgements are made available by the Honourable High Courts in the local or regional language. This could happen in a period of say 24 or 36 hours after the judgement is pronounced. The language could be Malayalam in the Honourable Kerala High Court or Hindi in the Honourable Patna High Court, as the case may be.

 

10.              I have only made a suggestion. It is for the judiciary and the legal fraternity to discuss this and decide as appropriate.

 

Friends

11.              Our society and economy have become more complex as well as more integrated with the global system. The challenges before the judiciary too have grown. The nature of disputes and cases that come to our courts has gradually undergone change. The dynamism and evolution in business and trade law and in financial markets; the changing nature of intellectual property and technology; and the still emerging norms of the digital sphere and of Internet law and governance – these are among examples of new questions and frameworks that the judiciary has had to grapple with. It has done so admirably and with enlightenment and thought.

 

12.              Even so, the nature of these challenges will only expand in the coming years, especially as technology advances rapidly. Our judiciary and justice delivery mechanism will need to continue to keep up with technology and with changes in our society, as indeed they have been so capably doing. I am confident they will remain more than equal to the task.

 

13.              Our legal system, with an independent judiciary as its bedrock, is an essential part of our nation building process. It acts as a corrective and it upholds the sanctity of the law and of natural justice. And it functions as the guardian of the ethical principles underlying the Constitution. This makes everybody connected with the process of justice delivery a nation builder. Both judicial officers as well as court officers – namely advocates, who assist in the justice delivery system – are nation builders. On them – on you, I should say – lies a heavy responsibility.

 

1.                  That is why each time you take your place in the courtroom please be conscious that common citizens of this country are looking to you – and looking up to you. Our common citizens have that sacred trust and faith that the judiciary will ever stand by them, and never let them down. I am sure the judiciary will always live up to the high expectations that our people have of it.

 

2.                  While ending, I would once again like to congratulate the Honourable Kerala High Court and the people of the state on this diamond jubilee. And I would like to wish all the judges, retired judges, members of the Bar and other stakeholders associated with the Honourable High Court the very best.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                1. I must thank all of you for this truly moving and emotional welcome. I am extremely touched. I feel like I have come to my own home. Thank you so much for this reception. 

2. I am happy to be in Kerala for the second time in this month. And I am happier still to be here on the birth anniversary of Dr K.R. Narayanan, a distinguished son of Kerala and one of my honourable predecessors in the Presidential office. This morning, at Rashtrapati Bhavan, I paid my tributes before the portrait of President Narayanan, and then boarded the flight to his home state. 

3. Historically Kerala is a land of spiritualism, with a tradition of spiritual leadership and social reform extending from AdiShankaracharya to Sri Narayana Guru to Ayyankali and so many others. Earlier today I was fortunate to pay floral tributes before the statue of Ayyankali and that memory will stay with me. 

4. Over centuries, your state has been the home of some great religions. Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Jewish cultures are age-old and have existed in close proximity here. They have given space to each other. It is important to keep that tradition of harmony alive even today. It is vital that our cultural traditions continue to draw from the heritage of Kerala and of India. 

5. Kerala’s traditions and your very thinking have been humanistic, people-oriented and democratic. The emphasis on human development and on health-care and education here has set an example for the rest of the country. In sanitation, your achievements are praiseworthy. In local self-government and panchayati raj, again Kerala has deepened our democracy. 

6. This focus on human development and on people’s welfare is not new to Kerala. In fact, the kingdom of Travancore was one of our most progressive states before Independence. And the then princely family is remembered for its reforms and welfare measures. Of course it is also remembered for giving us that great artist Raja Ravi Varma. 

Friends

7. God’s Own Country has an uncommon and important identity as a global face of India. This is true in so many ways. Being a coastal state, Kerala has led Indian engagement with foreign countries and cultures. It has been at the frontier of trade. 

8. Two thousand years ago, Roman ships used to come to the Malabar Coast. Later, merchant ships from Arabia and then from Europe were attracted to the ports of Kerala in their search for spices. They wrote of the efficiency and ethical practices of the ports. And praised the honesty of the administrators they met here in Kerala. In the 15th century, the Chinese explorer Zheng He was repeatedly drawn to Kerala and made several voyages to this state. 

9. Today, Kerala continues to attract the international community. Your beautiful state is one of India’s leading tourism destinations. The Ayurveda centres here are world renowned for helping people recover from crippling illnesses and rejuvenating them mentally. And as I learnt while launching the Technocity project today, Kerala also has a growing IT exports industry. 

10. Just as outsiders have flocked to Kerala, Kerala’s people too have ventured out of their home state and contributed to the world. A few weeks ago I travelled to Ethiopia on my first visit abroad as President of India. I met senior people in Ethiopia who turned emotional when they spoke of the impact of Indian school teachers on their lives 30 or 40 years ago. A large number of those pioneering school teachers were from Kerala. 

11. This is not the only example. The Malayalee migrant community is the backbone of the work-force of so many Gulf States. And it faithfully sends back remittances to help in the development of Kerala and of India. 

12. Nursing and health-care providers from Kerala are well-regarded for the excellence of their work across India and in many other countries. In Delhi and Mumbai and other cities, no hospital and practically no government or corporate office can function smoothly without the contribution of Malayalee staff members. As I pointed out earlier today, I too depended on colleagues from Kerala during my career as a lawyer. 

13. There is much to commend in this professional approach and outgoing attitude. Not only are the people of Kerala educated and knowledgeable, they are – I should say you are – willing to use that education and knowledge to venture out and to help build our nation. And to contribute to the well-being and the prosperity of other regions. 

14. This is not an easy thing to do. I can understand and appreciate the emotions of a person who has left his or her home in Kerala to go far away for work. The tug of home, the memories of one’s village and family and friends – these are hard on the heart. I have had to migrate myself, and had to leave my village in Kanpur for the city and finally for Delhi in search of education and work. 

15. The irony – happy irony I should say – is that part of my home in Kanpur is now occupied by a very nice and straight-forward person from Kerala, Mr George. He has been our tenant for the past 10 years, and he is the best tenant anybody can hope to have. 

Friends

16. I cannot end without pointing to one of the other markers of Kerala’s identity – your love for football. This is the home of so many of India’s most devoted football fans. 

17. India has successfully hosted the Under-17 Football World Cup. The final is to be played in Kolkata tomorrow. Some of the earlier matches were played here in Kerala. I hope you enjoyed the matches. I congratulate the state and the organizers for the smooth conduct of those matches. You have done the country proud. I also congratulate the spectators – some among you too may have gone to the matches. 

18. That happy, sporting spirit is so typical and so lovable of Kerala. Please keep it up. It makes you and makes your state special. Best wishes to all of you and to Kerala. And once again, thank you for such a memorable reception. 

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, addressed a civic reception hosted for him at Tagore Theatre, Thiruvananthapuram today (October 27, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that historically Kerala is a land of spiritualism, with a tradition of spiritual leadership and social reform extending from AdiShankaracharya to Sri Narayana Guru to Ayyankali and so many others. 

The President said that Kerala’s traditions and thinking have been humanistic, people-oriented and democratic. The emphasis on human development and on health-care and education in Kerala has set an example for the rest of the country. In sanitation, Kerala’s achievements are praiseworthy. In local self-government and panchayati raj, again Kerala has deepened our democracy. 

The President said that not only are the people of Kerala educated and knowledgeable, they are willing to use that education and knowledge to venture out and to help build our nation and to contribute to the well-being and the prosperity of other regions. 

The President said that today, Kerala continues to attract the international community. This beautiful state is one of India’s leading tourism destinations. He stated that just as outsiders have flocked to Kerala, Kerala’s people too have ventured out of their home state and contributed to the world. The Malayalee migrant community is the backbone of the work-force of so many Gulf States. And it faithfully sends back remittances to help in the development of Kerala and of India. 

Earlier in the day, the President paid tributes to social reformer Ayyankali by garlanding his statue in Thiruvananthapuram. He also launched the Technocity project and laid the foundation stone for the first government building in Technocity in Thiruvananthapuram. Tomorrow, he will grace the valedictory function of the diamond jubilee celebrations of High Court of Kerala in Kochi before returning to Delhi.

                1. I am very very happy to be here to lay the foundation stone of the first government IT Building in Technocity –and to launch what will be the fourth phase of Technopark. This isone of the iconic Information Technology facilities in not only Kerala but our country. I must point out that such is the attraction of Kerala, it has drawn me for the second time in this month. And I have come on a special day. This morning at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, I was privileged to pay my humble tributes to my predecessor and to a great son of Kerala, Dr K.R. Narayanan, on his birth anniversary. 

2. Dr Narayanan’s rise from a humble background to the highest office in our country was an inspiration for many of us. In his scholarship and learning, he combined some of the best legacies of Kerala and its people. 

3. The wisdom of Kerala is also apparent in its spiritualism. As I pointed out on my previous visit, this state is one of the spiritual homes of our society. I had the good fortune of meeting Mata Amritanandamayi and inaugurating large-scale public welfare programmes of her Foundation. Truly, as Kerala has taught us, service to the divine lies in service to fellow human beings. 

4. This sense of service has been deeply imbibed by the people of Kerala. I would say it has become your economic calling card. This is a state with an appreciable track record in public health and education, and is a front-runner in our country’s quest to achieve total literacy. It is logical therefore that Kerala has also become known for its strengths in the services sector and the knowledge economy. 

5. The future of our economy and of our employment creation is heavily dependent on the success we achieve with Digital India. The jobs of tomorrow will come more and more from digital services and other opportunities that are derived from the Internet. 

6. Kerala is potentially a power-house of Digital India. It is one of India’s most connected states, with among the highest rates of mobile phone penetration. I understand that the government is making efforts to bridge the digital divide and provide free Internet connections to two million poorer families by using a new optic fibre network. And there is ample evidence that our people, even those at the bottom of the pyramid, are very adaptive and can easily embrace and use new technology. 

7. The Kerala IT sector has been growing. Among all Indian states, it is currently ranked eighth in terms of exports by IT and IT-enabled services companies. The IT sector provides direct employment to one hundred thousand (or one lakh) people in Kerala. This is only the tip of the iceberg. There is immense capacity to make these numbers grow. 

8. Kerala’s strengths in basic literacy and skills – and the experience of Kerala’s people in the services sector and in consumer driven industries – make this state a natural for an IT ecosystem. I am confident that early development of Technocity will only accelerate this process. 

Friends

9. In many parts of the country, people from Kerala are an essential part of the economic landscape. I must confess that my own career as a lawyer was helped in no small measure by the dedication and unstinted support of staff members and colleagues who happened to be from Kerala. I remain grateful to them. 

10. And such achievements are by no means limited to India. Without the hard work of our brothers and sisters from Kerala, the economies of the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries would not be the same. Kerala migrant workers in those countries also contribute to the development of Indiaby unfailingly sending back foreign exchange. We cannot forget them or their immense role in nation building. 

11. Kerala’s fame as an educated and enlightened society goes far and wide. Recently, I travelled to Ethiopia on my first visit abroad as President of India. Wherever I went and whomsoever I spoke to in Ethiopia, there was always mention of the role of Indian school teachers. They arrived in Ethiopia 30-40 years ago and went to remote locations to teach little children. They shaped a society and its values – and became excellent ambassadors for India in Africa. Many of those teachers who are so remembered in Ethiopia, I was happy to learn, were from Kerala. 

Friends

12. Climbing higher in the services sector value chain, Kerala has obvious advantages in three areas. The first is of course Information Technology. The others are tourism and health-care. These are also the areas where jobs and employment opportunities lie for our youth – especially for the talented young men and women of Kerala. 

13. In tourism, this state is known the world over as God’s Own Country – and not without reason. It is one of our planet’s stand-out destinations. It is blessed with a spectacular natural beauty. 

14. Yet, natural beauty is not enough to build a tourist destination. Hard work and planning have to go into it as well. Here the local people of Kerala – across the socio-economic spectrum – deserve to be congratulated for having created a remarkable hospitality industry and I would say hospitality culture. This is a role model for many parts of India. 

15. In health-care, Kerala has long been known for its expertise in traditional healing systems such as Ayurveda. Kerala has also carved an identity for itself with the skills and diligence of its health-care providers. 

16. Hospitals and medical centres across the country – and in many other countries as well – simply cannot function without the ever smiling and ever attentive “Sisters from Kerala”. In nursing, hospital and medical services and care for the sick and the aged, health-care workers from Kerala, both men and women, are internationally sought after. 

17. As populations age and as health-care becomes more complex, demand for trained and capable human hands for the health-care industry will also only rise. This can provide numerous opportunities for young Indians. Kerala in particular has a head-start. We are seeing the advent of Artificial Intelligence and robotics in this area as well. But it is impossible for machines to match the empathy and emotions of a trained and dedicated nurse or care provider. 

18. In conclusion, I must emphasise that IT is not just important in itself. It is a force multiplier for the entire services economy. It has played a game changing role in health-care, education, tourism and many other industries. Some of these areas, as we have seen, are Kerala’s strengths. That gives me confidence that the development of Technocity will provide many, many new opportunities for the young people of Kerala. I wish all of you the very best. 

Thank you 

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited the laboratory and the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, today (October 24, 2017).

Later, the President participated in a roundtable discussion with scientists at IISc, Bengaluru. Addressing the scientist community, the President said that Knowledge, Discovery and Innovation are three of the four wheels that take a country forward. The fourth is our Society. Each wheel must move in co-ordination, in pace and in the right direction. The slightest misstep by one will take us in the wrong direction or stall us. Scientists have an immense responsibility. They are directly in charge of three wheels. But unless they connect every day with the fourth, society, we have no future.

The President said that India faces enormous challenges. We are to lift our people out of poverty, ensure their health and well-being and ensure our food and energy security. Society rightly demands solutions to these problems. On the other hand, scientists must not compromise their quest for knowledge – from atoms to galaxies. And these two endeavours are not contradictory.

The President said that we have seen how ISRO has succeeded through the efforts of the late Dr Satish Dhawan in combining cutting-edge science with helping farmers. And in linking ISRO’s research, applications and innovation with the academic capacities of IISc. The challenge is to replicate that partnership and that synergy, across institutions and across disciplines.

The President said that today scientists have the opportunity to pioneer a revolution where all the scientific institutes in Bengaluru work together. They can share their strengths and show by example how science and technology can take us to new heights. The spark from their efforts in Bengaluru can light the flame of knowledge all over the country. It can help take the culture of innovation further and deeper – from lab to shop floor, right down to school classrooms.

Leading scientists from Bengaluru presented a flavour of their plans for a paradigm shift in the way their efforts have become more collaborative and thereby more effective. In addition to IISc, scientists from JNCASR, inStem, NCBS, the Raman Institute and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics were present. The speakers pointed out that India has shown leadership in astronomy and mega- physics as well as materials research. In bio-technology too, our research is at global levels. The science leaders said that there is a sense of shared purpose and collaboration to take on new challenges and help achieve the goals of New India 2022. 

Those present at the roundtable discussion included Dr R. Chidambaram, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India; Professor Anurag Kumar Director, IISc; Dr K. Vijay Raghavan, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology; Dr Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology; Shri K.K. Sharma, Secretary, Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development; Shri Kiran Kumar, Chairman, ISRO; Dr S. Christopher, Chairman, DRDO and other scientists who spoke in the discussions and made presentations before the President.

It is the duty of every person in the country to connect with the objectives of this Yatra and provide our children the opportunity and experience of being citizens of a better India.

The President said that Shri Kailash Satyarthi has been contributing towards the cause of human rights of children for almost 40 years. He said he had been made aware that more than 85,000 children have been rescued from atrocities by the efforts of Shri Satyarthi. They have received educational opportunities and have been helped to start their lives afresh.

The President said that there are policies and laws to ensure the rights of children in our country. However, these rights can only be ensured through the awareness and sensitivity of the entire society. Millions of people, from south to north, have been made aware of this issue through this Bharat Yatra.

The President said the country must come together to ensure every child receives education and achieves his or her full potential with freedom and dignity, while being healthy and secure. Shri Kailash Satyarthi’s Foundation is always striving to achieve these objectives. He appreciated the Foundation and all those associated with it. He hoped that together we would build an India where there will be no scope for sexual abuse and human trafficking of children.

Speaking on the occasion, Nobel Prize Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi said the Bharat Yatra for ‘Surakshit Bachpan-Surakshti Bharat’ was a non-violent war on sexual abuse, rape and trafficking of children. He said that the voices of children cannot be silent any more. On Diwali this year, he urged all to light a lamp in the name of protection of children.

On the occasion, the President also lit a symbolic Diya – ‘Bal Suraksha Jyoti’. A photo exhibition was hosted at the venue and a short film that provided a glimpse of the Bharat Yatra was also screened.

                Children who arrived at Rashtrapati Bhavan from Rameswaram by the bus ‘Dr Kalam Sandesh Vahini Vision 2020’ called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 15, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Dr Kalam is one of the greatest personalities ever. He said that he saluted Dr Kalam and his monumental achievements as a scientist, a scholar and as the President of India. One of the best ways of building the character of the youth of any country is to inspire them to read biographies of great personalities. 

The President said that Dr Kalam was one of India’s greatest visionaries and is fondly remembered as ‘The Missile Man of India’ and ‘People’s President’. He has made momentous contribution to India’s scientific heritage through his involvement in varied fields ranging from nuclear technology to designing low cost stents for the heart or lightweight calipers for polio victims. India will never forget the remarkable contributions of Dr Kalam. He had a great passion for teaching and education and truly ignited young minds with the power to think and innovate. He enjoyed being with people. He was adored by people and youngsters. He loved students and spent his final moments among them. 

The President said that the Dr Kalam Sandesh Vahini bus presents the life story of Dr Kalam in a very interesting manner. He appreciated the effort. He said he was sure that a large number of Indians, especially the young people have benefited by seeing the mobile exhibition on the life, works and the vision of Dr Kalam. 

The Kalam Sandesh Vahini was launched by House of Kalam and Chinmaya University. The Vahini depicts various incidents from Dr Kalam’s life as well as key highlights of India’s scientific achievements, with an aim to educate and inspire the masses. It was flagged off by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi from Rameswaram on July 27, 2017, during the inauguration ceremony of Dr Kalam’s memorial. The Vahini has travelled from Rameswaram, through various states, to finally arrive at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. 

Earlier in the day, the President paid floral tributes at the portrait of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, former President of India, on the occasion of his birth anniversary at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Officers and staff of Rashtrapati Bhavan along with family members of Dr Kalam also paid floral tributes on the occasion.

The first day of the 48th Conference of Governors/Lt Governors at Rashtrapati Bhavan concluded today (October 12, 2017) with presentations and a discussion on the themes of ‘Higher Education in States’ and ‘Skill Development and Entrepreneurship - Making Youth Employable’.  The Minister of HRD, Shri Prakash Javadekar, and Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, made presentations covering the vision and roadmap for addressing the issues on the agenda.  Governors also gave their feedback and views, and cited experiences from their States. 

 

The agenda of the Conference has been shaped by the over-arching national mission to achieve ‘New India-2022’.  India will complete 75 years of Independence in 2022. The Union Government has developed a vision for ‘New India-2022’ that will require initiatives in education and skill building, enhancing educational, health and sanitation capacities of citizens, and upgrading infrastructure. Also envisaged is better access to and quality of public services. 

 

Twenty-seven Governors and three Lt. Governors of States and Union Territories are participating in the Conference. The Administrators of the UTs of Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu as well as of Lakshadweep are special invitees. The Vice-President, the Prime Minister, Minister for Home Affairs and other Union Ministers also participated in the Conference today.

 

Earlier in the day, in his opening remarks at the Conference, President Ram Nath Kovind said that it is essential to link youth with the process of nation building. Special attention needs to be paid to higher education and skill development at the level of States.  Addressing the participants, the President emphasised the need to trust citizens. He gave the examples of self-attestation of documents by individuals and the easier mechanism for obtaining a passport that is in place now, urging States to take forward this philosophy of trusting the citizen.

 

The President said that in the context of development of each part of the country, it was crucial to have a special focus on tribal and indigenous communities in the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The President said the dream of a developed India will be realised only when every State develops.

 

Following the President, the Doyen of Governors or the senior most Governor at the Conference, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan, Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, spoke on the gamut of developmental challenges, ranging from energy and technology to health and sustainable development.

 

The first session was addressed by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Referring to the mission of achieving New India by 2022, the Prime Minister emphasised that this can be achieved only with widespread popular participation. He said that it is important to encourage innovation not just in terms of new technology but also finding solutions to long-standing problems. He encouraged Governors to interact at length with students and teachers. He said universities should be centres of innovation. He suggested Governors could encourage their States and especially the youth and the university network to adopt one sport (other than cricket) in which the State had potential and attempt to build excellence in it. 

 

A presentation was made by Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog on the elements of New India-2022. He said that the focus would be on a clean, healthy and safe India, with new benchmarks of governance, greater transparency and higher accountability.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, opened the 48th Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 12, 2017). The Conference is being attended by Twenty-seven Governors and three Lt. Governors of States and Union Territories. The Administrators of the UTs of Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu as well as of Lakshadweep are also participating in the Conference as special invitees.

In his opening address, the President said that by participating in this Conference, Governors and Lt. Governors get a good opportunity to discuss important issues and share experiences from their respective States. He stated that Governors play the role of a bridge between the Union Government and States. The obligation of Governors to preserve and uphold the Constitution and commit themselves to the service and welfare of the people is even more pronounced in the current paradigm of Co-operative Federalism.

The President said critical milestones and national goals have been set in the context of the completion of 75 years of independence in 2022. This period is only five years away, and the Government of India has resolved to build a society that is safe and secure, prosperous, ensures opportunity for all, and is a leader in science and technology. Given the magnitude of this task, it is necessary that the entire country works unitedly and is on the same page. The five years from 2017 to 2022 are devoted to the creation of New India, one free of corruption, poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and unhygienic conditions. Simultaneously, a strong foundation will also be laid for the coming generations. In order to ensure ‘Team India’ advances in a single direction to achieve these national goals, Governors should inspire and connect all relevant stakeholders in their respective States.

The President said that it is essential to link youth with the process of nation building. The future of the country depends on the capacities, moral values and compassion of the younger generation. Special attention needs to be paid to higher education and skill development at the level of States. This is particularly true given the challenges of automation and Artificial Intelligence. The President pointed out that 69 per cent of Universities in the country fall under the purview of State Governments, and 94 per cent of all college and university students study in these institutions.

The President said technology can propel us to reach even difficult and long-term goals, and help ensure access to quality public services for all citizens. He also stressed trusting citizens more and gave the examples of self-attestation of documents by individuals and the easier mechanism for obtaining a passport. He urged the replication of these ideas at the level of States, since much of citizen’s interaction with Government agencies is at the level of States.

The President said that being an intrinsic part of the legislative system in their States, Governors can provide a new dimension to the development of their States by communicating with legislators, and inviting them to Raj Bhavan to deliberate on subjects related to public well-being. By establishing communication with University Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors, academicians, social workers and other thoughtful and enlightened citizens in the States, Governors could help raise the quality of discussion and debate and provide an impetus to society and the State government.

The President concluded by expressing hope that this Conference could help the Union Government and the States work together in the interests of all citizens, especially young people. The dream of a developed India will be realised, he said, only when every State develops.

Those participating in the inaugural session included the Vice President; the Prime Minister; Minister of Home Affairs; Minister of Law & Justice and Electronics & Information Technology; Minister of Health & Family Welfare; Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare; Minister of Human Resource Development; Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship; Minister of Railways & Coal; Minister of State (I/C) of Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region, Minster of State (I/C) of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs and Vice Chairman and CEO of NITI Aayog.

The two-day Conference will deliberate on distinct agenda items in different sessions. The theme of the opening session was ‘New India-2022’. The first session of the Conference was addressed by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. There was also a presentation by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog, on the elements of ‘New India 2022’.

The second session is on the subjects of ‘Higher Education in States’ and ‘Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to Make Youth Employable’. In the third session, to take place on October 13, 2017, Governors will make brief remarks on any special issues pertaining to their respective States/Union Territories. In the concluding session, a brief report on the deliberations will be presented by the respective conveners.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence in Public Administration, Academics and Management for the year 2017 to Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 10, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the occasion revived memories of our former Prime Minister, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri. He was an exceptional leader who believed in simple living and gave the slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’. He said that Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak was the most deserving person for an award named after Shri Shastri as he has contributed immensely in the direction of getting rid of the practice of manual scavenging. The Mayor of New York had declared April 14, 2016 as the ‘Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak International Day’ keeping in mind this contribution made by Dr. Pathak. He also received the Padma Bhushan in 1991. 

The President said that Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak has contributed to making revolutionary changes in society and has put into practice the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Lal Bahadur Shastri He also complimented the Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management for honouring people who have made such valuable contributions. 

The Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management, set up in Delhi in 1995, has instituted the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence in Public Administration, Academics and Management. Each year, the award honours an Indian who is an exceptionally outstanding and distinguished business leader, management practitioner, public administrator, educator or institution builder for his/her sustained individual contributions and achievements. 

Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak is the founder of Sulabh International and has developed and implemented, on a pan India scale, a low cost and appropriate toilet technology popularly known as the Sulabh Shauchalaya system.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated India Water Week-2017 today (October 10, 2017) in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that water is essential to life. It is fundamental to the economy and to ecology – and to human equity. The issue of water is becoming still more critical in view of climate change and related environmental concerns. Better and more efficient use of water is a challenge for Indian agriculture and industry alike. It requires us to set new benchmarks in both our villages and in the cities we build.

The President said that currently, 80 per cent of water in India is used by agriculture and only 15 per cent by industry. In the coming years, this ratio will change. The total demand for water will also rise. Efficiency of water use and reuse, therefore, has to be built into the blueprint of industrial projects. Business and industry need to be a part of the solution.

The President said that in urban India, 40 billion litres of waste water is produced every day. It is vital to adopt technology to reduce the toxic content of this water, and to deploy it for irrigation and other purposes. This has to be part of any urban planning programme.

The President urged a water management approach that is localised. He stated that it should empower village and neighbourhood communities and build their capacity to manage, allocate and value their water resources. Any 21st century water policy must factor in the concept of the value of water. It must encourage all stakeholders, including communities, to expand their minds – and to graduate from allocating a quantum of water to allocating a quantum of benefits.

The President said that access to water is a byword for human dignity. For India, providing safe drinking water to a population spread across six hundred thousand villages and urban areas is not just a project proposal. It is a sacred commitment. The government has prepared a strategic plan for ensuring drinking water supply in all rural areas by 2022, when India complete 75 years of Independence. By that year, the goal is to cover 90 per cent of rural households with piped water supply. We cannot fail. The deliberations of this conference have to ensure that we do not fail.

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari; Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti; Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal; and Minister of State for HRD and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr Satya Pal Singh.

                I am happy to be here to inaugurate the Fifth India Water Week 2017. I would particularly like to welcome the international delegates, from the European Union countries and elsewhere. They are joining their Indian counterparts in discussions related to this extremely important subject.

As we all know, water is essential to human life. In fact, since 60 per cent of the human body is water, it can be said that water is life itself. Without water, no field of human activity can be complete. Today, the world is debating if the flow of information is more important than the flow of energy. That is a good question. But the flow of water is still more important. It is fundamental to the economy and to ecology – and to human equity. The issue of water is becoming still more critical in view of climate change and related environmental concerns.

In India, water is central to some of our flagship programmes. I would go to the extent of saying that the modernisation of India is dependent on the modernisation of its water management. This is not surprising since our country supports 17 per cent of the global population – but has only four per cent of the world’s water resources.

Better and more efficient use of water is a challenge for Indian agriculture and industry alike. It requires us to set new benchmarks in both our villages and in the cities we build.

In India, 54 per cent of people are dependent on farming for their livelihood. Yet, their share of national income is only 14 per cent. To make agriculture more remunerative and to improve the prosperity of farming communities, the government has introduced many new projects. These include:

1. ‘Har Khet ko Paani’– Water for Every Farm: This requires enhancing the supply and availability of water

2. ‘Per Drop, More Crop’: This requires using drip irrigation and related methods to improve farm productivity, while using the same volume of water

3. ‘Doubling Farm Incomes by 2022’: To achieve this, the government is rapidly expanding the area under irrigation, and completing 99 long-pending irrigation projects. Sixty per cent of these projects are in drought-prone areas

I move now to India’s industrialisation and the role that water will play there. Under the Make in India mission, India is working to sharply increase the share of manufacturing in our GDP. From the current 17 per cent of GDP, we are determined to take it to 25 per cent by 2025.

Industry requires a large volume of water. This is particularly true for the manufacture of electronic hardware, computers and mobile phones. And these are all focus areas for Make in India.

Currently, 80 per cent of water in India is used by agriculture and only 15 per cent by industry. In the coming years, this ratio will change. The total demand for water will also rise. Efficiency of water use and reuse, therefore, has to be built into the blueprint of industrial projects. Business and industry need to be a part of the solution. That is why I am glad large manufacturing companies are present at this conference.

Friends

India is urbanising at a rate not seen in its history. An effort is being made to build or upgrade 100 modern cities as part of the Smart Cities initiative. As we know, reuse of water, solid waste management and better sanitation infrastructure and practices are benchmarks to assess Smart Cities.

In urban India, 40 billion litres of waste water is produced every day. It is vital to adopt technology to reduce the toxic content of this water, and to deploy it for irrigation and other purposes. This has to be part of any urban planning programme.

I must also point to the significant regional variations in India when it comes to the experience with water. On the one hand, groundwater sources are being savagely exploited and depleted in some of our northern and western states. On the other hand, in eastern and North-eastern states, there is the challenge of overflowing rivers and of regular flooding. Year after year, this damages human habitation and is leading to tragedies in countless families.

Only a multi-stakeholder and multi-pronged approach can address such calamities. This includes achieving an interlinking of rivers where feasible. It also necessitates a basin-wide management of river systems to both keep rivers clean as well as serve the purpose of different types of users. The Namami Gange project is a good start in this regard. We need to extend such thinking to other river systems in India and the Indian subcontinent, especially in the eastern part of our country.

In conclusion, I would urge a water management approach that is localised. It should empower village and neighbourhood communities and build their capacity to manage, allocate and value their water resources. Any 21st century water policy must factor in the concept of the value of water. It must encourage all stakeholders, including communities, to expand their minds – and to graduate from allocating a quantum of water to allocating a quantum of benefits.

Of course, this quantum of benefits will be dynamic. It will inevitably be linked to the mapping and forecast of livelihood patterns in human society. And these keep evolving.

By that year, the goal is to cover 90 per cent of rural households with piped water supply.

We cannot fail. The deliberations of this conference have to ensure that we do not fail. And I am sure, we will not fail.

With these words, I wish India Water Week 2017 all success.

Thank you.

Jai Hind!

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Vayoshreshtha Samman – a scheme of National Awards for senior citizens today (October 9, 2017) at a function held in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that there is a healthy tradition of respecting and taking care of elders in our country. He added according to the last census, the population of senior citizens in our country was approximately 10.5 crore, which was about 8.5% of our total population. The average life expectancy has increased in recent decades due to improvement in health services and other reasons. It is estimated that by the year 2050, the number of senior citizens will be approximately 19% of our total population.

 

The President said that he was happy to note that the Government of India has taken several steps for the welfare of elderly persons. These include the National Programme for Healthcare of the Elderly wherein specialised services will be provided for their treatment. Under the National Health Insurance Scheme implemented with the help of State Governments, additional health insurance is being provided.

 

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment.

 The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the initiation of various welfare progammes organised by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math today (October 8, 2017) in Kollam, Kerala.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President referred to Kerala’s role as one of the leading spiritual homes of our country and of our composite society. He stated that the bravery of our soldiers and the compassion and wisdom of our spiritual leaders are twin pillars on which we rest our hopes. These keep our civilisation secure. The flame of spiritualism shines brightly in Kerala and has done so for thousands of years. Revered people as Adi Shankaracharya, Sri Narayana Guru and Ayyankali did much to unite our country with a common sense of spiritualism – as well as to push for much-needed social reform.

 

The President said that Kerala’s spiritual consciousness is beyond faith and religious distinctions. The Christian community here is one of the oldest not only in India, but anywhere in the world. The first mosque to be built in India is in Kerala. Kerala also has a rich Jewish heritage. These historical instances reflect the mutual accommodation and understanding of different faiths and religious communities in Kerala. This is a state where one community has willingly given space to another. This is a history that we cannot forget and must learn from. And this is an accommodation and understanding that is at the essence of spiritualism.

 

Praising Mata Amritanandamayi for her social work, the President said that she represents the enlightened spiritual tradition of Kerala. Like Adi Shankara or Ayyankali she sees her spiritual mission as a contribution to nation building. She recognises, as only the truly spiritual can, that the greatest service to the Divine is service to fellow human beings. And the greatest service we can render to our fellow human beings – especially to those less privileged than us – is to help them achieve their potential. This includes building their capacity in health and education, and ensuring that they get equal opportunities. The Mata Amritanandamayi Math, the President noted, has worked precisely in these areas.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the India-Ethiopia Business Dialogue, organised to commemorate the 12th Anniversary of the India Business Forum in Addis Ababa today (October 5, 2017). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Ethiopia and India have been trading with each other for centuries. Trade relations between Ethiopia and India flourished during the ancient Axumite Empire from the 1st century AD. Today the economic relationship covers trade, private investment, concessional loans for infrastructure projects and development assistance, largely for capacity building. 

The President said that India is now among the top three foreign investors in Ethiopia. Indian investment has made a mark in textiles and garments, engineering, plastics, water management, consultancy and ICT, education, pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Indian investments in Ethiopia have had a significant presence in manufacturing and value addition to local resources. They have created jobs in this country and contributed to the prosperity of Ethiopian families. He congratulated the Indian Business Forum for playing a lead role in encouraging Indian investment and promoting trade and commerce between India and Ethiopia. 

The President said that India’s relationship with Ethiopia is symbolic of its engagement with the African continent, of which Addis Ababa is such a vital hub. At the Third India Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in 2015, India had announced the offer of concessional credit of US$ 10 billion over the next five years to Africa. This was in addition to the on-going credit programme. We have also committed to a grant assistance of US$ 600 million that will include an India-Africa Development Fund of US$ 100 million and an India-Africa Health Fund of US$ 10 million. The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor is another initiative brimming with potential. 

The President invited business stake-holders in Ethiopia and Africa to partner us in these frameworks and benefit from them. He stated that it is critical that such large projects are designed transparently and bring prosperity to local communities. In the end, the President added, trade and investment works best - or rather works only - when it helps host communities and people on the ground. 

Earlier in the day, the President visited the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa and led delegation-level talks with his counterpart, President Mulatu Teshome. The talks covered a gamut of developmental and trade themes. President Kovind mentioned India’s willingness to positively consider support for power transmission projects in Ethiopia, as well as announced specific assistance in the areas of healthcare, education and agriculture. The two Presidents witnessed the signing of two bilateral agreements – the first on Trade Facilitation and the second related to the Information Communication and Media sector. 

Later this evening, the President will hold talks with Mr Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, as well as attend a banquet in his honour to be hosted by President Teshome.

It is my pleasure to be here for the India-Ethiopia Business Dialogue and to address a business community that is, really, the legatee of an age-old relationship.

Ethiopia and India are old civilisations with young populations. Ethiopia is the cradle of humankind. Earlier today, at the National Museum in this city, I was privileged to get a glimpse of the remains of Lucy, who is in a sense our common mother. It is not without reason that Ethiopia, a stead-fast friend and a sister civilisation for India, is the focus of my first overseas visit since taking charge as President of India. 

Our countries have been trading with each other for centuries. Trade relations between Ethiopia and India flourished during the ancient Axumite Empire from the 1st century AD. The earliest recorded evidence of our bilateral commercial engagement is in the form of Indian traders coming to the ancient Red Sea port of Adulis to trade silk and spices for gold and ivory.

In the 19th century, the pioneers of Indian investment to Ethiopia were businessmen from our western state of Gujarat, who migrated to this rich and fertile land.

In recent years, Ethiopia’s remarkable economic growth and progress has been an object of global admiration. And I am happy to note that India has been a partner in this growth through trade and commerce, through investments and sharing of expertise, as well as through the large and vibrant Indian business community present in Ethiopia.

I would like to congratulate the Indian Business Forum (or IBF) that represents this community. It is playing a lead role in encouraging Indian investment and promoting trade and commerce between India and Ethiopia. I understand IBF was set up in 2005 and is marking its 12th anniversary. I am also happy to learn that this Forum is the first partner-country forum of its kind in Ethiopia and represents more than 100 Indian companies.

India is now among the top three foreign investors in Ethiopia. Indian investment has made a mark in textile and garments, engineering, plastics, water management, consultancy and ICT, education, pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Indian investments in Ethiopia have had a significant presence in manufacturing and value addition to local resources. They have created jobs in this country, and they have contributed to the prosperity of Ethiopian families.

Ethiopia has been the largest recipient of Indian concessional lines of credit in Africa with over US$ 1 billion committed to projects in power transmission and sugar. I am happy to learn that the Finchaa sugar project has been completed and handed over to the Ethiopian side. Two other projects in the sugar sector have also gone into production, and are expected to be handed over shortly.

It is a matter of pride for us that Indian investment is lauded and is considered a model worthy of emulation. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge efforts of IBF and its members. You have been fair and loyal partners to the people and business stake-holders of Ethiopia as well as excellent ambassadors of your country. In India, we are proud of you.

India’s bilateral partnership with Ethiopia is deep and wide. In the past seven decades, our diplomatic engagement has helped us collaborate in virtually every avenue of human activity. Both our governments have identified trade and economic relations as a priority for the near future. The economic relationship covers trade, private investment, concessional loans for infrastructure projects and development assistance, largely for capacity building.

The Indian economy is in the early stages of an exciting journey. Ambitious policy measures such as the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have made doing business in India easier. GST has unified the Indian market, hitherto segmented among multiple states and tax jurisdictions. Under our flagship programmes like Make in India and Start-up India, we have made concerted efforts to attract technology, investments and best practices from across the world.

Our programmes directed at the social sector – such as those for skilling our youth and providing housing for all – and massive infrastructure programmes are opening up new opportunities and creating the impulse for rapid growth. We are also willingly embracing technology and digital solutions, and using these to better the lives of our most underprivileged fellow citizens.

These reforms and initiatives are aimed at transforming the country and laying the foundations of a New India. Yet, there is much we can both learn from and share with the world, and particularly with partner developing countries like Ethiopia. I would say to our global friends that there has been no better time to engage with India.

Both Ethiopia and India have young populations. Our youth are our greatest resource. But to realise their potential, we need to educate them and give them the skills needed to become productive in an increasingly complex world. After all, the building of a 21st century economy requires the building of human capital – and equipping it for 21st century economic realities.

Along with a similar demographic profile, Ethiopia and India face similar challenges related to the health and well-being of our populations. India has been a source of affordable pharmaceuticals, generic medicines and specialised healthcare for the people of Africa, including Ethiopia. Education and health care will remain focus areas of our engagement with Ethiopia. 

Friends

 This business dialogue has helped us in bridging gaps between our business communities. Most important, it has identified actions the two governments could take to further facilitate investments and trade – be it in the realm of visa policies, banking procedures and laws, or customs regulations and practices.

Both our government want to create an enabling environment. For this, we value the specific recommendations made by our business communities today.

India’s relationship with Ethiopia is symbolic of its engagement with the African continent, of which Addis Ababa is such a vital hub. At the Third India Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in 2015, we had announced the offer of concessional credit of US$ 10 billion over the next five years to Africa. This was in addition to the ongoing credit programme. We have also committed to a grant assistance of US$ 600 million that will include an India-Africa Development Fund of US$ 100 million and an India-Africa Health Fund of US$ 10 million. The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor is another initiative brimming with potential.

I would invite you to partner us in these frameworks and benefit from them. It is critical that such large projects are designed transparently and bring prosperity to local communities. In the end, trade and investment works best – or I would say works only – when it helps host communities and people on the ground.

As Ethiopia’s long-standing partner, India remains optimistic about and invested in your growth story. We look forward to building on our numerous synergies and complementarities in sectors ranging from light manufacturing to food processing, clean and renewable energy to healthcare.  And in terms of capacity building of both people and institutions. Today, we have made a new beginning as partners in innovation and technology.  With our space programmes to inspire us, the sky is the limit for India and Ethiopia. Literally.

On a closing and more down-to-earth note, I must call upon Ethiopia and India to work together to push for reform in institutions of international financial and monetary governance, and make these relevant to our age. It is only appropriate that such ancient business partners as India and Ethiopia strive together for a more equitable and contemporary global economic architecture.

We owe this to the principles that we share. We owe this to the multilateral order that we both treasure. We owe this to the young people in both our countries who will inherit the future.

With these words I wish Ethiopian and Indian business delegations present here and IBF – and all others in this room   the very best.

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed an Indian community reception in Addis Ababa yesterday (October 4, 2017) hosted by the Ambassador of India to Ethiopia, Shri Anurag Srivastava.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said Indian community in Ethiopia has been at the centre of India-Ethiopia relations. As teachers and educators they have given a helping hand to nation building in their host country. As entrepreneurs, they have created economic opportunities and imparted skills to local people. As tech-professionals and workers they have added value to Ethiopian Industry. With hard work and dedication, the Indian community has built respect for itself within Ethiopian society. And yet it has retained and carried forward Indian values, family traditions and work ethic while adapting very well to this adopted home.

The President said that Ethiopia, like India, is a land of diversity, of multiple languages and varied cuisines; of music, dance and drama. The Indian community here must take advantage of the local eclectic culture as well as showcase and share our own cultural diversity. 

The President said both India and Ethiopia have large young populations. The youth are the future, and it is from them that new ideas would come. He advised the Indian community to make special efforts to connect with Ethiopia’s youth. He stated that this would help them germinate their ideas to provide solutions for a better world, be it tacking climate change or skilling people.

The President said the Government of India seeks sustained and proactive engagement with our overseas community. The purpose of this engagement is to provide an opportunity to familiarise the community with transformational changes taking place in India. The dialogue with the diaspora is also aimed at shaping possibilities and platforms through which it can participate in India’s growth and development.

The President said the Government of India cares for the overseas Indian community and keeps its promise to stand by them. He referred to efforts made to evacuate Indian citizens from Yemen (as part of Operation Rahat in 2015) and Libya, or more recently help individuals and families during the floods in parts of the United States.

The event in Addis Ababa was attended by some 500 members of Ethiopia’s Indian community. The Indian community is spread all over the country and is 5,000 strong.

President Kovind’s visit to Ethiopia continues today.

                I feel privileged to meet and address our Pravasi family in Djibouti. I am overwhelmed by your warmth and affection.

 

It is a matter of great honour for me to be the first Indian President to visit Djibouti.

 

It is also my first visit outside India after being elected President. This is no coincidence but a conscious decision on our part. Our relations with this   beautiful continent have a special place in our hearts, and we remain ever committed to deepen our fraternal bonds with the African people.

 

Friends,

As I speak about India’s special and enduring partnership with Africa, I am reminded of our greatest Pravasi, Mahatma Gandhi, for whom this continent was a sacred land. For it was here, that he, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, became the Mahatma.

 

This afternoon, shortly after I landed in Djibouti, I had the honour to pay my respects to Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of our Nation. This was even more special for I did so at the Nelson Mandela square. Remembering two of the greatest leaders to have ever walked this Earth, and that too, together, was truly a humbling experience. I could not have begun my visit to Africa more profoundly.

 

Friends,

Historical links and people-to-people contacts have existed between India and Djibouti since times immemorial.

 

The stories of our ancestors toiling in the Bab-al-Mandab are too well known. They bonded with Somali and Afar traders; and exchanged ideas and commerce with Arab merchants. I recount this tale to tell you how strong our maritime connect with Africa once was.  We must now try to rediscover this shared history and identity.

 

Much effort is required to resurrect our common heritage, not just for old time sake, but also to build a contemporary partnership. Blue economy and the depths of Indian Ocean provide immense possibilities to build a sustainable future. Its warm waters also present common security challenges.

 

The Ocean which connects us may be Indian in name, but belongs to all of us. Let it bind us together, as it had done centuries ago.

 

Friends, Our historic ties with Djibouti have given much comfort in building a multifaceted partnership. And while we have done our best to enhance our Government to Government relations; all of you present here have been the real champion of this partnership.

 

I say this because I know that in whatever capacity you have made Djibouti your home – be it as traders, as professionals, or as skilled workers, you have   shown a spirit of selfless and dedicated service to the people around you.

 

You have, while preserving your traditions, family values and strong work ethic, adapted very well in your adopted home, becoming pillars of support for the  local community and a source of pride for us.

 

And while you celebrate and preserve your fairs and festivals, you must also smear your colour and beauty on your Djiboutian friends.  You must share your culture and your stories with them.  

 

Someday, I would like to join you in Djibouti to splash the colour of Holi or to light the Aarti of Navratri. I hope I can count on your invitation! 

 

We Indians take much pride in our languages; be it Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, Malayalam or Hindi. I am truly elated that the Indian school here is passing them on to our younger generations.

 

Friends,

My message to you is that while we have Ambassador or Rajdoot to represent our government, all of you here are Rashtradoot or Representative of our Nation. Every Indian across the world is a Representative of India as he or she is the one who helps the world to understand India – its ethos and its strengths   

 

The rise of India is opening new opportunities for collaboration. Our Diaspora has an important role in building bridges between India and the world.

 

India is on a high growth trajectory. There is optimism and excitement in our country. We have undertaken to transform the lives of ordinary people, not in the distant future, but by 2022 when we celebrate 75 years of our Independence.

 

Through digital technology, innovation and clean energy, we want to leap-frog in our development pathway. From high speech rail to high speed fiber optic, we want to provide the best for our people. Our flag-ship programmes-Swachh Bharat, Start-up India, Digital India and Make in India are making good progress.

 

Our financial inclusion scheme Jan Dhan Yojana has provided formal banking facilities to over 300 million poor people.

 

Alongside economic empowerment, we are equally conscious of our social commitment. Our UJJWALA scheme has so far provided clean cooking fuel to over 29 million rural women.  For them the drudgery of collecting firewood and inhaling killer fumes are now things of the past.

 

Our approach to development has been to combine it with good governance. Fighting corruption and giving every person his or her due remains an article of faith for us.

 

Friends,

We want to embrace and connect with our Diaspora abroad, more than ever before. 

 

Through the use of Social Media, we have made it easier for the people to reach the government. We have started on-line portal MADAD to attend to consular grievances. Today, our Embassies are home to every Indian abroad. This is much to our delight and satisfaction.

 

Today, more than any other time, and in Djibouti more than any other place, you would know that India is there for you.  Operation Rahat that we carried out from Djibouti spotlights our unflinching commitment to our people abroad.  We are grateful to the Government of Djibouti for supporting and standing by us.  

 

The evacuation of 5000 Indian nationals together with 2000 nationals of about 40 countries could not have been done without your support. I would like to especially commend the role of our Honorary Consul Shri Nalin Kothari, his team and the community here. I must tell you that Operation Rahat has given us enduring respect and recognition from the global community.   

 

This Operation was just the beginning. Today, we are reaching out to all those in need. Be it women in distress in London or those needed to be evacuated from the Hurricane struck Islands in the Caribbean.

 

Friends,

I have come to Djibouti with a message of friendship and solidarity. I conveyed to the leadership the importance we attach to strengthening ties with this fraternal country. I am confident that my visit will open a new chapter of multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries.

 

I invite you to partner us in the rise of new India – an India which is inspired by the vision of our founding fathers and is determined to realize the aspirations of its people.

 

And as I do so, I am reminded of an African saying: If you want to walk fast, you walk alone, but if you want to walk far, you walk together. I leave that thought with you.

 

I thank you all for coming here today. I wish you and your families the best of health and happiness.

 

Thank you and Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has reached Djibouti today (October 3, 2017) in the first leg of his State Visit to two African countries - Djibouti and Ethiopia. The Prime Minister of Republic of Djibouti, Mr. Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed received the President at Ambouli International Airport. The two leaders then engaged in a short round of talks on bilateral relations and themes of common interest to both countries.

This is President Kovind’s first overseas visit after assuming office. It is also the first visit to Djibouti by an Indian Head of State or Head of Government. Shortly after leaving the airport, the President paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi by garlanding the bust of the Father of the Nation on Djibouti’s Nelson Mandela Avenue.

Later in the evening, the President addressed an Indian Community reception hosted by the Ambassador of India to Djibouti, Shri Anurag Srivastava. The reception was attended by about 200 people, roughly half the Indian/Indian origin population in Djibouti, some of them descendants of Indian traders who migrated from Jamnagar and Rajkot over 100 years ago. More recently, Indian blue-collar and white-collar workers, employed in the port in Djibouti or in IT companies, have added to the diaspora.

Addressing the gathering, the President said that while we have an Ambassador to represent our government, every member of the Indian community present here is a representative of our nation. In whatever capacity they have made Djibouti their home – be it as traders, as professionals, or as skilled workers, they have shown a spirit of selfless and dedicated service to the people around them. They have, while preserving their traditions, family values and strong work ethic, adapted very well in their adopted home, becoming pillars of support for the local community and a source of pride for India.

The President said that the rise of India is opening new opportunities for collaboration. Our diaspora has an important role in building bridges between India and the world. India is on a high growth trajectory. There is optimism and excitement in our country. We have undertaken to transform the lives of ordinary people by 2022 when we celebrate 75 years of our Independence. We want to embrace and connect with our diaspora abroad, the President said. He invited the Indian diaspora to partner in the rise of New India.

The President said that it was his first visit outside India after being elected President. That it was to Africa is no coincidence but a conscious decision on our part. Our relations with this beautiful continent have a special place in our hearts, and we remain ever committed to deepening our fraternal bonds with the African people.

The President said that historical links and people-to-people contacts have existed between India and Djibouti since times immemorial. We must now try to rediscover this shared history and identity. Much effort is required to resurrect our common heritage, not just for old times’ sake but to build a contemporary partnership. Prospects of the blue economy and the connect of the Indian Ocean provide immense possibilities to build a sustainable future.

The President said that Djibouti is a strategically located country, just off the Gulf of Aden. It is an important Indian Ocean partner country for India. During the Yemeni crisis of 2015, Djibouti was supportive of Indian efforts to evacuate Indian citizens, and those of other countries, as part of Operation Rahat, and offered use of an air strip.

President Kovind continues his visit to Djibouti tomorrow (October 4, 2017).

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited Kirti Mandir, Porbandar, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi today (October 2, 2017), and paid his tributes to Bapu on Gandhi Jayanti.  Later, the President addressed a function organised to declare ODF status for Rural Gujarat at Kirti Mandir.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that it was a privilege for him to visit the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi on this auspicious day.  By achieving the goal of Rural ODF status, Gujarat has paid true homage to Gandhiji. He congratulated the Chief Minister of Gujarat and his entire team for the achievement.

 

The President said that cleanliness is not the responsibility of only sanitation personnel and government departments; it is a multi-stakeholder national movement. About 100 years ago, Gandhiji had tried to inculcate this by cleaning toilets himself. Achieving the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission by October 2, 2019, will be an appropriate tribute to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, on his 150th birth anniversary. Today's achievement by Gujarat is a big step towards Clean India or Swachh Bharat.

 

The President also remembered Sardar Patel whose birthday too falls in this month, on October 31, and said that while Mahatma Gandhi was the leader of our independence movement, Sardar Patel was the sculptor of our national unity. It is impossible to imagine modern India without the contributions of Bapu and Sardar Patel. And both of these great men were Gujarat's gifts to India.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed a function organised to declare urban Maharashtra Open Defecation Free (ODF) today (October 1, 2017) in Mumbai.

 on the occasion, the President said that a healthy and prosperous India will be built only on the foundations of a clean India. He congratulated the Government and Chief Minister of Maharashtra on the historic occasion of urban Maharashtra being declared Open Defecation Free. He congratulated all the members of the “Swachh Maharashtra Team” and those who worked hard on the ground to achieve this goal and had kept to the commitment of a two-year deadline, set on October 2, 2015. He stated that such success is possible only with the cooperation and participation of all stakeholders.

The President said that the declaration of 'ODF' Urban Maharashtra is particularly relevant for the state as 49 per cent of Maharashtra’s people live in urban areas. ‘Smart Cities’, he said, also require ‘Smart Sanitation’ and ‘Smart Waste Management’. The President added that it was a matter of great satisfaction that the Government is focusing on sustainability of this successful campaign. The ‘OD Watch’ monitoring will be useful in alerting people and helping them quit old habits and not relapsing to open defecation. He hoped that just as the state has been successful in realising the goal of 'ODF', it would also realise the goal of 'Managing 100 per cent Waste'. The President said that tomorrow is Gandhi Jayanti and Maharashtra has paid a befitting tribute to Gandhiji by declaring urban Maharashtra Open Defecation Free today.

Earlier in the day, the President inaugurated the Shirdi International Airport, flagged-off the inaugural flight from Shirdi to Mumbai and also inaugurated the centenary year celebrations of the Samadhi of Shri Sai Baba in Shirdi.

Speaking in Shirdi, the President said that in our country, Sai Baba attracts people from every caste, religion, sect and class. Using simple phrases such as ‘Sabka Malik Ek Hai’, Sai Baba explained the philosophy of 'Advaita' to the common man. The influence of Sai Baba can be seen all over the world.

The President added that along with ‘spiritual connectivity’, the country also needed ‘physical connectivity’ through large infrastructure projects. He commended the building of the airport as a measure that would help pilgrims and visitors as well as trigger economic activity and job creation in Shirdi. He hoped that people in large numbers would use the Shirdi International Airport inaugurated today.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has issued the following message to the nation on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti.

In his message the President has said, “Gandhi Jayanti is an occasion for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the ideals and values of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

A man of simple living and a moral preceptor, Gandhiji gave a new direction to the country through his leadership. His philosophy of non-violence and peaceful co-existence is of increasing relevance in the present times. Through the symbols of Charkha, the spinning wheel and khadi, he stressed the message of self-reliance and dignity of labour.

Cleanliness is not only the responsibility of sanitation personnel and Government Departments. Today, India is fighting a decisive battle for cleanliness and hygiene through the ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign. Gandhiji believed that ‘Cleanliness is next to Godliness’. He visualised cleanliness as having three dimensions- a clean mind, a clean body and clean surroundings. Let us also commit ourselves to ensuring public hygiene, personal hygiene and environmental hygiene.

It is a multi-stakeholder national movement. Achieving the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission expeditiously will be a true expression of tribute and regard to Gandhiji on his birth anniversary.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that no Indian should fall prey to the hideous design of vested interests and anti-India proponents in fomenting trouble and weakening the unity and integrity of the country. He was delivering the first Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture, here today. The former Governor of Karnataka, Shri T.N. Chaturvedi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. The Vice President also administered the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas pledge on this occasion.  

 The Vice President said that by remembering this great man, remembering his words and achievements, we gain immense enthusiasm, inspiration and job-oriented self-confidence. He further said that the views of Sardar Patel are ideal for all of us and quoted Sardar Patel as saying, ""in a tough time the cowards find excuses, the brave people find the way"". Inspired by Mahatma ji, Sardar Patel’s ideals were nonviolence, skill, hard work, ability and efficiency, he added.

 The Vice President said that great qualities of Patel - loyalty to the leader, love for the motherland, unshakeable commitment to nationalism and complete steadfastness in completing the integration of diverse princely States with the Union of India without bothering about post or position. His was a monumental contribution in shaping the destiny of modern India and the country will remain ever grateful to him for ensuring its unity and integrity, he added.

 The Vice President said that India’s progress in various fields and its march as one of the major economies should not be allowed to be obstructed by anybody and every Indian should strive to uphold and strengthen country’s unity and integrity.

 Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:

 “आज हम भारत के लौह पुरुष, आज़ाद भारत के प्रथम उपप्रधान मंत्री और गृह मंत्री सरदार वल्लभ भाई पटेल की जयंती मना रहे हैं। यह एक महोत्सव है। इस महान पुरुष को याद करने से, उनके वचन और उपलब्धियों का स्मरण करके हमे अमित उत्साह, प्रेरणा और कार्योन्मुख आत्मविश्वास मिल जाते हैं।

 इस प्रेरण स्रोत को नमन करने से उनके जीवन के किस्सों का मनन करने से हमारे जनमानस में एकता, एकाग्रता, सतर्कता, भारतीयता की भावनायें उभर आती हैं।

 सरदार पटेल जी के विचार हम सब के लिए आदर्शपूर्ण हैं। उन्होंने कहा था कि “कठिन समय में कायर बहाना ढूंढते हैं, बहादुर व्यक्ति रास्ता खोजते हैं।” सरदार पटेल की बहादुरी हमें खेडा संघर्ष में, बारड़ोली के सशक्त सत्याग्रह में, देसी रियासतों को भारत सरकार में मिलाने में देख सकते हैं। प्रमुख कवि हरिवशंराय बच्चन जी ने 1950 में उनके बारे में लिखा था

 कठोर नग्न सत्य बोलता।

पटेल हिंद की नीडर जबान है।

 कवि उमाशंकर जोशी ने भी कहा था “His words are actions.” निर्भयता ही उनका कवच था। महात्मा जी से प्रेरित सेनानी सरदार का आदर्श थे, अहिंसा, कुशलता, कर्मठता, क्षमता और दक्षता।

 उनका प्रत्येक कार्य इन मूल्यों के प्रतिबिंब थे। कठिन से कठिन कार्य को उन्होंने बड़ी कुशलता से संपन्न करके दक्षता का परिचय दिया था। हाथ में हथौडा, हृदय में विश्वास , मन में अटूट संकल्प और वचन में मर्यादा को हम स्पष्ट रूप से देख सकते हैं। वे कहते थे - बोलने में मर्यादा मत छोडना, गालियाँ देना तो कायरों का काम है। उनके अनमोल वाक्य आज के देशवासियों के सामने अनुसरणीय आदर्श हैं।

 सरदार पटेल जी का महान व्यक्तित्व, आदर्शपूर्ण कृतित्व, उन्नत विचारधारा हमारे देश की अमूल्य, अतुलित धरोहर है। इस धरोहर के आधार पर हमें नए भारत को निर्मित करना है। इन आधारभूत मूल्यों की नींव पर एकात्म, समरस, सक्षम, सशक्त, समृद्व भारत का निर्माण करना है।

 As we gather here to pay tributes to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, we must all be grateful to his vision, determination, deftness and pragmatism in preventing the balkanization of the country and achieving the herculean task of politically integrating more than 560 princely States with the Union of India.

 He was a true nationalist, who placed the interests of the country above everything else. Nothing else except the country mattered most to him. It would be apt to describe him as the unifier of India and what was achieved by him during the turbulent days of partition remains unparalleled in modern history.

 He coaxed and persuaded rulers of princely States to merge with Indian Union and acted decisively by using force where it was required as in the case of Hyderabad when the Nizam not only nurtured ambitions to remain independent but also toyed with the idea of joining Pakistan. Codenamed ‘Operation Polo’, the swift action to liberate and integrate Hyderabad State with the rest of India took just four days and concluded on September 17, 1948.

 He was a towering personality with a heart of gold and remained unwavering in his loyalty to his mentor and the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, although the latter preferred Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to Patel to be the Congress President in 1946 and paved the way for him to become the country’s first Prime Minister.

 Without any ill-will, Patel withdrew his nomination from the race for the president’s post in favour of Pandit Nehru on the advice of Gandhiji.  The following statement exemplifies the greatness of Sardar Patel and his national fervor. “We both have been lifelong comrades in a common cause. The paramount interests of our country and our mutual love and regard, transcending such differences of outlook and temperaments as existed, have held us together.”

 I am mentioning that only to highlight the great qualities of Patel—loyalty to the leader, love for the motherland, unshakeable commitment to nationalism and complete steadfastness in completing the  integration of diverse princely States with the Union of India without bothering about post or position.

 He was a man of principles and character. His was a monumental contribution in shaping the destiny of modern India and the country will remain ever grateful to him for ensuring its unity and integrity.

 Here, I would like to recall what Maulana Azad had stated on Patel: “He made his choice out of the two courses that come before a man, namely would he live for his country or for himself. Sardar chose his country”.

 Praising the monumental contribution of Sardar Patel in unifying India, Pandit Nehru said: “History will record it in many pages and call him the builder and consolidator of the new India”.

 Gandhiji and Sardar Patel shared a unique relationship and at times differed on certain issues. In fact, Gandhiji lauded him for remaining firm on his convictions and said “All honour to Sardar for holding fast to his convictions”.

 In his address at the Benaras Hindu University following Gandhiji’s assassination, Patel said: “I claim to be nothing more than an obedient soldier of him like the millions who obeyed his call. There was a time when everyone used to call me his blind follower. But, both he and I knew that I followed him because our convictions tallied”.

 There are many interesting facets to Sardar’s life - he was a successful lawyer, a people’s leader, most dependable organizational man, an administrator par excellence, humane, compassionate and of course a nationalist above all.

 It is unfortunate that even 70 years after attaining Independence, various fissiparous tendencies are raising their ugly heads and attempts are being made to threaten the unity and integrity of the country.

 No Indian should fall prey to the hideous design of vested interests and anti-India proponents in fomenting trouble and weakening the unity and integrity of the country. India’s progress in various fields and its march as one of the major economies should not be allowed to be obstructed by anybody and every Indian should strive to uphold and strengthen country’s unity and integrity.

 

JAI HIND!”

                माननीय उपराज्यपाल जी, माननीय मुख्यमंत्री जी, माननीय मंत्रीगण, अति विशिष्ट अतिथिगण और सभी उपस्थित सम्मानित मित्रों।

हरियाणा की स्थापना के पचास साल पूरे होने के अवसर पर पिछले एक साल के दौरान आयोजित किए गए स्वर्ण जयंती समारोह का आज समापन हो रहा है। इस सुअवसर पर, मैं राज्य के सभी नागरिकों को उनके सुखमय भविष्य की शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ।


	 हरियाणा की सांस्कृतिक, आध्यात्मिक तथा भौतिक खुशहाली से पूरा देश परिचित है। प्राचीन युग से लेकर वर्तमान तक इस भूमि का एक सतत् और गौरवपूर्ण इतिहास रहा है। यह धर्म क्षेत्र है, कर्म क्षेत्र है। इस पुण्य भूमि ने ही भगवद्गीता का अनमोल उपहार विश्व को प्रदान किया है।
	मुझे यह जानकर हर्ष हो रहा है कि हरियाणा सरकार ने गीता की धरोहर को संजो कर रखा है। राज्य सरकार वार्षिक गीता महोत्सव आयोजित करती रही है। मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि इस वर्ष 25 नवंबर को भारत के माननीय राष्ट्रपति कुरूक्षेत्र के गीता महोत्सव का शुभारंभ करेंगे और कुरूक्षेत्र  विश्वविद्यालय में गीता पर एक अंतरराष्ट्रीय सेमिनार का उद्घाटन भी करेंगे। मुझे यह जानकर खुशी  है कि गीता पर आधारित इन आयोजनों की अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर ख्याति बढ़ी है। इस वर्ष  मारीशस को गीता महोत्सव में भागीदार के रूप में चुना गया है।  भारतीय मूल के लोगों को भावनात्मक रूप से अपने पूर्वजों की इस पवित्र भूमि से जोड़ने का अवसर प्रदान करने के लिए यह एक सराहनीय कदम है।
	मित्रों, महाभारत में इस भूमि का वर्णन 'बहुधान्यक' या 'बहुधन' के रूप में किया गया है। गत 50 वर्षों में हरियाणा के कर्मयोगी नागरिकों, किसानों, और उद्यमियों ने राज्य के 'बहुधान्यक' नाम को साकार किया है। आप सभी के सामूहिक प्रयासों के परिणामस्वरूप आज हरियाणा केंद्रीय अन्न भंडार में योगदान देने वाला दूसरा बड़ा राज्य है।
	मुझे अत्यंत प्रसन्नता हो रही है कि राज्य सरकार विकास के लिए सराहनीय प्रयास कर रही हैं। एक ओर हरियाणा की साक्षरता दर बढ़कर 76.6 प्रतिशत तक पहुँच गई है। हरियाणा की प्रति व्यक्ति की आय भी बढ़ गई है।
	परंपरागत रूप से हरियाणा को कृषि तथा दूध उत्पादों के लिए जाना जाता है। राज्य सरकार इस पारंपरिक व्यवसाय को वैज्ञानिक तथा आधुनिक रूप से प्रोत्साहित कर रही है। इन प्रयासों से हरियाणा का खाद्यान उत्पादन 1966 की तुलना में लगभग 7 गुना बढ़ा है। हरियाणा के लिए यह गौरव की बात है कि देश की भूमि का मात्र 5 प्रतिशत होने के बावजूद वह देश के अन्न भंडार में 15 प्रतिशत का वार्षिक योगदान देता है।
	राज्य सरकार ने अनाज, दलहन और तिलहन के न्यूनतम समर्थन मूल्य को हाल के वर्षों में बढ़ाया है जिसका सीधा लाभ हमारे मेहनती किसानों को हो रहा है। आज के सूचना और प्रौद्योगिकी के युग में यह अनिवार्य हो गया है कि हम इस आधुनिक तकनीक का भरपूर लाभ उठाएं। मुझे यह जानकर खुशी हो रही है कि हरियाणा सरकार ने किसानों को उनके उत्पाद की बिक्री के लिए


e-market की सुविधा प्रदान की है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि राज्य सरकार इस विषय में  किसानों को जानकारी देने के लिए एक व्यापक अभियान चलाएगी जो कि उनके लिए लाभकारी होगा।


	आई टी के क्षेत्र में हरियाणा की उपलब्धियों से पूरा देश परिचित है। मुझे इस बात पर गर्व है कि सौ से भी अधिक फार्च्यून 500 (Fortune 500) कंपनियाँ हरियाणा में उपस्थित हैं। हरियाणा के आई टी संबंधित निर्यात ने भारत के आई टी महाशक्ति के रूप में उभरने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई है। मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि हरियाणा में पंचायत स्तर पर भी आई टी का प्रयोग बढ़ रहा है। इससे पंचायतों के कार्यकलाप में पारदर्शिता आयेगी। ई-पंचायत के माध्यम से सरकारी कार्यक्रम सुचारू रूप से लागू करने में सहायता मिलेगी। प्रदेश ने बड़े पैमाने पर 'डिजिटल इंडिया' कार्यक्रम को लागू किया है। लगभग 200 सेवाएँ 'सेवा के अधिकार अधिनियम' के तहत लाई गई हैं। 100 से भी अधिक E- सेवाएँ प्रारंभ की गई हैं। इसके अतिरिक्त विभिन्न सेवाओं और सुविधाओं का कंप्यूटरीकरण किया गया है।  मुझे आशा है कि ये सभी क़दम हरियाणा सरकार को अपने नागरिकों को सुशासन प्रदान करने में सहायक सिद्ध होंगे।
	यह गर्व की बात है कि राज्य के दो जिलों करनाल तथा फरीदाबाद को केंद्र सरकार ने स्मार्ट सिटी योजना के तहत चुना है। इसके अतिरिक्त राज्य सरकार अपने संसाधनों से गुरुग्राम को भी स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में विकसित कर रही है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि इन जिलों का स्मार्ट सिटी योजना के अंतर्गत विकास हरियाणा के अन्य जिलों को भी इस योजना का लाभ उठाने के लिए प्रेरित करेगा।
	मुझे इस बात की भी बेहद प्रसन्नता है कि राज्य के सभी गांवों तथा शहरों को 'खुले में शौच से मुक्त' (ODF) घोषित कर दिया गया है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि  भारत सरकार के राष्ट्रीय स्वच्छता अभियान को हरियाणा सरकार और हरियाणावासी पूर्ण रूप से अपने जीवन का अभियान बनाएंगे, ताकि एक स्वच्छ हरियाणा देश के दूसरे राज्यों के लिए प्रेरणा स्रोत बन सके।
	राज्य में शिक्षा विशेषकर महिलाओं की शिक्षा तथा तकनीकी शिक्षा के लिए सराहनीय प्रयास किये जा रहे हैं। स्कूली शिक्षा को व्यावसायिक शिक्षा से जोड़ा जा रहा है। 'मेक इन हरियाणा – मेक इन इंडिया' कार्यक्रम के तहत स्कूलों में व्यावसायिक शिक्षा को प्रोत्साहन दिया जा रहा है। इसके तहत कौशल विकास और उच्च व्यावसायिक शिक्षा प्रदान करने के लिए विश्व स्तरीय शिक्षण संस्थानों की स्थापना प्रशंसनीय कदम है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि राज्य सरकार इस बात को सुनिश्चित करेगी कि इन संस्थानों से निकले विद्यार्थी स्वरोजगार स्थापित कर सकें या पर्याप्त रोजगार पा सकें।
	मुझे यह ज्ञात हुआ है कि राज्य सरकार ने 'सक्षम युवा योजना' के तहत लगभग 20 हजार ग्रेजुएट युवाओं को विभिन्न विभागों से जोड़ा है। जिसके अन्तर्गत प्रति माह 100 घंटों का रोजगार इन युवाओं को उपलब्ध कराया जाता है।


प्रदेश में कौशल प्राप्त युवाओं को रोजगार देने के लिए आवश्यक है कि निवेश और व्यवसाय करना आसान बनाया जाए।

2016 में हरियाणा 'व्यवसाय करने की सरलता सूची' में पाँचवें स्थान पर था। इस वर्ष आपका लक्ष्य दूसरे स्थान तक पहुँचने का है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि इस दिशा में सरकार द्वारा उठाए गए कदमों से हरियाणा अपने लक्ष्य तक पहुँचने में सफल होगा।     


	मित्रों, महिला सशक्तिकरण के क्षेत्र में हरियाणा का प्रयास अनुसरणीय रहा है। मुझे यह जानकर भी खुशी है कि 'बेटी बचाओ-बेटी पढ़ाओ' अभियान के तहत शिक्षण संस्थाओं में ग्रेजुएशन तक की शिक्षा नि:शुल्क कर दी गई है। महिलाओं के कौशल विकास के लिए UNDP के साथ भी समझौता किया गया है। महिलाओं की सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से महिला बस सेवा तथा महिला पुलिस थानों  जैसे कदमों से समाज में महिलाओं  की सुरक्षा के प्रति नई जागरूकता पैदा हुई है।
	मित्रों, इस अवसर पर मैं हरियाणा की महिलाओं का भी अभिनंदन करना चाहूँगा जिन्होंने बड़ी विषम परिस्थितियों का सामना करके जीवन के विभिन्न क्षेत्रों विशेषकर खेल जगत में अनुकरणीय उपलब्धियाँ प्राप्त की हैं।
	हरियाणा वासियों के राष्ट्र निर्माण में योगदान की बात करते हुए हरियाणा के जवानों की राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा में अदा की जा रही भूमिका की उपेक्षा नहीं की जा सकती।
	विकास की शाश्वत यात्रा में यह स्वर्ण जयंती उत्सव एक पड़ाव मात्र है। आने वाले वर्षों में विकास को और मजबूती देने के लिए हम सभी को अधिक से अधिक प्रयास करने की आवश्यकता है।
	हरियाणा में हरियाली आए, जन जीवन में खुशहाली बढ़े, अन्त्योदय के सिद्धांत को अपनाते हुए सरकार गरीबों के जीवन में सुधार लाए। स्वच्छ वायु, स्वच्छ जल सबको मिले। हरियाणा सरकार प्राकृतिक संपदा को परिरक्षित करे। कृषि और व्यवसाय को बढ़ावा दे। यह कर्म भूमि सारे देश को कुशलता और कर्मठता का संदेश दे। स्वच्छ हरियाणा, समद्ध हरियाणा का सपना साकार हो। यही मेरी आकांक्षा है।
	1 आज आप सभी के बीच आकर मैं धन्य हुआ हूँ जिसके लिए मैं राज्य सरकार को हार्दिक धन्यवाद देता हूँ।


जय हिन्द!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the invaluable contribution of Sardar Patel in building a modern and unified India needs to be remembered by every Indian as the country marches ahead as one of the largest economies in the world. He was addressing the two-day National Conference on ‘Making of a Gandhian Nationalist-A Study of the Life and Times of Sardar Patel’, here today. The Minister of State for Culture (I/C) and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that Sardar Patel was a selfless leader, who placed the country’s interests above everything else and shaped India’s destiny with single-minded devotion. He further said that in a truly masterful display of statesmanship, Sardar Patel ensured a smooth integration of the troubled domains by not allowing the situation to deteriorate into civil unrest. There was neither bloodshed nor any kind of rebellion as he went about the task of building a strong India with a missionary zeal, he added.

 The Vice President said that acknowledging the monumental contribution of Patel in nation building, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said, ‘History will call him the builder and consolidator of new India’. He further quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying, 'Many were prepared to follow me, but I could not make up my mind as to who should be my deputy commander. Then I thought of Vallabhbhai'. Sardar Patel was not only an organizer par excellence but also turned out to be a people’s leader, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 “I am extremely pleased to address this National Conference on ‘Making of Gandhian Nationalist: Life & Times of Sardar Patel”.

 Sardar Patel, the architect and unifier of modern India, was not only a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi but also his ardent follower. Patel was a selfless leader, who placed the country’s interests above everything else and shaped India’s destiny with single-minded devotion.

 He fashioned the country’s political integration with the swiftness of a military commander and deftness of a visionary leader.  

 Displaying the vision of a statesman, tact, diplomacy and pragmatic approach, he prevented the balkanization of the country and ensured the merger of more than 560 princely States with the Union of India at a critical and most turbulent period in the history of the country. What makes this stupendous integration most remarkable is that it was achieved without any bloodshed. 

 It indeed was a herculean task to bring the rulers of different princely States on board. Adopting different approaches as warranted by the situation, he gave friendly advice in some cases, persuaded the rulers to see reason in others and even used force as in the case of Hyderabad. What is most remarkable is the fact that Sardar Patel achieved a unified India when the rulers of the princely States were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

 After securing the accession of Junagarh, he ensured the liberation and integration of Hyderabad State with rest of India in a deft and swift action codenamed ‘Operation Polo’. The police action ended in just four days on September 18, 1948. Every year, September 17 is being celebrated as ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ in Telangana and parts Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

 In a truly masterful display of statesmanship, Sardar Patel ensured a smooth integration of the troubled domains by not allowing the situation to deteriorate into civil unrest. There was neither bloodshed nor any kind of rebellion as he went about the task of building a strong India with a missionary zeal.

 Undoubtedly, there is no parallel in modern history to what was achieved by him. Acknowledging the monumental contribution of Patel in nation building, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had this to say: ‘History will call him the builder and consolidator of new India’.

 After he came under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi, he became his lieutenant and was chosen to lead Kheda satyagraha. He switched over to Indian attire and later embraced khadi.  His biggest asset was his down-to-earth disposition. 

 'Many were prepared to follow me, but I could not make up my mind as to who should be my deputy commander. Then I thought of Vallabhbhai' said Gandhiji. Sardar Patel was not only an organizer par excellence but also turned out to be a people’s leader. He earned the title of ‘Sardar’ after he spearheaded peasant’s no-tax campaign at Bardoli in Gujarat.

 He also led the relief and rehabilitation operations from the front when Gujarat was ravaged by floods and worked tirelessly during plague outbreak in Ahmedabad.

 While he became immensely popular and had earned the title of Sardar after Bardoli campaign, Patel played a major role Salt Satyagraha and was imprisoned with other leaders. During Quit India Movement also, he went around the country giving stirring speeches and was again jailed.

 Although, Sardar Patel differed with Gandhiji on certain issues, he always remained loyal to him. Following Gandhiji’s assassination, he said: “I claim to be nothing more than an obedient soldier of him like the millions who obeyed his call. There was a time when everyone used to call me his blind follower. But, both he and I knew that I followed him because our convictions tallied”.

 His vision for a unified India also saw the creation of All India Administrative Services which he described as the ‘Steel Frame’. His exhortation to the probationers to maintain utmost impartiality and incorruptibility of administration is as relevant today as it was then.

 “We have to shed mutual bickering, shed the difference of being high or low, develop a sense of equality and banish untouchability. We have to restore the conditions of Swaraj prevalent prior to British rule. We have to live like children of the same father, these words of Sardar Patel during the Quit India Movement continue to inspire us.

 Following his death, ‘The Manchester Guardian’ wrote: “Patel was not only the organiser of the fight for freedom but also the architect of the new State when the fight was over. The same man is seldom successful as a rebel and a statesman. Sardar Patel was the exception”.

 It is unfortunate that there has been no proper recognition of the monumental contribution made by Sardar Patel and his legacy in unifying the country at its most critical juncture in the history.

 Finally, I would like to conclude by stressing that the invaluable contribution of Sardar Patel in building a modern and unified India needs to be remembered by every Indian as the country marches ahead as one of the largest economies in the world.

 

Thank you. Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Terrorism is a global concern that demands global attention and requires global cooperation. He was interacting with the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr. Paolo Gentiloni, who called on him, here today. 

The Vice President said that India believes in an early conclusion of negotiations and the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations. He further said that we also need to coordinate our action at the forthcoming meeting of the Financial Action Task Force and ensure that designated individuals and entities have no access to property and financial services. We must ensure that Pakistan continues to remain under the Asia Pacific Group and Financial Action Task Force monitoring, he added. 

The Vice President thanked for Italy’s support which led to India’s eventual membership in the MTCR. Membership of the NSG remains a priority for Indian Government and we look forward to Italy’s continued support for India’s membership of the NSG, he added. 

The Vice President said that the bilateral trade between India and Italy is at US$8.7 billion (Rs. 57,878 crores), which is below potential. He further said that India’s unprecedented reform initiatives including ease of doing business, flagship programs and roll out of the Goods and Services Tax offers unlimited business opportunities to Italian companies. 

The Vice President said that Climate Change is a very important issue for the two countries and India ratified the Paris Agreement on 3rd October 2016. We have a renewable energy target of 175 Giga Watts by 2022, launched the International Solar Alliance initiative and are working on a road map for introducing all electric vehicles beginning 2030. 

The Vice President said that many Italians take active interest in Indian culture, cuisine, music, dance, Yoga and Ayurveda. We will be happy to collaborate with Italy in enhancing the understanding of traditional systems of Indian medicines, he added.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Bahudha approach is yet another shining star that can lead us our quest for peace and harmony. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book ‘The 21st Century Geopolitics, Democracy and Peace’ authored by former Governor of Sikki, Shri B.P. Singh, here today. The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri N.N. Vohra and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President complimented Shri Singh for penning this book, which is highly relevant in the context of increasing globalization, growing terrorism and unprecedented technological advances. He further said that it indeed deals with a wide range of issues that are increasingly affecting an inter-dependent globalised world and strongly advocates that it would be ideal if we can adopt a ‘Bahudha’ approach which emphasizes the need for a dialogue to promote a harmonious and peaceful living.

 

The Vice President said that issues touched upon in the book include the role of educational institutions, progressive religious and social groups, forums for inter-faith dialogue and international institutions like the United Nations. It makes a strong case for promoting moral values, empathy and compassion and channelizing energies towards peace and development, he added.

 

The Vice President said that other interesting chapters are ‘Democracy and its Consequences’ and ‘Good Governance: A Narrative from Democratic India’. He further said that in the chapter, ‘The Emerging World: Challenges and Possibilities’, Mr. Singh quite correctly says that the future of peace and harmony in the 21st century would be directly linked to (i) ecology, global warming and climate change; (ii) nuclear weapons, emerging technology of warfare and continuing arms race among nation-states; (iii) geopolitics and nationalism; (iv) religious extremism and (v) poverty and inequality.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely delighted to release the book, “The 21st Century: Geopolitics, Democracy and Peace” written by former Sikkim Governor, Mr. B.P. Singh. Writing books is not new to Mr. Singh, a former IAS officer, who served with distinction in several positions in Assam and the Government of India.

 

I compliment him for penning this book, which is highly relevant in the context of increasing globalization, growing terrorism and unprecedented technological advances that are rapidly changing the way we live.

 

Frankly speaking, this book generates a lot of optimism and dispels cynicism about the future of the world and focuses on the innate goodness in all human beings. It has great relevance to our times.

 

We live today in turbulent world, a world that is being fragmented by narrow walls of prejudice on every conceivable issue. This book presents a viewpoint that is radically and refreshingly different.

 

It indeed deals with a wide range of issues that are increasingly affecting an inter-dependent globalised world and strongly advocates that it would be ideal if we can adopt a‘Bahudha’ approach which emphasizes the need for a dialogue to promote a harmonious and peaceful living.

 

It needs no reiteration that peace is an essential pre-requisite for progress of mankind, especially when the world is witnessing an increasing number of conflicts. In the context of the rise of terrorism and religious fundamentalism, which are threatening world peace like never before, the Bahudha approach advocated by the author is a good way to resolve even the most intractable problems.

 

The issues touched upon in the book include the role of educational institutions, progressive religious and social groups, forums for inter-faith dialogue and international institutions like the United Nations. It makes a strong case for promoting moral values, empathy and compassion and channelizing energies towards peace and development.

 

The author while outlining the rationale behind the book refers to the complexity of the evolving world in the 21st century.

 

He has touched upon key trends likeunprecedented scientific and technological development, previously unheard of prosperity and mind-boggling advances in the means of communication.

 

He recognizes major challenges confronting us like conflicts, natural calamities, hunger, malnourishment, pandemics, denial of education, violation of human rights and much else.

 

However, he is not pessimistic. He believes that despair would be a kind of self-indulgence. “One can see that there are very many positive signs on the geo-political map of the world”, he concludes and observes that the respect for another person’s point of view—the cornerstone of the Bahudha approach is on the rise.

 

While discussing how terrorism and fundamentalism are threatening world peace, the author says the new challenge calls for bold and imaginative statecraft from world leaders. He proposes the concept of Bahudha while calling for transcending age-old peace mechanisms and reconstructing our language of discourse.

 

Nobody can be in disagreement with his viewpoint that Bahudha approach is necessary at individual, group, national and global levels. It provides a moral choice between ‘the clash of civilizations’ and ‘harmony among civilizations’, as he puts it.

 

In the Chapter on ‘Interplay of Ideas: The Indian Story’, Mr. Singh rightly points out that India is much more than a large market place. Its history is not only a story of kings and queens and mere chronicle of invasions and conquests. Both in times of decline and distinction, India is a land alive with vital ideas and thoughts.

 

In the chapter dealing with ecological issues in the Himalayan region, the author points out that climate change has to be viewed in the context of enormous disturbance to eco-systems.  He says the threat to South Asia is especially more tangible both in the Himalayan region and in the Western Ghats. One cannot continue living as in the past.  If the Himalayan glaciers melt and the forests will be lost at an alarming rate with many birds, mammals and other species on way to extinction, we would be making our planet more uninhabitable and unsustainable.

 

As I have been long advocating, Mr. Singh too emphasizes the need for imparting ethical values to students and sensitizing them to the needs of a harmonious society in the chapter on ‘Science, Spirituality and Ways of Living: A plea for Integrated Education’.

 

Other interesting chapters are ‘Democracy and its Consequences’ and ‘Good Governance: A Narrative from Democratic India’. In the chapter, ‘The Emerging World: Challenges and Possibilities’, Mr. Singh quite correctly says that the future of peace and harmony in the 21st century would be directly linked to (i) ecology, global warming and climate change; (ii) nuclear weapons, emerging technology of warfare and continuing arms race among nation-states; (iii) geopolitics and nationalism; (iv) religious extremism and (v) poverty and inequality. 

 

Emphasizing that the role of national and global multilateral organizations would be vital, Mr., Singh observes that the 21stcentury would be dominated by a pluralist ethos; multiple nation-states, multiple centres of power; multiple faiths; multiple cultures; multiple economies and multiple languages.

He says, “We cannot envisage a world without conflicts or natural disasters. All I am advocating is to bring down mind walls that divide people and create hatred”.

 

Indeed, that has to be effort at every level—at individual, community, nation-state and global-- for peace and prosperity to co-exist and to make this planet a truly marvelous place for humans and all other living creatures.

 

Bringing down walls that divide us, engaging in dialogue, appreciating each other’s viewpoints and promoting peaceful co-existence has been the essence of Indian ethos from time immemorial.

 

It is this world view that we need to draw upon. The Bahudha approach is yet another shining star that can lead us our quest for peace and harmony.

 

As mentioned earlier, it is a timely book. It is a book that offers hope. It is a book that should trigger a thought process towards a better world.

 

I once again compliment the author, Mr. Singh and hope that his writings will inspire more Indians to look back at the rich heritage, draw inspiration and move forward.

 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must ensure that the benefits of democratic governance reach every citizen in our country. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the ‘Vigilance Awareness Week’ with the theme “My Vision-Corruption-free India”, organised by the Central Vigilance Commission, here today. The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K. Sinha, the Central Vigilance Commissioner, Shri K.V. Chowdary and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that we should go to the roots of corruption and strike at it. He further said that constant vigilance is required to see that the vast beautiful tree of our country is not eaten up by weeds and pests. The tree must be protected, preserved and nourished continuously by rejuvenating the entire eco-system, he added.

 The Vice President said that Sardar Patel represents the best values in the Indian tradition so far as governance is concerned and he integrated the country and also was a shining example of integrity and probity in public life. He further said that we must draw inspiration from Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s messages and his life. His sense of realism and pragmatic approach to issues allowed him to face challenges and demonstrate his successful leadership qualities, he added.

 The Vice President said that honesty and integrity are essential components of social capital. They add value to the economic capital and intellectual capital of any society and country, he added.

 The Vice President said that procedures and implementation of laws should become more citizen-centric. Each citizen should be able to access quality services without harassment, undue delays and corrupt practices, he added.

 The Vice President said that all out efforts should be made to improve the educational system to inculcate strong values, ethical conduct and commitment towards the welfare of the society at large. He further said that the Central Vigilance Commission is trying to promote “Integrity Club” in schools and colleges and this initiative will no doubt pay rich dividends in future. He commended the Commission for its concerted efforts in battling the blight of corruption.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am happy to inaugurate the Vigilance Awareness Week, 2017.  

 I am happy to note that the Central Vigilance Commission is organizing a number of programmes during this week to create greater awareness about corruption and the need to be aware of and combat it at all levels by everyone.

 The theme “My Vision-Corruption-free India” has been aptly chosen. If we want India to become a stronger economic power and if we want to create an India in which every citizen will be able to enjoy his/her rights and lead a better quality of life, we need “Su-rajya” or clean polity and good governance. We need to have good governance to take the development to the people. We must translate into reality the grand vision of great leaders like Sardar Vallabhai Patel, whose birth anniversary is being celebrated across the country today. 

 Addressing the senior civil servants almost seventy years ago, Sardar Patel had said: “Unhappily India today cannot boast of an incorruptible service, but I hope that you who are now starting, as it were, a new generation of Civil Servants, will not be misled by black sheep in the fold, but would render your service without fear or favour and without, any expectation of extraneous rewards. If you serve in the true spirit of service I am sure you will have your best reward.”

 The “black sheep” in all walks of life are the visible face of corruption. They thrive in a system that has low accountability, low transparency, cumbersome, poorly understood procedures and high discretionary powers. It is this system that we should reform and transform. The Prime Minister has given a three-line mantra – Reform, Perform and Transform. We should go to the roots of corruption and strike at it. Constant vigilance is required to see that the vast beautiful tree of our country is not eaten up by weeds and pests. The tree must be protected, preserved and nourished continuously by rejuvenating the entire eco-system.

 One of the instruments for building a healthy polity is the Central Vigilance Commission established in 1964. It was created on the basis of the recommendations of Santhanam Committee for exercising general superintendence over the vigilance administration in Government. The Commission was conferred statutory status through an Act of Parliament in 2003 and it also became a multimember body. In 2004 it became a designated authority to receive Whistle Blower complaints and to give protection to Whistleblowers.

 In June 2000, the Commission decided to observe Vigilance Awareness Week every year starting from 31stOctober, the birthday of Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The purpose is to make every citizen realise need to collectively combat the menace of corruption.

 Sardar Patel represents the best values in the Indian tradition so far as governance is concerned. He integrated the country and also was a shining example of integrity and probity in public life.

 I would like to quote Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who said:

 “The negligence of a few could easily send a ship to the bottom”, but with “the whole hearted cooperation of all on board, she could be safely brought to port”.

 We cannot afford to allow our ship to sink. We have a collective responsibility to steer this ship through troubled waters.

 We must draw inspiration from Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s messages and his life. There are innumerable incidents relating to his iron will and courage, in public and private life. He commanded respect and popularity owing to his integrity, truthfulness and firmness. His sense of realism and pragmatic approach to issues allowed him to face challenges and demonstrate his successful leadership qualities.

 Sardar Patel exemplified an ethical approach in his life, behaviour and dealings; personal rectitude and austerity were part of his being. It is these qualities that we must seek to imbibe and strive to emulate in our work and in our lives.

 Let me outline a few ways in which we can achieve a new India that is clean, not only by physically removing the garbage from our streets but also by creating a corruption-free governance structure.

 

We, in leadership positions, must lead by example.

 Honesty and integrity are essential components of social capital. They add value to the economic capital and intellectual capital of any society and country. They are reflective of our societal norms and attitudes. If we have to live up to the high standards of integrity set by the leaders who have given us freedom, it is imperative that we revive the values of hard work, honesty, empathy and integrity.

We have to ‘live’ these values not merely talk about them.

 

We must ensure that the benefits of democratic governance reach every citizen in our country.

 Governance should have citizens as the central focus and try to address the needs of the different segments of population effectively. Procedures and implementation of laws should become more citizen-centric. Each citizen should be able to access quality services without harassment, undue delays and corrupt practices. Information should be freely shared. Standard operating procedures should be in place reducing the amount of discretion.

 

Active involvement and participation by all stakeholders and actors is critical.

 The vision of Sardar Patel to see India as a great nation can only be achieved through active involvement of all sections of the population and key pillars of our governance structure. The presence of a strong civil society including a free press and independent judiciary are important pre-conditions for good governance.

The role of the media and of civil society in fighting the menace of corruption is also very important. A media that is objective, balanced and neutral in its reporting and ethical in functioning can have a great impact.

 Through their outreach efforts, civil society organisations can play a significant role in educating and creating awareness among the people.

 

Sharing of accurate information and universal literacy are key arsenal

I have always believed that information that has been sanctified with confirmation is the most powerful ammunition to fight corruption. Providing timely and accurate information empowers citizens. The Right to Information Act must be used to inform, enlighten and empower. We need to step up our national efforts to achieve universal literacy. It is virtually impossible to achieve a corruption-free society with more than 25 percent of our citizens being unable to read and write. Once we achieve universal basic literacy, we would have created a literate society that can understand the citizens’ entitlements and access public services and benefit from all socio-economic development programmes. We would have then created a critical mass of enlightened citizenry that can more confidently participate in the democratic processes. We would have deepened our democratic roots.

I strongly feel that the most effective antidote to corruption is an active, involved and empowered citizenry. In other words, the most potent weapon against corruption is people like you and me. Each one of us must set new benchmarks by adopting zero tolerance for corrupt practices. Ultimately, it must be understood that all the malpractices, double-dealing, nepotism and other such practices, be it governmental or organizational, hurt us. Therefore we must all join hands and pledge to root it out of the system.

 The first step towards empowering the citizens is creating awareness among them. It is extremely important for the common citizen to be aware of what to expect from the Government.

In this context, the efforts and commitment of the Central Vigilance Commission towards awareness generation and ensuring public participation in fighting the scourge of corruption are laudable whether through the display of hoardings and banners or grievance redressal camps for citizens, the awareness gram sabhas or through ‘walkathons’, ‘nukkad nataks’ or other means. I am happy to note that the Commission has circulated an Integrity Pledge to be taken by Government officials and the citizens. Such pledges have been found to be quite effective around the world in binding people to follow the path of honesty. Such public commitment by civil servants, students, journalists, educators, NGOs, and citizens, is not only a tool for creating awareness but can act as a force multiplier for the society at large to take the fight against corruption seriously.

 

Simplify, streamline, standardize and digitalize

Corruption undermines economic development by causing considerable distortion and inefficiency.  It increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments, the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements.

If India has to welcome investors, the ease of doing business must be considerably enhanced. The Prime Minister came out with a statement, saying that, it is not red-tape, it is red-carpet to the investors. Investments will come if the procedures are simple, if there is no harassment, if there is no corruption, investors will be happy to come here and invest money. The regulatory controls must be minimized and the procedures should be clear, simple, streamlined and digitalized so that there is very little ambiguity or discretion. The regulation should not become strangulation. We must standardize procedures and inform all citizens what these procedures are. Uncertainty and lack of information gives undesirable power to the implementing machinery. Citizen Charters have been a good step forward in this direction.

Apart from this, the cutting edge administration with which the common man comes into contact with the Government or its agencies needs a radical transformation.

The use of Information and Communication Technology has helped create efficient, transparent and accountable systems with no scope for arbitrariness and discretion while enabling better quality and efficient delivery of services.

 The Digital India initiative has ensured that Government services are made available to citizens electronically by improving online infrastructure and by increasing Internet connectivity i.e. by making the country digitally empowered.

I am confident that the Central Vigilance Commission will continue this challenging mission to not only point out some omissions and commissions by individuals but also to ensure that the society is free of this malaise of corruption. It can do so, probably in conjunction, with other bodies like the Central Information Commission, the Election Commission of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India which have mandates that could potentially contribute to a clean and corruption-free India that we wish to see by 2022.

All out efforts should be made to improve the educational system to inculcate strong values, ethical conduct and commitment towards the welfare of the society at large. The Commission, I am told, is trying to promote “Integrity Club” in schools and colleges. This initiative will no doubt pay rich dividends in future.

Mahatma Gandhi had said that: “As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves”. Remaking the world starts with remaking ourselves, our communities and our country.

 We surely have a long way to go. We are slowly improving on the global corruption perception index- from 38 in 2015 to 40 in 2016. But we can make quicker and lasting progress if we identify the key levers that can make a difference and take systematic action on each of them. I am sure that the government is not only aware of the challenge but is also committed to make a difference by 2022. The recent policy interventions including tax reforms could contribute to this societal transformation.

Why the people have welcomed the demonetisation, though it is painful for them. Because, they could understand the temporary pain is for long term gain. And the idea of opening Bank Accounts to all people under Jan Dhan, understood by the public after demonetisation.

 I take this opportunity to felicitate the Commission for its concerted efforts in battling the blight of corruption.

 Let us resolve to work relentlessly and assiduously to ensure a corruption free India.

 

Thank you. Jai Hind.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that dream big, aim high and work hard to realize their ambitions and achieve success in the chosen professions. He was interacting with a group of students from Atharva Group of Institutes at the Raj Bhavan, in Mumbai today. 

The Vice President cited how late President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, who came from humble background, rose to occupy the highest positions through sheer hard work, discipline and commitment. He further said that educational curricula in the fast-changing world must equip the students to find suitable employment or become self-employed.  Merely acquiring degrees was not enough, education must enlighten and empower the youth and Indians are endowed with talent and this talent needs to be tapped through skill development, he added. 

The Vice President asked students to be well acquainted with the country’s culture, history and heritage. He further said that culture has nothing to do with religion as the former is way of life and the latter is way of worship. Unfortunately, some people are trying to mix both and Hindu is not a religion but a cultural connotation, he added. 

Shri Naidu also exhorted the students to be first proficient in their mother tongues first and subsequently learn as many languages, including English. “Due to the passion to learn English, we are forgetting our mother tongue. You can articulate in a better manner in mother tongue”, he told them. The Vice President said that he had advised all the state Governments to ensure that mother tongue was taught as a subject in schools if not as a medium of instruction. 

The Vice President deplored attempts to create dissensions in the name of religion, region and castes and termed such attempts as utter nonsense. He said that agriculture and industry were equally important for the development of the country. 

The Vice President, who is also the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, expressed his concern over disruptions of Parliament and State Assemblies and underlined the need for constructive debates. “Debate, discuss and decide, but not disrupt”, he told lawmakers. Shri Naidu also said that pressure must be brought to bear on the political parties to pursue development agenda.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Healthcare sector and Skill Development in youth crucial for India’s progress. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating a Medical Camp in association with Star and Rainbow Hospitals and two Skill Development facilities - CCTV Network Management and Optic Fiber Technician courses in association with L&T Smart World Communications Limited and GATI Drivers Training Institute in association with Gati-KWE Pvt. Ltd., at Swarna Bharat Trust, in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali, the Minister for Irrigation, Marketing & Legislative Affairs, Telangana, Shri T. Harish Rao, the Minister for Health and Medical Education, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Kamineni Srinivas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the government’s expenditure not remaining commensurate with growing demands in the healthcare, the private sector has come to play a dominant role in both urban and rural areas. He further said that in urban areas, only 32 per cent of the patients visit public hospitals with the rest 68 per cent preferring private hospitals. In rural areas, 42 per cent patients visit public hospitals and the rest visit private ones, he added. 

The Vice President said that there is a definite need not only to expand the infrastructure in public health sector, but also increase the budget. He further said that the number of physicians available per 10,000 people, their number is grossly inadequate in India when compared to developed countries. While the number of physicians available is 20 per 10,000 people in developed countries, it is only six in India and the country needs 10.5 lakh doctors while we have only 6.5 lakh, he added. 

The Vice President said that to reach WHO norm of one doctor per 1,000, (there is one doctor per 1700 population in India) a high-level committee of NITI Aayog has recommended the setting up of 187 more medical colleges by 2022. Similarly, the number of hospital beds per 10,000 is 40 in developed countries while it is nine in India, he added. 

The Vice President said that India is the youngest country with 65% of our population below 35 years of age. He further said that India must skill its young population not only for economic benefit but for social reasons too. India’s huge human capital has to be made more qualitative with focus on rapid growth of productive enterprises and jobs and growth and inclusion must go together, he added. 

The Vice President said that specially designed training in tune with the market needs should become part of the educational system so that students who pass out find immediate employment and are not left out in the lurch. He further said that manufacturing currently contributes about 13% to the GDP of the country and Make In India seeks to increase it to 25 per cent in the coming years to give a major push to the economy. In China, the manufacturing sector contributes about 36 per cent to the GDP, he added. The share of manufacturing in the GDP at 13% is amongst the lowest as compared to many rapidly developing economies, he said. 

The Vice President said that the sector as a whole has been facing shortage of skilled manpower and the efforts of the government in skilling the youth should be supplemented by the corporate sector and the industries so that the target of 25 per cent contribution to the GDP is achieved faster. He further said that this is the time when Skill India, Digital India and Make in India can work in conjunction in one ecosystem and create a new resurgent India. We have to ensure that we scale up our efforts with greater speed and with proper ecosystem, India will become the world’s largest exporter of skilled manpower in the future, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that reformative measures like the introduction of GST will improve the economy. He was addressing the 90th anniversary celebration of Andhra Chamber of Commerce, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit and the Minister for Fisheries, Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President address:

 ""I am extremely pleased to be amidst you and inaugurate the 90th anniversary celebrations of the Andhra Chamber of Commerce.

 Ninety years is indeed a major milestone in the journey of this organization which was witness to the birth of Indian Republic and many other momentous events since it was formed in 1928.

 From 35 members when it was formed, the Andhra Chamber of Commerce has grown into one of the most reputed industry associations and is having 1800 members at present. Besides, 55 trade and industry associations are affiliated to it.

 Friends, the world is changing at a rapid pace aided by technological and digital revolutions. Any nation unable to keep pace with the changes will become a laggard. India is at the threshold of becoming one of the major economic powers and the private sector can play a huge role in accelerating the growth and development of the country.

 Tamil Nadu is among the States which are in the forefront of industrialization. This State is known, among others, for the automotive, leather and textiles industries and the hard working nature of the population. To spur growth, we have to improve infrastructure, resource efficiency and promote innovative technologies.

 Reformative measures like the introduction of GST will improve the economy in the long run, although there might be some teething problems in the initial stages of implementation. In the end, such reforms will also benefit the consumers.

 With various measures taken by the government to step up economic growth, including FDI in various sectors and given the strong macro-economic fundamentals, India will continue to grow steadily. “The economic activity”, according to the ‘Country Snapshot’ published by the World Bank, “is expected to stabilize, maintaining annual GDP growth at 7 % in the year 2018”. The report goes on to say, “Growth is projected to increase to 7.4% by Fiscal year 2020, underpinned by a recovery in private investments prompted by a recent increase in public capex and an improvement in the investment climate (partly due to the passage of the GST and the bankruptcy code and the measures to attract FDI)”.

 Describing the two major recent reforms in India—demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST)—as a monumental effort, IMF chief said it is hardly surprising that there “is a little bit of a short-term slowdown” as a result. “But for the medium term, we see a very solid track ahead for the Indian economy,” she said to a question on India.

 Reasons for lower GDP growth during the past quarter. Imaging that you have appointed a Principal, director of a college which is notorious for poor quality of education. You find that most students cheat during the examination with support of the teaches and do well in exams. The result of the college has been always 90 per cent in recent years. You are a person with principles. And hence you have decided to eliminate cheating from the examination. You installed CCTV cameras in all examination halls and also take proper actions towards the students and the teachers mall practices. The results is that, cheating is totally stopped in the examinations. However, the performance of your college dips drastically and less than 50 per cent students passed. This has been a bad performance in the recent years. You know face flack from all sides. Students are angry because they failed due to your strictness, teachers are angry because their track record got spoiled because of your, trustees of the college are angry because the result of their college has taken a beating under your charge. That is what happening in India right now.

 Women’s empowerment is one of the key parameters for the progress of any nation or society. I am happy that Andhra Chamber of Commerce led by Mrs. Indira Dutt, has set up Women’s Business Forum to impart training to women students and employees to enable them become entrepreneurs. It is a laudable initiative. I hope the training is not confined to Chennai alone and will be conducted all over the State. The Chamber must identify a few leading industries in each district and tie-up with them for imparting training to women students and employees.

 I am told that the forum also encourages women to take up community development. I feel that community development programmes must not only help the local communities to empower themselves but also enable them to take up initiatives to reduce poverty, promote sanitation and hygienic practices and create self-employment opportunities, among others.

 I must also laud the Chamber for proposing to set up a skill development centre in Andhra Pradesh. Setting up of such centres is the need of the hour. As all of you are aware, about 65 per cent of India’s population is under the age of 35 years and the youth need to be provided employment or training to become self-employed. Perhaps, the Chamber might to do well to establish more such centres, both in AP and Tamil Nadu.

 There is also a huge need to supplement Government’s efforts in regard to Make in India and Digital India programmes. Make in India has been launched with a view to increasing the share of manufacturing in our GDP to 25 per cent by 2025. By doing so, it is estimated that additional employment opportunities to the extent of 90 million jobs will be generated.

 The government is rightly focusing on generating employment and financial inclusion so that bottom of the pyramid, the poorest of the poor gain maximum advantage.

 A study by the State Bank of India has shown that villages who opened bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana may be saving more and reducing their consumption of alcohol and tobacco. We must collectively build on this momentum. Organizations like yours have a crucial role.

My best wishes to the Chamber for all its future endeavours.

 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi, remains an unsurpassed phenomenon in Carnatic music. He was addressing the gathering at the Birth Centenary Commemoration of Dr. M.S. Subbalakshmi, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Minister for Fisheries, Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar, family members of Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi affectionately referred to as MS Amma was the face of Indian Carnatic music for several decades. He further said that she captivated the hearts of billions, not only in Tamil nadu, South India or India but in the entire world. Setting aside mere gimmicks and gymnastics of classical music, she delved deep into the soul of the music and brought forth the treasures from there, not only to the pundits or the elite but also to the common man, he added.  

 The Vice President said that she rose to heights where all differences vanished and she took us there with her. He further said that all the Nations stood united when she sang in the assembly of the United Nations Organisation. In the enjoyment of such a fine expression of art all differences of caste creed, race and nationality evaporated, he added.

 The Vice President said that even Mahatma Gandhi was spell bound when he listened to her rendition of 'Vaishnava Janatho'. He further said that knowing that she might not be able to sing a song he had requested, Mahatma Gandhi is supposed to have said, “I would rather hear her recite the lines than hear anyone else sing it”.

 The Vice President said that titans on the opposite sides of ideology, the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajaji, united and stood together when it came to appreciating the music that flowed in her mellifluous voice. He further said that even the great sage of Kanchi, his holiness, the Paramacharya was not an exception. She was an epitome of grace, respected by one and all he added.

 The Vice President said that she was not only a singer par excellence, but was also a great actor who donned the roles of baktha meera and Sakunthala on silver screen. He further said that she had that glow, that divine glow, hailed by the great philosopher president Dr S Radhakrishnan as 'Brahma Tejas' found in the ""God intoxicated faces"" of great sages. Dr Sarojini Naidu was the Nightingale of India by her verses, Dr MS Subbulakshmi was the Nightingale of India by her voice, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""India is a land of rich cultural heritage with music in diverse genres representing the truly myriad mosaic of plurality—from the two main fountainheads of classical music—Carnatic and Hindustani—to a variety of folk music from every nook and corner to Sufi music, Qawwalis, Rabindra Sangeet to popular film music.

 What defines India is this rich heritage of music and its unifying role in bringing people together cutting across religions, regions, castes and communities.

 Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi affectionately referred to as MS Amma was the face of Indian Carnatic music for several decades. She captivated the hearts of billions, not only in Tamil nadu, South India or India but in the entire world.

 Friends! The roots of Indian music can be traced to Vedic literature, Sama Veda in particular and as such every note and cadence associated with our ancient music systems have to be preserved and propagated.

 Music has no barriers or boundaries. This Sanskrit saying शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गान रसं फणि: (Sisurvetti pasurvetti, vetti gana rasam phanihi) aptly sums up the magical power of music. Metaphysical and spiritual love finds sublime expression in the keertanas of Thyagaraja or Annamacharya, the bhajans of Meera or Tulsidas, among many highly evolved seers and sages of our literary and musical tradition. As Saint Thyagaraja said :“Sangeetha Gnanamu Bhakthi Vina Sanmargam Kaladhe”, which could be roughly translated as “unless you are able to blend devotion with music, it may not lead us to the blissful plane”

 Music acquired a divine dimension when somebody like legendary Carnatic singer, late M.S. Subbulakshmi lent her voice to various compositions. Setting aside mere gimmicks and gymnastics of classical music, she delved deep into the soul of the music and brought forth the treasures from there, not only to the pundits or the elite but also to the common man.

 In the enjoyment of such a fine expression of art all differences of caste creed, race and nationality evaporated.

 She rose to heights where all differences vanished and she took us there with her. All the Nations stood united when she sang in the assembly of the United Nations Organisation.

 Even Mahatma Gandhi was spell bound when he listened to her rendition of 'Vaishnava Janatho'.

 Knowing that she might not be able to sing a song he had requested, Mahatma Gandhi is supposed to have said, “I would rather hear her recite the lines than hear anyone else sing it”.

 Madurai Shanmugavadivu Subbulakshmi, remains an unsurpassed phenomenon in Carnatic music

 It will be perhaps an understatement to say that M.S. Subbulakshmi is a well-known name not only in India but across the world. 

 She was a cult figure, who had mesmerized everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to the common man with her mellifluous voice. Upon Gandhiji’s insistence, she recorded his favourite Meera bhajan ‘Hari Tum Haro’ overnight and sent it to him on his birthday in 1947.

 She was the first musician to be awarded Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour. She was also the first Indian musician to have performed at the United Nations General Assembly and the first Indian musician to be conferred with the Ramon Magsaysay award for public service.

 She was called the ‘Nightingale of India’ by Sarojini Naidu and “Tapaswini” by Lata Mangeshkar, while Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan described her as “Suswaralakshmi Subbulakshmi. Apart from UN, she performed at the Edinburg International Festival and for Queen Elizabeth-II at the Royal Albert Hall, London. She mostly sang in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Meera Bhajans in Hindi.

 For many decades now, it has been a common practice in most South Indian homes for people to wake up in the morning to the strains of M S Subbulakshmi’s rendition of Bhaja Govindam, the popular devotional composition written by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, Vishnu Sahasranaamam and Shri Venkateswara Suprabhatam, among others. Her Venkateswara Suprabhatham is played in Tirumala temple daily as part of the ritual.

 Titans on the opposite sides of ideology, the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajaji, united and stood together when it came to appreciating the music that flowed in her mellifluous voice. Even the great sage of Kanchi, his holiness, the Paramacharya was not an exception.

 She was an epitome of grace, respected by one and all. She was not only a singer par excellence, but was also a great actor who donned the roles of baktha meera and Sakunthala on silver screen.

 She also made a huge contribution to popularizing Annanmacharya Kritis.

 She also undertook more than 200 charity concerts and donated the royalties she had earned on devotional albums to the Tirumala temple. 

 When we celebrate the music of M S Subbulakshmi, we must also remember her husband Sri T.Sadasivam who visualized and orchestrated her career. We must also acknowledge another remarkable person in MS Subbulakshmi life – her daughter Smt Radha Viswanathan who accompanied her mother for almost 55 years on the concert stage and trained her granddaughters Aishwarya and Saundarya. The legacy continues.

 I deem it a great honour to be part of centenary celebrations of the iconic M S Subbulakshmi, who lives through her immortal legacy of spreading spiritual bliss through her divine melodies.

 

Jai Hind.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Institutions like Harijan Sevak Sangh doing yeoman service and deserve a helping hand from philanthropists, corporate and other resource persons. He was addressing the gathering at an event to rededicate Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya, unveiling the renovated Statue of Thakkar Bapa and unveil the plaque for pile foundation of Didi Nirmala Deshpande Nilayam, in Chennai, Tami Nadu today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit and the Minister for Fisheries, Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that Didi Nirmala Deshpande, who headed this organization till her last breath, was a dedicated Gandhian, who set an example to thousands of people not only in India but all over the globe. He further said that she had participated in the Bhoodan Movement and undertook 40,000 km padayatra along the length and breadth of the country to popularize the message of Mahatma Gandhi’s Gram Swaraj. She was a true messenger of peace and also strove for communal harmony, he added.

 The Vice President expressed his happiness over unveiling the plaque of Shree Geeta Bhavan Trust for their kind contribution. He congratulated all the awardees who have extended their help to revive and continue this service on the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi.

 The Vice President said that Harijan Sevak Sangh and its units are participating in a big way on the Swachh Bharath Programme launched by Prime Minister. He congratulated them for taking up this noble cause with enthusiasm and vigor.

 

 Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 ""I deem it a privilege and an honour to be associated with the premier Gandhian Institution, the Harijan Sevak Sangh-- the constitution, rules and regulations for which were written by Mahatma Gandhi himself in 1932. I am particularly happy to rededicate Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya and unveil the plaque for pile foundation of Didi Nirmala Deshpande Nilayam today as it also happens to be the birthday of Didi Nirmala Deshpande, who was known to me for decades. 

Didi Nirmala Deshpande, who headed the organization till her last breath, was a dedicated Gandhian, who set an example to thousands of people not only in India but all over the globe. She had participated in the Bhoodan Movement and undertook a 40,000-km padayatra along the length and breadth of the country to popularize the message of Mahatma Gandhi’s Gram Swaraj. She was a true messenger of peace and also strove for communal harmony.

I was quite distressed to know that Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya was ravaged by floods and went under eight feet of water in 2015 and was again damaged by the cyclone in 2016. It is all the more saddening that 10,000 books on Gandhiji were destroyed in the floods. However, I am happy to know that following an appeal several people have donated books on the Father of the Nation to the Vidyalaya. I am also happy to know that the Vidyalaya’s workshop and machinery have been renovated to the maximum extent.

The statue of Thakkar Bapa, who was a close associate of Gandhiji, was also submerged and had been renovated. I deem it an honour to unveil the renovated statue. I am told that the statue was originally unveiled on November 29th, 1962.

It is indeed a matter of pride that stalwarts like Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Shri Rajagopalachari, Shri Venkataraman and Didi Nirmala Deshpande were associated with this Institution.

This Institution, which commenced as an Industrial School for Harijan boys in 1935, is now admitting students of all sections and integrating them as desired by Gandhiji, while giving priority to brothers and sisters of the community. I am delighted to know that this campus also has a school providing free education from pre-K.G to primary level, a working women’s hostel providing a home away from home and a Gandhi public library.

Didi Nirmala Deshpande Nilayam of Harijan Sevak Sangh is being built to provide accommodation to girls pursuing higher education. I am glad to know that the Sangh is helping by providing them free boarding and educational facilities with the support of kind-hearted, philanthropic persons and organizations. For a few students, boarding grant is being given by the Governmentt of Tamil Nadu. I am told that the building is planned to be completed by 2020 to provide accommodation to more than 200 girls.

I understand that there is a great demand for this hostel from the girls hailing from rural areas with a difficult socio-economic background.

I am told that the present hostel building is in a highly dilapidated condition and gets flooded even during moderate rains. Under the leadership of Prof. Shankar Kumar Sanyal, the new building project has commenced.

It gives me great pleasure to know that Shree Geeta Bhavan Trust has initiated the new building construction by sponsoring the pile foundation costing 65 lakhs. I congratulate them and I am sure that this will serve hundreds and thousands of girls in the years to come. And I am glad to unveil the plaque of Shree Geeta Bhavan Trust for their kind contribution.

I congratulate all the awardees who have extended their help to revive and continue this service on the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi .

I am told that the proposals of both Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya and Harijan Sevak Sangh as part of CSR initiatives are under consideration of various public and private sector companies like Neyveli Lignite Corporation, ONGC, Coal India, LIC Golden Jubilee Fund, Asian Paints, RCC DIVA [Rajashtan Association], Lions Club and others. I am sure these organizations will take up the projects to help Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya and Harijan  Sewak Sangh.

As Mahatma Gandhi said ”Service to humanity is Service to God”. These institutions have been doing yeoman service and deserve a helping hand from philanthropists, corporate and other resource persons.

I also know that Harijan Sevak Sangh and its units are participating in a big way on the Swachh Bharath Programme launched by Prime Minister. I congratulate them for taking up this noble cause with enthusiasm and vigor.

Finally as an associate of Didi Nirmala Deshpande, I appeal to one and all to extend a helping hand to this great and noble institution for which Gandhiji himself has written the constitution.

Thank you.""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that science is the cornerstone for the progress of mankind. He was addressing the valedictory session of the 3rd India International Science Festival – 2017, jointly organised by the Ministry of Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, in Chennai today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the Minister of State for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Shri Y.S. Chowdary and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said the scientific inventions have revolutionized the world and shaped every aspect of the modern life. He further time has come now for every Indian to work towards recapturing our past glory and make India one of the leading nations in scientific and technological innovations.

 

The Vice President said India to reach new pinnacles in Science & Technology concerted efforts from governments as well as different sections of the society is needed to hugely step up large scale R & D activities in different domains. He further said that artificial Intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things, big data analytics and digital manufacturing are going to change the way we are going to live. Corporate bodies and industries have to set aside an exclusive corpus for encouraging innovative, out-of-the-box R & D projects and disruptive technologies that could provide long-lasting answers to problems faced by the people, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we need to create an ecosystem for bright researchers to thrive and ensure that youngsters do not get stifled by rules, red tape and favoritism. He further said that they must feel free to discuss ideas and take up innovative research. Ultimately, science should find solutions to the problems faced by mankind and make this planet a better place for the present and future generations, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to be present at the India International Science Festival-2017, the third in the series of such events being organized by the Ministry of Science & Technology, Ministry of Earth Sciences and Vijnana Bharati. 

Science is the cornerstone for the progress of mankind. Scientific inventions have revolutionized the world and shaped every aspect of the modern life. Indians have made significant contribution to the field of science from ancient times and are now in the forefront in state-of-the-art space technologies and the IT revolution sweeping the world.

Friends, Science & Technology has been part of India’s culture and tradition. The scientific bent of mind in ancient India was reflected right from the use of zero, place values, algebra, concept of atom, calculation eclipses, among others. ‘Sushruta Samhita’ talks of surgery while Charak describes hundreds of diseases, their causes and treatment methods.

The urban settlements of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa, production of highest quality steel and extraction of sugar are other examples when India was more advanced than the rest of the world.

“We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made”, vouched the great scientist, Albert Einstein.

Well-known writer and philosopher, Will Durant had this to say: “India was the motherland of our race and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages. India was the mother of our philosophy, of much of our mathematics, of the ideals embodied in Christianity… of self-government and democracy. In many ways, Mother India is the mother of us all”.

After demonstrating our knowledge to the world in the ancient times in the fields of astronomy, mathematics, yoga and ayurveda, India somehow lost its way following Mughal invasions and colonization. The time has now come for every Indian to work towards recapturing our past glory and make India one of the leading nations in scientific and technological innovations in the coming decades.

For this to happen, there has to be concerted efforts from the governments as well as different sections of the society - right from teachers, who mould young minds, to universities and industries, who need to hugely step up R & D activities in different domains. Unless research is taken up on a large scale, India will not be able to reach new pinnacles in Science & Technology.

In spite of the remarkable scientific achievements the world has witnessed from invention of telescope to discovery of Higgs boson, mankind continues to face numerous challenges such as those relating to climate change, global warming, sustainable development, clean energy and water and diseases. Only science can throw up solutions for the present and emerging problems in the years to come. Artificial Intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things, big data analytics and digital manufacturing are going to change the way we are going to live. These areas need to be fully exploited with innovative and disruptive technologies. 

Investments in S & T need to be stepped up to address various problems the country is facing today such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, diseases, urban-rural divide, lack of clean drinking water as also the issues relating to crime and security, among others.

Here, I would like to appeal to various corporate bodies and industries to join hands and set up an exclusive corpus for encouraging innovative, out-of-the-box R & D projects and disruptive technologies that could provide long-lasting answers to problems faced by the people.

I am happy that successive governments at the Centre have accorded importance to S & T and created the necessary infrastructure for scientists and academics to pursue their research. CSIR and ICMR are among the leading research bodies and have earned global recognition for their cutting edge work.

My advice to these two premier organizations is to create an ecosystem for bright researchers to thrive and ensure that youngsters do not get stifled by rules, red tape and favoritism. They must feel free to discuss ideas and take up innovative research.

I would like the Department of Science and Technology to work closely with the Ministry of Human Resources to make science learning interesting and interactive right from early schooling. This is needed to inculcate greater interest in science among school students so that more and more youngsters take up basic research.  

I am happy to note that the ministries have aligned their activities with the national agenda of the government towards Make in India, Start up India, Digital India, Swasth Bharat and Swachh Bharat. It is also a matter of pride that Department of Science & Technology is involved in a number of global projects like the 30-meter Telescope Project and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory project. I am also happy to note that India today is among the 12 biotech destinations and ranks third in the Asia-Pacific region. India also has the second highest number of US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved plants after the USA and is the largest producer of recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine.

I am sure this series of India International Science Festivals will generate new ideas and act as a catalyst in promoting scientific temper among the people. Ultimately, science should find solutions to the problems faced by mankind and make this planet a better place for the present and future generations.

 

JAI HIND!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Optimism and creativity, Resilience and self-control, Integrity and self confidence are the required to become successful. He was addressing the gathering after giving away Magudam Awards constituted by News18 Tamil Nadu, for the best and the brightest from Tamil Nadu in various fields, in Chennai today. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, the Chief Minister of Puducherry, Shri V. Narayanasamy, the Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri O. Panneerselvam and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that Tamil Nadu is home to an ancient and unique civilization that has allowed performing arts, sculptures, paintings, writing and trade to flourish over centuries. He further said that success is the consequence of passion, tenacity and unending labour. Wealth, fame and glory are only the consequences of success.

 

The Vice President expressed his happiness over giving away ‘MAGUDAM AWARDS’ to people from Tamil Nadu who have  excelled in the field of Sports, Entertainment, Public Service, Literature, Technology and Start-Ups.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""Vanakkam to my esteemed friends in this august gathering. We are here today to honour the best and the brightest from Tamil Nadu in various fields. Be it sports, arts and literature, social service, business or any other profession, Tamilians have been at the forefront of nation building, powering India ahead to the next generation of global super powers.

 

Tamil Nadu has always been at the forefront of India’s economic growth since before Independence, contributing in large part to the GDP of the country. With a Rs 13.39 lakh crore economy, Tamil Nadu is among the top states that contribute in large measure to the Indian exchequer. The state is currently growing at the rate of 7.49 per cent and is projected to shoot up to 9 per cent growth next year.

 

And all of this is thanks to the seven crore Tamilians who live and work not only in the state but also across the country and the world.

 

Tamilians are hard workers and innovators as is evident from many of the well known and well respected guests in this gathering. They have made their mark in the world – from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, a Chennaiite – to musical genius AR Rahman, film producer Ashok Amritraj and film director Manoj ‘Night’ Shyamalan, to name a few.

 

With a rich cultural heritage – from the wisdom of Tiruvalluvar to the temples of Madurai, the dargahs and mosques of Ramanathapuram, the churches and chapels of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu is home to an ancient and unique civilisation that has allowed performing arts, sculptures, paintings, writing and trade to flourish over centuries.

 

It is in this context that I am here today, speaking at News18 Tamil Nadu’s very first Magudam Awards. Magudam in Tamil, means ‘crown’ and it is apt that this award is named so, because all of the winners are kings and queens in their own right.

 

News18 Tamil Nadu’s Magudam Awards honours the hard work and determination that goes into achieving success against all odds in the six categories – sports, cinema, social service, business and entrepreneurship, science and technology as well as arts and literature. Apart from these, today we will also honour one person for a lifetime of achievement.

 

Today, brothers and sisters, is a celebration of success. As the great Tamil poet Tiruvalluvar said – “When the rare chance comes, seize it,To do the rare deed.”

 

There are such rare persons in our midst today who have seized that rare chance to do the rare deed and they have succeeded, thanks to grit, determination and unflinching passion in the face of enormous obstacles.

 

What defines success? Is it wealth? Is it fame? Is it glory? Success is the consequence of passion, tenacity and unending labour. Wealth, fame and glory are only the consequences of success.

 

Take for instance the nominees in each category today. Each and every one of them have succeeded due to these same qualities – passion for their chosen profession, tenacity to fight against poverty and all odds and unending labour.

 

In the business category for example – and I am only citing a few names, since time is short – concepts like Bharat Matrimony, Fresh Desk and Washapp – these have become success stories thanks to a novel idea implemented with dedication and fervour.

 

A wonderful helping heart in Madurai, Gandhimathiammal, who has taken it upon herself to feed street dwellers every day… Gunasekaran of Coimbatore who takes art to poor students and helps enrich their lives… Arivuchudar Tuition Centre of Villupuram which has brought quality education to hundreds of poor students in rural areas… these are the fruits of passion and we are here today to honour some among the many of these wonderful p

 

India is also at the forefront of science and technology, competing on par with global powers and those like Subbaiah Arunan, the brain behinf the Mars Mission, have helped put India there. Whether it is finding a cure for the Hepatitis B virus, as Professor SP Thyagarajan has done or innovating to reduce e-waste, as IIT Madras’ Indhumathi Nambi and Praveena Gangadharan have shown, we are indeed on the path to winning greater laurels globally.

 

As for the sporting arena, Indians are increasingly posing great challenges to world champions. Tamilians have a special role to play – the young Mariappan Thangavelu who has won laurels for the country in the 2016 Rio Paralympics, basketball player Anitha and cricketer Washington Sundar are some of the rising stars of next generation sportspersons who, I am sure, will do the nation proud in the near future.

 

Tamil Nadu loves its cinema – in fact cinema is an integral part of life and politics in the state. All of the Chief Ministers – like Mr MG Ramachandran, Mr M Karunanidhi and the late Ms Jayalalithaa have all come from the cine field. What would Indian cinema be without Nadigar Thilagam Sivaji Ganesan and Superstar Rajinikanth?

 

Tamil cinema is also at the forefront of innovation, experimentation and conscience. By conscience, I mean that the Tamil films being made by the bold new young directors, are intertwined with social messages, daring to choose realism and art and yet managing to churn out commercial successes.

 

Young director Manikandan’s “Kaaka Muttai” is a work of art on the life of children in the slums of Chennai. Extraordinary young talents such as actors Shivatha, Aishwarya Rajesh and Vijay Sethupathi make rustic Tamil characters come alive and sparkle on the big screen. Director Seenu Ramasamy, the very young Karthik Naren who delivered a blockbuster hit on his first attempt in “Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru” as well as the stars who have already ascended and remain at the top – Dhanush and Sathyaraj – the Tamil cine world has no dearth of talent.

 

Nasar, the winner of the Magudam Lifetime Achievement Award, is one of the greatest character actors of all time as well as a director, singer and lyricist. He followed his passion to become an actor, and has featured in over 300 films, including in Baahubali.

 

In the field of arts and literature, names such as Tho Paramasivan are well known – his research and deep knowledge of ancient Tamil culture and the magic wielded by his pen need no introduction. While Tho Pa engages with the written word, others like RP Amudhan wield the camera and the microphone, telling truth equally powerfully.

 

There is one common thread amongst all of these people gathered here today. They are all successes in their own right and the reasons are obvious.

The key characteristics of successful people has been researched across the world and across the centuries – simply because everybody wants to be a success of course! Let me list out a few key characteristics of successful people.

 

Optimism and creativity are what sets successful people apart from the average person. A negative attitude and approach to any endeavour can only guarantee failure. Similarly, doing things by the book is good, but innovating and using one’s creativity will set one apart from the rest.

 

Resilience and self-control are the other two qualities that are cultivated by highly successful people. Resilience is to plod on despite adversities, despite challenges, and to take an obstacle and turn it into an advantage. Self-control is crucial in order to ensure that we are unswerving from our chosen path and ensures complete focus on our goals.


Integrity and self confidence are the final two aspects of successful people that I would like to touch upon today. Short cuts can never ensure success. It is only reliability, honesty and credibility that can put one on the path to success. When we maintain our integrity, we show our peers that we are self confident and that nothing can bring us down. We show our clients and our bosses and the people we interact with that we have unimpeachable values. We show them that we are self made and independent.

 

And these, ladies and gentlemen, are the set of qualities that run as a common thread amongst the gathering in this hall.

 

Let me end my speech today with a rousing poem by the great poet Bharathiyar – you will all be familiar with it – it is called “Manadhil Urudhi Vendum”

Manadhil urudhi vendum,

Vakkinile inimai vendum,

Ninaivu nalladhu vendum,

Nerungina porul kaipada vendum,

Kanavu meippada vendum,

Kaivasamavathu viraivil vendum,

Dhanamum inbamum vendum,

Dharaniyile perumai vendum,

Kan thiranthida vendum,

Kaariyathil urudhi vendum,

Pen viduthalaio vendum,

Periya kadavul kaakka vendum,

Mann payanura vendum,

Vaanagamingu then pada vendum,

Unmai ninrida vendum.

 

(Let the mind be firm

Let the speech be sweet

Let the thoughts be noble

Let one attain what’s dear

Let all dreams come true

And quickly, too

Let there be wealth and happiness

And fame in this world

Let the eyes be open

Let one be determined in achieving one’s goals

Let women attain freedom

Let God protect us all

Let the land be fertile

Let us feel the heaven here

Let the Truth prevail)

Thank you very much and let us now honour the winners of News18 Tamil Nadu’s Magudam Awards.

Nandri Vanakkam.

 

Jai Hind.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the International community has to launch a concerted effort to isolate States which are sponsoring terrorism. He was addressing the 33rd Raising Day Celebrations of the National Security Guard (NSG), in Manesar, Haryana today. The Minister of Education, Government of Haryana, Shri Ram Bilash Sharma, the Director General, NSG, Shri Sudhir Pratap Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President paid homage to the 19 Brave Martyrs of NSG, who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty, thereby upholding the highest traditions of valour and sacrifice.

The Vice President said that NSG is a specially-trained, highly skilled and hugely motivated force, tasked with multifarious responsibilities and the entire nation is proud of their achievements. He further said that the National Security Guard is synonymous with bravery, professionalism and extreme dedication. The country will always remember the defining role NSG played in Akshardham, Mumbai and Pathankot attacks and neutralizing the grave threat, performing its tasks with great professional elan, he added.

The Vice President said in recent years, terrorist incidents have increased world over and some of the attacks have occurred at places which never experienced such events and perhaps least expected them. He further said that you are all aware that India is facing the menace of terrorism for the past three decades. We have always given a befitting reply to such anti-national elements, he added.

The Vice President said that there has been a paradigm shift in the modus operandi of our adversaries, wherein the threat is not limited only to border areas, but has manifested in the hinterland also. This requires constant reviewing and enhancement of our operational capabilities, he added.

The Vice President said that there is nothing like good terrorists and bad terrorists and terrorism knows no religion or boundaries and nobody should be allowed to get away with acts of violence in the name of ideology. The Vice President appealed to the United Nations to see the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on suppression of international terrorism, the proposal for which from India is pending since 1996.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

Shri Sudhir Pratap Singh, Director General, National Security Guard, Officers and my brave ‘Black Cat’ Commandos.

I am delighted to be part of the 33rd Raising Day Celebrations of the National Security Guard. At the outset, I pay homage to the 19 Brave Martyrs of NSG, who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty, thereby upholding the highest traditions of valour and sacrifice.

NSG is a specially-trained, highly skilled and hugely motivated force, tasked with multifarious responsibilities. Be it counter terrorist or counter hijack operations or protection of persons with high threat perception, you have always risen to occasion to ward off the challenges. The entire nation is proud of your achievements. NSG has footprints all over the country and the coming up of the Special Composite Group at Gandhinagar, bears testimony to the fact that the operational reach of NSG has further enhanced.

The National Security Guard is synonymous with bravery, professionalism and extreme dedication. I am certain that all of you must be proud to be a part of this special force, as the nation and people always look to you with awe, hope and trust and feel assured of their safety and well being. This confidence comes from the fact that NSG has delivered results by overcoming all odds, irrespective of the magnitude and the spectrum of challenge.

Over the last 33 years, you have successfully handled several terrorist and hijack situations. The country will always remember your defining role in Akshardham, Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. NSG accepted the challenge and neutralized the grave threat, performing its tasks with great professional elan.

In recent years, terrorist incidents have increased world over and some of the attacks have occurred at places which never experienced such events and perhaps least expected them. Those are the key words—least expected them. That’s how terrorists thrive and try to create mayhem by surreptitiously attacking at unsuspecting places and people. Hence, eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.

It is indeed ironical that as mankind progresses with the aid of technology, terrorists too come up with ways of using it for destroying lives and liberty of the people. The lone wolf attacks and the use of vehicles to mow down people in London, Barcelona and France reflect the need for mounting a heightened surveillance in public places to prevent recurrence of such incidents.

You are all aware that India is facing the menace of terrorism for the past three decades. We have always given a befitting reply to such anti-national elements.

However, recently, there has been a paradigm shift in the modus operandi of our adversaries, wherein the threat is not limited only to border areas, but has manifested in the hinterland also. This requires constant reviewing and enhancement of our operational capabilities.

To this effect, we all must remain committed to embracing the latest technology and develop specialist skills, with an aim to upgrade and hone our operational preparedness.

There is thus a dire need to constantly review, improve tactics and innovate and update strategy to always stay ahead in the game. In other words, to defeat the evil designs of terrorists both men and machines have to outsmart them.

Towards this end, the advancements that you have made in surveillance, firepower and developing counter UAV capabilities are indeed praiseworthy and laudable.

I feel the time has come for the international community to launch a concerted effort to isolate States which are sponsoring terrorism. There is nothing like good terrorists and bad terrorists. Terrorism knows no religion or boundaries and nobody should be allowed to get away with acts of violence in the name of ideology.

I fervently appeal to the United Nations to see the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on suppression of international terrorism, the proposal for which from India is pending since 1996.

It is extremely heartening to see NSG taking giant strides not only in ensuring its own progress but also carrying out Capacity Building, especially of our State Police Forces. This will ensure a synergised national response, to terrorism in our country. Other forces have also immensely benefitted from your Specialised Counter terror tactics, Bomb disposal techniques and from your K9 capabilities. By this measure, you are achieving the dual aim of capacity building, along with nation building and for this I wish to congratulate you.

For a force like NSG, training is the key and it is imperative that you are exposed to the best available training across the globe. I am happy that you have further built upon this repository by sharing the best practices with other Special Forces of India and the world. In the end, I convey my heartiest felicitations to each one of you on the 33rd Raising Day of NSG.

I am sanguine that you will always be committed to your Vision to be ‘A World Class Zero Error Force’. Our wishes and prayers are always with you and I am certain, that you will always put your best foot forward and come out successful in all your endeavours, while serving our great nation.

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Legislation should guarantee for providing service to peoples. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book 'The Mavericks of Mussoorie' authored by Shri M. Ramachandran, here today. 

The Vice President said that the book provides an opportunity to acquaint the general reader more intimately with how the Indian Administrative Service or the bureaucracy functions. He further said that the book also captures the professional competence, commitment to duty and hard work exhibited by the author in improving governance. Civil servants do face complex challenges in implementing policies of the government, he added. 

The Vice President said that the central services have to act innovatively to ensure that there is maximum governance and minimum government. He further said that it has been described as the ‘Steel Frame’ that holds the society together because it is supposed to be an objective implementer of the laws of the land. The higher civil services in the country have been one of the greatest contributors to nation building in the post-Independence India, he added. 

To explain the reason for lower growth of GDP during past quarter in the country, the Vice President gave an example of a college which indulged in malpractices to get good results. When a strict Principal was appointed in the college, he stopped all the malpractices and the students failed in the examinations. Resultantly, the students, teachers, management have blamed the Principal. 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

""I am happy to launch “The Mavericks of Mussoorie” written by Shri M. Ramachandran. This is a memoir or a chronicle of the experiences of a civil servant, who rose from a humble beginning to become a senior bureaucrat of the rank of the Chief Secretary in a State and Secretary at the Centre. 

The book provides, in the author’s own words, an opportunity to acquaint the general reader more intimately with how the Indian Administrative Service or the bureaucracy functions. 

It is a candid account of his career spanning 38 years of his service. Dr. Ramachandran had held various positions in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, including the post of the Chief Secretary in Uttarakhand. He had also served at the United Nations Development Programme and was also Secretary to the Central Government. 

This book while providing accounts of the challenges faced by a civil servant gives specific suggestions on how government needs to be improved in the larger interests of the common man. It makes pointed references to where governance changes are required—something quite relevant in today’s context when every effort is being made to make systems and procedures hassle-free for the common man. The book also captures the professional competence, commitment to duty and hard work exhibited by the author in improving governance. 

Dr. Ramachandran made a mark through his actions and pro-active measures in the infrastructure sector as seen in his role in the newly-created Uttarakhand or as Urban Development Secretary when a series of urban reforms were initiated such as national urban sanitation policy, credit rating of cities and promotion of public transport through BRTS and Metros in cities. 

Friends, no doubt, civil servants do face complex challenges in implementing policies of the government. Instead of routinely going about the task, the bureaucrats, especially those from the IAS and other central services have to act innovatively to ensure that there is maximum governance and minimum government. 

The civil service has been described as the ‘Steel Frame’ that holds the society together because it is supposed to be an objective implementer of the laws of the land. It has also been sometimes viewed in a negative light as too rigid and unbending. Sometimes it is also described as a steel frame that has got rusted because of inefficiency and corruption. While there are some aberrations and exceptions, I must say, the higher civil services in the country have been one of the greatest contributors to nation building in the post-Independence India. Most of them have been women and men of conviction, deep commitment and high level of competence. They have been creative translators of national policies. They have been innovative thinkers advising the political executive on policies and programmes. They have led from the front and provided India with the administrative leadership that the founding fathers like Sardar Vallabhai Patel had envisaged when they created the All India civil services in seventy years ago. 

Memoirs of administrative leaders like Shri Ramachandran ji provide the younger civil servants a source of inspiration. This book will give all civil servants a feeling that they can achieve tangible results despite all the odds and formidable challenges. 

The global and Indian governance contexts are changing rapidly. Like the transition from a colonial to a democratic regime necessitated a shift in emphasis, we are at the cusp of another change. We must move into a new managerial culture. The rising expectations of the people and the greater need for transparent, participatory and inclusive governance requires a shift in emphasis once again. 

The focus is now on a more efficient, effective governance intended to serve the citizens, especially those who are marginalized. The philosophy of the Government also is taking care of suppressed, oppressed and depressed people to follow the policies of Mahtama Gandhi, Dr. Ambedkar and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya of serving he unnerved, reaching the unreached, funding the unfunded, banking the unbanked, and taking care of the last man in the line, that is what called as 'antyodaya', uplifting the poorest of the poor. That is the main objective of the government and the Prime Minister has given a call, a three line mantra, 'Reform, Perform and Transform'. This reformation is very much needed for the transformation of the great nation that has to be done at every level. People at every level of administration, political or administrative, they have to well equipped with new ideas and further the process. The need of the hour is innovative service delivery and speedier project execution. The task before the civil services today lies essentially in identifying and removing the bottlenecks to create a vibrant and responsive, results-based management system. The accent must be on outcomes and impact and the higher civil services must set the tone. They must create a culture of evaluation, constant reflection and improvisation and innovation. 

Now the government is coming with service guarantee. The very fact that you need a legislation to provide guarantee for the service. Once the governments makes the law, the implementation part has to be taken care of by the bureaucrats, under the supervision of the political leaders. If the leadership is good, honest, dedicated you can do wonders. The scheme of Jan Dhan Yojana is one of such example. Within one year 26 crore people have opened bank account. No special staff, no overtime work, they did it with the commitment of the leadership. 

Reasons for lower GDP growth during the past quarter. Imaging that you have appointed a Principal, director of a college which is notorious for poor quality of education. You find that most students cheat during the examination with support of the teaches and do well in exams. The result of the college has been always 90 per cent in recent years. You are a person with principles. And hence you have decided to eliminate cheating from the examination. You installed CCTV cameras in all examination halls and also take proper actions towards the students and the teachers mall practices. The results is that, cheating is totally stopped in the examinations. However, the performance of your college dips drastically and less than 50 per cent students passed. This has been a bad performance in the recent years. You know face flack from all sides. Students are angry because they failed due to your strictness, teachers are angry because their track record got spoiled because of your, trustees of the college are angry because the result of their college has taken a beating under your charge. That is what happening in India right now. 

The ultimate objective, my dear friends, is to ensure that the benefits of the democratic governance are shared by all citizens and we leave no one behind. Our common endeavor is to transform Swaraj into Suraaj. I compliment the author on this excellent book that shows some of the ways in which this can be accomplished.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Dr. Kalam played a pioneering role in making India’s defence and space systems self-reliant. He was addressing the gathering at an event to Flag-off Rally for ‘Clean and Green India’ as part of 86th birth anniversary celebrations of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, here today.

 

The Vice President said that Dr. Kalam, a boat maker’s son, who used to distribute newspapers as a young boy to support the family, rose to become the First Citizen of India through sheer hard work, perseverance and self-belief. He further said that the ‘People’s President’ used to advice school children and youngsters to ‘Dare to dream and reach for the sky’.

 

The Vice President said that despite occupying the exalted position of the President of India, Dr. Kalam always remained simple and humble and treated all those who had worked with him or became acquainted with him with affection and warmth, irrespective of their position or background. The Vice President remembered that he had met him on several occasions and every discussion with him was a learning experience for him.

 

The Vice President said that Dr. Kalam’s vision was to see a fully transformed India as a developed country by 2020 and he was convinced that the country could achieve that status because of the talent, sincerity and hard working nature of the people. He often used to say that ‘strength respects strength’ and wanted India to emerge as a leading economic power, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“Friends, Brothers and Sisters!

 

We have gathered here to pay tributes to one of the most beloved Presidents of India, the late Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who was an equally great scientist and played a pivotal role in the development of the country’s missile and space technologies.

 

I am sure, Dr. Kalam, the ‘People’s President’ does not need any introduction to this audience, especially the youngsters.

 

A boat maker’s son, who used to distribute newspapers as a young boy to support the family, rose to become the First Citizen of India through sheer hard work, perseverance and self-belief. Dr. Kalam’s remarkable journey from Rameswaram to Rashtrapathi Bhavan in itself is an inspiration to every Indian.

He overcame several odds and challenges to pursue his goals and dreams. After completing aeronautical engineering and initially working with DRDO, he joined ISRO and was the project director for India’s first indigenously-built Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), which hurtled India into the space club by putting Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit on July 18, 1980.

 

Later, he moved back to DRDO and was chief architect of India’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)—under which five missiles were developed- Prithvi, Agni, Trishul, Akash and Nag. Thus, Dr. Kalam played a pioneering role in making India’s defence and space systems self-reliant. 

 

Dare to dream and reach for the sky was his advice to school children and youngsters.

 

Despite occupying the exalted position of the President of India, he always remained simple and humble and treated all those who had worked with him or became acquainted with him with affection and warmth, irrespective of their position or background. I too had met him on several occasions and every discussion with him was a learning experience for me.

 

His vision was to see a fully transformed India as a developed country by 2020 and he was convinced that the country could achieve that status because of the talent, sincerity and hard working nature of the people. He often used to say that strength respects strength and wanted India to emerge as a leading economic power.

 

In fact, the book written by him along with Y S Rajan titled ‘2020—A Vision for the New Millennium’ chartered the course for the country to become a developed country.

 

Friends, the time has come for every citizen to work towards building a New and Resurgent India. The first and foremost need is to overcome various social ills plaguing the country like poverty, illiteracy, casteism, communalism, regional parochialism and atrocities on women and weaker sections.

 

All sections need to be empowered, particularly the vulnerable groups like women, weaker sections and minorities. People must give up “chaltha hai” attitude and display a sense of passion and missionary zeal for building the India dreamt of by Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Dr. Kalam.

 

Let us all take a pledge to make India strong economically and technologically and the global hub of innovation and excellence.

 

JAI HIND!”

                Addresses 63rd Annual General Meeting of Indian Institute of Public Administration 
 



The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that technology driven government processes are required to address multiple challenges in contemporary India. He was addressing the 63rd Annual General Meeting of the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), here today.

 

The Vice President said that IIPA with more than six decades of Indian administration, assimilating changes, examining reforms and initiating research, evaluation and training programmes. He further said that the Public Administration has always been the management of change: administering change in society, in the economy and in political life. That is more so in a major democracy, he added.

 

The Vice President opined that we have to re-fashion our administrative abilities to implement the innovative and citizen-centric schemes of the Central and State Governments. He further said that it is a matter of pride that India’s fifteen-year development agenda is completely aligned with the global UN Sustainable Development Goals of citizen-centricity. The agenda before use is to convert ‘swaraj’ in to ‘suraj’ by providing good governance, by reaching all sections of the people, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we should aim at greater ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’ and we have to build a culture of ‘evaluation’ and constant ‘learning’ in our governance systems. He expressed hope that IIPA in conjunction with other similar institutions at state level will chalk out a comprehensive governance reform agenda and create a governance system with ‘people’ at the centre, the ‘results’ as the criterion of success and ‘constant innovation in processes’ as the guiding principle.

 

The Vice President said that programs should be implemented with Antyodaya approach that focuses on the most vulnerable, marginalized and hard-to-reach populations groups. Our approach has to be more empathetic, responsive and inclusive, that cares for women, differently abled and has, at its heart, a genuine commitment to spread the benefits of democratic governance to all sections in society without any discrimination in the spirit of the principle “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikaas”, he added.

 

The Vice President said that officers and the entire administrative system must understand the development imperatives of today and reorient the processes towards our common goal of serving each citizen. Need of the hour to create a governance system with ‘people’ at the centre, the ‘results’ as the criterion of success and ‘constant innovation in processes’ as the guiding principle, he added.

 

The Vice President released several publications and inaugurated the Online library - Digital Knowledge Repository of IIPA showcasing the research output and published resources of the Institute. He also gave away “Paul H. Appleby Awards” for distinguished services to IIPA and the field of Public Administration.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am happy to participate in the 63rd AGM as the President of this historic Institute. The IIPA has recently concluded its Diamond Jubilee. It has seen more than six decades of Indian administration, assimilating changes, examining reforms and initiating research, evaluation and training programmes.

 

In post-Independence India, Public Administration has always been the management of change: administering change in society, in the economy and in political life. That is more so in a major democracy such as India where poverty and diversity create a massive demand for responsible and responsive governance. Addressing the first batch of IAS officers on 21 April, 1947 Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel underlined the important post-Independence change in administrative emphasis from the colonial Indian Civil Service to the All-India Administrative Service. Terming the ICS as neither ‘Indian’ nor ‘Civil’, Sardar Patel had said:

 

‘….your predecessors were brought up in the traditions in which they felt out of touch and kept themselves aloof from the common run of the people. It will be your bounden duty to treat the common men in India as your own or to put it correctly, to feel  yourself to be one of them and amongst them and you will have to learn not to despise or disregard them. In other words, you will have to adapt yourselves to democratic ways of administration….’

 

This massive shift in outlook in serving the common person of India rather than the colonial command and control system, required great effort in Human Resources Development and training. This is one of the important reasons for setting up the IIPA.

 

We are again at the cusp of change as we have to re-fashion our administrative abilities to implement the innovative and citizen-centric schemes of the Central and State Governments. We have to harness the power of technology and utilize it for the benefit of the people. Today’s administrators have to match the strengths and weaknesses of our internal environments with the pulls and pressures of external forces. They have to not just manage but deliver change impartially, honestly, forcefully and at a pace which is socially and economically acceptable.

 

It is a matter of pride that India’s fifteen-year development agenda is completely aligned with the global UN Sustainable Development Goals of citizen-centricity. This is the most comprehensive framework for our country’s growth and development. It covers administrative deliveries, policy and regulation in the critical areas of reducing poverty, eliminating hunger, extending public health and well-being, providing basic education, providing clean water and sanitation, ensuring gender considerations, promoting clean energy and continuously striving for growth, employment and equity in our Governance.

 

Showing deep concern for the country’s environmentally dependent poor, India ratified its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. That shows our new resolve towards adhering to responsible growth patterns and strong commitment to climatically protect our poor especially in India’s coastal regions, hill tracts and the vulnerable populations in all of India’s twelve bio-geographic zones.  All this requires intelligent and knowledgeable administrative capacity that needs to be inculcated among our young officers. I am aware that IIPA and institutes of its kind have been engaged in this effort and will continue to do so in the future. 

 

However, I feel much more needs to be done.

 

We have a long way to go in translating the vision of our founding fathers into tangible reality. Our founding fathers thought that once we get ‘swaraj’ all the problems will be solved. But now, the agenda before use is to convert ‘swaraj’ in to ‘suraj’ by providing good governance, by reaching all sections of the people. We are still facing enormous challenges in delivering basic services to the common man. Illiteracy, ill health, poor quality of education, lack of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities, poor urban planning, inadequate attention to environmental pollution and a host of other issues remain. We have to gear up the implementation processes so that the intended benefits of the policies and programmes of our government reach the people on time.

 

We should aim at greater ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’. We have to build a culture of ‘evaluation’ and constant ‘learning’ in our governance systems.

 

Let me elaborate. We tend to focus more on activities and inputs and very often miss out on what I consider as the most important aspect- the outcome and the impact of our actions on the populations we are trying to serve. We must focus on results. We must look at the cost effectiveness and the ultimate impact. We must be willing to honestly evaluate and keep improving on our delivery systems. We must assess on a continuous basis as to whether we are able to achieve the stated objectives in the stipulated time and within the projected budget. W must look at efficiency of our working. We must keep reflecting on the question: Have we have adopted the most cost-efficient and energy-efficient and sustainable modality or not. Did we achieve the results without time –overrun or cost-overrun?

 

This requires a culture of evaluation, learning from the results of evaluation and acting promptly to make mid-course corrections. Unless this kind of an orientation is built into our governance patterns, we may be wasting our precious and scarce resources and not delivering services to our populations effectively and efficiently.  IIPA has an important role to play in building this crucial element in contemporary administrative and moving the entire system towards results based managerial culture.

 

Institutional support to the Government from IIPA, to help officers implement our programmes at all levels is crucial to success. I am happy that IIPA provides support services to major implementing ministries such as Housing and Urban Affairs, Consumer affairs, MEITY, DoPT, DST etc.

 

New thinking is necessary on the structure, attitudes and capacity of our administration to deliver on programmes like Swacch Bharat (urban and rural), Smart cities, Skill India, Direct Benefit Transfer, Digital India, AMRUT, universal housing through the PM Awas Yojana and so on.

 

 All these schemes go beyond the conventional delivery mechanisms of development administration of the Seventies and require greater coordination with the objective of reaching the citizen in the farthest village keeping in view the Antyodaya approach that focuses on the most vulnerable, marginalized and hard-to-reach populations groups.

 

It has to be a more empathetic, responsive and inclusive approach. It should be an approach that cares for women, differently abled and has, at its heart, a genuine commitment to spread the benefits of democratic governance to all sections in society without any discrimination in the spirit of the principle “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikaas”.

 

Not only repeated classroom training but repeated field visits and hand-holding of Central Ministries and State Governments by institutes like IIPA is the need of the hour. I congratulate the Institute for having consistently trained about 4500 officers from the Central and State Government in these topical areas of learning and for conducting about thirty research projects each year.

 

In our HRD efforts, Urban Management is in the forefront with more than 50% of India’s population expected to reside in cities and urban centres by 2030.  I am happy that IIPA houses the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs’ Centre for Urban Services an urban sector think tank providing training and research support since 1963.  It is extending urban financial and municipal management training to city Mayors, Commissioners and other senior functionaries from cities, public-sector and para-municipal agencies. The CUS at IIPA has also done appreciable work in city-management reports in corporations like Bengaluru, Indore, Gurugram and Ahmedabad. 

 

I am encouraged by the fact that the IIPA management has concluded an MOU with the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) to re-develop its old infrastructure. Let the new structures represent the 21stCentury and the new administration of tomorrow which IIPA through its past and present knowledge management and delivery will be able to portray to the Governments of the future. IIPA’s global network should enable an enhancement of its inter-country experience sharing and developing common good practices in relevant fields of administration.

 

The change that Sardar Patel saw and Pandit Nehru, the first President of the IIPA Society in the initial years dreamt of, are today a multi-dimensional challenge.

 

Technology driven government processes are required to address these multiple challenges in contemporary India.

 

Governance has to be very agile in its efficacy and reach if services to the poorest of the poor and those in the remotest corners- to the last mile- to the last person in the queue- of our country have to be effective in their impact.

 

Officers and the entire administrative system must understand the development imperatives of today and reorient the processes towards our common goal of serving each citizen.

 

I hope IIPA in conjunction with other similar institutions at state level will chalk out a comprehensive governance reform agenda and create a governance system with ‘people’ at the centre, the ‘results’ as the criterion of success and ‘constant innovation in processes’ as the guiding principle.

 

I wish you all the very best in your endeavours to deliver high quality outputs.

 

I hope you will be relentless in shaping IIPA as an institution of excellence, always alive to the current realities, agile enough to respond to changing contexts and forward looking enough to anticipate future trends.

 

Jai hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the medical fraternity to treat their profession as a mission to provide healthcare to the masses at an affordable and reasonable cost. He was addressing the gathering after releasing two books titled ‘Minimally Invasive GI Cancer Surgery’ authored by renowned laparoscopic surgeon, Dr. C. Palanivelu and ‘Bariatric Surgical Practice Guide’, edited by Dr. P. Praveen Raj, here today. 

The Vice President said that medical profession was a noble profession and keep that in mind and treat this as a mission. He further said that people consider a doctor to be next to God. He exhorted the medical fraternity to adopt a humanitarian approach while providing medical care to people. 

The Vice President said that the doctors should educate and sensitize the people about the dangers of leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating junk food. He further said that health experts opine that the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases will increase while those of the communicable diseases will decrease in the coming years. Modern lifestyle, diet and genetic predisposition are believed to be among the major contributing factors for this trend, he added. 

The Vice President said that among cancers, the GI cancers involving digestive organs such as esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, lungs, large intestine and rectum, constitute 60 per cent. He further said that the incidence of GI cancers is increasing alarmingly due to fast foods, smoking, alcohol and life style changes. He expressed concern that obesity was reaching alarming proportions and that youngsters were getting affected by GI cancers. 

He Vice President said that India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and showed the path to the rest of the world. He further said that today again it was becoming a medical tourism hub with people from different countries coming here for treatment. 

The Vice President congratulated Dr. Palanivelu for applying laparoscopic surgery for all types of surgeries, including cancer surgery and expressed the hope that the book written by him would go a long way in promoting minimally invasive surgery for GI cancers.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Yoga is the Mother of all Exercises. He was addressing the inaugural session of the 3rd International Yoga Conference, here today. The Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent Charge), Shri Shripad Yesso Naik and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that the ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world. He further said that we believe that knowledge and science should be transmitted freely for the welfare of the entire world. “Sarve Janaah Sukhino Bhavantu” has been our fervent prayer from time immemorial, he added.

 The Vice President said that Yoga goes beyond the physical exercises and connects the body with thought processes. He further said that Yoga has nothing to do with religion, as some people unfortunately attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system. It is a science of well being that needs to be studied and practiced just as any other medical system, he added.

 The Vice President said that Yoga should become a part and parcel of our daily routine to combat the modern-day health problems, both physical and mental. He further said that Yoga aims to help us to achieve a state of equilibrium when we are at peace with ourselves so that we can create a peaceful environment.

 The Vice President appreciated the efforts of the people like Baba Ram Dev who made Yoga to reach every house simply by explaining what Yoga is.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely pleased to inaugurate this two-day international Conference on ‘Yoga and Wellness’ organized by the Ministry of AYUSH.

 I am glad that a large number of delegates from more than 44 countries around the world are attending this conference.

 Yoga is the Mother of all Exercises.

 The theme of the conference is very much relevant and timely. It provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the ancient science of yoga and the possible ways in which this knowledge can be applied to make our contemporary lives better, healthier and happier.

 The conference will be focusing on seeking solutions to contemporary problems by utilizing the insights of ancient scientists. A quick glance at the topics being covered in this conference shows the potential pathway to wellness that yoga may offer to a population suffering because of modern, stress-filled lifestyles.

 ‘Yoga and Depression’, ‘Yoga and Cardiovascular Diseases’, ‘Yoga and Cancer Control’, ‘Yoga and Pain Management’, ‘Yoga for Women; Case Studies on Gynecological Disorders’—these are the topics of the technical sessions for papers presentation by experts, followed by a panel discussion.

 What does the wide range of the topics indicate? It indeed shows the all-pervasive and positive role yoga can play in management and control of different ailments. Friends, I need not elaborate to this erudite audience about the ill-effects of the many problems like pollution plaguing the modern society. For instance, studies have shown that yoga helps in improving pulmonary function in patients suffering from bronchial asthma.

The ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world.  Thanks to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the United Nations declared June 21 as the International Yoga Day and is now being celebrated across the globe. The ancient science has been practiced in India and many countries around the world for a number of years. What the declaration of June 21 as International Day of yoga will do is to enable a greater number of persons to benefit from this holistic science. We, in India, believe that knowledge and science should be transmitted freely for the welfare of the entire world. “Sarve Janaah Sukhino Bhavantu” has been our fervent prayer from time immemorial.

 Yoga is a holistic science embodying the basic principle of organic, interconnectedness of different facets of life. It is not a mere set of exercises. It goes beyond the physical exercises and connects the body with thought processes. It seeks to build a lifestyle that values calmness, harmony and positive thinking. It is probably one of the most effective therapies for many psycho-somatic disorders.

 As has been rightly mentioned, Yoga adopts a holistic approach towards health and well-being. While Yoga has nothing to do with religion, some people unfortunately attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system. It is a science of well being that needs to be studied and practiced just as any other medical system. This is precisely the objective of conferences like the one we are having here today. More research needs to be done to take this science forward so that the world population benefits from this treasury of knowledge and wisdom.

Yoga should become a part and parcel of our daily routine to combat the modern-day health problems, both physical and mental. There is also a misconception that Yoga is only a sort of physical exercise meant to help the fitness of an individual. Nothing could be farther than this. It is a holistic system where the mind and body act in unison and get completely rejuvenated as physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation help in overall well-being of an individual. And of course Yoga also helps in the spiritual quest of an individual through understanding of the inner Self and achieving complete peace with the surroundings.

 In fact, there are different dimensions of yoga and we find them elaborated in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and other treatises including the timeless classic, Bhagavad-Gita.  Samatvam Yoga Uchyate (समत्वंयोगउच्यते). “That is Yoga, which is based on Samatva, calmness, balance”. When there is imbalance within the body or the mind, we don’t feel well. We cannot do our best. Yoga believes that this balance has to be restored to achieve wellness and total well being.

 Yoga aims to help us to achieve a state of equilibrium when we are at peace with ourselves so that we can create a peaceful environment around us. We are at harmony with our surroundings, with our fellow human beings, with nature and environment. Yoga systems recognize that the training of the body is the first important step towards achieving this goal. The ancient yogic scientists emphasized the fundamental importance of being in good physical health. They said: “Shariramaadyam Khalu Dharma Saadhanam” meaning “A healthy body is the first step towards achieving whatever one aspires for”.

 While, yoga is an integral part of ‘Health and Physical Education’ in India, it is also gaining increasing popularity in schools in the United States and has been introduced in schools in the UK and Australia because of its positive effects on concentration levels and  emotional balance, among others.

 Many more systematic efforts to spread the knowledge are called for.

 I am sure this two-day conference will give an impetus to the wider dissemination of the scientific principles underlying yoga. I do hope that the scientific and medical fraternity will establish empirically the connection between yoga and wellness. That would, indeed, be the foundation for a healthy, harmonious sustainable world. Your efforts will hopefully be successful I wish that this Conference become a grand success.

 I appreciate the efforts of the people like Baba Ram Dev. He made Yoga to reach every house. That is the greatness of that individual. He made this herculean task simply by explaining what Yoga is and how it helps you lead a better life. Once he organized a Yoga camp in my place, Nellore town. He invited me to the Yoga demonstration at 5.30 in the morning. When we reached the venue next morning, I was surprised to see the ground was full of about 30 thousand Yoga enthusiasts, who gathered there to practice Yoga. Such was the impact of Baba Ram Dev.

 Many more great people have done great things. We have seen now, Swami Maheshwarananda ji living in a country like Austria, propagating Yoga and also Dr. Chris Streeter teaching Yoga in US Boston University, and catching up everywhere.

 

I wish to end with the prayer from the Upanishads that is a prayer for happiness, good health and positive thoughts.

 

SarveBhavantuSukhinah

SarveSantuNiraamayaah

SarveBhadraaniPashyantu

MaaKaschidDukhaBhaagBhavet

 

“Let everyone be happy, free from illness, see goodness everywhere and not be sorrowful”.

 

I wish you all the very best in your deliberations and future work.

 

Jai Hind”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that skill development is an important area in which NGOs and voluntary bodies must step up their activities to meet the growing requirement of vocational training and enable youth to find gainful employment or become entrepreneurs. He was addressing the gathering after giving away the ‘Rashtra Sewa Awards’ constituted by the Krishna Foundation, here today. The Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Dr. P.J. Kurien and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that Krishna Foundation has chosen poet and writer, Shri P. Parameswaran and Philanthropist and businessman, Shri Yusuff Ali for presenting Rashtra Sewa Awards in recognition of their services to the nation. The Foundation is also giving financial assistance to 20 school students belonging to weaker sections, he added.

 

The Vice President said that even 70 years after Independence, the country is grappling with many social evils like poverty, corruption, illiteracy, terrorism, religious fundamentalism, atrocities on weaker sections and gender discrimination. He further said that while the governments are doing their best to overcome the challenges on various fronts, the efforts of NGOs and voluntary organizations will go a long way in supplementing the measures taken by the governments.

 

The Vice President said that the NGOs all over the country that are working dedicatedly in different sectors - be it eradicating poverty, illiteracy, women’s empowerment, tackling the menace of child trafficking, drug and alcohol addiction or imparting skills to youngsters. He further said that for a country as large and as populous as India, more such dedicated organizations should step into the arena of social service. “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”, said the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, he added.

 

The Vice President said that organizations like the Krishna Foundation can make a meaningful difference to the lives of the poor and downtrodden. About 65 per cent population below 35 years, the nation must fully take advantage of this huge demographic dividend, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am happy to be amidst you for the presentation of Rashtra Sewa Awards, instituted by Krishna Foundation.

 

Conferring an award  on an individual in recognition of the outstanding work rendered by that person in a chosen field or for social service is not only meant to serve as an inspiration for others but also to motivate the awardee to scale bigger heights.

 

Indeed I am happy that Krishna Foundation has chosen poet and writer, P. Parameswaran and Philanthropist and businessman, Yusuff Ali for presenting Rashtra Sewa Awards in recognition of their services to the nation. I am told that the Foundation is also giving financial assistance to 20 school students belonging to weaker sections.

 

Shri P. Parameswaran is a scholar, great thinker and above all a renowned social worker, who dedicated his life for society. He is a poet, writer and also a good orator. He left politics to take up social service and also served as the Director of the Deen Dayal Research Institute. He started Bharateeya Vichar Kendram in Kerala, aimed at national reconstruction through study and research. The Kendram regularly organizes debates and symposia on issues of larger national and social importance. The Kendram also has become a central place for intelligentsia to meet, exchange and nurture ideas.

 

Shri Parameswaran is totally dedicated to the cause of the nation. He authored more than 30 books and was given Kerala Sahitya Academy Award for one of his books.

 

Shri Yusuff Ali, Chairman and Managing Director of the Abu Dhabi-based Lulu Group International, is one of the well-known businessmen from India.  He has provided employment to thousands of Indians and others and was awarded Padma Shri in 2008.

 

Friends, even 70 years after Independence, the country is grappling with many social evils like poverty, corruption, illiteracy, terrorism, religious fundamentalism, atrocities on weaker sections and gender discrimination. While the governments are doing their bit to overcome the challenges on various fronts, the efforts of NGOs and voluntary organizations will go a long way in supplementing the measures taken by the governments.

 

Social service in the complete sense of the terms should be the motto of such organizations. No doubt, there are numerous voluntary organizations/ NGOs all over the country that are working dedicatedly in different sectors-- be it eradicating poverty, illiteracy, women’s empowerment, tackling the menace of child trafficking, drug and alcohol addiction  or imparting skills to youngsters.

 

However, for a country as large and as populous as India, more such dedicated organizations should step into the arena of social service.

 

“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”, said the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. In another observation, he had stated: “To give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer”.

 

Organizations like the Krishna Foundation can make a meaningful difference to the lives of the poor and downtrodden. Today, our country’s greatest asset is its young population. With about 65 per cent population below 35 years, the nation must fully take advantage of this huge demographic dividend. Keeping this in view, the government launched a massive mission for skill development.

 

This is an important area in which NGOs and voluntary bodies must step up their activities to meet the growing requirement of vocational training and enable youth to find gainful employment or become entrepreneurs. Similarly, adult literacy could be one of the focus areas. The talents and energies of the youth need to be channelized in a proper and constructive manner for their own well-being and of the society at large. 

 

JAI HIND !”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the ongoing discussion on Economy in the country is good for democracy. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the International Conference on Technological Advancements in Railway & Metro Projects 2017, here today, organized by the Defence Infrastructure Planning & Management Council, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Urban Development and the Niti Aayog. The Union Minister for Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal, the Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that any transformation or reformation will have hiccups in the initial stages. He further said that revolutionary taxation and reformation is taking place in the country.

 

The Vice President quoted the World Bank President, Mr. Jim Yong Kim, who has described the recent slowdown in economic growth in India as an aberration, which is mainly due to temporary disruptions in preparation for the GST. He went on to recall the World Bank President’s statement that this aberration will get corrected in coming months and that the GST is going to have a hugely positive impact on Indian economy. He also cited recent reports that indicated a significant increase in sales of cars, televisions and refrigerators as compared to last year showing an upswing in consumer spending.

 

The Vice President said that with urbanization taking place at a rapid pace in India, the need for efficient and cost-effective transport is critical in ensuring faster mobility and sustainable development. He further said that new concepts such as ‘Transit Oriented Development’ should be tried out and promoted which will improve the lives of people living around the metro stations in a big way.

 

The Vice President said that the Indian Railways need to plan for a massive expansion very meticulously with forward looking, efficient technologies and innovative practices currently available across the globe and adopt them to serve our country’s aspiring population. He further said that the IT revolution sweeping the world, to which India has also been a major contributor, is bound to improve the efficiencies in signaling, communications and safety and help in areas like intelligent transportation systems.

 

The Vice President said that in the Indian ethos, we believe that science and technology are tools to improve the quality of life and we say “Bahujana hitaya, bahujana sukhaya” implying that we aim at the good of humanity at large and also care for the happiness of the entire population on this planet. We also believe this is possible if we are open to new ideas and concepts, either home grown or from outside, he added.

 

The Vice President expressed his hope that the discussions and the deliberations in this two-day conference will provide a fast-track approach to build many state of the art railway systems that will improve the economy and the quality of life of people in India and the rest of the world.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely happy to address this august gathering at the inaugural session of the International Conference on Technological Advancements in Railways and Metros.

 

From its origin purely as a colonial project in 1853, the Indian railways has emerged today as one of the largest rail networks in the world and an important economic engine in the growth and development narrative of India. It is estimated that in the next five years the Indian Railways will be the third largest railway system in the world accounting for 10 per cent of the global market. 

 

With its extensive network, Indian Railways caters to lower, middle and upper middle classes for both, short and long distance travelling. It also one of the largest employers in the government and generates informal employment through forward and backward linkages. 

 

Rail historian and journalist, Christian Wolmer, in an article succinctly summed up the transformative role played by the railways. He said: “Nowhere other than India is the railway so indelibly connected with the image of the nation. Just as there is no single country on earth that has such a broad cultural, ethnic, and racial mix as India, there is also no railway system that has played and, crucially, continues to play such a fundamental role”.

 

The Indian Railways connects the vast country through its extensive network of 64,000 km of track covering about 8,000 railway stations and 1,00,000 bridges as well as signalling and telecom network. It provides transport services to about two crore or 20 million passengers every day.  Each day, 20,000 trains criss-cross the length and breadth of India serving, in a year, a population of about 700 crore (seven billion) people and transporting more than 1,000 MT (billion tons).  

 

With the number of passengers projected to touch thirty million in the next few years and the demand for transportation of goods also touching four million tons of freight daily in the near future, the railways are poised for a massive expansion.

 

I am told that investments to the tune of Rs. 8 lakh crore are planned in the next five years on various projects in the railways.

 

With urbanisation taking place at a rapid pace in India, the need for efficient and cost-effective transport is critical in ensuring faster mobility and sustainable development.

 

As part of meeting the growing transport demand in cities, several new metro rail projects are in different stages of execution, apart from those in operation at Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Kochi, Lucknow and Mumbai. Metros are under construction at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Noida, Navi Mumbai and Pune, among others. Several others are under consideration and planning. Once various metros become operational, the intra-city mobility will improve by leaps and bounds.

 

I also understand that new concepts such as ‘Transit Oriented Development’ being tried out will improve the lives of people living around the metro stations in a big way. 

 

So, friends, the Indian Railways will have to plan for this massive expansion very meticulously. It will have to look for technologies and innovative practices currently available across the globe. It will have to be forward looking, efficient and adopt the state of the art technologies that serve our country’s aspirational population. Against this backdrop, this conference is very timely.

 

I am glad that this international conference is focusing on a host of technologies that are going to play a key role not only in improving the services but also in the safety of the commuters.  

 

The IT revolution sweeping the world, to which India has also been a major contributor, is bound to improve the efficiencies in signalling, communications and safety and help in areas like intelligent transportation systems.

 

I am glad that we have amidst us the Inventor of Maglev, also called magnetic levitation train. Maglev trains are very fast trains. Maglev trains float over a guide way using the basic principle of magnetic repulsion. This technology is apparently even ahead of High Speed Railways. Recently, we have embarked on collaboration with Japan to introduce high speed, ‘bullet trains’.

 

I am glad that technology is being harnessed for the welfare of the common man. In the Indian ethos, we believe that science and technology are tools to improve the quality of life and we say “Bahujana hitaya, bahujana sukhaya” implying that we aim at the good of humanity at large and also care for the happiness of the entire population on this planet. We also believe this is possible if we are open to new ideas and concepts, either home grown or from outside.

 

The ancient visionaries in India had given expression to this receptive approach when they said: “Aano Bhadrah Kratavo Yantu Vishwathah” (Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides). We should continue to build on this commonwealth of knowledge and wisdom.

 

Technology will also be a potential ally for improving the safety and security and enhance the quality of passenger experience. I hope this Conference will provide some new insights in this regard drawn from the global best practices.

 

The managers of our railway system must use every opportunity to update their knowledge and skills. Even the best systems in the world have to constantly keep learning and doing things differently to serve the populations better.

 

With about eight lakh crore planned investments, opening up of FDI in rail infrastructure and implementation of GST, I am sure the Indian railways will stand to benefit particularly in the long-distance transportation in the years ahead. Technology along with managerial excellence can chart a new trajectory.

 

The discussion which is going on our economy is always good for our democracy. But at the same time, we need to understand the experience. If some transformation or any reformation is going on, there will be some initial hiccups. But at the end of the day, it will help. A revolutionary taxation and reformation is taking place in the country. In future there will be a very happy situation with such a massive transformation taken place in a vast country like India.

 

The World Bank Chief, Mr. Jim Yong Kim has said that the recent slowdown in economic growth in India as an aberration mainly due to temporary disruption in preparation for the GST. That will be corrected in coming months. He also said that the GST is going to have a huge positive impact on Indian economy.

 

There is a discussion going on slow-down. Sales of cars, televisions and refrigerators increased more than 15 per cent in this Navaratri and Dassehra from last year. This shows how the country is moving forward.

 

I take this occasion to welcome all the experts gathered here today, congratulate the organizers and wish the conference a grand success.

 

I do hope that the discussions and the deliberations in this two-day conference will provide a fast-track approach to build many state of the art railway systems that will improve the economy and the quality of life of people in India and the rest of the world.

 

I wish to conclude with a fervent wish and a prayer from the 10th chapter of the Rig Veda that emphasises how we must continue this Jnana Yagna - the churning of ideas and sharing of creative thoughts- on a continuous basis with a common objective- creating for every one the happy world we all want:

 

“SAMAANI  VA  AAKOOTIH

SAMAANI HRIDAYANI  VA

SAMAANAMASTU  VO  MANO

YATHA VAH   SUSAHASATI ”

 

“May our intentions and aspirations be alike, so that a common objective unifies us all ”. 

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that increased production and efficient distribution of food grains can move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all. He was delivering the 49th Convocational Address at the Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU), in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh today. The Governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Chancellor of ANGRAU, Shri E.S.L Narasimhan, the Agriculture Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 

The Vice President said that India is the world's largest producer of milk, pulses and jute, and ranks as the second largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruit and cotton. He further said that the growing needs of our country’s increasing population require us to evolve our own home grown food security strategy.

 

The Vice President suggested that first we have to provide an end-to-end (E2E) ecosystem comprising of “4-I s” namely ‘Irrigation’, ‘Infrastructure’, ‘Investment credit’ and ‘Insurance’. The second is Lab-to-Land (L2L) transfer of technology, he added.

 

The Vice President said that infrastructural improvements in rural roads, dependable quality power, godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards are an essential prerequisite for improving the efficiency of the agricultural sector. Timely credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies are important building blocks of a robust ecosystem for Agriculture, he added.

 

The Vice President congratulated all the students, gold medalists and awardees who are receiving their degrees on this occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s Address:

 

“The Hon’ble Governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Chancellor of Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU), Shri E.S.L Narasimhan garu;  Vice-Chancellor, ANGRAU, Dr. V. Damodara Naidu, Members of the Board of Management, Members of the Academic Council, Faculty, Officials and Staff of the University, distinguished guests, dear students, respected parents, representatives of press and media, ladies and gentlemen :

I consider it a proud privilege to deliver the 49th Convocation address of this prestigious university. I heartily congratulate all the students, gold medallists and awardees who are receiving their degrees on this occasion. It is a moment of celebration of your achievements and also a moment of inspiration. It is a moment that launches you on your chosen vocation and helps you to realize your aspiration.

You have chosen to be agricultural scientists, a field that has tremendous relevance in a country with a vast agro-ecological diversity and where 64 percent of the total workforce in the rural areas is engaged in agriculture and contributes 39 percent of total rural net domestic product. Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, is one of the largest contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As per the 2nd advised estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the share of agriculture and allied sectors (including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery) is expected to be 17.3 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 2016-17 at 2011-12 prices.

The last seventy years after independence have been years of significant growth. The country’s food grain production increased by 8.7 per cent and reached a record high of 273.83 million tonnes in 2016-17.

 

As the Food and Agriculture Organization acknowledged:

 

“India is the world's largest producer of milk, pulses and jute, and ranks as the second largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruit and cotton. From 50 million tons in 1950, India's food grain production rose more than five times, to over 257 million tons in 2014-15. India is the world's largest milk producer, producing over 130 million tons annually. The dairy sector is also one of the largest employers of rural people, especially women. With an annual production of over 10 million tons, India ranks second in global fish production and aquaculture, next only to China.”

 

Yet, we have formidable challenges confronting us.

 

Except wheat, productivity of other crops in the country is below world average mainly because of poor access to irrigation and improved technology.

 

Workforce in agriculture sector is declining at the rate of approximately 2 percent every year. According to one estimate, “to double farmers’ income by 2022, the progress in various sources of growth has to be accelerated by 33 percent”.

 

Clearly, a concerted, coordinated focused action is required on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector. We cannot be complacent about the food security situation as it exists today. The growing needs of our country’s increasing population require us to evolve our own home grown food security strategy. Increased production and efficient distribution of food grains can move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all.

 

Our Honourable Prime Minister has called for doubling the income of Indian farmers by 2022.  Both the Central and State Governments are taking up several initiatives in this regard. In my view, we have to adopt a two pronged approach. The first is to provide an end-to-end (E2E) ecosystem comprising of what I call “4-I s” namely ‘Irrigation’, ‘Infrastructure’, ‘Investment credit’ and ‘Insurance’. The second is Lab-to-land (L2L) transfer of technology.

 

Let me take the first strand of work. Successive governments have been taking up a number of reform measures to strengthen the ecosystem but I think more time-bound, systematic and systemic efforts are called for. Irrigation is of course the most crucial factor. In addition to rain water harvesting and construction of check dams, the government is considering linking of rivers as a possibility to enhance the area under irrigation. More than 40 proposals of intra-state links have been received from 9 States viz. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Linking Narmada to other rivers in Gujarat, Ken- Batwa link in Madhya Pradesh and linking Krishna and Godavari in Andhra Pradesh are a few examples of what could be the most promising way forward.

 

In addition to irrigation, the government is rightly focusing on infrastructure like rural roads, dependable quality power, godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards. These infrastructural improvements are an essential prerequisite for improving the efficiency of the agricultural sector.

 

Two other important building blocks of a robust ecosystem are timely credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies. These allow for farmers to invest in better, income-generating crops and agricultural practices and increase their incomes. The insurance cover shields the farmers against unforeseen climatic and natural disasters. The kisan credit cards and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are steps in the right direction and need to be universalized. 

 

The government have to ensure the end-to-end services. Right from the purchase of seeds to the post-harvest operations, the farmer’s needs have to be addressed through a network of efficient farmer-friendly institutions. There is certainly a need to step up public investment in and for agriculture which currently stands at 2.7 percent of GDP.

 

Marketing of agricultural produce and getting a fair return is a big challenge for most farmers. The farmers still rely on local markets and have to resort, very often, to distress sale. A new initiative called E-NAM seeks to remedy this situation by adopting an e-trading platform for agricultural commodities. The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act is also being proposed to be amended by introducing single-point levy of market fee across a State and a united single trading licence.

 

The E2E initiatives of the government have to be supplemented by the private sector’s efforts as well. In addition, there is a very important second strand I mentioned at the beginning- strengthen the Lab-to-land (L2L) approaches. All of you have a huge challenge before you. How do you transfer the knowledge and skills you have acquired during your stay in this University to the farmers in order to transform the agricultural landscape of the country? How do you positively impact the lives of the farmers in rural India? 

 

You can do many things and use your innovative abilities to improve the efficiency of the system. Let me suggest a few areas that merit focused attention of agricultural universities and other institutions of higher learning as well as research institutions.

 

First is intensification of farming by enhancing productivity through use of high yielding varieties of seeds and efficient use of land and water. High yielding varieties cover only 69 percent of the total area under cereal crops. This coverage should be expanded. While irrigation facilities are being expanded by the government, there is a need to educate the farmers on using the water efficiently. “It is seen that even districts at same level of irrigation show large difference in aggregate productivity”. Every drop of this scarce resource must be made use of optimally. Equally important is that more crops must be grown on the same land.

 

Second is diversification. Farmers must be encouraged to diversify and take up high value crops like fruits, vegetables, fibre, condiments, pulses, spices and sugarcane. It has been established that the average productivity of high value crops is around Rs. 1.4 lakh per hectare as compared to Rs. 41,169 per hectare from staple crops like cereals and oil seeds. There is also a tremendous potential to diversify towards other allied occupations as well like dairy and forestry. The productivity of livestock is still quite low with an average milk yield of 4.90 kg per in-milk buffalo and 3.1 kg per in-milk cow. Similarly, we need to encourage farmers to take up agro-forestry and forestry, especially in view of the fact that India currently meets 40 percent of its non-fuel timber requirement from the import of wood and wood products.

 

These two sets of actions can be implemented and accelerated depending on how effectively the transformative technologies can be transferred to the farmers and how innovatively we can harness the power of information technology to provide information, knowledge and skills. We have to bring in a major shift in Indian agriculture moving it from a low-productivity stage to a high productive level and at the same time ensure that it is sustainable and equitable.    Using a multi-disciplinary approach, you must take up problem-oriented research. You must strengthen the vital connection between your lab and the farmer’s land. Forecasting the seasonal conditions in advance, testing the soil and water availability you must work with the government’s extension machinery like Krishi Vignan Kendras to advise the farmers on the cropping patterns and post-harvest processes and food processing technologies. You will have to provide your expert advice on different ways to increase productivity of crops and livestock. You must learn from indigenous and global technologies. You must bring in the state of the art in the field to make different agricultural processes more efficient but always keeping the farmer invariably at the centre of your work. I am glad that the students in this University maintain the essential link with the ground realities and farmers’ lives through the six month long rural agricultural work experience programme. I am sure this gives an opportunity for the students to share their knowledge with the farmers and at the same time gain new insights from the farmers’ experiences and practices. It is, in my view, a valuable two- way learning process.

 

Dear friends, you are a part of the large knowledge network devoted to the same cause. We have a very large system with 63 State agricultural universities, 4 deemed Agricultural Universities, 1 Central Agricultural University, 106 ICAR research institutes, and 680 Krishi Vignana Kendras. I do hope all of you in this University would be able to continuously add to the body of scientific knowledge and use it creatively for the benefit of our ‘Anna Daata’ s. I hope you would take the fountain of knowledge to the farmers’ fields and become ‘Aananda Daataa’s as you see the tangible happy transformation on the face of modern India.

 

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the remarkable team work and output shown by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) over the years is a model for other departments and institutions. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the week long celebrations of World Space Week, in SHAR, Sriharikoga, Andhra Pradesh today. The Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan, the Chairman, ISRO, Shri Kiran Kumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that his heart swells with pride with India’s prowess in space technology as country marches ahead to conquer new frontiers in space exploration. It is a double delight to him to be here as this internationally-renowned rocket launching site is located in his native district of Nellore, he added.

 

The Vice President said that a thousand years ahead of Europeans, Indian savants knew that the zero and infinity were mutually inverse notions. He further said that with the launch of the first sounding rocket from Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS) in 1963 and the first Satellite, Aryabhata in 1975, India has made giant strides and has emerged today as one of the leading space faring nations in the leadership of visionaries like Prof. Vikram Sarabhai, Prof. Satish Dhawan and former President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 

The Vice President said that by putting 104 satellites into orbit in one go and placing the heaviest Indian satellite, GSAT-19 weighing 3,136 kg in its orbit earlier this year, India’s space scientists and technologists have not only done the country proud but made the world to sit up and take note of its accomplishments. It is not a question of mere technological advancement, but achieving launch after launch successfully at much lesser costs of similar missions in advanced countries which makes every Indian proud, he added.

 

The Vice President said that this space port on the spindle-shaped island is one of the busiest satellite launch centres in the world and catering to global needs by truly epitomising India’s philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. He further said that all the activities of ISRO have been centred on societal applications.  ISRO now stands as one of the most reputed and leading space agencies in the world and is a huge source of inspiration to students and young and upcoming scientists, he added.

 

The Vice President made a visit to the Vehicle Assembling Unit at the SHAR.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“ISRO Chairman, Shri Kiran Kumar, distinguished scientists, brothers and sisters!

 

As I step into this busy space port at Sriharikota, my heart swells with pride. It symbolises India’s prowess in space technology as the country marches ahead to conquer new frontiers in space exploration. It is a living monument to the efforts of scores of visionaries, thousands of engineers and scientists who made this possible; who dared to dream and shape that dream into reality.

 

In fact, it is a double delight to me to be here because this internationally-renowned rocket launching site is located in my native district of Nellore.

 

As I was coming here, I was just thinking how cosmology,   creation of universe, sun, moon, stars, galaxies and planets have fascinated man from times immemorial.

 

Indeed the concept of time and space, cosmology, creation of universe is not new to Indians. The celebrated astrophysicist Carl Sagan pointed out that Hinduism is the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology.” Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long. Longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang,” said Sagan. Many other scholars and savants from India and other countries studied the role of science in ancient India.

 

French historian of mathematics, Georges Ifrah, who is the author of the book, ‘Universal History of Numbers’ said: “ The Indian mind has always had for calculations and the handling of numbers an extraordinary inclination, ease and power, such as no other civilisation in history ever possessed to the same degree. So much so that Indian culture regarded the science of numbers as the noblest of its arts. A thousand years ahead of Europeans, Indian savants knew that the zero and infinity were mutually inverse notions”.

 

Since the baby steps with the launch of the first sounding rocket from Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS) in 1963 and the first Satellite, Aryabhata in 1975, India has made giant strides and has emerged today as one of the leading space faring nations, thanks to visionaries like Prof. Vikram Sarabhai, Prof. Satish Dhawan and former President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. By putting 104 satellites into orbit in one go and placing the heaviest Indian satellite, GSAT-19 weighing 3,136 kg in its orbit earlier this year, India’s space scientists and technologists have not only done the country proud but made the world to sit up and take note of its accomplishments. It is not a question of mere technological advancement, but achieving launch after launch successfully at much lesser costs of similar missions in advanced countries which makes every Indian proud. As many as 209 foreign satellites from 28 countries were launched in missions undertaken by ISRO. 

 

ISRO scientists have also achieved what others could not do—putting spacecraft in orbit around Mars in the very first attempt—a remarkable feat indeed! While mentioning about low cost, the one thing that comes to my mind, not only mine but of  every Indian, is the prestigious Mars Orbiter Mission which has taken India to the red planet at a much lower cost compared to other space agencies and that too in the maiden attempt, which is indeed a unique achievement. I appreciate the dedicated efforts put in by all of you in achieving the historic milestone. I am extremely happy that today you are having the men behind that mission, Shri A.S. Kiran Kumar, your Chairman and Shri P. Kunhikrishnan, your Director to lead you to greater heights and bring more and more laurels to the nation. Only some days ago, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) completed three years. 

 

Another proud achievement was the discovery of water on moon by Chandrayaan-1. 

 

Today, this space port on the spindle-shaped island is one of the busiest satellite launch centres in the world and catering to global needs by truly epitomising India’s philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. All the activities of ISRO have been centred around societal applications.  ISRO now stands as one of the most reputed and leading space agencies in the world and is a huge source of inspiration to students and young and upcoming scientists. 

 

From communication to weather forecasting to telemedicine and disaster warning, ISRO’s efforts have enabled our nation to achieve self-reliance in most of our communication and earth observation requirements and helped in enhancing the living standards of the people.  I am aware that  weather predictions by ISRO Satellites when cyclones like Phylon and Hudhud hit Odisha coast led to saving of many lives. ISRO’s contributions were also recorded with gratitude during the recent Vardhah cyclone for timely and accurate prediction. 

 

India was lucky that the country’s space programme took wings under the visionary leadership of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. In his autobiography, ‘Wings of Fire’, former President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam said: “I consider Prof. Sarabhai as the Mahatma Gandhi of Indian Science — generating leadership qualities in his team and inspiring them through both ideas and example”. I am glad his great vision is still being carried forward by all of you with India being second to none in using advanced technology for exploring new frontiers and to ultimately benefit the common man, which should be the basic objective of any science-related activity.  Some of you here must have also had the privilege of working with Dr. Kalam, who had worked with single-minded devotion for the success of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, SLV-3 and also with Prof. Satish Dhawan, among others— all of whom had contributed immensely with their management and leadership styles towards the rapid strides India achieved in the space sector.

 

Extending support to South Asian countries with the launch of a dedicated satellite, GSAT-9 by GSLV-F09, is another commendable achievement of ISRO.  I am happy that ISRO had a very successful mission of heavy lift launcher GSLV Mk3 in the first attempt itself. We are also in the elite club of nations having cryogenic and re-entry technologies. The remarkable team work and output shown by this organization over the years is a model for other departments and institutions. After showing to the world how excellence could be achieved at minimal costs, I am told that you are immediately planning your second mission to moon, including a lander and a rover for scientific experiments.  I also learnt that you have plans to reach the sun, like Adithya mission, and you are also developing technologies for Human Space programme. 

 

Before coming to this function, I visited the huge facilities being built at SHAR to meet the challenging demands of the future.. There, I could understand the dedicated and untiring efforts that went into the launch of three different launch vehicles in the shortest time span of two months. I wholeheartedly appreciate each one of you for that. At this juncture, I recollect my earlier visit to this place with Honourable Prime Minister, when Shri Kunhikrishnan explained the details of French satellite, SPOT-7 mission by our PSLV-C23 as the Project Director.  Now, when he is the Director, I could see that SHAR is undergoing a massive infrastructure development, under the guidance of Chairman, ISRO, to meet the future requirements. 

 

I am informed that once the second vehicle assembly building, which is three times bigger than the present one, is commissioned and augmentation of other facilities is completed, the number of launches per year can be more than doubled, leading to self-reliance in space launch. I once again laud all of you for your skills, knowledge, dedication and sincerity over the years for the various milestones achieved by ISRO.

 

I am told that various outreach programmes like quizzes and essay competitions, exhibition and arranging visits to school students are being organized during the World Space Week. Such programmes will increase the awareness on space-related activities among the youngsters and inspire them. I also appreciate the steps you are taking to reach out to every nook and corner of this state and the neighbouring states to encourage and attract young minds.

 

Today, I am happy to be with you in Sriharikota for the inaugural function of this week long celebration of World Space Week. I am also happy to have the presence of Shri Kiran Kumar, Chairman, ISRO who is leading this great organisation to laudable heights. My best wishes for the success of all your future endeavours.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that linkage of rivers will help farmers of the country to grow more crops and increase their earnings which in turn will contribute towards the progress of the nation. He was speaking at an event to present 13th Dr. I.V. Subbarao Rythu Nestham Awards 2017, in Atkur, Andhra Pradesh today. The Agriculture Minister of Telangana, Shri Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, the Agriculture Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy, the Health Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri K. Srinivas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the governments have been considering inter-linking of rivers for decades, but because of certain hurdles the plan did not get materialised. He further said that by making small dams, Gujarat has shown how to preserve rainwater that reaches the farms. He suggested that the Center and the States should come out with a comprehensive policy on making agriculture a viable activity. States should work on farmer centric initiatives to increase farm income from agriculture, he added.

The Vice President expressed his concern over the agriculture that may soon become extinct as the farmers are averse to undertake farming due to losses, and he suggested that the Government should make agriculture viable to the farmers by providing basic infrastructure facilities. Though the Swaminathan Committee had suggested some recommendations on how to make agriculture viable, only a few recommendations were implemented so far, he added.

The Vice President said that there is a need for providing rural infrastructure facilities like road linkage, transportation etc., so that the farmers to get better market price for their products. Government’s recent initiative, National Agriculture Market (NAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC markets to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. E-markets to facilitate farmers to buy and sell their produce, he added.

The Vice President said that as part of measures undertaken to boost the agricultural sector, the Centre gave top priority to this sector. He further said that, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has introduced rural road network and electrification schemes. Likewise the Centre also took path breaking initiatives to enhance expenditure in farm and rural sectors, he added.

The Vice President said that the rural electrification under Deen Dayal Upadhyaa Gram Jyoti Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sanchi Yojana for water conservation and its management and insurance cover to farmers under Pradhan Mandtri Fasal Bima Yojana are some of the other initiatives of the centre for agriculture sector. He called upon the scientists to come out with innovative ideas to make agriculture a viable sector.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Bhagwan Rama was an embodiment of our culture. He was addressing the gathering at the Rajtilak Dussehra Day Celebrations, here today. 

The Vice President said that Bhagwan Ram was an ideal man, an ideal human being, ideal ruler, ideal father, ideal son, whatever his father has said, he has followed it, and that is why Rama is always respected, adored, admired. 

The Vice President said that after independence, Mahatma Gandhi wanted Ramarajya in India. Ramarajya means an ideal rule, where there is no fear, where there is no huger, where there is no corruption, where there is no exploitation, where there is no discrimination. He further said that it is our duty at various levels and we must all work for the ideals of Ramarajya, given to the expectations of Mahatma Gandhi, and see to it that the people are given a fair rule we all concerned. That is why politicians always talk about Ramarajya, he added. 

The Vice President said that Rama is our identity, our heritage. He further said that he was happy that the Nava Shri Dharmiak Leela Committee is regularly organizing Ramleela in order to remind the people about the great Rama, the great deeds he has done, the great example he has set before the country. 

The Vice President said that the Dharmiak Leela Committee is regularly organizing this on regular basis where to felicitate the people to come and see the experience of the Ramleela. He further said that Vijaya Dashmi is a victory of truth over untruth, victory of fairness over unfairness, victory of satya over asatya, that is the concept of Ramleela. The demon is disturbing the human kind that is why the Ravana vadha is taken place. Keeping this in our mind all of us in our life should embody the satya, that identity set by our great people, we must stand for honesty, we must also stand for fairness. We must all work towards real Ramarajya, where there is no hunger, where there is no corruption, where there no exploitation, where there is no discrimination, on the basis of religion. 

The Vice President urged upon every one that we must let the younger generation learn about Ram, Ramarajya, and take them on a fair path. Ramleela Tilak Dharan Celebration is very encouraging to everyone, and will take towards the Ramarajya, he added. 

He thanked the Nava Shri Dharmiak Leela Committee for inviting me to this important event. He congratulate the committee for organizing such an important event.

Victory to Mother India!

 Let Sardar Sahib be immortal!

 

The young loved ones of Maha Bharati who have come here in large numbers,

Today is 31st of October, the birthday of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. 31st October is also commemorated as the death anniversary of former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji. On the birth anniversary of the great Sardar Sahib, let us recall the efforts and the struggles of his life for the freedom of the country. After independence, this great man through his skill, struggles, strength and supreme devotion towards the nation had saved the country on several occasions of crises at a time when the country was on the verge of disintegration. He had not only steered the country out of problems at the time of Independence but also contributed significantly to consolidate the small princely kingdoms that wanted to secede from India after the British had left. He did not let the intensions of the British to eliminate the existence of India by dividing her into small states to succeed. This was the long term vision of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel that integrated the country into a single thread by using his diplomacy and strategies. No efforts were made to acquaint the new generation with Sardar vallabh Bhai Patel. Attempts have been made either to erase his name from the pages of history or to undermine his role. But history is witness to the fact that whether some political ideology or a political party gives him recognition or not, the young generation doesn't want to forget him. As a result, when the opportunity to serve came before us we commemorated the contributions made by that great personality in a special manner and will continue with it in every generation. Therefore, we have come up with this campaign - Run for Unity.  I am glad that the young generation is participating in Run for Unity with great enthusiasm.

 Once the country's first President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, had said something which had compelled us to think. He had said -""Today, we have the name 'India' to refer to as our country. Today we have a country called 'India'. This was made possible only because of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's statesmanship and tremendous hold on the administration."" He had further said, ""Despite this, we have forgotten Sardar Sahib."" The first President of India had expressed this pain over forgetting Sardar Sahib's contributions. 

India is a nation full of diversities. We have time and again reiterated that the unique feature of our country is unity in diversity. This has been our mantra. But unless we acknowledge this speciality of our country and feel proud of it, this will remain just a slogan. We would not be able to use it for nation building. Every Indian can feel proud of the fact that India has embraced every cult of the world, every tradition and every ideology in some or the other form. It has a variety of dialects, dressing styles, food habits and beliefs. Despite this diversity we have learnt from our traditions to be united for the country for its welfare. Today, even the people from the same traditions and cultural backgrounds are intolerant towards one another and can even kill one another. In the 21st century some people are propagating violence in the world just to place one's beliefs as superior to the others'. On these occasions India can proudly say that we are that country, we are the Indians who respect every belief, tradition and culture of the world. This is our legacy and strength. This is our path of a bright future. This is our responsibility. No one can underestimate the love of a brother and a sister. For the brother and the sister to sacrifice for each other is a natural tendency. Yet, in order to preserve the sanctity of this ritual, we celebrate Raksha-Bandhan. We try to enhance the relationship of the brother and the sister every year. Similarly, despite the country's unity it is necessary to reinforce the nation's cultural heritage. It is necessary to recall the Mantra of Unity again and again. It is essential to remember the pledge for the unity of the country again and again.

The country is vast. Generations keep changing. Not every incident of history is known. Therefore, it is necessary to echo the mantra of unity and search for the path to unity in a country with so much diversity. Our country should remain one and united. It's the responsibility of 125 crore Indians to secure the unity and integrity of the country given to us by Sardar Sahib. Therefore we should think about Sardar Patel by reminding ourselves of his contribution to the country's unity. Every generation should know the way he had integrated the country. Today, on 31st October, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahib. Eight years later we will be celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Sahib. What new example of Unity shall we set on the completion of 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Sahib? How can we promote this feeling of Unity within the people? We will have to move ahead with these resolutions. 

 The year 2022 will mark 75 years of independence. Innumerable patriots such as Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel had lived and died for the country. By the year 2022 when 75 years of independence will be completed we should take a resolution in our hearts as well as try to fulfil that resolution. Every Indian should have a resolution. Every Indian should make great efforts to fulfil those resolutions. That resolution should be for the welfare of the society, of the country and for enhancing the country's pride. We should associate ourselves with such a resolution. I believe that the need of the hour is to take a resolution today on the birth anniversary of the great freedom fighter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for the year 2022.

You all have come in large numbers and got involved with this event enthusiastically. All the youngsters across the country also are associated with it. I urge you all to take an oath on Rashtriya Ekta Diwas. Remembering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, let us take an oath which I am presenting before you and you will repeat after me with a resolution inside your minds. You will repeat after me by putting forward your right hand: “I solemnly affirm that I will dedicate myself to maintain the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country and will also put all my efforts to spread this message among my countrymen. I take this pledge in the spirit of unity of my country which could be made possible by the foresightedness and the contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. I sincerely take the pledge to make my contribution to ensure the internal security of my country.”

 

Victory to Mother India!

 Victory to Mother India!

 Victory to Mother India!

 

Thanks a lot!

                भारत माता की जय 

सरदार साहब अमर रहें, अमर रहें 

विशाल संख्‍या में पधारे हुए महाभारती के प्‍यारे लाडले सभी युवा साथी आज 31 अक्‍टूबर सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई की जन्‍म जयन्‍ती है। आज 31 अक्‍टूबर भारत की पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री श्रीमति इंदिरा जी की पुण्‍य तिथि भी है। आज पूरे देश में सरदार साहब की जन्‍म जयन्‍ती को स्‍मरण करते हुए उस महापुरूष ने देश की आजादी के लिए जिस प्रकार से अपना जीवन खपा दिया। उस महापुरूष ने देश के आजादी के बाद की संकट की घड़ियों से, बिखराव के वातावरण से, आंतरिक संघर्ष की चरम सीमा के बीच अपने कौशल्‍य के द्वारा, अपनी दृढ़ शक्ति के द्वारा, अपनी सर्वोत्र भारत भक्ति के द्वारा उन्‍होंने देश को न सिर्फ आजादी के समय पैदा हुए संकटों से बचाया बल्कि उन्‍होंने सैंकड़ों राजे-रजवाड़े जो अंग्रेजों का इरादा था‍ कि अंग्रेज जाने के बाद ये देश बिखर जाए। छोटी-छोटी रियासतों में बंट जाए। भारत का नामो-निशान न रहे, ये सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल का संकल्‍प बलखा। ये सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल की दीर्घ दृष्टि थी कि उन्‍होंने साम, दाम, दंड भेद हर प्रकार की नीति, कूटनीति, रणनीति उसका उपयोग करते हुए बहुत ही कम समय में देश को एकता के सूत्र में बाँध दिया। सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल शायद हमारे देश की नई पीढ़ी को उनसे परिचित ही नहीं करवाया गया| एक प्रकार से इतिहास के झरोखे से इस महापुरूष के नाम को या तो मिटा देने का प्रयास हुआ या तो उसको छोटा करने का प्रयास हुआ था। लेकिन इतिहास गवाह है कि सरदार साहब, सरदार साहब थे कोई शासन उनको स्‍वीकृति दे या न दे, कोई राजनीतिक दल उनके महात्‍मय को स्‍वीकार करे या न करे लेकिन यह देश इस देश की युवा पीढ़ी भी एक पल के लिए भी सरदार साहब को भूलने के लिए तैयार नहीं है, इतिहास से ओझल होने देने के लिए तैयार नहीं है और इसी का परिणाम है कि जब देश ने हमें सेवा करने का मौका दिया तो हमने देश के सामने सरदार पटेल की जयन्‍ती को एक विशेष रूप से मना करके उस महापुरूष के उस उत्‍तम कार्यों का पीढ़ी दर पीढ़ी तक स्‍मरण रहे और इसीलिए Run for Unity एकता के लिए दौड़ उस अभियान को हम चला रहे हैं और मुझे खुशी है कि देश की युवा पीढ़ी बढ़ चढ़ करके एकता की इस दौड़ में हिस्‍सा ले रही है। 

एक बार हमारे देश के प्रथम राष्‍ट्रपति डॉक्‍टर राजेन्‍द्र बाबू ने कहा था और उनके शब्‍द हम सबको सोचने के लिए मजबूर करते हैं। देश के प्रथम राष्‍ट्रपति राजेन्‍द्र बाबू ने कहा था आज सोचने और बोलने के लिए हमे भारत का नाम, भारत नाम का देश उपलब्‍ध है... यह सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल की statesmanship और प्रशासन पर उनकी जबरदस्‍त पकड़ के कारण संभव हो पाया है और आगे कहा है कि और ऐसा होने के बावजूद हम बहुत ही जल्‍द सरदार साहब को भूल बैठे हैं। राजेन्‍द्र बाबू भारत के प्रथम राष्‍ट्रपति ने सरदार साहब को भुला देने के संबंध में ये पीड़ा व्‍यक्‍त की थी। आज सरदार साहब की 31 अक्‍टूबर को एकता की दौड़ के साथ जन्‍म जयन्‍ती मना रहे है तब राजेन्‍द्र बाबू की आत्‍मा जहां भी होगी उनको जरूर संतोष होता होगा कि भले कुछ लोगों ने सरदार साहब को भुलाने का भरसक प्रयास किया होगा लेकिन सरदार साहब इस देश की आत्‍मा में विराजमान हैं। वो फिर से एक बार हमारे सामने इन युवा संकल्‍प के साथ फिर से उभर करके आए हैं और हमें नई प्ररेणा दे रहे हैं। 

भारत विविधताओं से भरा हुआ देश है विविधता में एकता हमारे देश की विशेषता ये मंत्र हम बोलते आएं हैं, गूंजता रहता है लेकिन जब तक उस विविधता को हम सम्‍मान नहीं देंगे। हमारी विविधता के प्रति गर्व नहीं करेंगे हमारी विविधता में एकता के सामर्थ्‍य के साथ हम अपने आपको आत्‍मिक रूप से जोड़गे नहीं तो विविधता शायद शब्‍दों में हमें काम आएगी। लेकिन राष्‍ट्र के भव्‍य निर्माण के लिए हम उसका उतना उपयोग नहीं कर पाएगें। हर भारतवासी इस बात के लिए गर्व कर सकता है कि विश्‍व की और हम ये बड़े नाज के साथ कह सकते है विश्‍व की हर पंथ, हर परंपरा हर आचार-विचार उसको किसी न किसी रूप में ये भारत अपने में समेटे हुए हैं। बोलियां अनेक है, पहनावा अनेक है, खानपान के तरीके अनेक हैं, मान्‍यताएं भिन्‍न हैं दृढ़ हैं उसके बावजूद भी देश के लिए एक रहना देश के लिए नेक रहना ये हमने हमारी सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत से सीखा है। आज दुनिया में एक ही पंथ और परंपरा से पले बढ़े लोग भी एक-दूसरे को जिंदा देखने को तैयार नहीं है। एक-दूसरे को मौत के घाट उतारने के लिए तुले हुए हैं। दुनिया को हिंसा की गर्त में डुबोकर के अपनी मान्‍यताओं का प्रभाव बढ़ाने में आज 21वीं सदी में कुछ मानव लगे हुए हैं। ऐसे समय हिन्‍दुस्‍तान गर्व के साथ कह सकता है। कि हम वो देश हैं, हम वो हिन्‍दुस्‍तानवासी हैं जो दुनिया की हर मान्‍यताओं को, परंपराओं को, पथ को अपने भीतर समेट करके एकता के सूत्र में बंधे हुए हैं। ये हमारी विरासत है, ये हमारी ताकत है। ये हमारे उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य का मार्ग है और हम लोगों का दायित्‍व बनता है भाई और बहन के प्‍यार को कोई कम नहीं आंकता है। भाई और बहन के लिए एक-दूसरे के लिए त्‍याग करना ये सहज प्रकृति प्रवृत्ति होती है उसके बावजूद भी उस संस्‍कार सरिता को बढ़ाने के लिए हम रक्षा-बंधन का पर्व मनाते हैं। भाई और बहन के रिश्‍तों को हर वर्ष संस्‍कारित करने का प्रयास करते हैं। वैसे ही देश की एकता देश की सांस्‍कृतिक विरासत ये सामर्थ्‍यवान होने के बावजूद भी हर बार हमें उसको पुन: संस्‍कारित करना जरूरी होता है। बार-बार एकता के मंत्र को याद करना आवश्‍यक होता है। बार-बार एकता के लिए जीने का संकल्‍प जरूरी होता है। 

देश विशाल है, पीढियां बदलती रहती हैं। इतिहास की हर घटना का पता नहीं होता है। तब भारत जैसे विविधता भरे जैसे देश में हर पल एकता की मंत्र को गूंजते रखना, हर पल एकता के रास्‍ते खोजते रहना, हर पल एकता को मजबूत करने के तरीकों से जुड़ते रहना ये भारत जैसे देश के लिए अनिवार्य है। हमारा देश एक रहे, अखंड रहे ...सरदार साहब ने हमें जो देश दिया है, उसकी एकता और अखंडता सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का दायित्‍व है। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की जिम्‍मेवारी है और इसलिए सरदार पटेल को हम उनका पुण्‍य स्‍मरण देश की एकता के लिए उन्‍होंने जो भगीरथ कार्य किया है। उसके साथ जोड़ करके करना चाहिए। कैसे उन्होंने देश को एक किया। हर पीढ़ी को पता होना चाहिए और उसी बात को लेकर के आज 31 अक्‍टूबर सरदार साहब की जन्‍म जयन्‍ती हम मना रहे हैं। आठ साल के बाद सरदार साहब की जयन्‍ती के 150 साल होंगे। जब सरदार साहब की जयन्‍ती के 150 साल होंगे तब हम देश को एकता की वो कौन सी नई मिसाल देंगे। जन-जन के भीतर एकता के इस भाव को किस प्रकार से प्रबल करेंगे। उन संकल्‍पों को लेकर के हमें चलना होगा। 

2022 आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं। भगत सिंह, सुखदेव, राजगुरू, नेता जी सुभाष चंद्र बोस, महात्‍मा गांधी, सरदार पटेल अनगिनत देशभक्‍त, अनगिनत लक्षावधि देशभक्‍त, देश के लिए जीए, देश के लिए मरे। 2022 आजादी के 75 साल हो हम भी एक संकल्‍प को हृदय में तय करे उस संकल्‍प को सिद्ध करने के लिए हम जुट जाएं। हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी का कोई संकल्‍प होना चाहिए। हर हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी को संकल्‍प को साकार करने के‍ लिए भरसक प्रयास करना चाहिए। और वो संकल्‍प जो समाज की भलाई के लिए है। वो संकल्‍प जो देश के कल्‍याण के लिए है। वो संकल्‍प जो देश की गरिमा को ऊपर करने वाला हो। उस प्रकार के संकल्‍प से हम अपने आप को जोड़े आज भारत की आजादी के वीर सुपुत्र सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल की जन्‍म जयन्‍ती पर 2022 के लिए भी हम संकल्‍प करें ये मैं समझता हूं समय की मांग है। 

आप इतनी बड़ी विशाल संख्‍या में आए। उमंग और उत्‍साह के साथ इसमें शरीक हुए। देश भर में भी नौजवान जुड़े हुए हैं। मैं आप सबको राष्‍ट्रीय एकता दिवस पर शपथ के लिए निमंत्रित करता हूं। हम सब सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल का पुण्‍य स्‍मरण करते हुए, मैं जो शपथ आपके सामने प्रस्‍तुत करता हूं आप उसको दोहराएंगे और सिर्फ वाणी से नहीं मन में संकल्‍प धारण करेंगे। इस भाव के साथ उसको दोहराएंगे आप सब अपना दाहिना हाथ आगे करके मेरी इस बात को दोहराएंगे। मैं सत्‍य निष्‍ठा से शपथ लेता हूं कि मैं राष्‍ट्र की एकता अखंडता और सुरक्षा को बनाए रखने के लिए स्‍वंय को समर्पित करूंगा और अपने देशवासियों के बीच यह संदेश फैलाने का भी भरसक प्रयत्‍न करूंगा। मैं यह शपथ अपने देश की एकता की भावना से ले रहा हूं। जिसे सरदार वल्‍लभ भाई पटेल की दूरदर्शिता एवं कार्यों द्वारा संभव बनाया जा सका। मैं अपने देश की आंतरिक सुरक्षा सुनिश्चित करने के लिए अपना योगदान करने का भी सत्‍य निष्‍ठा से संकल्‍प करता हूं। 

भारत माता की जय

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. The mega festival of Chatth, celebrated 6 days after Diwali, is one of those festivals which are celebrated in accordance with strict rituals & regimen. In everything associated with it like cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to. The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature & worshiping nature. Surya & Jal –The Sun & Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo & clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles. In this mega festival of faith, veneration of the rising sun and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with unparalleled Sanskar. The world respects & venerates those who rise; the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect & revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent. The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival. Before the advent of Chatth, people come together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with utmost enthusiasm & fervour. Sun worship or Chhath Pooja is a festival of protecting the environment, ushering in wellness and discipline. 

Usually, people shy away from borrowing from others. But in Chhath Pooja, it is specially customary to ask for Prasad after the morning Arghya ritual. It is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that, it destroys his ego that proves to be an impediment in one’s path of progress. It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India. 

My dear countrymen, ‘Mann - Ki - Baat’ has garnered accolades; it has also attracted criticism. But whenever I look at the overall outcome of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp & weft of our common citizens’ lives, cent per cent. Take the examples of Khadi and handloom. On Gandhi Jayanti I have always advocated the use of handloom and Khadi. What has it led to? You will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs. You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi & Handloom store. During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise. Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi & Handicrafts have risen almost by 90%. One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi & handloom. 

I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this. Khadi was Khadi foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation. Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them. It is playing a very important role for gramodaya. 

Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali. Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces. We also remember our brave security forces. We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our country’s soldiers. All of you must have celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour. To me, Diwali brought a special experience. Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel. Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu & Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart. On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the country’s borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds. Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour. Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over. As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations. United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October. 

Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world. And, we are believers in “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam” which means the whole world is our family. And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN. You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter; both start with the words ‘We the people’. India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this. 

In its initial phrase, it was proposed as ‘all men are born free and equal’ which was amended and adopted as ‘all human beings are born free and equal’ with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta. It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought. India’s most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations. India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions. 

Many of you may be getting to know this for the first time. More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations. Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country. Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over. These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world. In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved. 

Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations. Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts. Very few people may know that India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia for the United Nations Peace Mission. And see how this initiative from India became a big source of motivation for other countries too. Later, all countries started sending their women police units. You will surely feel proud to know that India’s contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries. The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world. Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task. Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas. They have to live amongst many different people. They need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures. They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment. While remembering our brave UN Peacekeepers today, who can forget the sacrifice of Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria who laid down his life while fighting in Congo in Africa? 

Every Indian feels proud while remembering him. He was the only UN peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra. Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus. In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country. General Thimaiyya, who had been India’s army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts. India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world. We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow. 

My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity. Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person. She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA. And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated. She later proved herself true to her name. Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita. 

She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor. Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule. The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well. Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on. Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture. She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening. She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology. Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment. 

It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration. Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu. She helped publication of Basu’s research and publicity through her articles and conferences. 

This is India’s unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture. 

Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this. In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time. Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads. She was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor. Getting inspiration from her sacrifice, people came forward and joined her. 

Through her work, she spread the message of the importance of cleanliness and service to mankind. And, it is inscribed on her grave – “Here reposes Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India”. Undoubtedly, she did so. There cannot be any other befitting tribute to this great soul than every Indian taking a lesson from her life and emulating her. 

Thank you for your phone call. First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji. Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India. Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have started to appear in children nowadays. It is indeed surprising today, when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes. 

In earlier times, such diseases were known as 'Raj-Rog' which means diseases that used to afflict only the rich or those who lived a life of luxury. Such diseases were very rare in young people. But our lifestyle has changed. Today these diseases are known as ‘lifestyle disorders.’ One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits. 

Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis. If you’ll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary. You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life. I would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds. If possible, we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them. 

The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift. After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children. Yoga for Young India. Yoga will be helpful for especially our young friends, in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders. The practice of Yoga 30 minutes before school can impart much benefit. It can also be practised at home and the specialty of Yoga is that it is easy, simple and accessible to all. I am saying this because a person of any age can easily practise it. It is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere. 

No special tools or fields are needed. There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes. These studies are being carried out in AIIMS too and the results that have emerged so far are very encouraging. Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only; instead of this we should make them a part of our life. 

My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports. In different games, our athletes have made the country proud. In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance. Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years. India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007. I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff. 

After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton. Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indian’s heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance. After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title. I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India. 

Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month. Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field. I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match. There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators. This world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you. Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and zeal of all the young players. The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best. 

Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone. The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers. The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear. I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again. 

My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about ‘Swachch Bharat’, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program ‘Mann Ki Baat’ every day and every day ‘Mann Ki Baat’ will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness. Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts. Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an official’s zeal. 

A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra. An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort. In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue and with team-work. Just think Two-hundred-days of continuous labour! They sent me photographs with a caption- ‘Before and After’! I was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I have to tell such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization, in these living pictures. 

Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope. This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum. Forts are symbols of our heritage. And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean. I congratulate Ecological Protection Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur. 

My dear countrymen, we’ll celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November. Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs; he’s guru to the entire world. He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and considered all castes to be equal. He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women. Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity. He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice & dedication. He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour. He ran a LANGAR which sowed the seeds of the spirit of service amongst fellow beings. Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity & oneness in people. Guru Nanak Dev ji voiced three messages for a meaningful, fulfilling life- Chant the name of the Almighty, work hard and help the needy. In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani. Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji. Come, let us try & advance on the path of his ideals & teachings. 

My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of October. All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India. We can learn a lot from the unparalleled saga of this great son of Mother India. The 31st of October was also the day on which Smt. Indira Gandhi left this world. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s speciality was that he not only put forth revolutionary ideas; he was immensely capable of devising practical solutions to the most complicated problems in the way. Translating a thought into reality was his forte’. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India. He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation & one constitution. His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles. Wherever respectful coercion was needed, he proceeded gently. Wherever the use of force was imperative, he did not hesitate. He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit & determination. It was only he who could achieve this task of uniting India. He conceived a nation where everyone was equal. One ideal of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us. He had said “No division of caste or creed should be able to stop us, all are the sons & daughters of India, all of us should love our country and we should carve out our destiny on the foundation of mutual love & harmony. 

These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today. And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day. His contribution in giving a unified texture to the nation is without parallel. On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahab, Run for Unity will be organized throughout the country, which will see the participation of children, youth, women, in fact people of all age groups. I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony. 

My dear countrymen, you must’ve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination. May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you. 

Many many Thanks.

                All the eminent personalities, ladies and gentlemen associated with Vedanta Bharati,

It is an old belief that whenever a Mantra is chanted together in a single voice at a place, a powerful energy is produced which engulfs the mind, the body and the soul. Nad-Brahma has been accepted in that very context. Even modern science does not deny the power of enchantment of the mantras. Today I can feel the same energy by these wonderful mantras of Dakshinamurthy and Soundarya Lahari in this environment. This divine sensation comprises of not only the nectar but also a mystery and an indomitable desire to unify with God.

Every Mantra of Soundarya Lahari reflects a different power and a different feeling. That spirit and power is filling us with the new consciousness, new energy in this moment. I am fortunate that I am a person who has been associated with Navratri for years and Soundarya Lahari is a part of my Navratri celebrations.

Bowing down to the supreme Sri Sri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji, I wish to express my gratitude to Vedanta Bharati. They invited me to join the programme and give this opportunity to spend some quality time here. I am fortunate to have got this opportunity to experience the lessons of Soundarya Lahari under Shri Shri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji. With the blessings of Swamiji Soundarya Lahari has completed 10 years.

Congratulations to all of you and best wishes from my side. I believe that you are lucky that you have become a part of this sacred task. Brothers and sisters, about 8 to 10 days ago I had gone to Kedarnath. The gates of the temple were about to be closed. I was fortunate that I had the opportunity to pay obeisant to Mahadev ji. Whenever I go to Kedarnath, a question arises in my mind continuously. How did Adi Shankaracharya ji reached this inaccessible place thousands of years ago? 

Even in this period of modern technology, it is not so easy to go there. How would have Adi Shankara gone there thousands of years ago? Which is that eternal energy and power that motivated Shankaracharya to traverse through the entire country thrice and to establish the 4 Maths in the four corners of the country at the young age of 32? He made a great effort to culturally integrate India like a garland.

Adi Shankaracharya ji dedicated his life to strengthen our spiritual traditions. Adi Shankaracharya ji analysed very minutely all the wrongs that had crept in our traditions and at that age he had showed courage to criticize the evils within us. By putting forward right arguments, he made every effort to prevent the future generations from deviating to a wrong path. He had stressed the importance of the tradition of worshipping Shiva-Shakti-Vishnu-Ganapati and Kumar together. He re-established the Indian tradition once again. Adi Shankaracharya ji integrated the whole of India with the knowledge of the Vedas and Upanishads and connected it with the feeling of unity. He made the scriptures as the medium. He assimilated all the good things of different faiths and philosophies and motivated the people to follow the path of knowledge and devotion. He created Soundarya Lahari for the future generations. It turned out to be an institution with which every common man of the country could associate himself. In Soundarya Lahari it was ensured that no distinction between the different forms of God was made while propitiating the God.

""Ekam sadvipra bahudha vadanti""

The blessings obtained from Soundarya Lahari are also showered on everyone without any discrimination. It is believed that by chanting the text of Soundarya Lahari one can obtain knowledge, wealth, health and everything. The penance by Adi Shankaracharya is still present in the same form in the Indian culture - the culture which assimilates everything and unites everyone. This culture is also the basis for a new India; a culture that believes in the Mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'(development of all).

Brothers and sisters, Shri Shankar Bharati Mahaswamiji has dedicated his life to spread the message of Adi Shankaracharya to the people. Considering the entire world as a family, Adi Shankaracharya's message of 'ekatma bhav' has been reaching to the people through Vedanta Bharati. They are associated with Vedas and Upanishads in different languages and with several publications and books. And they are continuing with this trend.

Friends, the more the people read about the spiritual glory and the ancient messages of India, the more the world will get benefited out of it. The mankind which is confused is passing through a crisis such as the fight over presenting oneself as superior than the others or the fight over the path to attain salvation. Adi Shankaracharya gave the principle of Advaita or Oneness, where there is no existence of Dvaita. There is no possibility of conflict where there is no dualism. In different parts of the world whenever there is an obstruction in the path of life the countries set their eyes on India. In this way, all the problems of the world can be resolved by our traditions. We have inherited these traditions in our life.

 

ॐ सह नाववतु । सह नौ भुनक्तु । 

सह वीर्यं करवावहै । तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै । 

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Let everyone be nurtured and let everyone be strengthened. We never say that let 'me' be nurtured or let 'me' be powerful. In the temples we pray that everyone should be nurtured and be strengthened. This is our tradition. No one should be jealous of the other.

Today on this occasion I want to mention a special event of Vedanta Bharati which is Vivekadipani and 'Vivek utkarshani contest'. Very few people would know that efforts were made to weaken this interaction with Adi Shankaracharya, our spiritual traditions and culture. Attempts were made to destroy it but no one could end this legacy for thousands of years. It is said--

 

दीन-ए-इलाही का बेबाक बेड़ा, 

नक्शा जिसका अक्स-ए-आलम में पहुंचा। 

किए पांच सौ पार सातों समुंद्र, 

न अमन में ठिठका न कोई गुलजाम में झिझका। 

वो डूबा दोहाब-ए में गंगा के अंदर।। 

However, the long years of slavery had impacted our spiritual knowledge which today is largely confined to books. It is safe only with some priests. The kind of effort that should have been made after independence was not made. If today's young man is reading everything from his mobile phone then how will he get to know about the traditional knowledge hidden in the books? Who will let him know about this great heritage? So, telling the school students about our Indian culture and values through the programme Vivekadipani and through quiz competition is a great initiative by Swamiji. This is a great service even for the future generations.

The ultimate goal for any person in Indian philosophy is to attain liberation. The philosophies of the Vedas and Upanishads believe that 'vyakti' or individual, 'samasti' or society and 'srishthi' or universe or creation and 'parmeshti' or ‘God’ all are interconnected. We do not see them in isolation but in an integrated whole. This philosophy recognises the planet as 'mother earth'. It says that Earth belongs to all and Earth is our mother. This philosophy gave birth to ' vasudhaiva-kutumbakam'. 

Similarly, Soundarya Lahari also has a Mantra-""“फल: अपिवान्छा समाधिकम” which means the earth provides us more than what we demand. Such a great truth is reflected in this simple word. We all have enough water, air, river, grains, minerals, plantations, everything from the nature. It is essential to conserve this boon.

This very idea is our tradition. It emphasizes not to exploit the nature but to use the resources in a balanced manner from the nature. Exploitation of nature is considered as a crime here. Only 'Milking of nature' is the human right. Our tradition has taught us this. You have always seen this in our governance and administration.

Brothers and sisters, India is a country that has been persistently striving for justice, dignity, opportunity and prosperity not only for herself but also for the entire world. You must be aware that International Solar Alliance was launched last year. The government is constantly trying to promote solar energy both nationally and internationally. Even today, in the plans of the centre, you will get a glimpse of this desire of protecting the nature. The kind of work that is going on in the fields of solar power, wind power and hydropower was never seen before. 

The world's largest renewable capacity expansion programme is going on in this country – the country of Soundarya Lahari.

The government is aiming at achieving 40% of its energy needs by non-fossil fuel based renewable energy by the year 2030. By the year 2022 when India will be celebrating 75 years of independence, the government aims to achieve 175 Gigawatts... I am not talking about Megawatt. Megawatt is a matter of past. Today we are talking about Gigawatts; Gigawatt - for the production of renewable energy. Due to the government's efforts more than 22000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity has been increased and integrated with the power grid in the past 3 years. The previous government could add only 12000 megawatts to the renewable energy capacity in the last 3 years of its tenure while it had spent Rs .4000 crores on the renewable energy in last 3 years of its tenure. After coming to power we have spent approximately 11000 crore rupees in this sector within 3 years. 

At present our country has the electricity generation capacity of about 300 GW. It includes the electricity generation from all types of sources like coal, water, solar and wind energy. You will be surprised to know that if the resources available in the country are fully utilised, then 750 GW of electricity can be generated only by solar power. We should utilise our potential effectively.

Ceaseless efforts are being made by the government in this direction. For this, solar parks are being set up across the country; building bye laws have been changed in order to promote rooftop solar programme, loans are being provided at low interest rates for installing solar plants in government buildings; solar plants have been given infrastructure status and long term loans are being provided for these. Bengaluru is in a way the land of start-ups. The youngsters here are associated with innovation and inventions. I want to invite the youngsters of Bengaluru who are associated with start-ups. Come let us begin a movement for clean cooking. How can we make a cheap and affordable cooking stove by using solar energy? The old models of solar cookers are not suitable for the modern families. They want a gas-like oven. Even this is possible today. There's a huge market in this field for today's youngsters and start-ups. Clean cooking will prove to be a boon for old mothers. The forest dwellers will not have to deforest in order to get firewood for fuel. They can cook their food by using solar energy. This will also save time in cooking food for their children. We should strive towards those innovations that will benefit the country. You will see the level of impact on the society the day when all the institutions of the country will be able to fulfil their energy needs themselves.

Friends, I want to demonstrate the fact as to how a new approach is saving the country’s money and also protecting the environment. Brothers and sisters, the LED bulb which earlier used to cost Rs. 350 now costs only Rs. 40-45 under the new UJALA scheme. Till date more than 27 crore LED bulbs have been distributed throughout the country by our government. In Karnataka as well approximately 1.75 crore bulbs have been distributed. Even if we consider savings of Rs. 250 per bulb then the country's middle class has saved approximately 7000 crore rupees. Moreover, these bulbs are saving electricity bill in every household. Whoever has LED bulbs in his home will surely see a reduction in his electricity bill. Therefore, the use of energy has also declined. The middle class families have saved approximately 14000 crore rupees in one year. Naturally, the use of LEDs has reduced the consumption of electricity. This means that 7000 MW less energy is required in the installed capacity. If a 7000MW plant was installed, then that would have cost of at least 35 to 40 thousand crore rupees. By saving electricity, we could save the country 35- 40 thousand crore rupees. This was achieved only by changing the approach of working through a plan. The money that was saved by the middle class by purchasing LED bulbs and by reduction in electricity consumption amounts to approximately 55 to 60 thousand crore rupees. The middle class families have benefited.

Because of the government’s efforts, now the local bodies that are replacing the street lights with LED bulbs are also benefiting financially. I am the MP of Banaras and I helped Banaras save approximately 15 crore Rupees which is being utilised for other schemes. It is estimated that a Tier-II city is able to save approximately 10 to 15 crore Rupees. 

These funds are now being spent in the development of the city. With the efforts of the government there is a possibility of saving the expenditure incurred on the import of petrol and diesel from abroad. 

Brothers and sisters, petrol and diesel have no future. These natural resources will exhaust one day. The future belongs to solar energy, wind energy and of hydro energy. We can do it easily in our country because we are the people who believe in preserving nature and worshipping nature. Sacrificing our lives for protecting the trees has been inherent in our tradition. We pray even for breaking the branch of a tree. We have been taught to be kind and affectionate towards the living beings since our childhood. Every day after the Aarti we chant the shanti mantra-“वनस्पतय: शांति आप: शांति” (Vanaspatayaha shanti aapaha shanti)

But this is true that this tradition has been marred over the years. Today the Saints have to increase their efforts in this regard. Only if we are able to bring the texts, that have been our traditions, into practice we will be able to fight the challenge of climate change. Our entire Rig Veda is dedicated to this. 

Brothers and sisters, I also want to give the example of Ujjwala Yojana. Through this scheme, the government has so far provided gas connections to more than 3 crore poor women. These women had to depend on either wood or kerosene when they did not have access to a gas connection. The government scheme has not only made their lives easier but also provided them with a safer environment.

Our country has gone through several changes over the years - changes in the individuals and changes in the society. Over the years, some evils also creep in the society. But a special feature of our society is that whenever such evils have crept in, someone or the other from within the society had taken the lead to eliminate it. Our great saints have spent their entire lives in enlightening us against the evils of the society. There was a time when the leadership was under our country's saints.

One of the unique features of our country is that from time to time we got great Saints like Adi Shankaracharya, Sant Vasaveshwar, who had identified these evils and showed us the path to salvation.

That time demands that we talk of the country along with the god of our religion; we should talk of Bharat Mata. In order to liberate Bharat Mata from the stranglehold of evils like illiteracy, ignorance, malnutrition, black money and corruption, the Saints and the spiritual society should also increase their efforts and show the path to the country. 

With everyone's participation and concerted efforts we can create a new India. Everyone can develop only with the help of everyone. 

I once again congratulate all of you on the chanting of Soundarya Lahari and on the completion of 10 years of continuous spiritual practice. I also bow down to the spiritual leaders who are engaged in the penance for the past 10 years and I thank them for that penance. 

I bow down to Sri Sri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji and end my speech here.

Once again I feel privileged to be present here on this auspicious occasion. It is a blessed moment for me. I wish to continue with some good work for Mother Bharati by seeking your blessings.

Thanks a lot!!

                All the eminent personalities, ladies and gentlemen associated with Vedanta Bharati,

It is an old belief that whenever a Mantra is chanted together in a single voice at a place, a powerful energy is produced which engulfs the mind, the body and the soul. Nad-Brahma has been accepted in that very context. Even modern science does not deny the power of enchantment of the mantras. Today I can feel the same energy by these wonderful mantras of Dakshinamurthy and Soundarya Lahari in this environment. This divine sensation comprises of not only the nectar but also a mystery and an indomitable desire to unify with God.

Every Mantra of Soundarya Lahari reflects a different power and a different feeling. That spirit and power is filling us with the new consciousness, new energy in this moment. I am fortunate that I am a person who has been associated with Navratri for years and Soundarya Lahari is a part of my Navratri celebrations.

Bowing down to the supreme Sri Sri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji, I wish to express my gratitude to Vedanta Bharati. They invited me to join the programme and give this opportunity to spend some quality time here. I am fortunate to have got this opportunity to experience the lessons of Soundarya Lahari under Shri Shri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji. With the blessings of Swamiji Soundarya Lahari has completed 10 years.

Congratulations to all of you and best wishes from my side. I believe that you are lucky that you have become a part of this sacred task. Brothers and sisters, about 8 to 10 days ago I had gone to Kedarnath. The gates of the temple were about to be closed. I was fortunate that I had the opportunity to pay obeisant to Mahadev ji. Whenever I go to Kedarnath, a question arises in my mind continuously. How did Adi Shankaracharya ji reached this inaccessible place thousands of years ago? 

Even in this period of modern technology, it is not so easy to go there. How would have Adi Shankara gone there thousands of years ago? Which is that eternal energy and power that motivated Shankaracharya to traverse through the entire country thrice and to establish the 4 Maths in the four corners of the country at the young age of 32? He made a great effort to culturally integrate India like a garland.

Adi Shankaracharya ji dedicated his life to strengthen our spiritual traditions. Adi Shankaracharya ji analysed very minutely all the wrongs that had crept in our traditions and at that age he had showed courage to criticize the evils within us. By putting forward right arguments, he made every effort to prevent the future generations from deviating to a wrong path. He had stressed the importance of the tradition of worshipping Shiva-Shakti-Vishnu-Ganapati and Kumar together. He re-established the Indian tradition once again. Adi Shankaracharya ji integrated the whole of India with the knowledge of the Vedas and Upanishads and connected it with the feeling of unity. He made the scriptures as the medium. He assimilated all the good things of different faiths and philosophies and motivated the people to follow the path of knowledge and devotion. He created Soundarya Lahari for the future generations. It turned out to be an institution with which every common man of the country could associate himself. In Soundarya Lahari it was ensured that no distinction between the different forms of God was made while propitiating the God.

""Ekam sadvipra bahudha vadanti""

The blessings obtained from Soundarya Lahari are also showered on everyone without any discrimination. It is believed that by chanting the text of Soundarya Lahari one can obtain knowledge, wealth, health and everything. The penance by Adi Shankaracharya is still present in the same form in the Indian culture - the culture which assimilates everything and unites everyone. This culture is also the basis for a new India; a culture that believes in the Mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'(development of all).

Brothers and sisters, Shri Shankar Bharati Mahaswamiji has dedicated his life to spread the message of Adi Shankaracharya to the people. Considering the entire world as a family, Adi Shankaracharya's message of 'ekatma bhav' has been reaching to the people through Vedanta Bharati. They are associated with Vedas and Upanishads in different languages and with several publications and books. And they are continuing with this trend.

Friends, the more the people read about the spiritual glory and the ancient messages of India, the more the world will get benefited out of it. The mankind which is confused is passing through a crisis such as the fight over presenting oneself as superior than the others or the fight over the path to attain salvation. Adi Shankaracharya gave the principle of Advaita or Oneness, where there is no existence of Dvaita. There is no possibility of conflict where there is no dualism. In different parts of the world whenever there is an obstruction in the path of life the countries set their eyes on India. In this way, all the problems of the world can be resolved by our traditions. We have inherited these traditions in our life.

 

ॐ सह नाववतु । सह नौ भुनक्तु । 

सह वीर्यं करवावहै । तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै । 

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Let everyone be nurtured and let everyone be strengthened. We never say that let 'me' be nurtured or let 'me' be powerful. In the temples we pray that everyone should be nurtured and be strengthened. This is our tradition. No one should be jealous of the other.

Today on this occasion I want to mention a special event of Vedanta Bharati which is Vivekadipani and 'Vivek utkarshani contest'. Very few people would know that efforts were made to weaken this interaction with Adi Shankaracharya, our spiritual traditions and culture. Attempts were made to destroy it but no one could end this legacy for thousands of years. It is said--

 

दीन-ए-इलाही का बेबाक बेड़ा, 

नक्शा जिसका अक्स-ए-आलम में पहुंचा। 

किए पांच सौ पार सातों समुंद्र, 

न अमन में ठिठका न कोई गुलजाम में झिझका। 

वो डूबा दोहाब-ए में गंगा के अंदर।। 

However, the long years of slavery had impacted our spiritual knowledge which today is largely confined to books. It is safe only with some priests. The kind of effort that should have been made after independence was not made. If today's young man is reading everything from his mobile phone then how will he get to know about the traditional knowledge hidden in the books? Who will let him know about this great heritage? So, telling the school students about our Indian culture and values through the programme Vivekadipani and through quiz competition is a great initiative by Swamiji. This is a great service even for the future generations.

The ultimate goal for any person in Indian philosophy is to attain liberation. The philosophies of the Vedas and Upanishads believe that 'vyakti' or individual, 'samasti' or society and 'srishthi' or universe or creation and 'parmeshti' or ‘God’ all are interconnected. We do not see them in isolation but in an integrated whole. This philosophy recognises the planet as 'mother earth'. It says that Earth belongs to all and Earth is our mother. This philosophy gave birth to ' vasudhaiva-kutumbakam'. 

Similarly, Soundarya Lahari also has a Mantra-""“फल: अपिवान्छा समाधिकम” which means the earth provides us more than what we demand. Such a great truth is reflected in this simple word. We all have enough water, air, river, grains, minerals, plantations, everything from the nature. It is essential to conserve this boon.

This very idea is our tradition. It emphasizes not to exploit the nature but to use the resources in a balanced manner from the nature. Exploitation of nature is considered as a crime here. Only 'Milking of nature' is the human right. Our tradition has taught us this. You have always seen this in our governance and administration.

Brothers and sisters, India is a country that has been persistently striving for justice, dignity, opportunity and prosperity not only for herself but also for the entire world. You must be aware that International Solar Alliance was launched last year. The government is constantly trying to promote solar energy both nationally and internationally. Even today, in the plans of the centre, you will get a glimpse of this desire of protecting the nature. The kind of work that is going on in the fields of solar power, wind power and hydropower was never seen before. 

The world's largest renewable capacity expansion programme is going on in this country – the country of Soundarya Lahari.

The government is aiming at achieving 40% of its energy needs by non-fossil fuel based renewable energy by the year 2030. By the year 2022 when India will be celebrating 75 years of independence, the government aims to achieve 175 Gigawatts... I am not talking about Megawatt. Megawatt is a matter of past. Today we are talking about Gigawatts; Gigawatt - for the production of renewable energy. Due to the government's efforts more than 22000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity has been increased and integrated with the power grid in the past 3 years. The previous government could add only 12000 megawatts to the renewable energy capacity in the last 3 years of its tenure while it had spent Rs .4000 crores on the renewable energy in last 3 years of its tenure. After coming to power we have spent approximately 11000 crore rupees in this sector within 3 years. 

At present our country has the electricity generation capacity of about 300 GW. It includes the electricity generation from all types of sources like coal, water, solar and wind energy. You will be surprised to know that if the resources available in the country are fully utilised, then 750 GW of electricity can be generated only by solar power. We should utilise our potential effectively.

Ceaseless efforts are being made by the government in this direction. For this, solar parks are being set up across the country; building bye laws have been changed in order to promote rooftop solar programme, loans are being provided at low interest rates for installing solar plants in government buildings; solar plants have been given infrastructure status and long term loans are being provided for these. Bengaluru is in a way the land of start-ups. The youngsters here are associated with innovation and inventions. I want to invite the youngsters of Bengaluru who are associated with start-ups. Come let us begin a movement for clean cooking. How can we make a cheap and affordable cooking stove by using solar energy? The old models of solar cookers are not suitable for the modern families. They want a gas-like oven. Even this is possible today. There's a huge market in this field for today's youngsters and start-ups. Clean cooking will prove to be a boon for old mothers. The forest dwellers will not have to deforest in order to get firewood for fuel. They can cook their food by using solar energy. This will also save time in cooking food for their children. We should strive towards those innovations that will benefit the country. You will see the level of impact on the society the day when all the institutions of the country will be able to fulfil their energy needs themselves.

Friends, I want to demonstrate the fact as to how a new approach is saving the country’s money and also protecting the environment. Brothers and sisters, the LED bulb which earlier used to cost Rs. 350 now costs only Rs. 40-45 under the new UJALA scheme. Till date more than 27 crore LED bulbs have been distributed throughout the country by our government. In Karnataka as well approximately 1.75 crore bulbs have been distributed. Even if we consider savings of Rs. 250 per bulb then the country's middle class has saved approximately 7000 crore rupees. Moreover, these bulbs are saving electricity bill in every household. Whoever has LED bulbs in his home will surely see a reduction in his electricity bill. Therefore, the use of energy has also declined. The middle class families have saved approximately 14000 crore rupees in one year. Naturally, the use of LEDs has reduced the consumption of electricity. This means that 7000 MW less energy is required in the installed capacity. If a 7000MW plant was installed, then that would have cost of at least 35 to 40 thousand crore rupees. By saving electricity, we could save the country 35- 40 thousand crore rupees. This was achieved only by changing the approach of working through a plan. The money that was saved by the middle class by purchasing LED bulbs and by reduction in electricity consumption amounts to approximately 55 to 60 thousand crore rupees. The middle class families have benefited.

Because of the government’s efforts, now the local bodies that are replacing the street lights with LED bulbs are also benefiting financially. I am the MP of Banaras and I helped Banaras save approximately 15 crore Rupees which is being utilised for other schemes. It is estimated that a Tier-II city is able to save approximately 10 to 15 crore Rupees. 

These funds are now being spent in the development of the city. With the efforts of the government there is a possibility of saving the expenditure incurred on the import of petrol and diesel from abroad. 

Brothers and sisters, petrol and diesel have no future. These natural resources will exhaust one day. The future belongs to solar energy, wind energy and of hydro energy. We can do it easily in our country because we are the people who believe in preserving nature and worshipping nature. Sacrificing our lives for protecting the trees has been inherent in our tradition. We pray even for breaking the branch of a tree. We have been taught to be kind and affectionate towards the living beings since our childhood. Every day after the Aarti we chant the shanti mantra-“वनस्पतय: शांति आप: शांति” (Vanaspatayaha shanti aapaha shanti)

But this is true that this tradition has been marred over the years. Today the Saints have to increase their efforts in this regard. Only if we are able to bring the texts, that have been our traditions, into practice we will be able to fight the challenge of climate change. Our entire Rig Veda is dedicated to this. 

Brothers and sisters, I also want to give the example of Ujjwala Yojana. Through this scheme, the government has so far provided gas connections to more than 3 crore poor women. These women had to depend on either wood or kerosene when they did not have access to a gas connection. The government scheme has not only made their lives easier but also provided them with a safer environment.

Our country has gone through several changes over the years - changes in the individuals and changes in the society. Over the years, some evils also creep in the society. But a special feature of our society is that whenever such evils have crept in, someone or the other from within the society had taken the lead to eliminate it. Our great saints have spent their entire lives in enlightening us against the evils of the society. There was a time when the leadership was under our country's saints.

One of the unique features of our country is that from time to time we got great Saints like Adi Shankaracharya, Sant Vasaveshwar, who had identified these evils and showed us the path to salvation.

That time demands that we talk of the country along with the god of our religion; we should talk of Bharat Mata. In order to liberate Bharat Mata from the stranglehold of evils like illiteracy, ignorance, malnutrition, black money and corruption, the Saints and the spiritual society should also increase their efforts and show the path to the country. 

With everyone's participation and concerted efforts we can create a new India. Everyone can develop only with the help of everyone. 

I once again congratulate all of you on the chanting of Soundarya Lahari and on the completion of 10 years of continuous spiritual practice. I also bow down to the spiritual leaders who are engaged in the penance for the past 10 years and I thank them for that penance. 

I bow down to Sri Sri Shankar Bharati Mahaswami ji and end my speech here.

Once again I feel privileged to be present here on this auspicious occasion. It is a blessed moment for me. I wish to continue with some good work for Mother Bharati by seeking your blessings.

Thanks a lot!!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the Dashamah Soundarya Lahari Parayanotsava Mahasamarpane at Bengaluru. 

The Soundarya Lahari is a set of shlokas composed by Adi Shankaracharya. At the event, there was mass chanting of Soundarya Lahari. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said he feels a special energy in the environment from this mass chanting. 

The Prime Minister recalled his visit to Kedarnath a few days ago, and said he is filled with awe at the work done by Adi Shankara, in that remote location, as well as at other places across India, in his relatively short life-span. He said Adi Shankara had united India, through the Vedas and Upanishads. 

The Prime Minister said the common man could relate to Adi Shankara's composition - Soundarya Lahari. He said Adi Shankaracharya removed evils from the society, and prevented them from reaching future generations. He said Adi Shankara had imbibed the best of practices from different ideologies and thought. He said Adi Shankaracharya's penance still exists in the present form of Indian culture - a culture that accepts all, and moves forward together. This culture is the foundation of New India - and follows the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, the Prime Minister said. 

The Prime Minister said that in a way, India's cultural heritage holds the answers to all global problems. He said that in India, the stress has always been on preventing the exploitation of nature. 

The Prime Minister said that LED bulbs which earlier cost more than 350 rupees, are now available for 40 to 45 rupees under the Ujala scheme. He said more than 27 crore LED bulbs have been distributed so far. This has resulted in savings in the electricity bill as well, he added. 

The Prime Minister mentioned that over 3 crore LPG connections have been distributed through the Ujjwala Yojana. This has not only made a positive difference in the lives of rural women, but also contributed to a cleaner environment, he said. 

The Prime Minister said that the need of the hour is that efforts be made to free India from evils such as illiteracy, ignorance, malnutrition, black money and corruption.

At a public meeting at Ujire, the Prime Minister distributed RuPay cards to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana account holders. He unveiled a logo to mark the launch of ""Preserve Mother Earth, and Transfer to Next Generation"" programme. 

Addressing the gathering, he expressed happiness at the opportunity to pray to Lord Manjunatha. 

He said that the current century is about skill development. India is a youthful nation, and hence, we must harness our demographic dividend, he added. 

Our saints and seers created as well as nurtured institutions which have helped society for centuries, the Prime Minister said. 

Speaking about the opportunity to hand over RuPay cards to women Self Help Groups, the Prime Minister said that he is happy to see enthusiasm towards digital transactions. 

He urged people to use the Bhim App and embrace cashless transactions. This is the era of honesty and integrity; there is no place for those who cheat the system, the Prime Minister said. 

The Prime Minister said that every rupee, and every resource from the Government of India is devoted for the welfare of Indians. We are ensuring that the fruits of development reach the intended beneficiaries without any scope of corruption, he added. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that conservation of water is a major challenge for us in this day and age. We also need to give importance towards living in harmony with nature and not think about short term gains, he added. He called upon the farmers of Karnataka to embrace methods like drip irrigation that help conserve water.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed over 360 Officer Trainees of the 92nd Foundation Course at LBSNAA, Mussoorie, on the 2nd day of his visit. The Officer Trainees belong to 17 Civil Services, and 3 Services from the Royal Bhutan Civil Service.

The address was preceded by presentations made by the Officer Trainees on essays written by them on the subject ""Why I joined the Civil Services""; and on themes such as housing, education, integrated transport systems, malnutrition, solid waste management, skill development, digital transactions, Ek Bharat - Shreshtha Bharat, and New India - 2022.

Officer Trainees also presented the best of their ideation on the Swachh Bharat Mission.

Addressing the Officer Trainees (OTs), the Prime Minister began by complimenting them on the presentations. He said that he has given instructions that these presentations be studied in depth by senior officers of the Government of India. He said their observations and feedback should be shared with the OTs before the end of the Foundation Course.

Giving tips to the OTs on how to prepare for their life immediately after the end of the training, the Prime Minister said that they must always be alert and attentive to the people around them. He said that the learning from books would surely prevent them from straying down the wrong path; but it is the connect and rapport they can establish with their teams and the people, that will help them to become successful.

The Prime Minister stressed on the importance of jan-bhagidaari, or public participation, for policy initiatives to be successfully implemented.

The Prime Minister said that before independence, the Civil Services were tasked with the objective of preserving the British Raj. Now, he said, the objective of the Civil Services is the prosperity and well-being of the people. He said if civil servants imbibe these objectives, the gap between Government machinery and the people can be bridged.

The Prime Minister said that the problem of silos, and lack of team spirit among civil servants, can be effectively tackled during the initial training at Mussoorie. Referring to the trek performed by OTs during the Foundation Course, the Prime Minister asked them to imbibe the learnings of the trek, such as team spirit and leadership, and apply them throughout their careers.

The Prime Minister said that social movements can drive change in a democracy, and the civil services should be catalysts for the same. Referring to the devotional song ""Vaishnav Jan"", performed by OTs during the cultural programme yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the OTs should contemplate on the lyrics of this song, after replacing the words ""Vaishnav Jan"" with ""Civil Servant.""

The Prime Minister said that anonymity is the biggest strength of the civil servant. He compared the civil services to the fourth lion of the Ashoka Emblem, which remains invisible, yet makes its presence felt at all times.

The Prime Minister said travel is a great Indian tradition, and travelling and interacting with people is a great learning experience. He urged OTs to tour the field areas, during their postings.

Exhorting the OTs, the Prime Minister said that the ""sense of career,"" which had successfully brought them to LBSNAA, should now be replaced by a ""sense of mission"" - to serve the people of India. He said that in future, when they serve in the field, this should be their ""purpose of life.""

Earlier this morning, the Prime Minister participated in the Yoga session of the Officer Trainees, held in the lawns of the Academy, in the backdrop of the Himalayas.

The Prime Minister unveiled plaques to mark the laying of Foundation Stone of the New Hostel Building, and a 200 metre multifunctional synthetic athletic track.

The Prime Minister visited the Balwadi at the Academy and interacted with the children. He also visited the gymnasium and other facilities at the Academy.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met and interacted with over 360 Officer Trainees of the 92nd Foundation Course at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. He is at LBSNAA on a two-day visit.

He had a lively informal interaction with the officer trainees in four groups. During the wide-ranging interaction, which lasted nearly four hours, the Prime Minister urged the Officer Trainees to express their ideas and thoughts to him frankly and without fear. A variety of subjects such as administration, governance, technology and policy-making came up for discussion. The Prime Minister encouraged the Officer Trainees to study and research governance issues in depth, so that they could understand them well. He also stressed on the need for them to develop a national vision. The discussions were marked by a large degree of experience-sharing.

He interacted with faculty members of the Academy, who gave him an overview of the work being done there, to train India's civil servants.

The Prime Minister visited the state-of-the-art Gandhi Smriti Library at LBSNAA. He attended a short cultural programme by the Officer Trainees.

Earlier, on arrival at the Academy, the Prime Minister offered floral tributes on the statues of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K. Sinha, and Director, LBSNAA, Smt. Upma Chawdhry were present during the interactions.

                My Cabinet colleague Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji, Shri C.R. Chaudhary Ji, Secretary General, UNCTAD, Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, and other dignitaries present here. 

First of all, I congratulate all of you for this Regional Conference on an important subject like Consumer Protection. This programme is being attended by representatives from South Asia, Southeast Asia and all the East Asian countries. I welcome all of you to this programme. 

This event is the first of its kind in South Asia. I would also like to express gratitude to UNCTAD for having supported India’s initiative and playing an active role in bringing it to this stage. 

Friends, very few regions of the world have such intensive historical interfaces as this region has. For thousands of years we have been connected by Trade, Culture and Religion. The Coastal Economy has made significant contribution in connecting this region for centuries. Movement of people from one place to another and exchange of thoughts and ideas, has been a two way process and has benefitted every country in this region. Today, we all symbolise a shared heritage not only economically but also culturally. 

Friends, in today's modern era our traditional relationship has attained a new dimension. The Asian countries are not only catering to the goods and services markets in their own country but their reach has expanded to other continents as well. In such a scenario, Consumer Protection is an important component which enhances and strengthens trade in this region. 

Today's event is a reflection of how seriously we understand the needs of our citizens, how hard we strive to overcome their difficulties. Every citizen is a consumer too and hence this event symbolizes our collective determination. 

It is also very heartening to see that the United Nations has come forward as a partner in this entire process. For the first time in 1985, the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection were framed. They were revised two years ago. India has also played an active role in the process of revision. These guidelines are very important with regard to Sustainable Consumption, E-Commerce and Financial Services in developing countries. 

Friends, consumer protection has been an integral part of governance for ages in India. Consumers' protection finds mention in our Vedas written thousands of years ago. It is mentioned in Atharvaveda that-

""इमा मात्रा मिमीम हे यथ परा न मासातै""

It means that nobody should be involved in malpractices of quality and measurement. 

These ancient documents explain the rules of Consumer Protection and the kind of punishment to be given to the trader who indulges in wrong practices. You will be astonished to know that in India around 2500 years ago, during the period of Kautilya, there were guidelines for the government regarding how the trade should be regulated and the interest of the consumers be protected. The Posts in the organisational structure in the Kautilya period may be considered as Director of Trade and the Superintendent of Standards in today’s context. 

Friends, we consider consumer as gods. In many shops you may see the writing – ग्राहक देवो भव:। Regardless of the nature of business, Consumer satisfaction should be the prime motive. 

Friends, India is one of the first few countries to legislate Consumer Protection Act in 1986, just one year after adoption of UN Guidelines. 

Protection of consumer interests is a priority of the government. This is also reflected in our resolution of the New India. Moving beyond Consumer Protection, New India will have Best Consumer Practices and Consumer Prosperity. 

Friends, today we are in process of enacting a new Consumer Protection Act keeping in view the business practices and requirements of the country. The proposed Act lays great emphasis on consumer empowerment. Rules are being simplified to ensure that Consumer grievances are redressed in a time-bound manner and at least possible cost. Stringent provisions are proposed against misleading advertisements. A Central Consumer Protection Authority with executive powers will be constituted for quick remedial action. 

We have enacted the Real Estate Regulatory Act for the protection of home buyers. Earlier, consumers waited for years to get the possession of their homes as they would fall prey to unscrupulous builders. There used to be ambiguity regarding the area of the flat. Now after RERA, only registered developers can seek bookings only after getting all the required permissions. Moreover, booking amount has been fixed only at 10 per cent. 

Earlier, the builders used to divert the money received for bookings to other projects. Now government has made a stringent provision that 70 per cent of the payment received from buyers will be kept in an ""Escrow"" account and this amount will be spent on that project only. 

Similarly, the Bureau of Indian Standard Act has also been enacted. Now any commodity or service related to public or consumer interest can be brought under compulsory certification. This Act also has provisions to order recall of substandard products from the market and for compensation in case of loss or damages incurred by the consumer. 

Recently, India has also implemented Goods and Services Tax-GST. After GST, dozens of different types of indirect taxes in the country have been abolished. Many Hidden Taxes have also gone away. Now, the consumer knows how much tax he has paid to the state government and how much to the central government. The queues of the trucks on the borders now no longer exist. 

With GST, a new business culture is developing and in the long term consumers will be the biggest beneficiaries. It is a transparent system in which no one can hurt the interests of the Consumers. Increased competition due to the GST will lead to moderation in prices. It will directly benefit poor and middle class consumers. 

Friends, besides strengthening the interests of the consumers through the law, it is also necessary that the grievances of the people are promptly addressed. In the last three years, our government has created a new eco-system for Grievance Redressal by making efficient use of technology. 

The capacity of the National Consumer Helpline has been increased 4 times. Portals and Social Media associated with Consumer Protection have also been integrated. A large number of private companies have been connected to the portal. About 40 percent complaints get transferred directly to the companies automatically through the portal enabling quick action. Consumers are also being made aware through the “Jago Grahak Jago” campaign. I can confidently state that this govt. has used social media positively for Consumer Protection in India, as has never been done before. 

Friends, in my view and in the vision of my govt. the scope of Consumer Protection is very broad. Development of any country and consumer protection are complementary. Good governance has an important role in taking the benefits of development to every citizen. 

Ensuring delivery of rights and services to the deprived by the Government is also a way of protecting interests of the consumers. Ujjwala Yojna for Clean Energy, Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan for health and hygiene, Jan-Dhan Yojna for Financial Inclusion reflect this spirit. The govt. is also working towards the goal that every citizen of the country owns a house by 2022. 

Recently, a scheme has also been launched to provide electricity connection to every household of the country. All these efforts are for providing Basic Lifeline support to people and to make their lives more comfortable. 

Interests of consumers are not protected by merely giving them rights. In India we are also working to formulate schemes which help consumers save money. The poor and middle class in the country is benefitted most from these schemes. 

You might also be aware that UNICEF has recently announced findings of a survey in India. According to the survey, considering medical costs averted, value of time savings and mortality averted, financial savings for each household in Open Defecation Free communities are Rs. 50,000 per year. 

Friends, Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna has been launched to provide affordable medicines to the poor. More than 500 medicines have been included in the list of essential drugs and their prices have been reduced. Capping prices of Coronary Stents have made them cheaper by up to 85 per cent. Recently, prices of knee implants have also been brought under control. This also is saving crores of rupees for the poor and middle class people. 

Our thinking is to move beyond Consumer Protection to promotion of Consumers Interest. 

Our scheme, Ujala is another example of monetary saving in Consumer Interest. This simple scheme for distribution of LED bulb has shown extraordinary results. When this government assumed charge, cost of a LED bulb was Rs. 350-/. After government's efforts, the same bulb is now available in just Rs. 40 to 45-/ under the scheme. Therefore, this scheme alone has caused saving of more than Rs. 20 thousand crores for consumers by reducing the cost of LED bulb and through reduction in electricity bills. 

Friends, keeping the inflation under control has caused economic benefits to the poor and middle class consumers. Otherwise, the rate at which the Inflation was rising during previous government’s tenure it would have resulted in huge rise in the budget of the common citizen's kitchen. 

By strengthening the Public Distribution System through technology, it is also being ensured that the poor, who have the right to affordable food grains, get their due. 

Under the Direct Benefit Scheme, by transferring the money directly into the beneficiaries' bank accounts the government has prevented leakage of more than Rs. 57 thousand crores. 

Friends, it is necessary that the consumers also understand their shared responsibilities towards the society and discharge their duties in this regard to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. 

Here, on this occasion, I specially want to inform colleagues from other countries about Give-it-up campaign. Subsidy is provided on LPG cylinders in our country. On my appeal, within a short time of around one year, more than one crore people have given up their gas subsidy. The savings thereon have been used in giving free gas connections to 3 crore households so far. 

It is an example that how the shared contribution from each consumer benefits other consumers thus creating a positive environment in the society towards one's duties. 

Friends, Government is implementing Prime Minister Rural Digital Literacy Campaign for Digital Empowerment of Consumers living in rural areas of the country. Under this scheme, one person each from 6 crore households is being made digitally literate. This campaign will facilitate villagers for electronic transactions and availing Government services digitally. 

Digital awareness in the villages of India is also creating a huge e-commerce market for the future. Unified Payment Interface-UPI has given the e-commerce industry a lot of strength. Bharat Interface For Money - i.e. BHIM App has expanded digital payments in cities as well as in rural areas. 

Friends, India is one of the world's largest markets on the strength of the population of more than 125 crore and the fast growing middle class. The openness of our economy welcomes every country in the world, brings Indian consumers closer to the global players. Through Make in India we are offering a platform to Global Companies to produce in India and to make better use of our huge human resource. 

Friends, this is a first of its kind conference in this part of the world. Every country represented here is engaged in its own way for protecting the interests of their consumers. But we must also keep in mind that now with the increasing Globalization, the whole world is changing into a single market. Therefore it is very important to learn from each other's experiences, to explore the points of common understanding and to discuss the possibility of building a Regional Coalition for Consumer Protection through such an event. 

Friends, Asian countries provide large business opportunities because of large consumer base of more than 4 billion, increasing purchasing power and young demographic profile. E-commerce and trans-border mobility of people is resulting in increased cross border transactions. Under these circumstances, a strong regulatory system in every country and information sharing is a must for sustaining consumer confidence. A framework for cooperation is also necessary to expeditiously act in cases related to consumers from other countries. This will enhance mutual trust and trade. 

Creating a Structured Mechanism for Communication, Mutual Sharing of Best Practices, Creating New Initiatives for Capacity Building and Starting Joint Campaigns, are such areas which can be pursued in mutual interest. 

Friends, strengthening of our emotional bonds will also strengthen our shared cultural and trade heritage. Taking pride in our culture while respecting other cultures is part of our tradition. Over the centuries, we have been learning from each other and Trade and Consumer Protection are also an integral part of this process. 

I hope that keeping in view the future challenges a roadmap with a clear vision for moving forward will be prepared in this conference. I am hopeful that we will also succeed in institutionalizing regional cooperation through this conference. 

I once again express gratitude to you for participating in this conference. 

Thanks a lot!

                मंत्रिमंडल के मेरे सहयोगी श्री राम विलास पासवान जी, श्री सी. आर. चौधरी जी, UNCTAD (अंकटाड) के सेक्रेटरी जनरल डॉक्टर मुखीसा किटूयी जी, और यहां उपस्थित अन्य महानुभाव, 

सबसे पहले आप सभी सभी को consumer protection जैसे महान विषय पर International Conference के लिए बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। 

इस कार्यक्रम में दक्षिण एशिया, South-East Asia और East Asia के कई देशों के प्रति‍निधि भी आज हमारे बीच में शामिल हैं। मैं आप सभी का इस कार्यक्रम में हृदय से बहुत-बहुत स्‍वागत करता हूं। 

दक्षिण एशिया में ये अपनी तरह का ये पहला आयोजन है। मैं UNCTAD का भी आभारी हूं, जिसने भारत की इस पहल को मजबूती के साथ आगे बढ़ाया और उसे इस स्‍वरूप तक लाने में सक्रिय भूमिका निभाई। 

सा‍थियो, दुनिया का ये भू-भाग जिस तरह एक-दूसरे से ऐतिहासिक रूप से जुड़ा हुआ है, वैसा अन्‍य जगहों पर कम ही देखने को मिलता है। हजारों वर्षों से हम trade, culture, religion ऐसे कई पहलू से जुड़े हुए हैं। Costal Economy ने इस भू-भाग को connect करने के लिए सदियों से अहम योगदान दिया है। लोगों का आना-जाना, विचारों का आदान-प्रदान, एक two-way process रहा है। जिसका लाभ इस क्षेत्र के हर देश को कम-अधिक मात्रा में मिलता रहा है। हम आज भी सिर्फ आर्थिक ही नहीं, बल्कि सांस्‍कृतिक तौर पर भी एक shared heritage का प्रतीक हैं। 

सा‍थियो, आज के modern era में हमारे पारस्‍परिक संबंध एक नये आयाम पर पहुंचे हैं। एशिया के देश न सिर्फ अपने देश पर goods और market services को cater कर रहे हैं बल्कि उनका विस्‍तार दूसरे महाद्वीपों तक भी फैलता चला जा रहा है। इसमें consumer protection ऐसा विषय है, जो इस क्षेत्र में व्‍यापार को बढ़ाने, उसे और मजबूत करने का एक important component है। 

आज का ये आयोजन इस बात का प्रतीक है कि हम अपने नागरिकों की आवश्‍यकताओं को किस तरह गंभीरता से समझते हैं; उनकी दिक्‍कतों को दूर करने के लिए किस तरह से गंभीरतापूर्वक प्रयास करते हैं। हर नागरिक एक consumer भी होता है, और इसलिए ये आयोजन हमारे collective determination का भी प्रतीक है। 

सा‍थियो, इस पूरी प्रक्रिया में संयुक्‍त राष्‍ट्र का एक सहयोगी तौर पर आगे आना भी एक बहुत ही सुखद बात है। Nineteen Eighty Five (1985) में पहली बार consumer protection पर UN Guidelines बनी थीं। दो वर्ष पूर्व ही इसमें और सुधार किया गया है। सुधार की इस प्रक्रिया में भारत की भी सक्रिय भूमिका रही है। 

और मैं डॉक्टर मुखीसा का आभारी हूं, उन्‍होंने जिस प्रकार से भारत की सराहना की। अनेक क्षेत्र में भारत जिस बातों को lead ले रहा है, उसका भी उन्‍होंने बहुत ही उत्‍तम तरीके से जिक्र किया, मैं इसलिए उनका हृदय से बहुत आभारी हूं। 

विकासशील देशों में sustainable consumption in commerce और finical service के संबंध में ये guidelines बहुत ही महत्‍वपूर्ण हैं। 

साथियो, भारत में सैंकड़ों, हजारों वर्षों से consumer protection, Governance का अभिन्‍न हिस्‍सा रहा है। हजारों वर्ष पूर्व रचित हमारे वेदों में उपभोक्‍ता संरक्षण की एक व्‍यापक चर्चा है। अथर्व वेद में कहा गया है- 

“इमा मात्रा मिमीम हे यथ परा न मासातै” 

यानी वस्‍तुस्थिति और नाप-तौल में किसी भी तरह की गड़़बड़ी न करें। 

ऋगवेद में कहा गया है- हजारों वर्ष पूर्व रचित ग्रंथों में consumer protection के बकायदा नियम समझाए गए हैं। गलत तरीके से trade करने वाले को किस तरह की सजा दी जाए, उसे भी उस क्षेत्र समय में वर्णित किया गया है। 

आप जान करके हैरान होंगे कि लगभग ढाई हजार साल पहले, कौटिल्‍य के समय में, बाकायदा शासन के लिए guidelines परिभाषित की गई थीं कि कैसे trade का regulate किया जाएगा और कैसे सरकार उपभोक्‍ता के हितों की रक्षा करेगी। 

कौटिल्‍य-काल में शासन द्वारा जिस तरह की व्‍यवस्‍था थी, आज के हिसाब से अगर उन पदों को हम आज के terminology में रखें तो उसका मतलब होता है; director of trade, superintended of standards; मैं समझता हूं कहा जा सकता है। 

हमारे यहां ग्राहक को भगवान माना जाता है। कई दुकानों में आपको लिखा मिल जाएगा- ग्राहक देवो भव: । चाहे कोई भी business हो, उसका एकमात्र मकसद Consumer की सं‍तुष्टि होना चाहिए। 

साथियों, भारत उन कुछ देशों में शामिल रहा है जिसने UN guidelines Adopt होने के अगले ही साल यानि 1986 में ही अपना Consumer Protection Act लागू कर दिया था। 

उपभोक्ता के हितों का ध्यान इस सरकार की प्राथमिकताओं में से एक प्रमुख अंग है। सरकार की ये प्राथमिकता New India के संकल्प के साथ भी पूरी तरह जुड़ी हुई है। New India, जहां Consumer Protection से आगे बढ़कर Best Consumer Practices और Consumer Prosperity की भी बात को हम बल दे रहे हैं। 

साथियों, हम आज की देश की जरूरतों को, आज के व्यापारिक तौर-तरीकों को ध्यान में रखते हुए एक नया Consumer Protection Act already process में है, हम बना रहे हैं। नए कानून में Consumer Empowerment पर विशेष जोर दिया जा रहा है। Consumer की परेशानी कम समय में, कम खर्च में दूर हो, इसके लिए नियमों को और अधिक सरल किया जा रहा है। Misleading विज्ञापनों पर और सख्ती का प्रावधान किया जा रहा है। तुरंत सुनवाई के लिए Executive powers के साथ Central Consumer Protection Authority का भी गठन किया जाएगा। 

हमने Real Estate Regulatory Act बनाया है, जिससे घर खरीदने वाले उपभोक्ताओं के हितों का संरक्षण हुआ है, और विशेष करके मध्‍यम वर्ग, निम्‍न वर्ग का व्‍यक्ति जो जीवन की पूरी कमाई घर बनाने के लिए खर्च कर देता है; उसके लिए protection मतलब, उसकी पूरी एक जिंदगी के अरमानों के protection का दायरा बन जाता है। पहले, बिल्डरों की मनमानी की वजह से वर्षों तक लोगों को अपने घरों के लिए इंतजार करना पड़ता था। फ्लैट के एरिया को लेकर भी भ्रम की स्थिति बनी रहती थी। अब इस नए कानून RERA के बाद केवल Registered developers ही सभी आवश्यक permission प्राप्त करने के बाद घर की booking कर सकेंगे। सिर्फ एक pamphlet छापकार ही लोगों के रुपये नहीं बटोर सकते हैं। इसके साथ ही सरकार ने booking amount की सीमा को भी 10 प्रतिशत पर फिक्स कर दिया है, वरना पहले advance में 25, 30, 40 percent तक, 50 percent तक लोगों से पैसे हथिया लिए जाते थे। 

पहले ये होता था कि बिल्डर, घरों की बुकिंग के बाद मिलने वाले जो पैसे होते थे उसको दूसरे प्रोजेक्ट में लगा देते थे। अब सरकार ने ऐसा प्रावधान किया है कि खरीदार से मिलने वाली 70 प्रतिशत राशि “Escrow” अकाउंट में डालनी होगी और ये राशि उसी प्रोजेक्ट पर ही खर्च की जाएगी। 

इसी तरह ब्यूरो ऑफ Indian Standard Act भी बनाया गया है। अब Public या Consumer Interest से जुड़ी किसी भी वस्तु या सेवा को compulsory certification के अंतर्गत लाया जा सकेगा। और इसके तहत खराब क्वालिटी की वस्तुओं को बाजार से Recall करने और उससे अगर उपभोक्ता को नुकसान हुआ है, तो उसकी Compensation का भी प्रावधान किया गया है। 

अभी हाल ही में भारत ने Goods And Services Tax- GST को भी लागू किया है। GST के बाद देश में अलग-अलग तरह के दर्जनों Indirect Tax का जाल खत्म हुआ है। कितने ही तरह के Hidden Tax अब खत्म हो चुके हैं। उपभोक्ता को अब सामने receipt पर दिखता है कि उसने कितना टैक्स राज्य सरकार को दिया, कितना टैक्‍स केंद्र सरकार को दिया। बॉर्डर पर ट्रकों का लगने वाला लंबा जाम भी खत्म हो गया है। 

GST से देश को एक नया business culture मिल रहा है और Long Term में GST का सबसे बड़ा फायदा Consumers को ही होने वाला है। मध्‍यम वर्ग, निम्‍न वर्ग, गरीब; जिसका अज्ञान का लाभ उठाया जाता था; जैसे-जैसे लोगों को इसकी जानकारी मिलती जाएगी, ग्राहक जागरूक होता जाएगा और कहीं पर भी आप कोई भी उसका cheating नहीं कर पाएगा। ये एक पारदर्शी व्यवस्था है जिसमें कोई Consumers के हितों के साथ खिलवाड़ नहीं कर पाएगा। इतना ही नहीं, GST की वजह से जब कंपनियों का आपस में competition बढ़ेगा, और बढ़ने वाला है; तो चीजों की कीमतों में भी बहुत गिरावट आएगी, कमी आएगी। और इसका सीधा फायदा भी गरीब और मध्यम वर्ग के Consumers को होने वाला है। 

अब देखिए, transportation, जो ट्रक पांच दिन में जाती थी, अब सारे check post हटने के कारण वो तीन दिन में जा रही है। इसका मतलब कि जो सामान ढो करके जाने का खर्च होता था उसमें कटौती आई है। ये आने वाले दिनों में consumer को transfer होने ही वाला है। आज भले ही कोई लोग अज्ञान का लाभ उठाते होंगे, लेकिन सारी चीजों का फायदा आने वाले दिनों में ग्राहक को, मध्‍यम वर्ग, निम्‍न-मध्‍यम वर्ग, गरीब को, उसको transfer होने ही वाला है। 

साथियों, कानून के माध्यम से उपभोक्ता के हितों को मजबूत करने के साथ ही ये भी बहुत आवश्यक है कि लोगों की शिकायतों पर तुरंत कार्रवाई हो। Ultimately democracy की ताकत grievance redressal में होती है। लोकतंत्र का अहम, grievance redressal system कितनी आपकी powerful है; इस पर लेखा-जोखा होता है। पिछले तीन वर्षों में technology का इस्तेमाल करते हुए हमारी सरकार ने Grievance redressal का एक नया Eco-system तैयार किया है। 

National Consumer Helpline की क्षमता को 4 गुना बढ़ाया जा चुका है।Consumer Protection से जुड़े portal और social media को भी integrate किया गया है। Portal से निजी कंपनियां भी बड़ी संख्या से जुड़ रही हैं। Portal के माध्यम से लगभग 40 प्रतिशत शिकायतें सीधे कंपनियों के पास automatic transfer हो जाती हैं जिन पर तेजी से कार्रवाई होती है। जागो-ग्राहक जागो- इस अभियान के माध्यम से भी उपभोक्ताओं को जागरूक करने का एक व्‍यापक प्रयास निरंतर चलता रहता है। मैं बड़े संतोष के साथ कह सकता हूं कि Consumer Protection में जिस तरह social media का Positive तरीके से इस्तेमाल इस सरकार ने किया है, वैसा देश में पहले कभी नहीं किया गया। 

साथियों, मेरी नजर में और हमारी सरकार के vision में Consumer Protection का दायरा बहुत ही विस्तृत है। किसी भी देश का विकास और Consumer Protection एक दूसरे के पूरक होते हैं, वो जुड़वां भाई होते हैं। विकास का फायदा हर नागरिक तक पहुंचे, इसके लिए Good Governance, इसकी भी बहुत बड़ी भूमिका रहती है। 

जब आप सरकार के नाते ये सुनिश्चित करते हैं कि नागरिक तक उसके अधिकार पहुंचें, नागरिक तक वो सेवाएं पहुंचे, जिनसे वो अज्ञानवश वंचित रह जाता है, तब भी आप Consumer के हितों को Protect करते हैं; ये good governance के माध्‍यम से संभव होता है। देश के लोगों को Clean Energy के लिए उज्ज्वला योजना, health and hygiene के लिए स्वच्छ भारत अभियान, Financial inclusion के लिए जन-धन योजना, ये ऐसी कई योजनाएं हैं; इसी भावना को प्रतिबिंबित करती हैं। 2022 तक, जबकि आजादी के 75 साल हो रहे हैं, और भारत जब आजादी के 75 साल मना रहा है, तब 2022 तक देश के हर व्यक्ति के पास अपना घर हो, इस पर भी सरकार बहुत व्‍यापक रूप से काम कर रही है। 

अभी हाल ही में देश के हर घर में बिजली connection पहुंचाने के लिए भी एक बहुत बड़ा initiative लिया गया है, एक बहुत बड़ी योजना शुरू की गई है। ये सारे प्रयास लोगों के Basic Life Line सपोर्ट देने के साथ ही उनकी जिंदगी आसान बनाने के लिए भी हैं। 

Consumer के हितों की रक्षा सिर्फ उसे अधिकार देने से ही पूरी नहीं होती है। भारत में हम उस दिशा में भी काम कर रहे हैं जहां सरकार की योजनाएं Consumer के पैसे बचाने में मददगार साबित होनी चाहिए और हो रही हैं। इन योजनाओं से सबसे ज्यादा फायदा देश के गरीब, निम्‍न–मध्‍यम वर्ग, मध्यम वर्ग, ऐसे समाज के एक बहुत बड़े दायरे को होता है। वो law abiding citizen होते हैं। वे कानून का पालन करने वाले मध्‍यमवर्गीय लोग होते हैं। उनको हम जितना sport देंगे, उतनी हमारी व्‍यवस्‍थाएं और अधिक ताकतवर बनेंगी। 

आपको जानकारी होगी कि UNICEF ने अभी हाल ही में भारत में एक सर्वे के नतीजों की घोषणा की है। सर्वे के मुताबिक स्वच्छ भारत मिशन के बाद जो गांव खुले में शौच से मुक्त हो गए हैं, उन गांवों में प्रत्येक परिवार को सालाना 50 हजार रुपयों की बचत हो रही है। वरना यही राशि उस परिवार को बीमारियों के इलाज, अस्पताल आने-जाने, और दफ्तर से ली गई छुट्टियों आदि पर खर्च करने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ता था। अब ये consumer की नजर से देखें हम इस घटना को तो हमने उसके 50 हजार रुपये बचाना, ये अपनी उसकी एक consumer के नाते purchasing power भी बढ़ाते हैं और उसकी अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था को priority देने के लिए हम सुविधा provide करते हैं। 

साथियों, गरीबों को सस्ती दवा के लिए भारतीय जनऔषधि परियोजना हमने प्रारंभ की है। 500 से ज्यादा दवाइयों की कीमत को कम करके उन्हें आवश्यक दवाइयों की लिस्ट में रखा गया है। स्‍टेंट की कीमत में capping करके स्‍टेंट को 85 प्रतिशत तक सस्ता किया गया है। मध्‍यम वर्ग का परिवार, अगर परिवार के एक व्‍यक्ति को हृदय की बीमारी हो जाए और स्‍टेंट लगवाना हो तो ढाई लाख, तीन लाख, दो लाख; कहां से खर्च करेगा? सरकार ने intervention किया, as a consumer एक heart patient, consumer भी है और उसको अगर 85 percent कम कीमत से वी स्‍टेंट मिल जाए; मैं समझता हूं आधी हृदय की बीमारी तो यूं ही चली जाएगी। यही तो consumer protection होता है। हाल ही में घुटने के implants की कीमत को भी सरकार ने नियंत्रित कर दिया है। आज शायद ही कोई परिवार होगा जहां 50 के बाद घर में घुटने की शिकायत वाले लोग न मिलें। और फिर डॉक्‍टर्स तो बता देते हैं बस mechanical engineering में जैसे पुर्जा बदल देते हैं, आओ पुर्जा बदल देते हैं, और फिर वो बहुत बड़ा लम्‍बा-चौड़ा बिल दे देते हैं। हमने इसके लिए व्‍यवस्‍था की, उसकी कीमतें कम की। जो retired लोग हैं, जो pensioners हैं, वे consumer भी हैं। उस आयु में उनको इतनी बड़ी मदद, मैं समझता हूं pension की बढ़ोत्‍तरी से भी ये बचत उसको ज्‍यादा ताकत और विश्‍वास देती है। ये काम सरकार का approach है। 

हमारी सोच Consumer Protection से आगे जाकर Consumer Interest Promotion की ओर भी है। Consumer Interest में लोगों के पैसे बचाने का एक और उदाहरण मैं आपके सामने रखता हूं और वो है हमारी उजाला स्कीम। ये पूरी स्‍कीम सिर्फ consumer के हित में ही सीमित नहीं है, consumer के interest की भी चिंता करती है। आपने देखा होगा, वैसे चीज बहुत छोटी लगती है, लेकिन इसका प्रभाव कितना होता है, उजाला योजना। ये साधारण सी स्कीम है LED बल्ब के वितरण की, लेकिन परिणाम असाधारण हैं। 

जब ये सरकार आई थी तो एक LED बल्ब, उसकी कीमत 350 रुपये से ज्यादा में वो बिकता था। सरकार ने उसमें intervention किया, बा‍रीकियों में देखा, LED का बल्‍ब production, उसकी दिशा में देखा। मार्केट बने, इसकी चिंता की। और जो बल्‍ब साढ़े तीन सौ रुपये में बिकता था, अब उजाला स्कीम के तहत केवल 40-45 रुपये में वो बल्‍ब उपलब्ध है। अब कोई मुझे बताए कि देश के मध्‍यम वर्ग के व्‍यक्ति के जेब में पैसा बचा कि नहीं बचा? उसके interest को protect किया कि नहीं किया? LED बल्ब की कीमत कम करके और लोगों के बिजली बिल में बचत कराकर सरकार ने सिर्फ इस एक योजना से consumer के, उपभोक्ताओं के करीब-करीब 20 हजार करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा, उनके जेब में पूरे देश में बचाए हैं, एक साल में। क्‍योंकि बिजली का बिल कम हो गया इसके कारण। 20 हजार करोड़ रुपये, अगर पुरानी सरकारों की तरह, अगर हम रेवड़ी बांटने के लिए लगा देते तो जय-जयकार करने वालों की कमी नहीं थी। 

लेकिन हमने कठिन रास्‍ते चुने लेकिन consumer के interest को पूरे करने के तरीके के साथ जुड़े रहे। 20 हजार करोड़ रुपये कम नहीं होता है। इतने मिले बिजली बचने के कारण। Environment में कितना फायदा हो रहा है। अगर इतनी ही बिजली का कारखाना लगाना होता तो शायद 50-60 हजार करोड़ रुपये, उतनी बिजली उत्‍पादन के लिए कारखाने लगाने पड़ते; वो तो एक extra benefit हुआ है। 

साथियों, Inflation पर लगाम लगाने की वजह से भी और उसकी वजह से गरीब और मध्यम वर्ग के Consumers का आर्थिक फायदा हुआ है। जिस तेजी से Inflation बढ़ रहा था, 2012-13, 11, 12, 13 का समय देख लीजिए, अगर उसी रफ्तार से बढ़ता होता तो आज था कितनी महंगी होती, अगर इसका हिसाब लगाओगे तो कोई भी बड़ा अर्थशास्‍त्री चौंक जाता कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का आदमी खाता कैसे है? लेकिन इस सरकार ने कदम उठाए, Inflation को कम किया, थाली पर बढ़ने वाले बोझ को रोक दिया। कुछ कीमतों में सस्‍ता होने में सफल हुए, Inflation कम होता गया। इससे भी Consumer की जेब में पैसे बचे हैं, Consumers के interest की रक्षा हुई है। शायद ही मध्‍यम वर्ग, निम्‍न-मध्‍यम वर्ग के परिवारों की इतनी बारीकी से चिंता शायद ही इस देश में पहले कभी हुई होगी। 

टेक्नोलॉजी के माध्यम से Public Distribution System को मजबूत करके भी ये सुनिश्चित किया जा रहा है कि जिस गरीब का सस्ते खाद्यान्न पर अधिकार है, उसे ही वो अनाज मिलना चाहिए, स्‍थायपन्‍न नहीं होना चाहिए। चोरी हो करके फ्लोर मिल में नहीं जाना चाहिए गेहूं, गरीब के पेट में जाना चाहिए। ये भी Consumers के interest के protection की हमारी commitment का उदाहरण है। 

Direct benefit scheme के तहत लाभार्थियों के bank account में सीधे पैसा transfer करके सरकार पे 57 हजार करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा की रकम को गलत हाथों में जाने से रोक दिया है। कोई तो थे बिचौलिए, कोई तो थे दलाल, जिनके पास ये पैसा जाता था। आधार की सबसे बड़ी सफलता ये है कि जिसका हक है उसको हक का देने में आधार एक बहुत बड़ी भूमिका अदा कर रहा है। और 57 हजार करोड़ रुपया प्रतिवर्ष, एक वर्ष नहीं- प्रति वर्ष। 57 हजार करोड़ रुपये चोरी होती थी और उसको भ्रष्‍टाचार के रूप में कभी बाजार के अखबारों में कभी छपा नहीं है वो। जैसे 2G का छपता था, कोयले का छपता था, इसका नहीं छपा; क्‍योंकि क्‍योंकि इतनी छोटी-छोटी रकमों की चोरी हुआ करती थी किसी को पता नहीं चलता था। 

Consumer के interest की चिंता करने के कारण सरकार ने technology का इस्‍तेमाल किया, transparency पर जोर लगाया और उसी का परिणाम है‍ कि जो हकदार हैं, उसका हक आज न कोई छीन सकता है; जिसका हक है उसको पूरा का पूरा, एक रुपये का 15 पैसे हुए बिना , एक रुपया का 100 पैसा उसके पास जा रहा है। ये काम Consumer interest का सबसे बड़ा उदाहरण है। 

साथियों, Sustainable Development Goals और उसकी प्राप्ति के लिए आवश्यक है कि consumer भी अपने साझा उत्तरदायित्व समझते हुए अपने कर्तव्यों का निर्वहन करें। 

यहां इस अवसर पर मैं दूसरे देशों से आए हुए अपने साथियों को Give-it-up scheme के बारे में विशेष तौर पर बताना चाहूंगा। हमारे यहां रसोई गैस के सिलेंडर पर लोगों को subsidy दी जाती है। Clean cooking की तरफ हमारा बल है। लेकिन जब मैंने एक बार लाल किले से लोगों को अपील की लोगों को 15 अगस्‍त को कि अगर आप afford करते हैं तो आपको इतनी subsidy की क्‍या जरूरत है? सालाना 100-1500 रुपया लेकर क्‍या जरूरत है, आप छोड़ते क्‍यों नहीं? मैं आज बड़े संतोष के साथ कह सकता हूं और दुनिया का जो माहौल है उसके सामने भारत में सामान्‍य मानवी ने जो मिसाल दिखाई है, एक उदाहरण है। 

Ten Million से ज्‍यादा लोग, एक करोड़ से ज्‍यादा लोगों ने सिर्फ मेरे कहने मात्र से अपन gas subsidy को surrender कर दिया। मैं समझता हूं ये है partnership. जो गरीब है, सामान्‍य है जिसको अब व्‍यवस्‍था मिलनी चाहिए, जिसको अब व्‍यवस्‍था ने आगे बढ़ाया है, उसने छोड़ने के लिए आगे आना चाहिए। ये प्रयोग मैं समझता हूं, देश को एक नया भारत का परिचय करानी वाली बात है कि आज भी मेरे देश में वो इमानदारी, समाज के लिए कुछ करने की भावना जन-जन में व्‍यापत है और इस सरकार ने उसके साथ अपने-आपको connect किया है। लोगों ने जो गैस सब्सिडी छोड़ी, वो हमने सरकारी खजाने में नहीं डाली। हम तिजोरी भर सकते थे, लेकिन वो हमने काम नहीं किया। हमने उस गैस सब्सिडी का फायदा, जिनको लकड़ी के चूल्‍हे से रोटी पकानी पड़ती थी, जो मां बीमार हो जाती थी, जो environment को नुकसान होता था, हमने करीब 3 करोड़ परिवारों को जिसने कभी गैस का चूल्‍हा नहीं देखा था, clean cooking के लिए सोचा नहीं था, उनको मुफ्त में gas connection दे करके हमने इस बात को और transfer कर दिया। 

ये एक उदाहरण है कि कैसे प्रत्येक कन्ज्यूमर के shared contribution से दूसरे का फायदा होता है और समाज में भी अपने कर्तव्यों के प्रति एक positive, devoted भाव से एक नया माहौल बनता है। 

साथियों, सरकार देश के ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में रहने वाले उपभोक्ताओं के Digital Empowerment के लिए, जैसे आपने उल्‍लेख किया डॉक्टर मुखीसा किटूयी जी ने; प्रधानमंत्री ग्रामीण Digital साक्षरता अभियान चला रही है। इसके तहत 6 करोड़ घरों में और हर घर में एक व्यक्ति को Digital रूप से साक्षर बनाने का एक बहुत बड़ा अभिायान भारत सरकार ने हाथ में लिया है। इस अभियान से गांव के लोगों को Digital लेन-देन, Digital तरीके से सरकारी सेवाओं को प्राप्त करने में और सहूलियत मिलेगी। वो दिन दूर नहीं होगा जब JAM connectivity- जन-धन, आधार, मोबाईल, पूरे governance के केंद्र बिंदु में ये JAM रहने वाला है। जन-धन, आधार, मोबाईल- एक अपने मोबाइल फोन पर वो सरकार से सीधा संपर्क कर सकें, वो दिन दूर नहीं है। लेकिन उसमें humanity source development के तहत भारत के 6 करोड़ ग्रामीण परिवारों में, हर परिवार में एक बंदा digitally literate हो, उसका एक बहुत बड़ा अभियान हमने चलाया है। 

भारत के गांवों में डिजिटल जागरूकता है। भविष्य के लिए एक बहुत बड़ा e-commerce मार्केट को भी बल देने की संभावना मैं देख रहा हूं। Unified Payment Interface- UPI ने e-commerce इंडस्ट्री को एक बहुत बड़ी ताकत दी है। Bharat Interface For Money- यानि BHIM App ने शहरों के अलावा ग्रामीण इलाकों में भी डिजिटल पेमेंट का एक व्‍यापक विस्तार किया है। 

साथियों, सवा सौ करोड़ से ज्यादा की जनसंख्या और तेजी से बढ़ते मिडिल क्लास की वजह से भारत दुनिया के सबसे बड़े बाजारों में से एक है। हमारी अर्थव्यवस्था का खुलापन, दुनिया के हर देश का स्वागत करता है, भारतीय उपभोक्ताओं को Global Players की ओर, और निकट लाने की संभावना बनाता है। Make in India के माध्यम से हम Global Companies को भारत में ही Produce करने और यहां के विशाल मानव संसाधन का बेहतर इस्तेमाल करने के लिए एक platform दे रहे हैं, और निमंत्रण भी दे रहा है। 

साथियों, धरती के इस हिस्से में ये अपनी तरह की पहली conference है। हम में से प्रत्येक देश अपने-अपने तरीके से अपने देश के उपभोक्ताओं के हितों की रक्षा करने में जुटा हुआ है। लेकिन हमें ये भी ध्यान में रखना होगा कि बढ़ते हुए Globalization के साथ पूरा विश्व एक Single Market की ओर आगे बढ़ रहा है। और इसलिए इस तरह के आयोजन के माध्यम से एक दूसरे के अनुभवों से सीखना, Common Understanding के बिंदु तलाशना और Consumer Protection से जुड़े किसी Regional Coalition के निर्माण की संभावनाओं पर चर्चा, मैं समझता हूं बहुत ही अहम है, महत्‍वपूर्ण है। 

400 करोड़ से ज्यादा का consumer base, बढ़ती हुई purchasing power, Young Demographic Profile, हम एशियाई देशो में एक बिजनेस का बहुत बड़ा आधार है। E-commerce और लोगों की बढ़ती Trans-border mobility की वजह से आज Cross-Border Transaction लगातार बढ़ रहा है। ऐसे में Consumer का भरोसा बनाए रखने के लिए ये बहुत आवश्यक है कि हर देश में मजबूत regulatory system हो और उस system के बारे में दूसरे देशों को भी आवश्यक जानकारी हो। दूसरे देशों के उपभोक्ताओ से जुड़े मामलों में तेजी से की गई कार्रवाई करने के लिए Co-operation का frame work होना भी उतना ही आवश्‍यक है। इससे आपसी विश्वास बढ़ेगा और व्यापार की पहली शर्त होती है विश्‍वास। रुपये व्‍यापार को जितना बढ़ाते हैं उससे ज्‍यादा विश्‍वास व्‍यापार को बढ़ाता है। 

Communication के लिए Structured Mechanism बनाना, Best Practices की Mutual Sharing करना, Capacity building के लिए नए Initiatives लेना और Joint Campaigns शुरू करना; ऐसे विषय हैं जिन पर आपसी हितों को ध्यान में रखते हुए कार्य किया जा सकता है। 

साथियों, हमारी सांस्कृतिक और व्यापार की साझा विरासत भविष्य में उतनी ही मजबूत होगी, जितना हमारे बीच भावनात्मक संबंध मजबूत होंगे। अपनी संस्कृति पर गर्व के साथ ही दूसरों की संस्कृति का सम्मान हमारी परंपरा का हिस्सा है। सदियों से हम एक-दूसरे से सीखते रहे हैं और Trade और Consumer Protection भी इससे अछूता नहीं रहा है। 

मुझे उम्मीद है इस conference में भविष्य की चुनौतियों को ध्यान में रखते हुए, एक स्पष्ट vision के साथ आगे बढ़ने का roadmap तैयार होगा। मुझे उम्मीद है कि हम इस conference के माध्यम से एक Regional Co-operation को institutionalize करने में भी सफल होंगे। 

इस कॉन्फ्रेंस में शामिल होने के लिए मैं आपका एक बार फिर से बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद करता हूं, मैं आपका आभार व्यक्त करता हूं और मैं इस conference को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। 

बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद !!!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated Phase 1 of the RO RO (Roll on, Roll off) ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej. This ferry service shall reduce the travel time between Ghogha in Saurashtra, and Dahej in South Gujarat, from about seven or eight hours, to just over an hour. Phase 1, inaugurated today, enables passenger movement. When fully operationalized, this ferry service will also enable movement of vehicles. 

The Prime Minister inaugurated the Sarvottam Cattle Feed Plant of Shree Bhavnagar District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. 

Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that he is happy to be in Gujarat to personally convey new year greetings. He said that this programme, for the launch of a ferry between Ghogha and Dahej, is of vital importance for the entire nation. Noting that this ferry service is a first of sorts, the Prime Minister said it is a dream come true for people of Gujarat. 

He said that the history of human civilisation illustrates the vitality of rivers and maritime trade. Gujarat is the land of Lothal; how can we forget these aspects of our history, he added. This programme is to bring back to life our glorious past; and connect Saurashtra with South Gujarat, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister said that people from these two regions frequently travel to and fro; and this ferry service will save a lot of time, as well as fuel. 

The Prime Minister said that in the last three years, a lot of importance has been given to the development of Gujarat. He said Gujarat has a long coastline, and we should harness the opportunities that arise out of this. He said that steps have been taken in developing coastal infrastructure. This ferry service too, he added, would not be restricted to this one route. He said that other places too would be linked through ferries. He said the goal of the Union Government is to make the transport sector integrated, and state-of-the-art. 

The Prime Minister travelled on the maiden voyage of this service, from Ghogha to Dahej. During this voyage, he was given a briefing about the ship, and the ferry service. He also interacted with divyangjan children on board the ship. 

Addressing a gathering in Dahej, the Prime Minister said that the Government's vision is ports for prosperity. India needs better ports and more ports, he added. Without proper connectivity, the economic development of a nation slows down, he asserted, adding that the Government has focused on port infrastructure. 

The Prime Minister mentioned the Government's stress on the blue economy, which he said is integral to the vision of a new India.

                My dear brothers and sisters,

Friends,

The feelings that a farmer gets after seeing his bumper crop; the feeling that a potter gets when he makes a beautiful water pitcher or earthen pots or earthen lamps, the same joyous feeling that he gets after making them; the experience, the happiness that a weaver gets after weaving a beautiful carpet; I’m experiencing the same thing now. I’m feeling like that I’ve come here after having experienced the desires and emotions of 1.25 billion fellow countrymen just a while ago.

While traveling from Ghogha to Dahej through the sea, every single moment I was thinking that the time which is getting passed at this moment, it is writing a new history, it is opening the doors of a new future. And we will lay a solid foundation for a New India, we will realize the dream of a New India by passing through this door. Everybody from Sardar Patel to Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had dreamt of properly utilizing the people’s power of the country for this thing. And today we have crossed a mile stone of their dreams.

This ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej will not only make the lives of millions and millions of people of Saurashtra and South Gujarat easier, but it will also bring them closer.

This ferry service will kick-start a new era of social and economic development in this entire region. New opportunities of employment will be available to those youth who will take advantage of this facility. A new chapter of coastal shipping and coastal tourism is going to be added with this thing. In the future, all of us, the people who are present here should take note of it; that in future Hazira, Pipavavo, Jafrabad and Daman and Diu, we can link all these important places through this ferry service in future.

I’ve been told that the government has a plan to take this ferry service to Hazira beyond Surat and then up to Mumbai in the coming years. The issue of starting a similar service in the bay of Kutch is being discussed and a lot of progress has been made in this regard. I convey my best wishes to the state government and for this kind of initiatives being taken by them and I assure them that they will get the full cooperation of government of India.

This initiative of the government is a living example of the government’s commitment for the development of entire Southern Gujarat including Dahej. We have specially focused on the centres like Dahej and Hazira for providing momentum to industrial development in the entire South Gujarat in addition to Bharuch. Perhaps, nobody would have been able to think earlier about the kind of work that is being done with regard to the rail network and road linkages in addition to establishment of Petroleum, Chemicals & Petrochemicals Investment Regions.

mphasis has also been laid on the development of infrastructure in Hazira. In the coming days, these regions are also going to benefit from Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. The maritime development of Gujarat is a role model for the entire country. I am hopeful that this project of Ro-Ro ferry service will work like model project for other states as well.

The way we have understood and solved the problems that affect this kind of project by working hard for several years so that this kind of difficulties can be minimized if we need to construct a new project in future; Gujarat has done tremendous work in that direction.

Friends, not just today but for the centuries India has been way ahead of other countries in the field of water transportation. Our techniques used to be far better than that of other countries. However, it is also true that during the period of slavery we gradually stopped learning from our historical advantages; we gradually forgot them. Along with the reduction in new innovations, the existing capabilities of that time also slowly became a part of history. Otherwise, after independence why water transportation was completely neglected, was completely ignored in a country, whose navigational capabilities were recognized by the world for hundreds of years.

Friends, even today the share of roads in transportation sector is 55%, while the share of railways is 35% and waterways that is the cheapest mode, accounts for just 5 or 6%. Although, the share of waterways and coastal transport had been nearly thirty per cent in the third world countries. This is our reality and this is the challenge before us and we have to move ahead with the determination to change this situation.

Today, you will be surprised to know that logistics accounts for 18% of our total economy. It means that in comparison with other countries the cost of moving goods from one part to the other part is costlier in our country. And because of that those things that are required by the poor people get costlier due to transportation cost. We can halve the cost of logistics by encouraging the water transportation and we have all the resources, facilities, means and capabilities; we have all these things to do that.

Friends, in our country we have 7,500 kilometers long coast line and 14,500 kilometers long internal waterways, or river network for waterways. In a way mother India has already blessed us with 21,000 kilometers long waterways. For years we have been sitting idle on this asset and we failed to understand how to utilize this thing.

You will be surprised to know that the first port policy in our country was formulated in 1995. The country got independence in 1947 and the port policy made in 1995, so how much we delayed it? Prior to that the work for the development of ports was not taking place with a long term vision. Things were just functional somehow. And it is true that because of that the country had to suffer the economic loss of billions and billions of rupees.

I give you an example; if we transport coal through waterways then it costs around 20 paisa per ton per kilometer. But when we transport the same coal through railways then it costs Rs. 1.25 per ton per kilometer; the cost of 20 paisa becomes 1.25 rupees and you can think how the cost will be multiplied if we use roads? You tell me that whether we should transport the coal by cheaper means or not? You will be surprised to know that even today 90% coal is being transported through the railways. We have determined to change this situation that’s been in use for decades and the government has been regularly taking new initiatives for this purpose. Friends, when we purchase a new house then we take into account that what kind of connectivity that place has with other areas, whether road is available or not, whether rail service is available or not, whether bus services are available or not if we need to go somewhere.

When we start a new business even then we take into account what kind of connectivity is in that area; whether there will be any problem in the movement of goods in that area or not?

When it is our general approach then this question also arises that why should we establish our industry away from sea shores? If the raw material, if the finished goods produced in the factories are dependent on the connectivity of ports then will it not be prudent to develop the industry along the coastal areas? Not only will it reduce the cost of logistics but it will also help in improving the ease of doing business.

Whatever is required inside the country, the industry for those things can be set up anywhere inside the country; and it must be done. However, whatever is required to be sent to the other countries, whatever is to be exported then if we do these things in coastal areas then it becomes more convenient; it fetches more profits.

Friends, it is being said in the world of transport that if you are solving tomorrow’s problem today then you are already very late. You just imagine, if someone decides to construct a flyover in area which faces traffic jam everyday then the number of vehicles goes up so fast that by the time the flyover gets ready there will be traffic jam on it as well. This was the situation of our country. And that is why the government is working in the transport sector by taking into the account the present needs and the requirements of the future as well. Our formula is P for P, Ports for prosperity. Our ports are the gateways of the prosperity. A project like Sagarmala is reflection of this vision. We have been working on this project while keeping the requirements of 2025, of 2035 in the mind. And under this scheme, the government has been investing massively in more than 400 projects by taking into account the requirements of present times to till 2035.

Investment of more than 8 lakh crore rupees is being lined up for these different projects. Sagarmala project will certainly become a big basis for a New India.

Friends, we need more modern ports to establish strong relations with other countries through the oceans. Ports are like lungs of our economy. If ports become dysfunctional and they don’t work according to their capacity then we will not be able to trade much. As body supplies oxygen sucked by the lungs to its different parts through the veins with the help of heart, similarly, in economy this role is being performed by railways, highways, airways and waterways. If the supply of blood, if the supply of oxygen becomes deficient in the body then it becomes weaker, similarly if there is a lack of proper connectivity then the economic development of the country also starts getting slow. And that is why this government has been deploying the maximum resources in these two sectors – infrastructure and connectivity.

Friends, this is the result of efforts made by the government that a massive change has been brought about in the port sector in the last three years. The capacity that has been added so far, most of it has been added in the last two-three years. And situation of those ports and government companies have improved which have been incurring losses. And the government is also focused on the development of skills related to coastal services.

As per one estimate, in the future due to Sagaramala project alone, there will be potential for creation of one crore jobs in different parts of the country. We have been working with this approach to make the entire framework of transportation modern and integrated.

These days, you people experience traffic jams at several places. Our ports also face this kind of jams and due to these jams at the ports the logistic cost goes up, and waiting time goes up. As we are not able to do any productive work, we only keep waiting once we are stuck in a traffic jam; similarly, the vessels continue to wait for loading and unloading of goods. And it’s not just that vessel but the entire economy gets stuck. It’s extremely essential to modernize the ports and remove the bottlenecks.

Sagarmala project has one more aspect and it is the blue economy. Earlier people only used to talk about the ocean economy but we talk about blue economy. Blue economy means the combination of economy and ecology. Blue economy also nurtures the eco-system of seas along with economic activities.

If the industrial revolution of 18th and 19th centuries took place on the land then the economic revolution of the 21st century will take place through the seas, it will happen through the blue economy.

Friends, given our present requirements and challenges, it is extremely essential that we maximize the use of sea faring prowess of our country. Increased use of the capabilities of the blue economy will become the basis for a New India.

Blue economy can be used for ensuring food security. For example, if our fishermen brothers engage in the production of sea beads, if they add value in it then it can supplement their income. Similarly, blue economy can become a strong basis for New India in the field of energy, in the field of mining and tourism.

Friends, this government is developing a new work culture in the country. A work culture that is accountable and transparent. And today due to this work culture the work on projects have been done at a fast pace. Today, the roads are constructed at twice the speed, the railway tracks are being laid at twice the speed in the country.

The arrangements are being made for using drones and satellites for monitoring of the projects in order to complete them within the stipulated time. There must be some reason that today you people get the passports so quickly. There must be some reason that today you people so easily get the gas cylinders. There must be some reason that now you people don’t have to wait for months to get the income tax refund. These changes have been brought about in your lives and the main reason behind these things is the change that we have brought about in the work culture of the government. It’s such a work culture that ensures delivery of the rights of poor people, the rights of middle class people to them through the use of technology.

Whatever you people taught me in Gujarat that experience has become very useful for me in Delhi. I have been getting the files being dug out and I’ve been ensuring the completion of those projects that have been stuck for decades. We have developed a system called Pragati. Projects worth over Rs. 9 lakh crore have so far been scrutinized through it. The projects that have been stuck for four decades are getting completed at a fast pace after being scrutinized through Pragati. This government is trying to establish an honest economy and an honest social economy in the country. Demonetization has not only ensured that black money stashed in the safes is being deposited in banks but it also provided that kind of proofs to the country that made it possible to start an unprecedented cleansing campaign.

Similarly, the country is getting a new kind of business culture under the GST. We are aware that earlier people used to go out with their trucks and they used to get stuck for hours at check posts. All the check posts have been abolished after the implementation of GST. The truck which used to take five days, now it takes three days to reach its destination. The cost of transporting goods has come down and the corruption worth thousands of crore rupees at those check posts and all such things have also been abolished due to GST. Now please tell me, those who have looted the country so farby working as a contractor, whether they will be angry with Modi or not? Whether they will be angry with Modi or not? Will they be upset with Modi or not? But whether the welfare the citizens of the country should be ensured or not? Whether the citizens of the country should be benefited or not?

There is a business culture under which the entire business is conducted honestly and all the profits are also made honestly. And it’s my experience that no businessman wants to resort to dishonest means. However, some rules and regulations, some officers and politicians apply pressure on him, they compel the poor fellow. We have been working to provide an honest environment to him.

You see the numbers of traders joining the GST is continuously growing. 27 lakh people have been added to the indirect tax net after the implementation of GST.

Friends, I’m aware that some traders who have been coming back to the mainstream are apprehensive about the scrutiny of their past records. I’d like to fully assure them who have been honestly joining the development of the country, who have been coming to the mainstream that no officer will be allowed to harass them due to their previous record.

Brothers and sisters, despite a lot of reforms and tough decisions the economy of the country is on the right track, it’s in the right direction. If we look at the recently released data then the production of coal, electricity and natural gas; the production of all these things has increased substantially. Foreign investors have been making record investments in India. India’s foreign exchange reserve has topped $ 40,000 crores from $ 30,000 crores.

Several experts are in agreement with this thing that the fundamentals of the country’s economy are quite strong. We have taken important steps in the reform sector and this process will continue. And the financial sustainability of the country will also be maintained. We will continue to take step that is necessary to boost the investment and speed up the economic development.

Friends, this is an era of evolving systems. It’s an era of realization of success through solemn pledges. All of us will have to take a solemn pledge for building a New India, and we will have to realize that. Today, a new facility has been created for a New India through the launch of Ghogha-Dahej ferry service here.

Once again I convey my best wishes to you and invite you people to take maximum of advantage of it.

Bharat Mata Ki Jay (Victory to mother India),

Bharat Mata Ki Jay (Victory to mother India),

Bharat Mata Ki Jay (Victory to mother India),

Thank you very much.

                My dear brothers and sisters present here in large numbers 

Best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Deepavali and the New Year; and besides that we have just celebrated the festival of Bhai Dooj and waiting for the festival of Nag Panchami. And today the entire India is getting an invaluable gift from the land of Ghogha in the direction of building a New India, a New Gujarat with a new pledge. Today the first stage of Ro-Ro ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej is getting inaugurated. This is the first of its kind of project in India. It is also the first of its kind of project in the south-east Asia. I congratulate the people of Gujarat and the government of Gujarat for completing this project while using several latest technologies and at a cost of Rs. 650 crores. A big dream of 6.5 crore Gujaratis has been realised with the start of this project. 

Brothers and sisters, 

I also got the opportunity to inaugurate the cattle feed plant of Sarvottam dairy from this platform just a while ago. 

My dear brothers and sisters, 

This is a matter of contention. What is it? It is whether mankind first learnt how to swim or it first learnt how to make a wheel. But it is true that humans always considered it easier to swim across the river, from their village. Gujarat had a thousands of years old history of sea faring. Boats were made here. It was the tradition of this place to make boats and go around the world. Flags of 84 countries used to wave in Lothal. Phalphi University; students of several countries used to study here in Phalphi University around 1700 years ago. But no one knows what happened and all these things were buried under the soil like history. There was a period like that in our history. 

Brothers and sisters, today’s programme, today’s inauguration is an occasion to bring back those old glorious days of Ghogha, Bhavnagar and the coastal areas of Gujarat. This ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej will not only make the lives of millions and millions of people of South Gujarat easier, but it will also bring them closer. The journey that used to take 7-8 hours now that will be completed in one to 1.25 hours. There is a saying in our region that the time is the most precious thing. It is being said that time is the money. Today, no one in the world can turn a day of 24 hours into a day of 25 hours. But this government of India and the government of Gujarat can give you a gift of 7 hours by converting the journey of 7-8 hours into a journey of one hour. As per a study, if the transportation of some goods costs 1.5 rupees by road then if we carry the same amount of goods by rail then it would cost one rupee and if we transport the same amount of goods by waterways then it would cost only 20-25 paise. You can imagine how much of your time will be saved. How much petrol and diesel of the country is going to be saved otherwise lakhs of liters of fuel is being wasted just because of traffic jam. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Nearly, 12,000 people travel daily between Saurashtra and south Gujarat. More than 5,000 thousands vehicles ply daily between these two places to connect them. But when this connectivity will be through the sea instead of the road then this distance of 307 kilometers will be reduced to 31 kilometers. One ferry can carry more than 500 people, or more than 100 cars and equal number of trucks on it. Friends, when a large part of this traffic will become dependent on this ferry service or when people will take their vehicles from this side to that then its impact will also be visible on the highways connecting Delhi and Mumbai. The number of vehicles in the most industrialized region of Gujarat like Dahej, Vadodara and in nearby areas will come down and their speed will increase and that speed will take the entire economic system of this place into the top gear. 

Friends, we can’t achieve the new results with old approach. Neither can we conduct new experiment through old thinking. Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service is a very big example of this thing as well. 

When I became the chief minister and inquired about it, when I discussed the issue which was going on for several decades. But no one knew that this scheme was consigned to which corner. And when I started looking into it, when I started moving ahead; and after assuming the office I wanted to immediately start this thing. You will be surprised to know that the government had made so many several structural mistakes that this Ro-Ro ferry service could have never been materialized. What have they done during the old time? The problem was that the entity which was expected to operate the ferry, they urged the same entity to build the terminal as well. You please tell me if someone runs a bus on the road then do we ask the bus operator to also build the road or to build a bus station? An aircraft lands on the airport; do we ask the airlines to construct an airport? Government constructs the road, bus stations and airports. Private people come forward to run their businesses there. In case of this Ro-Ro ferry service, they said that you will have to build a jetty, its port and if you want to do it then please do that and see this is the sea shore and there is water, please come forward. Friends, who will come forward? Finally we changed the policies. We changed the approach of the previous governments. We decided that the government will build the terminal for this ferry service. After construction of the terminal, the work for operating the terminal and the ferry services will be awarded to a private agency. The soil sediment in the coastal area of this place is also a big problem and due to that it’s difficult to bring ferries to the shores. Under the changed policy, the government decided that the government will bear the cost of dredging, cost of removing the soil and stones. We also made this arrangement that the government will have a share in the profit of the private agency that will run the service. And this new strategy succeeded and as a result of it this Ro-Ro ferry service is getting started between Ghogha and Dahej. 

I came here in 2012 and I laid the foundation stone for this thing. But if we want to do something in the sea then we used to be dependent on the government of India. And at that time that kind of person were occupying the positions in the government of India when I was the chief minister of Gujarat that the development work from Vapi to Mandavi in Kutch in the coastal areas of Gujarat was completely blocked. All our industries have been threatened to be closed down in the name of environment. I know that with what kind of difficulties we were able to take Gujarat forward. But when you people gave me the opportunity to serve in Delhi then all the problems were solved one after another. And today the dedication of the first stage of this Ro-Ro ferry service; and it was a difficult project as the lord Varun Dev was also testing us. The history bears testimony to the fact that whenever there was a problem in constructing a bridge in the sea then the solution was found by churning the same sea. 

Friends, today we have got this success, this water bridge due to the blessings of lord Varuna. I wish while bowing down to him that may the blessings of lord Varuna will always be with the people of Gujarat. And today when we have been launching this Ro-Ro ferry service then I also bow down to Veer Mokhara Ji Dada. And as my fishermen brothers and sisters step forward after offering a coconut to Veer Mokhara Ji Dada, today I will also follow their tradition. And may the blessings of Veer Mokhara Ji ensure the security of our travelers. May Bhavnagar and Saurashtra also develop on the lines of the parts of south Gujarat and may there will be so much progress and I’m fully confident that the blessings of Veer Mokhara Ji will be with us. 

And this project was a challenge both for engineers and for the government of Gujarat. That is why all the people who have been related with this scheme are worthy of appreciation. 

Brothers and sisters, the country’s largest sea front is available with Gujarat. Our coastline is more than 1600 kilometers long. For the hundreds of years Gujarat has been attracting the attention of the entire world due to its strength and capability. The information obtained from Lothal port still surprises top marine experts even today. The place where we are present today, the ships from different parts of the world have been coming here for hundreds of years. I have been talking about the port led development in Gujarat by considering this sea as a heritage from the time when you people have made me the chief minister of the state. After taking into account this thing we have laid special emphasis on the development of infrastructure and other projects in the coastal areas of Gujarat. We made a new policy for ship-building, we developed ship building parks and encouraged smaller ports in the special economic zones and also brought big changes in the rules related to breaking of ships. The government placed special emphasis on building the specialized terminals like solid cargo, chemical and LNG terminals in Dahej, and coal terminal in Mundra. A new direction, new energy and new spirit was given to the port sector of Gujarat by construction of such specialized terminals. 

In addition to these things, the government has especially encouraged the Vessel Traffic Management System and Ground Breaking Connectivity Project. The government has been working in a very detailed manner to set up a maritime university and a maritime museum in Lothal in the coming days. In addition to all these things, we have been continuously running the schemes like Sagar Khedu Vikas Karyakram for the development of my fishermen brothers and local people. We laid emphasis on this thing that the local youth will be trained for this shipping industry and only they will be employed in it. 

We have prepared a complete infrastructure for their education, health, drinking water and electricity along with the coastal social security. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Recently Prime Minister of Japan has paid a visit. At that time we have signed an important agreement with Japan in the shipping sector. And under that agreement, the government of Japan and their financial agency JAICA will provide us money, they will give us financial assistance for the up-gradation, for the moernisation of Alang ship yard. They have agreed for this thing. 

Friends, 

The government has also been working on an alternative road from Bhavnagar to Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard. Around 15 to 25 thousand workers work in the largest Ship Recycling Yard of Asia. Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard is some 50 kilometers away from Bhavnagar. I think I don’t have to tell about the condition of traffic jam on that route. The government has decided to widen and upgrade the alternative route connecting the Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard with Mahuva, Pipavav, Jafrabad and Veraval. Given the fact that the capacity of the Alang Yard will be enhanced in the future so it has become essential to modernize the link road. This route will also benefit the vehicles coming towards the Ghogha-Dahej ferry service. 

Friends, this is the result of consistent efforts made by the government that the coastal areas of Gujarat are developing so fast. Today, Gujarat handles 32% of the total load of the cargo handled by the smaller ports of the country, it means one third is being handled by Gujarat. Not only this, this work has grown by several folds in the last 15 years. And I am hopeful that the way Gujarat has expanded the handling capacity of its ports by four times, in the coming days the work of handling the cargo will pick up more pace. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Gujarat is situated at a very strategic location from the point of view of sea routes. It’s very easy to reach any part of the world through these sea routes. We should take maximum advantage of Gujarat’s strength. And Gujarat’s maritime development is also a model for the entire country. I’m hopeful that this entire project of Ro-Ro ferry service will act like a model for other states as well. 

The way we have understood and solved the problems that affect this kind of project by working hard for several years so that at least those states which want to follow this project will not encounter the same problems. This ferry service will kick-start a new era of social and economic development in this entire region. Thousands of new opportunities of employment will be created. A new chapter of coastal shipping and coastal tourism is going to be added with this thing. In the coming days when a dedicated freight corridor between Delhi and Mumbai will be constructed and when the work on Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor will be complete then the importance of this ferry service along with the other sea routes linking Gujarat will grow by many folds. 

This project is going to provide a new strength to Dholera special investment region (SIR) that has been constructed to connect the industrial development between the areas of Ahmedabad and Bhavnagar. Dholera SIR is going to become the largest industrial centre of not only of India but of the entire world. It will create employment opportunities for millions of people. Due to the efforts made by the Gujarat government the infrastructure related work in Dholera has been going on at a fast pace. In a few years, Dholera will be able to leave its mark in the entire world; and only one land; this Ghogha-Dahej ferry service will also contribute in that thing. 

Friends, in the future, this ferry service is not going to stop only at Ghogha and Dahej. In the future, we are going to move in the direction of linking Hazira, Pipavav, Jafrabad and Daman and Diu through this ferry service. I’ve been told that the government has been working to take this ferry service to beyond Surat and up to Hazira and then up to Mumbai in the coming years. The issue of starting a similar service in the bay of Kutch is being discussed at the primary level at this stage. I have been told that a pre-feasibilty report has already been prepared to start a similar service between Vayu in Kutch and Rozi port of Jamnagar. It’s not just that. When the use of this ferry service will go up then a lot of industries can also be connected through the river Narmada. 

Friends, India’s coastal boundary is 7,500 kilometers long and it is full of the potential for the investment. I believe that our ports are gateways for prosperity. In the last several decades, not much attention was paid to them at the level of central government. And the shipping and port sector of the country have been neglected for a long time. Now the government has started the Sagarmala project to reform this sector and to make it modern. 

Under the Sagarmala project the work of modernizing the existing ports of the country and development of new ports is being carried out. Roads, railroads, interstate-waterways and coastal transport are being integrated. This scheme is playing an extremely important role in boosting the transportation of goods through the coastal transport. 

Friends, this is the result of efforts made by the government that a massive change has been brought about in the port sector in the last three years. And the maximum capacity addition has taken place in the last two-three years. And the situation of those ports and government companies have been improving which have been incurring losses. And the government is also focused on the development of skills related to coastal services. As per one estimate, there will be potential for creation of one crore jobs in different parts of the country in the future due to Sagaramala project alone. We have been working with this approach to make the entire framework of transportation modern and integrated. 

The imbalances of the transport sector of our country have also been removed. You can understand the level of imbalance from the fact that even after so many years of independence our country only had five national waterways. This sector was neglected despite the water transportation was cheap and the rivers of the country were full of water. And now this government has constituted 106 National Waterways and the work is taking place on them at a rapid pace. The total length of these national waterways is more than 17,000 kilometers. And these waterways have proved extremely helpful in removing the imbalances of the country’s transportation sector. 

Our sea assets can provide a new dimension to our rural and coastal areas. The government has started Blue Revolution Scheme so that fishermen brothers can take full advantage of this asset. They have been trained about the modern techniques of fishing and value addition in the fisheries. 

Today, under the Blue Revolution Scheme a scheme has been prepared to provide financial assistance to fishermen for procuring longliner trollers. Central government will provide a subsidy of Rs. 40 lakh per vessel. These longliner trollers will not only make the lives of fishermen easier but they will also provide a new economic strength to their business. The kind of trollers that have been used as of now they are meant for catching fish in the shallow water. These are very old in terms of technology and very risky as well. That is why when they go out in the sea on these trollers then often they lose the way. And they don’t even get to know that when they have gone beyond India’s maritime boundary and have crossed into the maritime boundary of some other country. Thereafter they have to face several difficulties. We can minimize those difficulties by maximizing the use of technology and that is why the government has made this scheme with the help of these Longliner trollers so that the fishermen brothers can go deep in the sea and also in the right direction to catch the fish. These modern Longliner trollers are also very energy efficient. It means they will increase both the business and profit of fishermen while ensuring their safety. 

Friends, development of infrastructure is one of our top priorities. The kind of investment that has been made in the last three years in Highways, Railways, Waterways and Airways; this kind of investment was never made in such a short span of time. Besides, regional air service is being improved by making a new Aviation Policy. Small airports are being modernized. The work on the first bullet train of the country has been started a few weeks ago. All these works will become the basis for providing the country a transport system of the 21st century, such a transport system that will be as per the hopes and requirement of a New India. 

Friends, today, I will go from Ghogha to Dahej through the ferry. And some differently abled kids, children will be with me. And the happiness on their faces will be my reward. 

Brothers and sisters, perhaps, nobody can imagine how I have felt after completing the work that was my dream since my childhood days. The thing that I heard about during my childhood but which was never materialized and today when I see that thing through my own eyes and I myself got the opportunity to work on that, I think it’s a very fulfilling moment of my life. I consider it my good fortune. I will go to Dahej and will share my experience there. But today I would request you people to join us in this very important work and please consider that this ferry service is the first thing, it’s just the beginning and this is the first stage and private companies will forward at a later stage and a lot of ferry services, a lot of new routes will be started and development of tourism will also take place. 

And the rich people of Surat will hire this and go out in the sea to celebrate their birthdays. There are immense opportunities for development. And that is why I have said once again that the fortune of Ghogha is about to be changed. The fortune of Ghogha is getting changed once again. And once again I congratulate all of you for the Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service and the cattle feed plant of Sarvottam Dairy. 

Many-many thanks to all of you.

                यहां उपस्थित विशाल संख्‍या में पधारे हुए मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयो और बहनों, 

आप सबको दीपावली और नवीन वर्ष की शुभकामनाओं के साथ, अभी हम लोगों ने भाई दूज का त्‍यौहार मनाया नागपंचमी के त्‍यौहार का इंतजार कर रहे हैं और नये संकल्‍प के साथ, नये भारत, नये गुजरात के निर्माण की दिशा में आज एक अनमोल उपहार घोघा की धरती से पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान को मिल रहा है। आज घोघा दहेज के बीच Ro-Ro ferry service का प्रथम चरण का शुभारंभ किया जा रहा है। ये भारत में अपनी तरह का पहला project है। यही दक्षिण पूर्वी एशिया का भी ये इतना बड़ा पहला project है। मैं गुजरात के लोगों को, यहां की सरकार को, 650 करोड़ रूपयों का ये project, अनेक आधुनिक तकनीक के साथ परिपूर्ण करने के लिए बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। इस project की शुरूआत के साथ साढ़े छ: करोड़ गुजरातियों का एक बहुत बड़ा सपना पूरा हुआ है। भाईयो बहनो 

अभी इस मंच से मुझे सर्वोत्‍तम डेयरी cattle feed plant के उद्घाटन का भी अवसर मिला है। 

मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयो बहनों, एक विवाद का विषय है। क्‍या? मनुष्‍य जात ने सबसे पहले तैरना सीखा था कि पहिया बनाना सीखा था। कोई तय नहीं कर पाता था कि पहले पहिया बना कि पहले इंसान तैरना सीखा। लेकिन ये सही है कि मानव जात सदियों से तैर कर नांव से नदी पार करना उसने हमेशा सरल माना, आसान माना। गुजरात के हजारों साल का सामुद्रिक यात्रा का इतिहास रहा है। नांव बनती यहां थी। नाव लेकर दुनिया में जाकर लोगों की परंपरा थी। लोथल 84 देशों के झंडे यहां पर फहरते थे। फलफी यूनिवर्सिटी 1700 साल पहले अनेक देशों के बच्‍चे हमारे यहां फलफी यूनिवर्सिटी में पढ़ते थे। लेकिन पता नहीं क्‍या हुआ सब कुछ इतिहस की तरह नीचे जमीन में दब गया। वो भी तो एक जमाना था। 

भाईयो बहनों, आज का ये programme, आज का ये प्रारंभ घोघा, भावनगर, गुजरात के समुद्र तक के वो पुराने भव्‍य दिवसों को वापिस लाने का अवसर है। घोघा-दहेज के बीच से फेरी सर्विस सवा सौ दक्षिण गुजरात के करोड़ो लोगों की जिंदगी को न सिर्फ आसान बनाएगी बल्कि उन्‍हें और निकट ले आएगी। जिस सफर में 7-8 घंटे लगते थे। वो सफर एक सवा घंटे में पूरा किया जा सकेगा। हमारे यहां कहा जाता है सबसे मुल्‍यवान चीज समय होता है। time is money ये कहा जाता है। आज दुनिया में कोई 24 घंटे के, 25 घंटे नहीं कर सकता है। लेकिन ये भारत सरकार और गुजरात सरकार है कि आपके 24 घंटों में से एक घंटे की सफर करके, सात घंटे की सौगात दे सकता है। एक study कहती है कि सामान को ले जाने में अगर सड़क के रास्‍ते डेढ़ रूपये का खर्च होता है, तो उतना ही सामान ले जाने के लिए रेल के जरिये एक रूपया लगता है, लेकिन वही सामान अगर हम जलमार्ग से ले जाएं तो सिर्फ 20-25 पैसे में ले जा सकते हैं। आप सोच सकते हैं कि आपका कितना समय बचने जा रहा है। देश का कितना पेट्रोल डीजल बचने वाला है। वरना लाखों लीटर इंधन तो जब ट्रेफिक जाम हो जाता है, वहीं पर बरबाद हो जाता है। 

भाईयो और बहनों, सौराष्ट्र और दक्षिण गुजरात के बीच हर रोज लगभग 12 हजार लोग यात्रा करते हैं। पांच हजार से ज्‍यादा गाड़ियाँ हर रोज इन दो क्षेत्रों को connect करने के लिए सड़कों पर दौड़ती हैं। जब यही connectivity सड़क के बजाय समुद्र से होगी, तो 307 किलोमीटर की दूरी 31 किलोमीटर में बदल जाएगी। एक फेरी अपने साथ 500 से ज्‍यादा लोग, 100 के लगभग कारें, 100 के करीब ट्रकें ये अपने साथ लेकर के जा सकती है। साथियों जब ट्रेफिक का बड़ा हिस्‍सा इस फेरी सर्विस पर निर्भर हो जाएगा। या जब अपनी-अपनी गाड़ियाँ इधर से उधर ले जाएंगे। तो इसका प्रभाव दिल्‍ली और मुंबई को connect करने वाले रास्‍तों पर भी पड़ने वाला है। गुजरात के सबसे ज्‍यादा औद्योगिकरण वाले क्षेत्र जैसे दहेज, बड़ोदरा और उसके आस-पास के मार्गों पर गाडि़यों की संख्‍या कम होगी, गाडि़यों की रफ्तार बढ़ेगी और तेजी यहां के पूरे economy system को top-gear में ले जाएगी। 

साथियों, हम पुरानी approach के साथ नए नतीजे प्राप्‍त नहीं कर सकते हैं। न ही पुरानी सोच के साथ नए प्रयोग किए जा सकते हैं। Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service इसका भी बहुत बड़ा उदाहरण है। 

मैं जब मुख्‍यमंत्री बना और खोज खबर ली इस पर चर्चा की, तो कई दशकों से होकर रहे थे। लेकिन ये योजना पता नहीं किस कोने में पड़ी थी। अब जब मैं इसमें जाने लगा आगे बढ़ने लगा। मेरे आने के बाद मैं चाहता था तुरंत शुरू हो, आप हैरान हो जाएंगे कि सरकार ने ऐसी structural गलतियां की थी कि कभी Ro-Ro ferry service हो ही नहीं सकता। पुराने जमाने में क्‍या काम किया था इन्‍होंने? समस्‍या ये थी कि जिसे ferry चलानी थी, उसी से आग्रह किया जाता था कि तुम भी टर्मिनल बनाओ। क्‍या मुझे बताइये, रोड के उपर कोई बस दौड़ाता है, तो बस वाले को हम कहते हैं कि रोड बनाओं, बस वाले को कहते हैं कि बस स्‍टेशन बनाओ! एयर पोर्ट पर विमान आता है क्‍या मैं विमान वाले को कहता हूं कि एयरपोर्ट बनाओ? एयरपोर्ट सरकार बनाती हैं, बस स्‍टेशन सरकार बनाती हैं, रोड सरकार बनाती हैं। उस पर दौड़ने के लिए private लोग व्‍यापार के लिए आते हैं। Ro-Ro ferry service में उन्‍होंने कह दिया एक Jetty बनानी है, उसका पोर्ट बनाना है, आपको करना है तो करो ये समुद्र का किनारा है, ये पानी है आगे बढ़ो। कौन बढ़ेगा भाई? आखिरकर हमनें नीतिया बदली, पुरानी सरकारों के इस approach को हमने बदल दिया। हमने तय किया कि ferry service के लिए टर्मिनल बनाने का काम सरकार करेगी। टर्मिनल बन जाने के बाद उसका संचालन और ferry चलाने का काम private agency को दिया जाएगा। यहां के ‘रब’ समुद्र क्षेत्र में तलहाटी में जमीन मिट्टी भी बड़ी समस्‍या होती है। इस वजह से ferry को किनारे तक आने में दिक्‍कत होती है। बदली हुई रणनीति के तहत सरकार ने भी तय किया कि मिट्टी निकालने के लिए पत्‍थर हटाने के लिए dredging का काम भी, सरकार उसका खर्चा उठाएगी। हमने ये भी व्‍यवस्‍था बनाई कि इस सर्विस के बाद private agency को जो लाभ होगा, उसमें सरकार की भी भागीदारी होगी। ये नई रणनीति सफल रही। और इसी का परिणाम है कि Ghogha-Dahej के बीच Ro-Ro ferry service प्रारंभ हो रही है। 

2012 में मैं आया था। इसका शिलान्‍यास मैंने किया था। लेकिन तब समुद्र में कुछ काम करना है। तो हम जरा भारत सरकार पर dependent रहते थे। और भारत सरकार में ऐसे लोग बैठे थे उस समय, जब मैं गुजरात का मुख्‍यमंत्री था। वापी लेकर के कच्‍छ के मांडवी तक गुजरात के समुद्री तट पर विकास पर पूरा प्रतिबंध लगा दिया गया। हमारी सारी industries को पर्यावरण के नाम पर ताले लगाने की धमकियां दी गईं थी। मैं जानता हूं कितनी कठिनाईयों से हमने गुजरात को आगे बढ़ाने में सफलता पाई थी। लेकिन जब दिल्‍ली में आप सबने मुझे सेवा करने का मौका दिया एक के बाद एक समस्‍याएं सुलझती गईं। और आज Ro-Ro ferry service 

का लोकार्पण करने का प्रथम चरण का और ये project कठिन था। वरूण देव जी हमारी परीक्षा लेते रहे। लेकिन इतिहास गवाह है जब सेतू के निर्माण में किसी तरह की बाधा आई तो समुद्र मंथन में से ही अमृत भी निकल कर आया। 

साथियों आज हमें वरूण देव की आर्शीवाद से ये अमृत मिला है। जो जलसेतू मिला है। मैं शीश झुकाकर के ये कामना करता हूं कि वरूण देव का आर्शीवाद हमेशा की तरह गुजरात के लोगों के साथ रहे। और आज जब हम आज ये Ro-Ro ferry service का प्रारंभ कर रहे हैं तब, मैं वीर मोखरा जी दादा को भी नमन करता हूं। और जैसे मेरे मछुवारे भाई बहन वीर मोखरा जी दादा को नरियल कराके करके आगे बढ़ते हैं। मैं भी उनकी परंपरा का आज पालन करूंगा। और वीर मोखरा जी के आर्शीवाद से हमारी यात्रियों की सुरक्षा बनी रहे। भावनगर और सौराष्ट्र, दक्षिण गुजरात के हिस्‍से की तरह आगे बढ़ जाएं, इतनी प्रगति हो और वीर मोखरा जी के आर्शीवाद हम पर बने रहेंगे, ये मुझे पूरा विश्‍वास है। 

ये project इंजीनियरों और गुजरात सरकार दोनों के लिए ही एक बहुत बड़ी चुनौती था। इसलिए जो भी लोग इस परियोजना से जुड़े हैं, वे सब के सब बधाई के पात्र हैं। 

भाईयो और बहनों, गुजरात में देश का सबसे बड़ा sea front उपलब्‍ध है। 1600 किलोमीटर से भी ज्‍यदा हमारा समुद्री तट है। सैंकड़ों वर्षों से गुजरात अपनी शक्ति और सामर्थ्‍य से पुरी दुनिया का ध्‍यान अपनी ओर खींचता रहा है। लोथल पोर्ट से निकली जानकारियां आज भी बड़े-बड़े marine experts को अचभिंत करती है। जिस जगह पर हम सभी उपस्थित हैं, वहां पर सैंकड़ों वर्षों से दुनिया के अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों से जहाज आते रहे हैं। इस समुद्र को विरासत समझते हुए, देखते हुए मैं उसी समय से गुजरात में port led development की बात कर रहा हूं। जब आपने मुझे मुख्‍यमंत्री के पद पर बिठाया। इसी को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए हमने गुजरात के coastal इलाके में Infrastructure और Development के दूसरे projects पर विशेष ध्‍यान दिया। हमने Ship-Building इसकी नई policy बनाई, Ship Building Park बनाए। Special Economic Zones में छोटे पोर्ट को बढ़ावा दिया जाए। Ship-breaking के नियमों में भी बढ़े बदलाव किए गए। सरकार ने Specialized Terminals के निर्माण पर भी विशेष जोर लगाया, जैसे दहेज में Solid Cargo, Chemical और LNG Terminal, मुंद्रा में Coal Terminal ऐसे Specialized Terminals से गुजरात के port-sector को एक नई दिशा, नई ऊर्जा और नई चेतना प्राप्‍त हुई है। 

इसके साथ ही सरकार ने Vessel Traffic Management System और Ground Breaking Connectivity Project को भी विशेष रूप से बढ़ावा दिया। सरकार आने वाले दिनों में Maritime University बनाने और लोथल में Maritime Museum बनाने पर भी बहुत विस्‍तार से काम इन दिनों चल रहा है। इन सारे कार्यों के साथ ही यहां रहने वाले मेरे मछुवारे भाई बंघु और स्‍थानिय लोगों का विकास हो, इसके लिए सागर-खेड़ू विकास कार्यक्रम जैसी योजनाएं भी हम लगातार चला रहे हैं। इसी बात पर भी जोर दिया कि Shipping Industry में स्‍थानिय युवाओं को प्रशिक्षित करके उन्‍हें ही रोजगार दिया जाएगा। 

उनकी शिक्षा, स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य, पीने के पानी, बिजली के साथ ही हमने Coastal Social Security का भी पूरा infrastructure तैयार किया। 

भाईयो और बहनों, अभी हाल ही में जापान के प्रधानमंत्री आए थे। उस समय हमने जापान के साथ Shipping Sector को लेकर के एक महत्‍वपूर्ण समझौता किया। इस समझौते के तहत जापान सरकार और वहां की एक वित्‍तीय संस्‍था JAICA, Alang shipyard में up-gradation के लिए उसके modernization के लिए हमें वित्‍तीय सहयोग देंगे, हमें धन देंगे। इसके लिए वो तैयार हुए हैं। 

साथियों, सरकार भावनगर से Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard तक के लिए एक alternative road भी उस पर भी काम कर रही है। एशिया के सबसे बड़े Ship Recycling Yard में 15 से 25 हजार कर्मचारी काम करते हैं। Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard भावनगर से करीब 50 किलोमीटर दूर है। अभी जो route उस पर काफी जाम की कितनी दिक्‍कत रहती है। मुझे लगता है वो मुझे बताने की जरूरत नहीं है। सरकर ने ये तय किया है Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yard और मअुवा, पीपावाओ और जाफराबाद, वैरावल को जोड़ने वाला जो एक वैकिल्‍पक रूट है उसे चौड़ा किया जाएगा, upgrade किया जाएगा। भविष्‍य में Alang Yard की क्षमता भी बढ़ने जा रही है और उसे देखते हुए बीच सड़क का आधुनिकीकरण आवश्‍यक हो गया है। इस रूट से Ghogha-Dahej ferry service के लिए आ रही गाडि़यों को भी फायदा होने वाला है। 

साथियों, सरकार के लगातार प्रयास का नतीजा है कि गुजरात के coastal आज इतनी तेजी से विकस हो रहा है। आज गुजरात पूरे देश में छोटे पोर्ट के जरिए होने वाले कुल cargo की आवाजाही का 32 प्रतिशत अकेला गुजरात handle करता है। यानि एक तिहाई गुजरात में होता है। इतना ही नहीं इस काम में पिछले 15 वर्षों में गुना बढ़ोतरी हुई है। मुझे उम्‍मीद है कि जिस तरह पिछले 15 साल में गुजरात ने अपने ports की क्षमता को भी चार गुना बढ़ाया है, cargo handling की रफ्तार भी और तेज होगी। 

भाईयो और बहनों, गुजरात मार्ग की दृष्टि से बहुत ही strategic location पर है। यहां से दुनियां के किसी भी भू-भाग तक समुद्री मार्ग से पहुंचना बहुत ही आसान, सस्‍ता और सरल रास्‍ता है। हमें गुजरात की शक्ति का भरपूर फायदा उठाना चाहिए। गुजरात का maritime development भी पूरे देश के लिए एक model है। मुझे उम्‍मीद है कि Ro-Ro ferry service का पूरा project भी दूसरे राज्‍यों के लिए भी एक model project की तरह काम करेगा। 

हमनें जिस तरह बरसों की मेहनत के बाद इस तरह के project में आने वाली दिक्‍कतों को समझा है, उन्‍हें दूर किया है। वो दिक्‍कतें कम से कम इसे दोहराने वालों राज्‍यों को कभी नहीं आएगी। इस ferry service से पूरे क्षेत्र में सामाजिक, आर्थिक विकास का एक नया दौर शुरू होगा। रोजगार के हजारों नये अवसर बनेगें। Coastal Shipping और Coastal Tourism का भी नया अध्‍याय आरंभ होगा। आने वाले दिनों में जब दिल्‍ली और मुबंई के बीच Dedicated Freight Corridor बन जाएगा और साथ ही दिल्‍ली-मुबंई Industrial Corridor का काम पूरा हो जाएगा तो इस सर्विस समेत गुजरात से जुड़े समुद्री मार्ग का महात्‍मय भी कई गुना बढ़ जाएगा। ये project अहमदाबाद और भावनगर के बीच के इलाकों में औद्योगिक विकास को एक करने के लिए बनाए गये Dholera special investment region (SIR) को भी एक नई मजबूती देने वाला है। Dholera SIR भारत ही नहीं विश्‍व के नक्‍शे पर विकसित होने वाला ये सबसे बड़ा औद्योगिक केंद्र होने वाला है। इससे लाखों लोगों के लिए नए रोजगार के अवसर बनेगें। गुजरात सरकार के प्रयास से Dholera में infrastructure से जुड़े काम तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। कुछ ही वर्षों में Dholera पूरी दुनिया में अपनी धाक जमाएगा और उसमें एक ही भूमि का, Ghogha -Dahej ferry service का भी योगदान होगा। 

साथियों, भविष्‍य में हम इस ferry service को ये सिर्फ Ghogha-Dahej तक रूकने वाला नहीं है। भविष्‍य में हम इस ferry service को हम हजीरा, पीपावाओ, जाफराबाद, दमन-द्वीप इन सभी जगह पर जोड़ने की दिशा में आगे बढ़ने वाले हैं मुझे बताया गया है। कि सरकार की तैयारी आने वाले वर्षों में इस ferry service को सूरत से आगे हजीरा और फिर मुंबई तक ले जाने के लिए भी चल रही है। कच्‍छ की खाड़ी में भी इसी तरह का project शुरू किए जाने की चर्चा अभी प्राथमिक स्‍तर पर चल रही है। मुझे बताया गया है। कि कच्‍छ के वायु और जामनगर के rozi बंदर के बीच ऐसी सेवा शुरू करने के लिए pre-feasibilty report already तैयार हो चुकी है। इतना ही नहीं जब ferry service का इस्‍तेमाल बढ़ेगा तो तमाम उद्योगों को नर्मदा नदी के माध्‍यम से भी connect किया जा सकता है। 

साथियों, भारत की विशाल समुद्री सीमा 7500 किलोमीटर लंबी है। निवेश की बड़ी संभावनाओं से भरी हुई है। मेरा मानना रहा है कि हमारे समुद्री तट देश की प्रगति के gateway हैं। भारत की समृद्धि के प्रवेश द्वार हमारे बंदर होते हैं। लेकिन बीते दशकों में केंद्रीय स्‍तर से इन पर कम ही ध्‍यान दिया गया। देश का shipping और port sector भी लंबे समय तक उपेक्षित रहा। इस sector को सुधारने के लिए उसे आधुनिक बनाने के लिए सरकार ने सागरमाला कार्यक्रम भी शुरू किया है। 

सागरमाला परियोजना के तहत देश में मौजूदा ports उसका modernization और नये पोर्ट के development का काम किया जा रहा है। सड़क रेलमार्ग Interstate-Waterways और Coastal Transport को integrated किया जा रहा है। ये परियोजना Coastal Transport के जरिये माल ढुलाई को बढ़ाने में बहुत अहम भूमिका निभा रही है। 

साथियों, सरकार के प्रयासों का ये नतीजा है कि पिछले तीन वर्षों में Port Sector में बहुत बड़ा परिवर्तन आया है। और अभी तक का सबसे ज्‍यादा capacity addition पिछले दो या तीन वर्ष में हुआ है। जो port और सरकारी कंपनिया घाटे में चल रही थी, उनमें भी परिस्थिति बदल रही है। सरकार का ध्‍यान coastal service से जुड़ी skill development पर भी है। एक अनुमान के मुताबिक अकेले सागरमाला project से आने वाले समय में एक करोड़ जितनी नई नौकरियों के हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में अवसर पैदा हो सकते हैं। हम इस approach के साथ काम कर रहे हैं कि transportation का पूरा framework आधुनिक और integrated हो। 

हमारे देश में transport नीतियों में जो असंतुलन था, उसे भी दूर किया जा रहा है। ये असंतुलन इतना ज्‍यादा था वो आप इसी से समझ सकते हैं कि आजादी के इतने वर्षों बाद भी हमारे यहां सिर्फ पांच National Waterways थे। water transport में इतना सस्‍ता होना और देश की नदियों का जल होने का बावजूद इसे नजरअंदाज कर दिया गया। अब इस सरकार ने 106 National Waterways का गठन किया गया है। और इस पर तेजी से काम चल रहा है। इस National Waterways की कुल लंबाई 17000 किलोमीटर से भी ज्‍यादा है। ये Waterways देश के transport sector देश के असंतुलन को देर करने में बहुत मददगार साबित हुई है। 

हमारी सामुद्रिक संपदा हमारे ग्रामीण और समुद्री तट को एक नया आयाम दे सकती है। मछुआरे भाई इस संपदा का पूरा इस्‍तेमाल कर पाएं इसके लिए सरकार ने Blue Revolution Scheme को शुरू किया है। उन्‍हें आधुनिक तकनीक का इस्‍तेमाल करते हुए मछली पकड़ने और मछली पालन में value-addition के बारे में सिखाया जा रहा है। 

Blue Revolution Scheme के अंतर्गत आज मछुआरों को Longliner trollers के लिए आर्थिक मदद देने की भी योजना बनाई है। एक vessel पर केंद्र सरकार की तरफ से चालीस लाख रूपये की सब्सिडी दी जाएगी। Longliner trollers का ने सिर्फ मछुआरों की जिंदगी आसान बनाएगें बल्कि वो उनके कारोबार को भी नई आर्थिक मजबूती देंगे। अभी जिस तरह ये trollers का इस्‍तेमाल किया जाता है, वो कम पानी में मछली पकड़ने के काम आते हैं। तकनीक के मामले में भी ये बहुत पुराने हैं risky हैं। इसलिए जब इन पुराने trollers को लेकर के वे समुद्र जाते हैं तो अक्‍सर रास्‍ता भटक जाते हैं। उन्‍हीं पता तक नहीं चलता कि भारत की समुद्री सीमा छोड़कर, दूसरे देश की समुद्र सीमा में पहुंच गये। इसके बाद मछुआरों को कई तरह की दिक्‍कत उठानी पड़ती है। तकनीक का ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा इस्‍तेमाल करके हम इन दिक्‍कतों को कम कर सकते हैं और इसलिए हमने ये Longliner trollers की मदद से मछुआरे भाई समुद्र में सही दिशा में दूर तक गहरे पानी में मछली पकड़ने के लिए जा सके इसके सरकार मदद करने की योजना बनाई है। आधु‍निक Longliner trollers ईंधन के मामले में भी काफी किफायती होते हैं। यानि मछुआरों की सुरक्षा बढ़ाने के साथ-साथ उनका व्‍यापार और मुनाफा दोनों बढ़ाएगें। 

साथियों देश में infrastructure का विकास हमारी सबसे बड़ी प्राथमिकताओं में से एक है। पिछले तीन वर्षों में Highways, Railways, Waterways और Airways पर जितना निवेश किया गया है। उतना पहले इतने कम समय में कभी नहीं हुआ। इसके अलावा नई Aviation Policy बनाकर Regional Air Service को सुधारा जा रहा है। छोटे-छोटे हवाई अड्डों का आधुनिकीकरण किया जा रहा है। कुछ हफते पहले ही अहमदाबाद से मुंबई के बीच चलने वाली देश की पहली बुलेट ट्रेन का भी काम शुरू किया जा चुका है। ये सारे प्रयास देश को इक्‍सवीं सदी के transport system देने का आधार बनेगें। एक ऐसा transport system जो New India की आवश्‍यकता हो New India की उम्‍मीदों के मुताबिक। साथियों आज यहां Ghogha से मैं ferry के माध्‍यम से ही दहेज़ तक जाऊंगा। मेरे साथ मेरे कुछ नन्‍हें साथी, दिव्‍यांग बच्‍चे भी होंगे। उनके चेहरे की खुशी ही मेरा पारिश्रमिक होगा। 

भाईयो-बहनों, से बचपन से जिस कार्य का सपना देखा था, वो पूरा होने के बाद मैंने ऐसा अनुभव किया इसकी कल्‍पना शायद कोई नहीं कर सकता है। बचपन में जिस बात को सुना था और हो नहीं रहा था, आज जब अपनी आंखों के सामने देख पर रहा हूं और खुद को उस काम को करने का मौका मिला, मैं समझता हूं कि मेरे जीवन का बहुत धन्य पल है। मैं इसे अपना सौभाग्‍य मानता हूं। दहेज मैं जाऊंगा अपने अनुभव वहां बाटूंगा। लेकिन मैं आज आपसे आग्रह करूंगा कि इस महत्‍वपूर्ण काम में आप हमारे साथ जुडि़ए और ये मानिए ये ferry service तो शुरूआत है, ये पहला चरण है। बाद में प्राइवेट कंपनिया आएंगी ढेर सारी फेरिया चलेंगी। रूट चलेंगे, tourism development होगा। और सूरत के हमारे धनी लोग इसको हम hire करके जन्‍म दिन मनाने के लिए भी समुद्र में जाएंगे। बहुत बड़ी विकास की संभावनाए हैं। और इसलिए मैंने कहा कि घोघा का भाग्‍य फिर एक बार बदलने वाला है। घोघा का भाग्‍य फिर एक बार बदल रहा है। और एक बार फिर आप सभी को Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service और सर्वोत्‍त्‍म डेयरी के cattle freed plant के लिए मैं बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं। आप सबको बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद देता हूं। 



भारत माता की जय,

                Join me chanting in full strength,” Jay Jay Kedar”.

My best wishes to all the brothers and sisters in the divine land of Uttarakhand; I have just one desire, may Baba Kedar continue to bless everyone.

The auspicious festival of Deepavali was celebrated in the country and across the world only yesterday. I convey my best wishes to all the brothers and sisters in the country and around the world for this auspicious festival from this holy land of Kedarnath.

There are some states like Gujarat where the new year starts today. Greetings on the occasion of the new year; many congratulations! I convey my best wishes to all those families around the world who begin their new year today. Greetings to all of you on the occasion of new year. Happy new year! Once again Baba has summoned me. Once again I have reached here at the feet of the lord. Once again I got the opportunity to meet the old acquaintances. Today, they again reminded me what they would have heard of me.

This Garuda Chatti, at one point of time I got an opportunity to spend several years of my life here. But, perhaps, it was not the Lord’s will that I spend my whole life at his feet and that’s why he sent me back. Perhaps the Lord thought, why should I serve just one god as there are 1.25 billion gods in the country to serve.  There is a saying that service to the people is just the same as the service to God. And that is why the service to 1.25 billion people is equal to the service of the Lord, it is equal to the service of Badri Vishal, it is equal to the service to Mandakini and it is equal to service to mother Ganges. And that is why once again after making a solemn pledge with new energy from here and with the blessings of Bhole Baba, with a clean mind and concrete determination every Indian makes a solemn pledge to take the country to the top of the world by 2022, the 75thanniversary of India’s independence.

        With this solemn pledge, at the outset I pay my tributes to all those people who lost their lives in this holy land due to the natural calamity. They came from all the states.  At that time I was chief minister of a state and I had no right to encroach upon the work of other states. I can never think of doing that thing. However, I could not help myself. Whether I was right or wrong, this will be decided by the history. But I reached out to those victims  and I came here.

And I made a request to the government at that time that please allow the Gujarat government to carry out the work of rebuilding Kedarnath and I will try to meet the expectations of my fellow countrymen. We were sitting in a room, the then chief minister of the state agreed, all the officers also agreed and they said that Modi Ji it will be good if Gujarat took the responsibility. And I expressed my pledge before the media after coming out of the meeting. The news flashed on TV that Modi was now taking the responsibility of rebuilding Kedarnath. I don’t know what kind of upheaval it created in Delhi. Within an hour such a pressure was built on the state government that it had to announce that it did not need help of Gujarat to deal with the issue. It’s fine, if the people sitting in Delhi were feeling problem then why should I trouble anyone? I stepped back. However, perhaps the lord had decided then that this work will be done by one of his sons.

And when Bhartiya Janta Party’s government was formed here and the people of Uttarakhand overwhelmingly supported us then it strengthened my belief that now the Lord has decided that I would have to finish this task and that is why I have come back here before the closure of the temple’s doors and once again I make a pledga at the Lord’s feet.  Today the foundation is being laid for a grand redevelopment work within the stipulated time.  What kind of pilgrim centre it should be, what kind of arrangements should be made for the priests, how to take care of all the needs of the priests, how to make arrangements for a more comfortable life for them that is bigger than the hardships suffered by them, how to make arrangements for it? The roadmap for redevelopment has been prepared while keeping all these in mind. I myself took the meetings, I was taking care of everything; what kind of design it will be? What will be the architecture? How the rebuilding work will be carried out while following the architecture of our temples and also following all those rules and regulations? The roadmap for its development has been prepared keeping all these things in the mind.

In a way, the houses that will be given to the priests, they will be three-in-one. The arrangement for serving the travelers should be made on the ground floor, all such arrangements will be made there. They themselves will stay on the first floor and their guests and personal guests will stay on the floors above that level. Round the clock electricity and water will be provided and all the arrangements for cleanliness will be ensured and this entire road will be made very wide. And then a separate facility will be created for the priests. We will also create facilities for buying worship related stuff, for buying pilgrimage related stuff for a very large number of travelers if they need to buy something after coming here; we will have that facility. We will make all the arrangements be it a post office or be it a bank or facility of telephones and also the facilities for using computers.

Today, five projects are starting here. First, as I just said, the widening of this road, it will be made of RCC and it will have all the modern facilities. As soon as a traveler starts his journey, he will get to listen the music being played at the banks of Mandakini, he will walk towards this side while listening that music lost in the devotion.

The work of constructing a wall on the bank of Mandakini will be done. In a way it is related to providing the seating facility to the travelers, this kind of arrangements should be there so that they can hear the sound of the flowing river. As I just said, the approach road, such an approach road will be constructed that will make it very grand, will make it look like divine. And its lighting will be similar to the lighting arrangement made at the retaining wall on the bank of river Mandakini. And one more embankment will be constructed because the power of the source of water can be experienced on both the sides. So on the one side is mother Saraswati; so the retaining wall and embankment for it will also be constructed, it will be done. And a lot of money will also be spent on that thing.

And one more thing. A boy who was born 2500 years ago in Kerala’s Kagadi –he left home at the age of 7 and wanders through Himachal, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari reaches the land of mother Bharti; who on the Tilak on his forehead carries the soil of all the regions on his forehead comes to Kedar. He also completes his life here. The Adi Shankaracharya, whose philosophy has continued to inspire India for hundreds of years, whose sepulcher; that too was destroyed in this calamity. The design work for that structure is ongoing. I invite devoutness and architecture that such a grand place should be built for Adi Shankar, such a grand sepulcher should be built for him; and it should be built in such a manner that people should not feel that it is separate from Kedar. But the travelers should feel a kind of spiritual awakening along with the tradition of that great mortification as soon as they reach near the Adi Shankar. The work is ongoing in that direction to create such a structure. Today, the foundation is being laid for that thing also.

I’m aware that money will be required but I have full confidence that once Indian pilgrims decide this thing with a sense of devotion then it is my belief that this country will not fall short in providing the funds for the kind of redevelopment work as desired by the pilgrims. And I also invite the state governments of the country to participate in this thing. I would also invite the people from industry, business people to lend their support for the corporate social responsibility.

I’m grateful to JSW which has decided to take the responsibility for the initial work. But different kind of dreams keep coming into my mind, new and newer things keep getting added into them therefore I would also request the people for this thing and also for the CSR.

When this kind of massive fund will be invested here, massive work for creating infrastructure will be carried out here then all the rules related to environment will be followed in that thing. The place will be rebuilt as per the interest, as per the nature and tendency of this place. It will be modern but its soul will be the same that has been preserved by the land of Kedar inside it for hundreds of years; this kind of redevelopment work will be done here.

When I had come here at the time of opening of the doors of the temple I had the intention of sending a message to the country that we should get out of the shadow of that calamity. Sometimes we think at the time of starting the journey whether facilities have now been created there or not? Can we reach there or not? And that is why the number of pilgrims had come down. However, I’m happy that this time more than 4.5 lakh pilgrims have come to the feet of the lord in such a short span of time. And once again this pilgrimage has been revived. And you can write it down that the next year this number will not be less than 10 lakh because people’s trust has been restored, the message has been conveyed as the entire country saw that on TV and the message will be conveyed once more due to today’s programme and when the doors will be opened again, when the journey will start again then once again the plenty of pilgrimage will be undertaken with the same strength. Once again Uttarakhand which is our divine land, which is the land of our brave-hearts; Uttarakhand, there cannot be a better place to express the devotion of my brave mothers.

In our country, Himalaya has a lot of unique features. There is so much potential for development and every region of Himalaya has a different spirit in it. If we go to Sringar, then we have a different experience of Himalaya; and we experience another thing if we go to Mata Vaishno Devi or Amarnath. The same Himalaya is in Himachal Pradesh, but if we go to Shimla, Kullu, Manali then we experience something different but if we come to the land of Uttarakhand in the lap of the same Himalaya then we experience a spiritual awakening. The same Himalaya, but we experience a different thing when we go to Darjeeling and we experience different thing when we go to Sikkim. You can imagine the same Himalayas, the same mountains, the same snow but we experience different spirit in different regions.

I’m a person who has wandered a lot in the lap of Himalayas. I have experienced the spirit of every region distinctively. And that is why I’m able to talk about this thing myself. I don’t know what can be weighed in which manner in a science laboratory but the way I have experienced the Himalaya; that Himalaya, if anyone has interest in flora and fauna of this place then a very wide landscape is available to him to keep discovering new things throughout his life. If someone has interest in adventure then Himalayas invite every adventurist of the world. If someone has interest in herbs and herbal medicine of this place then such natural gems have been present in every single lap of Himalaya that it can make someone feel a new spirit and the kind of usage of herbal medicine are there that the rural people of this place are being aware of. And I have seen that this scorpion herb, if a scorpion stings by chance then a villager would immediately ask not to cry and use this herb or apply that herb and it will give relief. And he puts a leaf on it and it provides relief. And both of them grow together. What a wonderful arrangement has been made by the lord. And that is why the deeper we dwell into these things; and that is why the government of India has started a massive research work in Dehradun on our natural assets, on the assets of Himalaya,  this research is going to be of great use in the future.

In the entire world, I see a huge potential for organic farming in the lap of our Himalaya. Sikkim is a small state. It has a population of just 6-7 lakh people but nearly 12-15 lakh tourists visit the state and it also has problem of road connectivity and it doesn’t have an airport either. But now I’m constructing it and it will be constructed soon. But despite that tourists come in such a large numbers. Sikkim has converted the entire state into an organic state. It continuously worked for 10-12 years as per the international parameters. The entire Himlayan region should be freed from the use of chemical fertilsers, all the Himalayan states should stop using chemicals and should use herbal compost. If we continue to work for the next 10-12 years with patience then this is the power of organic farming that the world will be ready to pay one dollar for the same agricultural produce of yours that now just fetches one rupee.

I invite Uttarakhand, I call upon the government of Uttarakhand and the officers of Uttarakhand to take up this task and you should move ahead with the dream to turn Uttarakhand into an organic state, you should set a target for 2022 and start working on it from today itself. It may take 10 years to get the certification as it has its own rules. But once you decide this thing that you will create public awareness, you will bring about the change; you can imagine that today the entire world is moving towards holistic health care and only then we can move our agriculture produce away from the world of chemicals and then what a great service it will be to the mankind. We also need to strengthen this power of Himalayas.

There is plenty of scope for tourism but it should not jeopardize spiritual strength of this land even a bit and tourism can be simultaneously developed along with it. We can develop new and newer areas so that the nature is protected, environment is protected and the devotion for the god too has been maintained.

There is  an old saying in the hills that hills have their unique features. The youth and water of hills never come to the use of the hills. We have taken up the task to change this saying. The youth of the hills and the water from the hills should be used here. The electricity should be generated from the hill water and the same water should be used for adventure tourism and water sports. And new tourist destinations should be developed on the basis of the same water that has never been used for the hills and that the same water should become capable of inviting the youth from all over the world and it should become useful for the hills. And the youth those who used to get downs from the hills and go to the plains in search of livelihood, we should create such opportunities in the hills that these youth will not have to leave the hills. The government of India is taking one step after another so that the youth of the hills should become useful for the hills.

The government of Uttarakhand has taken several important decisions, several important initiatives in such a short span of time and it’s the result of these things that today the development is scaling new heights; a new confidence is being generated.

People of Uttarakhand have enough strength and sense of discipline.. There is not a single family which does not have someone in the armed forces. There is not a single village where there will not be 250-300 retired armed forces personnel. And when ex-servicemen are present in such a large number then the discipline of that area becomes commendable. And this discipline is a big support, a big strength for the tourists. And we should publicise this thing, we should create scheme for this purpose. We should create a system for using the experience of ex-servicemen for instilling confidence in the tourists which can become a big source of support for us and others.  There is an immense potential and development of Uttarakhand by exploiting that potential should be done so that Uttarakhand becomes the biggest attraction in the country, so that it becomes the most favored tourist destination so that for tourists it is: Uttarakhand, for adventure it is: Uttarakhand, for travelers it should be Uttarakhand, for adventure it should be Uttarakhand, for the nature and for those people who have a desire to stay in the lap of nature it should be Uttarakhand, for those who conduct research and develop things, for them it should be Uttarakhand.

I invite all of you to start a new account on these days of Diwali and the beginning of new year. In our tradition, the entire country closes its books of accounts on Diwali and starts new books of accounts, so a new book of account of development starts  today. We will move ahead to take this development journey to new heights. Even today, I have given some suggestions. The state government will go through them one more time and I will meet them again in a month or two. I will lay emphasis on those other things that I have in my mind for this area. But it is our collective responsibility to protect the environment. It is our collective responsibility to protect the nature. I can guarantee this thing that if we protect the environment then it will protect us. I would like to assure you that if we protect the nature then it will protect us. The history of hundreds of years is a testimony to the fact that whenever, wherever the nature has been protected no problem was created there due to the nature. Wherever the environment has been protected no problem was created there due to the environment. And it is that land from where we can provide that strength to the people.

We took upon us the task of providing gas connections to the poorest of the poor under the Pradhanmantri Ujjwala Scheme to set them free from using the wooden stoves, to stop logging of the forests. It was a massive campaign for protection of environment. The government of India and Uttarakhand government have taken it forward in a significant manner by working together.

Now we have taken upon us another task. Today, there are four crore families in the country that don’t have electric bulb in their houses. Even today they have been condemned to lead the life of 18th or 19th century. This is the 21st century and whether the poorest of the poor family should have an electric bulb or not? Whether electricity should be provided to that poor family or not whose kids want to study in the night? If a poor too wants his wheat or grain to be milled in a wheat grinder then why should he has to go 10 kilometers, instead of that if there is electricity operated grain mill in his village then the work of milling of wheat and millet will be done in the village or not?  In order to bring about change in the lives of poor, I have taken upon this task on myself to provide electricity connection to 4 crore poor households under the Pradhanmantri Saubhagya scheme. There are thousands of families in Uttarakhand those are yet to get electricity connection.

I call upon the government of Uttarakhand please adopt this scheme of the government of India. And there should be a competition among the states that which one of them will complete the Saubhagya Scheme before others? Which state will complete the Ujjwala scheme before others? Which state promotes the tourism to the maximum possible extent? In the coming time there should be a healthy competition among the states for different sectors of development. I call upon all the Himalayan states for a competition. Let’s have a healthy competition with each other and take the development to new heights.

I would also like to congratulate Uttarakhand for this thing – toilets, freedom from open defecation; some days ago I was told that Uttarakhand has completed the work of making its rural areas free from open defecation. Now no one has to go to defecate in open in villages of the state. In cities, the work is ongoing and Uttarakhand is getting ready to completely become open defecation free including cities.

I congratulate all of you for providing the momentum to this work so far. But I’d like to urge you people to run this scheme under the mission mode. Nobody should be compelled to relieve himself in open area in the cities as well.

I had visited Uttar Pradesh some days ago. Yogi Ji’s government has taken up the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh. Now they have changed the name of toilets. Now they no longer call a toilet - toilet, they don’t call it Sandas, they have named toilet as Izzatghar (the place of honor).

I think those mothers and sisters who have been compelled to relieve themselves in open they fully understand the meaning of this word – Izzatghar. We should also run a campaign for building these Izzatghars. Toilets are in themselves a great facility for restoring the honor of mothers and sisters. It provides a great service to their health as well. And recently Unicef has conducted a survey of 10,000 villages in India. The survey covered both kind of houses that had toilets and that didn’t have toilets. It covered those villages which were aware about the toilets and also those villages which were not aware; Unicef studied all those villages. It’s an organ of United Nations and they found that different kind of diseases that afflict the household due to lack of toilet, and due to the disease if the kid falls ill then mother gets busy, father gets busy in tending the kid; the kid can’t go to school and father can’t go out for work; and if the mother falls sick then the entire family falls sick and if the wage earner of that house falls sick then the income of that family stops and the entire family starves. After taking into account all these things, they conducted this survey that if there is no toilet in the household then what are the expenses on diseases and what are the expenses when a toilet has been constructed. And Unicef has calculated that construction of toilet saves Rs. 50 thousand of a poor family on diseases. You just imagine if a family is able to save Rs. 50 thousand annually then what kind of strength it will provide to that family.

A toilet can change lives and that is why I have to run a campaign to construct toilets across the country with the same commitment with which I will have to carry out rebuilding work of Kedarnath Dham of the Lord only then my country will move ahead. We should march with the same commitment.

Once again I welcome the government of Uttarakhand, I thank them. And all the pilgrims from across the country who come on the pilgrimage of Char Dham Yatra, and those who are aware that we have started construction work for the new roads to connect the four pilgrimage centres at a cost of Rs. 12,000 crore; we have started the work on providing modern connectivity.

So now this Kedarnath Dham will be constructed in this manner. My Kedarnath will become grand, it will become divine and it will become a good source of inspiration. It is becoming a source of devotion for 1.25 billion countrymen. Every son has a desire to once take his old parents on the pilgrimage of Char Dham.

Today, this government is carrying out that work that is dream of 1.25 billion countrymen; it has been working to realise those dreams. Although this work is being executed on the land of Uttarakhand but it is being done for every single Indian. And I’m having a feeling of extreme divine satisfaction in my life while starting that work before you people.

I convey my good wishes to all you.  I once again bow down to Bhole Baba (the lord Shiva). And I once again call upon you to join me chanting with your full strength   Jay Jay Baba Bhole, Jay Jay Baba Bhole,

Jay Jay Baba Bhole, Jay Jay Baba Bhole.

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Kedarnath today. He offered prayers at the Kedarnath Temple, and laid the Foundation Stone for five infrastructure and development projects. These include the development of retaining wall and ghat on the Mandakini River; development of retaining wall and ghat on Saraswati River; construction of main approach to Kedarnath Temple; development of Shankaracharya Kutir and Shankaracharya Museum; and development of houses for Kedarnath Purohits. The Prime Minister was briefed on the Kedarpuri Reconstruction Project.

Addressing a gathering, the Prime Minister said he was happy to be in Kedarnath, a day after Diwali. He said that the start of a New Year is being celebrated in Gujarat today, and conveyed his greetings to everyone around the world.

Noting that the service of the people is the service of God, the Prime Minister pledged to devote himself fully to realising the dream of a developed India, by the time we mark 75 years of freedom in 2022. Recalling the natural calamity of 2013, the Prime Minister said that as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had come to do all that he could for the victims; and offered support from the State of Gujarat for the reconstruction effort.

The Prime Minister said that through the work that is being done in Kedarnath, one would be able to see how an ideal “place of pilgrimage” should be – in terms of both amenities for pilgrims, and the welfare of the priests. He said that the infrastructure being developed in Kedarnath would be of good quality, adding that it would be modern, but would preserve the traditional ethos, and ensure that the environment is not damaged.

Shri Narendra Modi said that the Himalayas have much to offer for spiritualism, adventure and tourism, and for the nature lover. He invited everyone to come and explore the Himalayas.

The Governor of Uttarakhand, Dr. K.K. Paul, and Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat, were present on the occasion.

The Prime Minister made a video call today to the crew of Indian Naval Sailing Vessel (INSV) Tarini, currently on a mission to circumnavigate the globe.

The Prime Minister wished the crew of INSV Tarini a ‘Happy Diwali’, on behalf of the nation. He also wished them success in their mission.

The Prime Minister had earlier met the crew of INSV Tarini on 16 August 2017 before they embarked on the 22,100 nautical mile circumnavigation journey. INSV Tarini is currently approaching their first stop in Fremantle, Australia and is expected to reach there on 22 October 2017 after covering 4770 nautical miles.

The Prime Minister also conveyed birthday greetings in advance to two of the crew – Lt. Cdr. Vartika Joshi, and Lt. Payal Gupta - whose birthdays are coming up shortly.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today celebrated Diwali with the jawans of Indian Army and BSF, in the Gurez Valley, near the Line of Control, in Jammu and Kashmir. He was there for nearly two hours. This is the fourth successive Diwali that the Prime Minister has celebrated with jawans on the border.

The Prime Minister offered sweets and exchanged greetings with the jawans.

Addressing the jawans, the Prime Minister, said that like everyone else, he too wishes to spend Diwali with his family. Therefore, he said, he had come among the jawans of the Armed Forces, whom he considers to be ""his family.""

The Prime Minister said he gets new energy when he spends time among the jawans and soldiers of the Armed Forces. He appreciated their penance and sacrifice, amid harsh conditions.

The Prime Minister said that he had been told that the jawans present at the gathering regularly practice Yoga. He said that this would definitely enhance their abilities, and give them a sense of calm.

He said that jawans who leave the Armed Forces after completing their duty tenure, can become excellent yoga trainers subsequently.

The Prime Minister spoke of the new resolve that each Indian citizen must make for 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. He also encouraged the jawans to innovate, so that their routine tasks and duties become easier and safer. He mentioned how best innovations are now being recognised and awarded at the Army Day, Navy Day, and Air Force Day.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government is committed to the welfare and the betterment of the Armed Forces, in every way possible. In this regard, he mentioned the implementation of One Rank, One Pension, which had been pending for decades.

The Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Bipin Rawat, and other senior Army Officers were present on the occasion.

In the visitors' book, the Prime Minister wrote:

“Protecting the Motherland, far from your loved ones, displaying the highest traditions of sacrifice, all soldiers at the nation's borders, are symbols of bravery and dedication.

I have an opportunity to spend the festival of Diwali with you. The presence of brave soldiers at the border, on this festive occasion, lights the lamp of hope, and generates new energy among crores of Indians.

To accomplish the dream of ""New India,"" this is a golden opportunity for all of us to work together. The Army too is a part of it.

Greetings to all of you on Diwali.”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the All India Institute of Ayurveda, in New Delhi, to the nation. 

Speaking on this occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the gathering on the celebration of Dhanvantari Jayanti as Ayurveda Divas. He complimented the Ministry of AYUSH for the establishment of the All India Institute of Ayurveda. 

The Prime Minister asserted that nations cannot progress unless they value and cherish their history and heritage. Those nations who leave their heritage behind, are destined to lose their identity, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that when India was not independent, its knowledge, and its traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda were belittled. Attempts were even made to reduce the faith that Indians had on them, he added. He said that in the last three years, this situation has changed to quite an extent; and the faith of the people is being restored in the best of our heritage. The pride in our heritage is reflected in the way people gather for Ayurveda Day or Yoga Day, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that Ayurveda is not just a medical practice, but encompasses public health and environment health as well. That is why the Government has laid stress on integrating Ayurveda, Yoga and other AYUSH systems into the public healthcare system. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is working towards establishing an Ayurveda hospital in every district of the country. He said that more than 65 AYUSH hospitals have been developed in the last three years. 

The Prime Minister said that herbal and medicinal plants can be a significant source of income, globally, and India should leverage its capabilities in this regard. He said the Union Government has approved 100 percent FDI in healthcare systems. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is focused on providing affordable healthcare for the poor. He said the stress has been on preventive healthcare, and improving affordability and access to treatment. He said Swachhata – or cleanliness – is a simple mechanism of preventive healthcare. He said the Union Government has got 5 crore toilets built in three years. 

The Prime Minister said that new AIIMS are being established to help the people get better access to healthcare. He mentioned measures such as capping prices of stents and knee implants; and establishment of Jan Aushadhi Kendras for providing medicines at affordable prices.

                All Ayurveda lovers and the eminent personalities present here,

Best wishes to you all and to the whole Nation on the occasion of Dhanvantari Jayanti and the Ayurveda day.

In fact, the celebrations for the festival of Deepavali have also started. I wish all my countrymen as well as the Indian community spread across the world, a very happy and prosperous Deepavali.

I was told that many Ayurvedic colleges in the country are connected to this programme through technology and I welcome them all. I congratulate you all for the establishment of the country's first All India Institute of Ayurveda.

I thank the AYUSH Ministry and all the eminent personalities associated with this Ministry for the establishment of this Institute and for celebrating Dhanvantari Jayanti as the Ayurveda day.

Friends, even with a lot of efforts a country cannot progress unless it knows its history, heritage, culture, glorious traditions and if it doesn't take pride in them. Those countries that move ahead forgetting its legacy shall certainly lose its identity.

Friends, if we look at the history of our country, we will find that India was once a prosperous and a powerful country. The other countries realised that it was impossible to compete with India's knowledge and intellect. Therefore they adopted a different path. They thought that whatever best things we had, should be destroyed. They were bent upon to try and erase our achievements rather than creating their own.

So, during the era of colonization our traditions, sages, farmers, scientists, knowledge, yoga, Ayurveda were ridiculed. They tried to weaken these strengths of our country so much so that even our own people began to lose faith in them.

After the liberation from slavery we hoped that whatever had survived should be preserved and be modified with time but unfortunately it was not prioritised. Everything was left to itself.

In the time of colonization, an attempt was made to destroy our strength and even after independence we continued with this. In a way we had turned away from our legacy. Because of these reasons many of our information and knowledge that once used be our grandmothers' prescriptions, were patented by other countries and thus, slipped into the hands of those countries.

Today those have become intellectual property right of someone else. Today I feel proud that several attempts have been made to change this situation in the last 3 years. The reputation of our superior heritage is once again being established in the minds of the people today.

Today while celebrating the Ayurveda Day or the International Yoga Day on 21st June, the people feel proud of their cultural heritage. When we look at the images of lakhs of people from different countries performing yoga, we feel that lakhs of people are trying to connect with India's heritage which is yoga. In every age, the inheritance of the humankind starts transforming with the contribution or some addition of every period and in every part of the country. Yoga, which has been originally the heritage of India, has now started spreading to the entire human race as its legacy.

This transformation is a result of the efforts of the past 3 years and the AYUSH Ministry too has played a significant role.

Friends, Ayurveda is not just a medical practice. It has a wide range of scope and includes subjects like social health, Public Health, environmental health etc. Realising this need, the government is now focusing on the integration of Ayurveda, yoga and other Public Health Care systems of AYUSH. The government has kept Ayush under four of its priority areas. Apart from making a separate Ministry, we have also framed rules for the integration of Ayush system with other Healthcare Services while formulating our National Health Policy.

Friends, the government believes that the integration of AYUSH with the Healthcare system will not remain confined to the files like before but will be implemented effectively. The AYUSH Ministry has started several initiatives in this direction. Several initiatives like National Health Protection Scheme, National AYUSH mission, Mission Madhumeha, AYUSH gram have been discussed by Mr Shripad Naik.

Friends, in order to expand the penetration of Ayurveda in the country it is essential to have Ayurveda hospitals with all the facilities in every district. The AYUSH Ministry is working at a fast pace in this direction and within 3 years more than 65 AYUSH hospitals have been opened.

The inauguration of the AIIMS like institution which is the All India Ayurveda Institute, is also a part of this endeavour. At the initial stage, more than 750 patients are coming here every day. In the coming days, the number of patients is estimated to be doubled. Usually in every programme it is said that your volume of work should increase; but I do not want the number of patients to be increased. So, I hope that an atmosphere of wellness is created so that the people do not have to come here. This Institute has been built with modern infrastructure. This will be helpful in the Ayurvedic treatment of many serious diseases. I am happy that today with the establishment of this Ayurveda institute, the knowledge of Ayurveda is once again reinforced and is getting a new energy.

It is also very promising to note that the Ayurveda Institute will work together with AIIMS, Indian Council of Medical Research and some other international organisations. I hope that the All India Ayurveda Institute will be the main centre of interdisciplinary and integrative health practice while treading this path.

Friends, Ayurveda is highly beneficial with a long list of its properties. The world today not only wants to be healthy but also wants wellness which can be fulfilled only by Ayurveda and yoga. Today the feeling of 'back to the basics' and 'back to the nature' is becoming stronger in all the countries of the world. More and more people are tilting towards it. The people are getting attracted towards those systems that are directly associated with nature. In such a scenario, a favourable environment is being created for Ayurveda. There is a need to increase the utility of Ayurveda as much as possible as per today's requirements.

How many of those who have studied Ayurveda are hundred per cent devoted towards this science? When he opens a hospital and a OPD and a patient asks for a quick remedy as he has to go for work as early as possible, the Ayurveda doctor feels that it is better to give him an allopathic medicine along with an injection. However, the sign board outside says that it’s 'Ayurvedic Health Centre'. This shows that the devotion towards Ayurveda is not hundred per cent. In order to re-instil the confidence of the people in the effectiveness of Ayurveda, first of all there should be a feeling of hundred per cent devotion towards Ayurveda. We should first develop the confidence in the system. We use to hear a joke in our childhood. There was a man who went to an eatery but the owner was not available. When the man enquired about the owner to his servant, the servant replied that the owner had gone to a nearby eatery to have food.

In such a scenario who will visit his eatery? Therefore friends, it is essential that the scientists associated with Ayurveda should expand its services. They should also think about the areas where Ayurveda can become more effective. One such area is that of sports. Recently there has been a sharp increase in the demand for physiotherapists. Every player has a personal physiotherapist. Sometimes these renowned players unknowingly get entangled with the pain killers. We all know that Ayurveda and yoga can be effective in this field. Ayurveda and yoga based Physiotherapy will not cause any such risk of consuming a banned drug.

Yoga and Ayurveda are important for our security forces just like these are effective in sports. Our soldiers protect the country in difficult situations. Sometimes they are posted in the mountainous areas, in the deserts or in high seas and sometimes in the dense forests; in different seasons and situations. In such a situation, Ayurveda and yoga can save them from many diseases. Mental stress can be dealt with easily. Yoga and Ayurveda can be very effective in strengthening the immunity system and it can help to increase the concentration.

There is a need to focus on quality Ayurvedic education. Rather, its scope should also be increased. The entire supporting chain of Ayurveda like Panchakarma therapist, Ayurvedic dietician, paralysis analyst, Ayurveda pharmacist, should also be developed.

Apart from this, I suggest that there is a need to reroute the different courses being taught at different levels in Ayurvedic education. A Student with the Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) learns about natural, Ayurvedic diet, Ayurvedic Pharmaceuticals. After completing his course of 5 years he gets his degree and then practices on his own or finds a job or goes for higher studies.

Friends, is it possible to design the BAMS course in such a way that the student gets a certificate at every passing level of the exams? It has two advantages. Those students, who would like to start their practice along with higher education, will be comfortable and students who have missed studies for some reason will also have a certificate of some level of the course. This will be helpful in his life and those who complete the 5 Year Course will also have better employment opportunities.

Just now, Shripad Naik ji was mentioning about the collaboration with Spaulding Rehab Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I was really delighted to hear this and I congratulate both the sides. I hope that this collaboration will help in developing sports medicine, rehabilitation medicine and a possibility of Ayurvedic treatment for prevention of pain.

Brothers and sisters, I have launched Standard Guidelines and Standard Terminology Portal for treatment with Ayurveda a short while ago. Both these initiatives will generate a large amount of data, which can be used for getting scientific recognition according to the modern methods of Ayurveda. I believe that this initiative will prove to be milestones in the field of AYUSH science. The universal acceptance for Ayurveda will also increase with its help.

Standard guidelines and standard terminology in Ayurveda are therefore essential. The absence of these leads to the suppression of Ayurveda by the allopathic world. In our country, the same disease is described in different words in different parts of the country. The treatment is more or less same but the description is different. Therefore, we are not able to reach out to the world in a right way. This portal can be of great use in this direction. Once, a commission of the Indian government in its report had mentioned that Ayurveda is far away from the people's homes; because this method is not favourable in today's time. So, on one hand there are the allopathic medicines that can be quickly and easily consumed; on the other hand, there is this Ayurveda system, which is usually avoided by the common man because of the long and time consuming process of making the medicine. In this age of fast food, the old style of packaging of the Ayurvedic medicines is not going to work. As soon as the packaging of Ayurvedic medicines becomes modern, the standards of the treatment procedures are fixed and the terminology becomes uniform, you will see the rapid progress in this system.

In today's time, people want immediate results. With immediate results, people do not care about the side effects. But this kind of thinking is wrong. So, the need of the hour is that we should focus on the research that will help developing the Ayurvedic medicines that not only give immediate results but also help in preventing side effects. We should think on these lines and build them.

Brothers and sisters, I have been told that under the Ministry of AYUSH, the pharmacy standard of over 600 Ayurvedic medicines has been published. Greater publicity will lead to greater penetration of Ayurvedic medicines.

Today there is a huge market for Herbal medicines. India has to use its full capabilities here. Herbal and medicinal plants are becoming important sources of income.

In Ayurveda, medicines are made out of a plethora of such plants which do not require much water or a fertile land. Some therapeutic plants grow without any specific requirement. Unaware of the significance of some of these and mistaking them for scrubs or weeds, these are uprooted. We need to think about how to avoid this loss due to lack of awareness.

New employment opportunities are also opening up with the cultivation of medicinal plants. I would like to urge the AYUSH Ministry to develop a short term course for the farmers and the students in this direction in collaboration with the Ministry of Skill Development. Has any research been done on the use of seaweeds in Ayurveda? India's coast is a great asset. Can it be of any use in Ayurvedic medicine? I know that I am not an expert in this subject but if we do research in these new areas then we can make a difference in the lives of those fishermen. We can serve those interested in wellness by further enriching the vegetable based medicines. If the farmer utilizes the land in the edges of his conventional farm land and cultivates the medicinal plants, his income will increase. We want to double the farmers' incomes by the year 2022 which will mark 75 years of independence. This can also become an additional source of income for the farmers if the AYUSH Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry together guide the farmers to cultivate these medicinal plants at the edges of their farmlands.

Friends, this sector requires a lot of investment now for development and expansion. The government has approved hundred per cent Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in Healthcare system. Efforts should also be made so as to provide the benefits of FDI to Ayurveda and yoga in the Healthcare system.

I would like to urge all the companies and the private sector of the country to come forward for yoga and Ayurveda as well, just as they have done for allopathic based hospitals. Contribute a part of your corporate social responsibility fund to the Ayurveda and yoga also.

We should keep in mind that the knowledge that our ancestors had acquired thousands of years ago was based on a lot of hard work and inspiration for the welfare of mankind. The desire for experimentation and innovation gave birth to the miracles like yoga and Ayurveda. But as soon as we started ignoring innovation, the conditions began to change and our impact started to decline.

There is a need to change the situation completely. It is the need of the hour as also of the entire humanity that India should change this situation. Today the world is searching for a Holistic Health Care but the breakthrough is still awaited. It is looking up to India and its Ayurvedic and yogic power with a lot of hope and expectation. It is confident that India's experience of yoga and Ayurveda can be used in the welfare of the entire world. India should not lose time now. We should move ahead with this resolution and prove it right.

Friends, India's thinking: ‘Ekam Shata Vipra Bahudha Vadanti’ i.e. “That which exists is one, sages call it by various names” is applicable to all kinds of pharmaceutical systems or health systems too. We respect every health care system and wish for each one's progress. Just like the Indian democracy, every health system has its democratic right. Every system has the right to progress and be respected. The government aims to extend all kinds of health systems to the poor, to provide cheap treatment to the poor and to make the treatment easily available to the poor.

Therefore, our emphasis on health sector has been consistent on two major things - firstly, preventive healthcare and secondly, to increase the affordability and access to healthcare.

With an emphasis on preventive health care, we started Mission Indradhanush in order to cover all those children with vaccination by 2020 who were left out in the normal immunization campaign. The government decided that such children should be immunised completely from 12 types of diseases. Under Mission Indradhanush more than 2.5 Crore children and about 70 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated.

It is only because of the government's efforts that the pace of vaccination in the country that was growing at a rate of 1% annually, has now reached approximately 6% since we started this campaign 3 years ago. Whenever a target is set within the same machinery we will get results. We are indeed getting the results. This month itself the government has made this mission even more focused. Intensified Mission Indradhanush has been started under which vaccination coverage will be focused on those districts which have been left behind till date. Till the next year the immunisation campaign will be run in 173 districts of the country every month for 7 days in a week continuously. The government aims to achieve full immunization coverage in the country by December 2018.

Friends, earlier it was believed that healthcare is the responsibility of the Health Ministry. But our thinking is different. Under Intensified Mission Indradhanush, we have now tied up with 12 different ministries of the government, even the Ministry of Defence.

Brothers and sisters, another cheaper and healthier way of Preventive Healthcare is cleanliness. The government has taken hygiene to the masses as a people's movement. The government has constructed more than 5 crore toilets in 3 years. The way the people's perception about cleanliness has changed can be depicted by an example. Some people have started calling toilet as an 'Izzatghar' or 'Abode of dignity'. You might have read a report of UNICEF a few days ago. The report says that when a person builds a toilet in his village for his family, he saves Rs.50000 annually on medical expenses. Just imagine that a poor person benefits by saving 50000 rupees after building a toilet.

The government is trying to promote preventive healthcare along with taking a Holistic approach for increasing affordability and accessibility to healthcare. PG medical seats have been increased for medical students studying in medical colleges. It will be beneficial directly to our youth as well as the poor who can have easy access to the doctors. New AIIMS are also being established in various states to provide better treatment and Health Services to the people of the country. There has been a heavy cut in the price of stents. The price of the stents varies from 50000 rupees to 1 lakh to 2 Lakhs and sometimes even 2.5 lakhs. If a person from a middle class family has a heart problem and he needs a stent, then he won't be able to afford it even if he keeps his entire house as collateral. The government talked to them and asked them why these were so expensive. After discussion, the price was reduced by 30- 40%. These days many senior citizens require knee operation and knee implants. We also reduced the cost of knee implants. We tried to make available cheaper medicines through Jan Aushadhi stores to the poor. Therefore, we also opened up Jan Aushadhi stores in hospitals. Today the best medicines which earlier used to cost 12 rupees are now available at one and a half rupees.

Friends, I have been told that our foreign missions in almost 24 countries are celebrating Ayurveda Day this year. The IT revolution has swept the world in the last 30 years. Now there should be a health revolution under the leadership of Ayurveda. Let us take a pledge on this auspicious day: ' we will practice Ayurveda; we will keep Ayurveda alive and we will live for Ayurveda'.

Friends, I conclude my speech with the best wishes to you all on behalf of All India Ayurveda Institute on the Ayurveda day. Once again my best wishes to you all.

Thank you very much!!!

Bharat Mata Ki Jay (Victory for Mother India)-Bharat Mata Ki Jay (Victory for Mother India).

My dear brothers and sisters present here in large numbers,

My regards to the people of Mokama. I convey my regards to all of you on this holy land of Lord Parashuram. I am blessed on coming here in Mokama.

The whole country is gearing up to celebrate Diwali. Preparations for Chhath Puja are also underway. I congratulate you in advance for Dipawali and Chhath Puja. And gifts worth nearly Rs. 4 thousand crore are being given to Bihar on this pious occasion.

Brothers and sisters, a short while ago Gadkari Ji was talking about how many road projects, highway projects have been started by the government of India. And description was so long that I saw that you too were surprised that so many schemes can be implemented in such a short span of time to turn around the fortune of Bihar.

I am grateful to Nitish Ji and his entire team for supporting all the government of India schemes in every possible manner. When we had difficulties they came forward to solve our problems and in a way today both the central government and the state government have been working shoulder to shoulder with full dedication to realise the dreams of Bihar and you can see the results. Nitish Ji has touched upon several issues, since he is the chief minister, but he was also a member of Parliament from this area for several years so it’s natural to have an emotional attachment with you. And due to that emotional attachment he has that restlessness that this should be done or that should be done and so on. And I respect his feelings and I assure him that the government of India would walk with him shoulder to shoulder to realise the dreams of millions and millions of people of Bihar and it will take the journey of development to new heights.

Brothers and sisters, today I got the good opportunity to come to the land of Mokama, Nitish Ji showed me the design of the bridge from the above, the foundation stone for which is being laid here today, when we were coming here. He showed me the model and I am confident this kind of bridge will become the centre of attraction for the entire Bihar. And this bridge will connect Begusarai, the area of work of the first chief minister of Bihar Dr. Shri Krishna, with the state capital Patna. Even today, I bow down to Shri Babu who made Begusarai the industrial capital of Bihar by establishing Refinery, Fertilizer, Thermal Power Plant and Barauni Dairy.

Today, I have come to that land which is just a few hundred meters away from that temple of education which imparted the values to the national poet Dinakar Ji during his childhood. As one remembers Dinkar Ji his feelings inspire us even today. They show us the path of liberty from the blind faith. Be it an oppressed person or one who is persecuted or exploited, poor, deprived, villager, farmer, labourer, we feel an inspiration to respect them due to the emotions expressed by Dinakar Ji. This is the land on which Dinakar Ji was raised. Dinakar Ji had said:

 

‘Arti Liye To Kise Dhoondhta Hai Moorkh, Andh-Shraddha Ke Khilaf Chot Panhuchate The’

 ‘Arti Liye To Kise Dhoondhta Hai Moorkh, Mandiro, Raj Prasado Mein, Tahkhano Mein’

 ‘Are Devata Kanhi Sadko Par Gitti Tod Rahe, Devata Milenge Kheto Mein, Khalihano Mein’.

 

Today, the people who will break stones for the projects that are being launched, they are our gods who make our fortune. And government of India is taking an important step to realise the dreams of Dinakar Ji.

Brothers and sisters, this land is also the land where lord Parashuram had meditated. Nobody can forget the grand history of the holy Simaria Bank located on the banks of mother Ganga at the confluence of three great ancient states – Ang, Magadh and Mithila. And when I have got the good opportunity to bow down to this holy Simaria Bank from this platform then I respectfully bow down to it. This is the land of brave-heart Babha Chauharmal, a fair is being organised in his memory every year at some distance from here. A large crowd gathers here and I also bow down to such a holy land.

My dear brothers and sisters of Bihar, as far as I can see, I see people everywhere. There are two three times more people outside this tent than those who are inside it. All those people are facing harsh sunlight outside. And they have been facing the heat under the sun for quite some time and despite suffering this hardship they have turned up here in large numbers to bless me, I bow down to you as well. I welcome you. But my dear brothers and sisters of Bihar, I would like to assure you that the government of India and the state government will not allow the hardships faced by you people here to go waste.

Our country also had this kind of people whose thinking was responsible for the backwardness of the country. I have read about this kind of politicians who used to talk like this if someone talked about constructing a road: ‘What is the need for a road, the roads are needed by those who have cars, do we poor people have cars, why do we need roads?’  The people with this kind of negative mentality, we cannot even think about the way they have ruined the country. If today you travel to a village where there is no road....MPs also come to meet me and they tell me that some roads under the Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojna have not been constructed in their area, they ask me to give priority to their area.  Whenever people from rural areas meet me they demand the roads under the Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojna.

Brothers and sisters, in the last three years we have increased the budget so much, we have ramped up the speed of the work so much that today we have succeeded in constructing the twice as much roads than what we used to construct earlier and that is why this work of constructing the roads is taking place to bring about a change in the rural life. However, rural roads alone are not enough. We should connect our large economic centres, economic centres are growth centres as well and those place where economy thrives; we also need to connect these places with interior areas through the road connectivity.

Today, those projects worth thousands of crores of rupees for which the foundation stones have been laid, these projects are not for merely running the vehicles on them. The construction of road is meant for changing the economy of this place. And it is our attempt to bring prosperity here through the roads and these are roads that pull the prosperity and contribute in the making the area prosperous.

Brothers and sisters, Ganga, our lives are dependent on her. Today, if mother Ganga were not there then how terrible the situation would have been? However, we never made any attempt to save that Ganga, we were indifferent. Saving the Ganga is equal to saving our future generations. If we clean the river Ganga then nobody can stop its stream and that is why the government has been engaged in cleaning the Ganga by spending the billions and billions of rupees. And this is not merely the name of a river. And once again we will develop the same feelings of reverence towards rivers, initiatives for saving the rivers will be taken, an awareness about all the rivers of India will be generated. If we want to avoid the water crisis in India in future then this is the only way and we will have to take it seriously. And that is why this cleanliness mission that has been launched, and all the states, from Gangotri to Bengal Sagar, which have been associated with this mission, the first priority is being given to this thing by dividing their responsibility that Ganga should not be polluted. A campaign has been launched to stop the drainage of polluted water, to stop the water polluted with chemicals going into Ganga. And today foundation stones for several projects are being laid simultaneously in Bihar so that in the coming days we will be able to see mother Ganga the same way the way we have devotion for her. And when mother Ganga will be as per our dreams then there will be an unique joy in Chhath Puja, and there will be an unique feeling of devotion.

Brothers and sisters, during the last few days, government of India’s Railway ministry has started an important train for the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and it is going to be of immense benefit during Diwali and Chhath Puja. Antyoday Express from Mumbai to Gorakhpur, this is the first Antyoday Express of the country and just one week ago I have flagged off from Surat the second Antyoday Train from Surat to Patna Jaynagar. We have made this arrangement that the poorest of the poor can board the train at the last moment without reservation.

 

We have connected Mahamana Express from Baroda to Banaras. People who have been working in Surat, in Baroda and in Ankaleshwar, people those who work in Maharashtra can reach their homes comfortably for the festivals of Diwali and Chhath Puja. This government has started these four important trains in the last few days at a very fast pace to connect Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, it is certainly going to benefit you people during Diwali and Chhath Puja.

Brothers and sisters, a short while ago Nitin Ji, Gadkari Ji presented a sketch to you, perhaps, this kind of massive work of building infrastructure in such a short span of time would never have been done in Bihar before. As Nitin Ji just said that in case of the work of roads alone, the work worth Rs. 53,000 crore has either been started or has been approved. You can imagine what kind of comfort these basic facilities, these basic facilities of infrastructure will provide.

We know it very well that the future will not allow the journey of development to move forward without connectivity. Road connectivity, rail connectivity, internet connectivity, gas grid, electricity connection and taps of clean water are required. These issues of connectivity are related to poor people and even in these things a project of waterways has been launched under the leadership of our Gadkari Ji. And if we successfully implement waterways then you will see the importance of rivers. Those people who are from the economic field even they won’t be able to resist the need to associate themselves with the rivers with a feeling of reverence. This kind of change is going to be come about in the field of the country’s economy due to the waterways to supply the goods to the poorest of the poor in the least possible expenses. This thing is going to become possible on the banks of the mother river due to waterways.

In the British era this waterway was there, at that time Mokama was known as Mini Calcutta. It had become the centre of big economic and transportation activity. The government of India has taken upon itself the task of restoring this reputation and I would like to assure you that in any case we will restore that reputation.

You must have seen that we have started a massive campaign to provide electricity to those villages where it was not available. There were 18,000 villages without electricity. We started with the dream to finish it within 1,000 days. We still have some months left however we have electrified nearly 15,000 villages so far and we have been working at a fast pace to electrify those remaining 2.5 to 3,0000 villages. Along with that we have recently launched Pradhanmantri Saubhagya Yojana. This Pradhanmantri Saubhagya Yojana, I’d urge Bihar to take full advantage of it. Under this Pradhanmantri Saubhagya Yojana, the government of India and the state government will work together to provide electricity to those houses which don’t have electricity connection. Even if someone lives in a shanty he even then he will get the electric bulb. Earlier if someone used to ask for electricity connection then the government used to tell that there is an electricity poll on that side and if we need to supply electricity then we will have to install 10 polls from there to here and it will cost nearly Rs. 30,000. And if you pay Rs. 30,000 then only you will get the electricity connection. So the lower class, middle class people, poor people used to reply that they don’t need electricity as they can’t afford to pay Rs. 30,000. People did not used to take electricity connection. Brothers and sisters, we have decided that no Indian family will be compelled to live in the 18th century like situation. The connections will be given free of cost, if there is a need to install polls then the government will install them, if there is a need to lay the wires then the government will do that and it will supply electricity to that house and the first connection will be given free of cost so that he can think about the education and lives of his children, can think in a new way and move forward in the direction of change.

Brothers and sisters, this is a unique feature of this government which even our critics have to admit after these three years. It was a habit of previous governments to make announcements while keeping the elections in mind and then to forget the people and the schemes. Today, there is this kind of government in Delhi that we prepare the road map of a scheme if we conceive it. And the government completely dedicates itself in arranging those resources, in implementing those schemes in a time bound manner to finish them during its tenure. You might have seen that the gas connections to more than 3 crore families, to the poor families, to the poorest of the poor families have been provided so far. They have started cooking chapattis on gas stove. We have a dream of providing gas connections to two crore more families in the next two years and we will accomplish that within the stipulated time and will bring about the change in poor person’s life.

We have started off with the cleanliness campaign. And I will call upon to everyone and would like to tell the government employees, would like to tell the educated youth, the financially sound families to think about a moment and think about those mothers and sisters who live in villages, who live in the shanties of cities and who have been compelled to defecate in the open. Who don’t have toilets, what do they do? They go out of their houses in the dark before the sunrise and come back after relieving themselves before the sun rises. And once the sun rises and if they need to relieve themselves during the day time then they wait until the night, until the sunset, until it is dark and till then they torture their bodies, till then they bear the pain and after that they go to defecate. What kind of adverse impact it will have on the health of my poor mothers and sisters? What will be the situation of our mothers and sisters? And that is why I especially urge to every state of the country that we should not be complacent in constructing toilets if it is our responsibility, we should honestly take it forward and we should make every effort to finish it if we have concerns for the dignity our mothers and sisters, if we have concerns for their health.

Today, we have linked five crore families in the country with toilets. In a country where the facilities for cleanliness were less than 50% of the requirement, today we have succeeded in taking this figure to nearly 80%, but we will have to take it further and therefore I especially urge to our people of Bihar to take one responsibility in their villages. Today, nearly 2.5 lakh villages in the country have declared themselves Open Defecation Free. I invite Bihar, lets come forward to make our villages, our tehsils, our districts open defecation free. And in the coming days, from the land where Mahatma Gandhi had launched Champaran movement, the land where Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of cleanliness, the land where Mahatma Gandhi had given the message of self dependence, such a land, and today the country has expectations of you. You also take the leadership in this thing as well and take Bihar to new heights and it will not be possible without the people’s participation. Tasks are not finished on the basis of government money alone, but when people decide then the work happens automatically and that is why I invite you people.

My brothers and sisters, you have blessed me by turning up in such a large number; I once again express my gratitude to you. And I assure you that the government of India is committed for the development of eastern India. And under the development model followed by us, be it eastern Uttar Pradesh, be it Bihar or West Bengal or Assam or Odisha or be it North East, all these regions will scale new heights of development. We have been working in the direction of setting up a fertiliser plant in your area. Our farmers are going to get benefit from that.

And with this single expectation that all of you will join this journey of development I call upon all of you to join me in saying this with your full strength:

 

(Bharat Mata Ki Jay) Victory for Mother India,

 (Bharat Mata Ki Jay) Victory for  Mother India,

 (Bharat Mata Ki Jay) Victory for Mother India,

 

Thank you very much.

                भारत माता की जय। भारत माता की जय। 

विशाल संख्या में पधारे हुए मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयों और बहनों, 

अपने सब मोकामावासी के प्रणाम। भगवान परशुराम की पावन धरती पर अपने सबके सादर प्रणाम। हमें मोकामा में आ के धन्य हो गे लियो। 

पूरा देश दिवाली मनाने की तैयारी कर रहा है। छठ पूजा की भी तैयारियां चल रही हैं। आप सबको दिपावली और छठ पूजा की मेरी तरफ से अग्रिम शु‍भकामनाएं देता हूं और इस पावन पर्व पर करीब-करीब पौने चार हजार करोड़ रुपयों की विकास की सौगात भी आज इस बिहार की धरती को मिल रही है। 

भाईयों-बहनों, अभी हमारे गडगरी जी, कितने प्रोजेक्‍ट हमारी भारत सरकार ने शुरू किए हैं और वो रोड के क्षेत्र में, रास्‍ता बनाने में उसका वर्णन कर रहे थे और वर्णन इतना लम्‍बा था कि मैं देख रहा था कि आप भी हैरान थे कि इतने कम सेमय में बिहार का भाग्‍य बदलने के लिए इतनी सारी योजनाएं लागू की जा सकती हैं, यह हमने करके दिखाया। 

मैं नितिश जी का और उनकी पूरी टीम का भी हृदय से आभारी हूं कि भारत सरकार की सभी योजनाओं को, हर प्रकार का उनका सहयोग रहा, समर्थन रहा। हमारी कठिनाइयां होती है तो वो दूर करने की चिंता करते हैं और एक प्रकार से केंद्र सरकार और राज्‍य सरकार दोनों कंधे से कंधा मिला करके आज बिहार के सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए जी-जान से जुटे हुए हैं और परिणाम नजर आने लगा है। नितिश जी ने कई विषयों को स्‍पर्श किया, वे मुख्‍यमंत्री तो हैं लेकिन उनका लगाव इस क्षेत्र में इतने सालों तक सांसद रहने के कारण, आपके प्रति उनका emotional लगाव है और emotional लगाव होने के कारण उनके मन में यह तड़पन होना कि यह होना चाहिए, वो होना चाहिए ढिकना होना चाहिए, फलाना होना चाहिए। मैं उनकी इस भावना का आदर करता हूं और मैं विश्‍वा दिलाता हूं कि भारत सरकार बिहार के कोटि-कोटि जनों के सपनों को पूरा करने में कंधे से कंधा मिला करके आपके साथ चलेगी और विकास की यात्रा को नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाएगी। 

भाईयों-बहनों आज मुझे मोकामा की धरती पर आने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है, जिस पुल के निर्माण का आज शिलान्‍यास हुआ है, मुझे हमारे नितिश जी जब मैं ऊपर आ रहा था, तो उसकी डिजाइन दिखा रहे थे। उसका model दिखा रहे थे, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि इस प्रकार का Bridge, यह पूरे बिहार के लिए आकर्षण का केंद्र बनेगा। और यह पुल बिहार के प्रथम मुख्‍यमंत्री डॉ. कृष्‍ण जी की कर्म भूमि बेगू सराय को राजधानी पटना के साथ जोड़ने वाला Bridge है। बेगूसराय को Refinery, Fertilizer, Thermal Power और बरौनी डेयरी स्थापित करके, बिहार की औद्योगिक राजधानी बनाने वाले ऐसे श्री बाबू को भी आज मैं आदरपूर्वक नमन करता हूं। 

आज मैं उस धरती पर आया हूं जहां से कुछ सौ मीटर की दूरी पर वो तीर्थ धाम है, शिक्षा का वो क्षेत्र है, जिसने राष्‍ट्र कवि दिनकर जी का बालकाल में संस्‍कार संस्‍करण किया था। और जब दिनकर जी की याद आती है, तो उनकी भावनाएं आज भी हमें प्रेरणा देती हैं। अंध-श्रद्धा से मुक्ति के लिए मार्ग दिखाती है। दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित, गरीब, वंचित... गांव हो, किसान हो, मजदूर हो उनके प्रति एक आदर का भाव जगाने की प्रेरणा दिनकर जी की भाव अभिव्‍यक्ति में हम महसूस करते है। जिस धरती पर दिनकर जी पले-बढे और जिनका जन्‍म स्‍थान भी नजदीक में ही है। दिनकर जी ने कहा था – 

‘आरती लिये तो किसे ढूंढता है मूर्ख, अंध-श्रद्धा के खिलाफ चोट पहुंचाते थे। 
 

‘‘आरती लिये तो किसे ढूंढता है मूर्ख, मंदिरों, राज प्रसादों में, तहखानों में,

अरे देवता कहीं सड़कों पर गिट्टी तोड़ रहे, देवता मिलेंगे, खेतों में खिलहानों में’’।।



आज जिन रास्‍तों के निर्माण का प्रोजेक्‍ट हो रहा है, वहां वो ही भगवान जो गिट्टे तोड़ने वाले हमारा भाग्‍य बनाने वाले हैं और भारत सरकार दिनकर जी के उन सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए एक अहम कदम उठा रही है। 

भाईयों-बहनों, यह जगह भगवान परशुराम की तपोस्‍थली भी है। प्राचीन काल के तीन महाजनपद अंग, मगध और मिथिला के संगम पर अवस्थित मां गंगा का पवित्र सिमरिया तट का गौरवशाली इतिहास कोई भूल नहीं सकता है। इस मंच से, इस पवित्र सिमरिया तट को आज मुझे नमन करने का सौभाग्‍य मिला है, मैं श्रद्धापूर्वक नमन करता हूं। यह वो धरती जो वीर शिरोमणि बाबा चौहरमल, जिनके नाम पर कुछ ही दूरी पर प्रति वर्ष मेला लगता है। लोग उमड़ पड़ते हैं, मैं ऐसी इस पवित्र भूमि को भी नमन करता हूं। 

बिहार के मेरे प्‍यारे भाईयों-बहनों, मेरी जहां भी नजर पहुंच रही है मुझे लोग ही लोग नजर आ रहे हैं। जितने लोग यह पंडाल में जगह मिली है, उससे दोगुना-तीनगुना लोग बाहर है। यह सारे लोग ताप में तप रहे हैं। इतने लम्‍बे समय से तप रहे हैं, इतना कष्‍ट उठा करके भी आज हम सबको आप आशीर्वाद देने के लिए आए, मैं आप सबको भी नमन करता हूं। आपका अभिनंदन करता हूं। लेकिन मेरे प्‍यारे बिहार वासियों यह आप जो तप कर रहे हैं, तप में तप रहे हैं, मैं आपको विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं भारत सरकार और राज्‍य सरकार आपकी इस तपस्‍या को कभी बेकार नहीं जाने देगी। 

हमारे देश में ऐसे भी लोग हो गए जिनकी सोच देश को पीछे ले जाने का कभी कारण भी रही थी। अगर कोई अच्‍छी सड़क बनाने की बात करे तो मैंने ऐसे नेताओं का अखबारों मं पढ़ा करता था कभी, वो कहते थे कि सड़क की क्‍या जरूरत है, सड़क तो मोटर कार वालों को चाहिए, हम गरीबों के पास गाड़ी का है, हमको रोड की क्‍या जरूरत है, सड़क की क्‍या जरूरत है। ऐसे विकृत मानसिकता वाले लोग, उन्‍होंने देश को जितना तबाह किया है शायद उसक हम कल्‍पना नहीं कर सकते। आज किसी भी गांव में जाइये और अगर सड़क नहीं है... मुझे M.P भी मिलने आते हैं, तो यही कहते है कि साहब मेरे इलाके में अभी कुछ गांव में प्रधानमंत्री ग्राम सड़क योजना बाकी रह गई है, इस बार हमारे यहां priority दीजिए। गांव के नागरिक जब भी मिलते हैं, उनकी मांग रहती है कि हमें प्रधानमंत्री ग्राम सडक योजना दीजिए। भाईयों-बहनों, पिछले तीन साल में हमने बजट में इतनी बढोत्‍तरी कर दी, हमने काम में इतनी तेजी लाई कि पहले जितने रोड़ बनते थे एक दिन में आज उसकी डबल रोड बनाने की दिशा में हम सफल हुए और गांव के जीवन को बदलने के लिए यह रोड बनाने का काम हो रहा है। लेकिन सिर्फ ग्रामीण सड़क पर्याप्‍त नहीं है। हमें बडे-बड़े आर्थिक जो सेंटर होते हैं, जो growth center होते हैं, जहां economy drive करती है, उसको भी interior स्‍थानों के साथ हमें रोड connectivity से जोड़ना जरूरी है। 

आज जो हजारों करोडों रुपयों की योजनाओं के शिलान्‍यास हुए हैं वो सिर्फ उस पर गाडियां दौड़ाने के लिए नहीं है। यह सड़क का निर्माण यहां के आर्थिक जीवन को बदलने के लिए हैं। यहां पर समृद्धि उसी रोड से खींच करके लाने के लिए हमें प्रयास हैं और रास्‍ते ही होते हैं जो समृद्धि को खींच करके लाते हैं और समृद्धि का इलाका निर्माण करने में योगदान करते हैं। 

भाईयों-बहनों, गंगा हम सब का जीवन उससे जुडा हुआ है। अगर आज मां गंगा न होती तो पता नहीं हमारा पूरा भू-भाग वहां की कैसी भयंकर स्थिति होती। लेकिन उस गंगा को कभी बचाने के लिए हमने प्रयास नहीं किए, हमने उदासीनता बरती। गंगा को बचाना हमारी भावी पीढि़यों को बचाना है। गंगा को निर्मल करेंगे, तो गंगा को अविरल करने से कोई रोक नहीं पाएगा और इसलिए सरकार अरबो-खरबो रुपया खर्च करके गंगा की सफाई पर लगी है और यह सिर्फ एक नदी का नाम नहीं है, एक बार नदियों के प्रति फिर से वही एक बार वही श्रद्धाभाव जगेगा, नदियों को बचाने की पहल चलेगी, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की हर नदियों के प्रति जागरूकता आएगी। भारत में, भविष्‍य में पानी के संकट से अगर बचना है तो यही मार्ग है जिसको हमने गंभीरता से लेना होगा और इसलिए गंगा सफाई का जो अभियान चल रहा है, गंगोत्री से ले करके बंगाल सागर तक जो भी राज्‍य इसके साथ जुडे हैं उनके अलग-अलग भाग करके गंगा गंदी न हो, सबसे पहली प्राथमिकता उस पर दी गई है। गंगा में जाने वाले गंदे पानी को, केमिकल वाले पानी को रोकने की दिशा में अभियान चला है। आज बिहार में एक साथ अनेक विद्, इस प्रोजेक्‍टों का भी शिलान्‍यास हो रहा है, जो आने वाले दिनों में मां गंगा को हम जैसी श्रद्धाभाव रखते हैं, उसी रूप में देखने को मिलेगा और जब मां गंगा हमारे सपनों के अनुरूप होगी, तब छठ पूजा का आनंद ही कुछ और होगा, वो भक्ति का भाव भी कुछ और होगा। 

भाईयों-बहनों, पिछलों दिनों भारत रेल मंत्रालय ने पूर्वी उत्‍तर प्रदेश और बिहार के लोगों के लिए महत्‍वपूर्ण ट्रेन चलाई है, जिसका लाभ यह दिवाली और छठ पूजा में भरपूर मिलने वाला है। मुम्‍बई से गौरखपुर ट्रेन अंत्‍योदय एक्‍सप्रेस, देश की पहली अंत्‍योदय एक्‍सप्रेस और अभी एक सप्‍ताह पहले मैंने सूरत से पटना जयनगर तक दूसरी अंत्‍योदय एक्‍सप्रेस को भी वहां से मैंने हरी झंडी दी है। without reservation गरीब से गरीब व्‍यक्ति last moment दौड़ करके अंदर आ करके बैठ सकता है, अपने घर जा सकता है, यह व्‍यवस्‍था की है। 

महामाना एक्‍सप्रेस, बड़ोदा से बनारस तक जोड़ी है, सूरत में काम करने वाले लोग, बड़ोदा में काम करने वाले लोग, अंकलेश्वर में काम करने वाले लोग, महाराष्‍ट्र में काम करने वाले लोग दिवाली और छठ पूजा के त्‍यौहार पर अपने घर आराम से पहुंच सके, इसलिए बहुत तेजी करके इन्‍हीं दिनों यह चार महत्‍वपूर्ण ट्रेन बिहार और पूर्वी उत्‍तर प्रदेश को जोड़ने का काम इस सरकार ने किया है, जिसका लाभ दिवाली में और छठ पूजा में आपको अवश्‍य मिलने वाला है। 

भाईयों-बहनों, अभी नितिन जी हमारे बता रहे थे, हमारे गडकरी जी, गडकरी जी ने जो खाका बताया आपके सामने शायद देश आजाद होने के बाद इतने कम समय में infrastructure का इतना बडा काम बिहार की धरती पर कभी नहीं हुअ होगा, अकेले रोड का काम... अभी नितिन जी बजा रहे थे 53 हजार करोड़ रुपयों के काम या तो मंजूर हो गए या तो काम चालू हो गए हैं। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि यह मूलभूत सुविधाएं, infrastructure की मूलभूत सुविधाएं कितना बड़ा परिणाम लाएगी इसका आप अंदाजा कर सकते हैं। 

हम यह बात भलीभांति जानते हैं कि आने वाला युग बिना connectivity विकास यात्रा को कभी आगे बढने नहीं देगा, रोड connectivity चाहिए, रेल connectivity चाहिए, internet connectivity चाहिए, गैस ग्रिड चाहिए, बिजली का connection चाहिए, शुद्ध पानी की नलिया चाहिए। यह connectivity यह गरीब से जुड़े हुए विषय हैं और इसमें हमारे गडकरी जी के नेतृत्‍व में water way का भी अभियान चला है। अगर एक बार water way को हम सफलतापूर्वक आगे बढ़ाएंगे, आप देखिए नदी का महत्‍व भी जो आर्थिक विषयों से जुड़े हुए लोग हैं, वो भी श्रद्धाभाव से नदियों से जुड़ने के लिए आगे आए बिना रह नहीं पाएंगे, ऐसा बदलाव यह waterways के कारण देश के आर्थिक क्षेत्र में माल ढोने की व्‍यवस्‍था में कम से कम खर्च में माल पहुंचाने से गरीब को सस्‍ता में सस्‍ता चीजों को उपलब्‍ध कराने का काम यह मां के तट पर waterway के द्वारा यह संभव होने वाला है। जिस जमाने में अंग्रेज waterway का उपयोग करते थे, तभी यह हमारा मोकामा, मिनी कलकत्‍ता के रूप में जाना जाता था। एक बड़े आर्थिक और ट्रांसपोर्टेशन की गति का केंद्र बन गया था। यह शौहरत फिर से हासिल कराने का भारत सरकार ने बीड़ा उठाया है और मैं आपको विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं कि यह शौहरत हम वापस ला करके रहेंगे। 

पिछले दिनों हमने देखा होगा कि हमने जिन गांवों में बिजली नहीं है उन गांवों में बिजली पहुंचाने का एक बड़ा अभियान उठाया है। 18 हजार गांवों ऐसे थे, जहां बिजली नहीं थी। एक हजार दिन में पूरा करने का सपना ले करके चले हैं। अभी-अभी कुछ महीने अभी बाकी है, लेकिन अब तक करीब-करीब 15 हजार से ज्‍यादा गांव बिजली पहुंचा चुके हैं और जो ढ़ाई-तीन हजार गांव बाकी हैं, उनमें भी तेज गति से काम चल रहा है। लेकिन उसके साथ अभी हमने प्रधानमंत्री सौभाग्‍य योजना लागू की है। यह ‘प्रधानमंत्री सौभाग्‍य योजना’, मैं बिहार से आग्रह करूंगा आप इसका भरपूर फायदा उठाइये। यह ‘प्रधानमंत्री सौभाग्‍य योजना’ यह है कि भारत सरकार और राज्‍य सरकार मिल करके जिसके भी घर में बिजली का connection नहीं है भारत सरकार और राज्‍य सरकार मिल करके मुफ्त में बिजली का connection देंगे। झुग्‍गी-झोपड़ी होगी, तब भी उसके घर में लट्टू जलेगा। पहले कोई बिजली मांगता था, तो सरकार कहती थी कि उधर खम्‍भा है, उस खम्‍भे से यहां आना है तो 10 खम्‍भे और लगाने पड़ेंगे, इतना तार लगाना पड़ेगा, इसका करीब 30 हजार रुपया खर्चा होगा। अगर तुम 30 हजार रुपया दोगे, तब बिजली का connection मिलेगा, तो निम्‍न, मध्‍यम वर्ग का व्‍यक्ति, गरीब व्‍यक्ति को कहता था भई मुझे बिजली नहीं चाहिए, मैं 30 हजार रुपया नहीं दे सकता। लोग बिजली नहीं लेते थे। भाईयों-बहनों, हमने तय किया है कि अब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का कोई भी परिवार 18वीं शताब्‍दी के अंधेरे में जीने के लिए मजबूर नहीं होगा, मुफ्त में connection दिया जाएगा, खम्‍भे डालने होंगे तो सरकार डालेगी, तार लगाने होंगे तो सरकार लगाएगी और घर तक बिजली ले जाएंगे, पहली जो connection दे देंगे, मुफ्त में connection दे दिया जाएगा, ताकि वो अपने घर में बच्‍चों की शिक्षा के लिए, जीवन के लिए सोचे, नये तरीके से सोचे और बदलाव की दिशा में आगे बढ़े। 

भाईयों-बहनों, यह सरकार की एक विशेषता है और आप तीन साल के बाद हमारी आलोचना करने वालों को भी इस बात का स्‍वीकार करना पड़ रहा है। पहले सरकारों की आदत हुआ करती थी चुनाव में ध्‍यान में रख करके योजनाओं की घोषणा करना और फिर लोगों को योजनाओं को भुला देना। आज दिल्‍ली में ऐसी सरकार हमारी चल रही है कि जिस योजना की कल्‍पना करते हैं उसका रोड मैप भी तैयार करते हैं। और हमारी आंखों के सामने, समय-सीमा में उन योजनाओं को लागू करने के लिए सरकार जी-जान से जुट जाती है, संसाधन इकट्ठे करती है। आपने देखा होगा गरीब परिवारों को गैस का connection आज देश में तीन करोड़ से ज्‍यादा परिवारों को, गरीब से गरीब परिवारों को गैस का सिलेंडर पहुंच गया। वो गैस के चूल्‍हे से रोटी बनाने लग गए। आने वाले दो साल में दो करोड़ परिवारों को और देने का सपना है, वो भी हम समय-सीमा में पूरा करके रहेंगे और गरीब की जिंदगी में बदलाव लाएंगे। 

हम जो स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान ले करके चले हैं। यह स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान मेरे लिए उसके लिए मेरे दिमाग में मेरी गरीब माताएं-बहनें हैं और मैं हर किसी को कहूंगा, सरकार में बैठे मुलाजिमों से कहना चाहूंगा, पढ़े-लिखे नौजवानों से कहना चाहूंगा, आर्थिक रूप से सम्‍पन्‍न परिवारों से कहना चाहूंगा, पलभर के लिए सोचिए, उन मां-बहनों के लिए भी सोचिए जो मां-बहनें गांव में रहती हैं, शहर की झुग्‍गी झोपड़ी में रहती हैं और खुले में शौच जाने के लिए मजबूर हैं। उन्‍हें शौचालय नहीं है, वो क्‍या करती हैं सूरज उगने से पहले अंधेरे में घर से बाहर जा करके अपनी प्रात: विधि करके सूरज उगने से पहले घर लौट आती हैं। और एक बार सूरज उग गया और कभी दिन में उसको जाने की जरूरत पड़ गई तो रात को सूरज ढलने तक वो इंतजार करती है और जब अंधेरा होता है, शरीर को पीड़ा देती है, पीड़ा सहन करती है और बाद में वो शौच के लिए जाती है। मेरी इन गरीब मां-बहनों की तबीयत पर कितना दुष्‍प्रभाव होता होगा। हमारी मां-बहनों के हाल क्‍या होते होंगे, और इसलिए मैं विशेष रूप से हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सभी राज्‍यों से आग्रह करता हूं कि अगर हमारे दिल में हमारी मां-बहन, बेटियों की इज्‍जत, उनके स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य की चिंता यह अगर हमारा दायित्‍व है तो हम शौचालय बनाने में कोई भी लापरवाही न करे, उसको ईमानदारी से आगे बढ़ाएं, इसको पूरा करने का प्रयास करे। 

आज देश में पांच करोड़ परिवारों को शौचालय से जोड़ा है। जहां देश में 50 प्रतिशत से भी कम स्‍वच्‍छता की व्‍यवस्‍थाएं मौजूद थीं, आज करीब-करीब 80% से ज्‍यादा हम पहुंचाने में सफल हुए, लेकिन हमें इसे और आगे बढ़ाना है और इसलिए मैं विशेष रूप से मेरे बिहार वासियों से आग्रह करता हूं कि आप एक जिम्‍मेदारी लीजिए अपने गांव में, आज देश करीब ढ़ाई लाख गांव खुले में शौच से अपने आप को मुक्‍त कर चुके हैं। मैं बिहार को निमंत्रण देता हूं, आइये हम भी अपने गांव को खुले में शौच से मुक्त करें। अपनी तहसील को खुले में शौच से मुक्त करें, अपने जिलो को खुले में शौच से मुक्त करें और आने वाले कम समय में जिस धरती पर महात्‍मा गांधी ने चम्‍पारण का सत्‍याग्रह किया हो, जिस धरती पर महात्‍मा गांधी ने स्‍वच्‍छता का संदेश दिया हो, जिस धरती पर महात्‍मा गांधी ने स्वावलंबन का पुरूषार्थ दिया हो, ऐसी धरती आज देश आपसे अपेक्षा कर रहा है। आप इसमें भी अगुवाई कीजिए और बिहार को नई ऊंचाईयों पर.... और यह जनसमर्थन के बिना संभव नहीं होगा। सिर्फ सरकारी खजाने से काम नहीं होते, जब जनता जनार्दन तय कर लेते हैं, तो काम अपने आप हो जाते हैं। और इसलिए मैं आपको निमंत्रण देता हूं। 

मेरे भाईयों-बहनों, आप इतनी बड़ी संख्‍या में आ करके आशीर्वाद दिया, मैं फिर एक बार आपका आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। और मैं विश्‍वास दिलाता हूं भारत सरकार पूर्वी-भारत के विकास के लिए प्रतिबद्ध है, हम विकास के जिस model को ले करके चल रहे हैं उसमें पूर्वी-उत्‍तर प्रदेश हो, बिहार हो, पश्चिम बंगाल हो, असम हो, ओडि़शा हो, North-East हो, यह सारे इलाके यह विकास की नई ऊंचाईयों को पार करेंगे। आपके यहां Fertilizer के कारखाने को हमने आगे बढ़ाने की दिशा में काम उठाया है। इसका परिणाम मेरे किसानों को भी मिलने वाला है। 

और इस विकास की यात्रा में आप सब जुड़े इसी एक अपेक्षा के साथ आप सब मेरे साथ पूरी ताकत से बोलिए – 

भारत माता की जय, 

भारत माता की जय, 

भारत माता की जय, 

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                All the youngsters present here in large numbers,

Our chief minister was telling me that I am the first Prime Minister ever to visit the Patna University for a programme. I am privileged that my predecessors have left some good work to be accomplished by me. Hence, I have got the opportunity to do this good work.

First of all I would like to salute this sacred soil because this University Campus has played a major role in contributing to the country's development. There is a famous Chinese saying: if your vision is for a year then sow food grains; if your vision is for 10-20 years then sow fruit-bearing trees; but if your vision is for next generations then you should go for producing good human beings. Patna University exemplifies this saying. After the seed was sown hundred years ago, within hundred years several generations came and studied in the University; some of them became politicians and started serving several areas after passing out. Today I realise that there might not be any state in the country where the top five civil servants are not from Bihar’s Patna University.

I generally meet officials from different states of India. Daily I talk to about 80 or 100 people for about 2 hours and I realise that the greater chunk of those officials are from Bihar. They are blessed by Goddess Saraswati. But the time has changed. Bihar has the blessings of Goddess Saraswati. But Bihar also needs the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi. The government of India intends to take Bihar to new heights with the blessings of both the Goddesses.

Nitish ji is committed towards the development of Bihar and the Government of India is also committed towards the development of Eastern India. Our resolution should be to elevate Bihar to the position of other developed States of India by 2022 when the country will celebrate 75 years of Independence.

The city of Patna is situated at the banks of mother Ganga. The knowledge and heritage of Bihar is as old as the river Ganga. No one can forget Nalanda or Vikramshila while referring to India's history of education.

Probably there is hardly any area which remains untouched by this soil's contribution in reforming human lives. The legacy of this great heritage is in itself a great source of inspiration. Those who can recall the rich history are capable of conveying it to the future generations and those who forget remain barren. Therefore its creation is powerful. Its conception is also possible on this soil which has the power to enlighten this earth because it has a great historical Heritage, cultural heritage and a living example. I believe that there is no such power or capability anywhere else.

There was a time when we used to go to schools and colleges to learn but that era has ended. Today the world is transforming, the ideas are changing and with technological intervention even the way of life is changing. In view of this fact, the students are also facing great challenges. The challenge is not about what new to learn but how to unlearn or de-learn the out-dated things and then re-learn the new things.

Once, Mr Forbes of the Forbes magazine had given an interesting definition. He had said that the purpose of knowledge is to empty the brain, to fill our minds with new thoughts and to do new things. He said that knowledge should empty the brain and broaden the thoughts. Our thinking has been to burden the brain; to cram things. If we want to bring a change in the true sense, then all of us have to start a campaign to broaden the mind-set so that new ideas can enter into our minds. Therefore the universities should provide learning and not teaching. How to take our educational institutions in that direction?

There is a consistency in one aspect over the years of evolution of the human culture and that is innovation. In every era human beings have added some innovation to their lifestyle. Today innovation is going through a period of competition. Only that country can progress in the World that prioritizes innovation and institutions. But a mere cosmetic change to the institution cannot be considered as modification. The need of the hour is to get rid of old and out-dated thoughts and to find new ways for securing the future and to arrange for resources in order to improve the lifestyle with the help of principles of science and technology. Today every sector needs to be reformed with the help of technology and the society also needs innovative ways for its progress. And so the universities can play a significant role in order to meet the needs of the future generation at a time when the competition has become globalised. Today we are not competing within our country or with our neighbouring countries only. The competition has also been globalised. So we have to accept that competition as a challenge. If the country wants to progress, take on new heights and secure our place in the global arena, then a great emphasize should be on innovation by our younger generation.

The perception of the world about India started changing only after the IT revolution swept the country. Before that the world used to conceive India as the land of snake charmers. The world used to associate Indians with black magic, ghosts and superstitions. But after the IT revolution the world was astonished to see the technological soundness of the younger generation. When the 18 to 20 year-olds of India started showing their IT prowess, the world was startled. Their perception about India changed.

I clearly remember my visit to Taiwan a long time ago. At that time I was not even the chief minister and had no links with elections. I had gone there on the Taiwan government's invitation. That was a 10-days trip. There was an interpreter with me to help me with conversation. In those 10 days we developed a little friendship. After 6 or 8 days he asked me whether I would mind if he enquired something. I told him to go ahead. But he was quite hesitant and could not ask me. Later, while travelling I asked him what was that he wanted to ask me that day. He was again hesitant. I told him that it was okay and he could ask me frankly. He was a computer engineer. Then he asked that whether India was still the same, the land of snake charmers, black magic and superstitions. He kept staring at me. I asked him what he felt after looking at me. He felt embarrassed and started apologizing. I said, ""No brother, today India is not the same and in fact there has been a valuation!"". He asked - ""how?"" I said that our ancestors used to play with Snakes and our present generation plays with a mouse! He understood that the mouse I was talking about was not the animal but the one used in the computers.

What I mean to say is that these things enhance the strength of the country. Sometimes we achieve awards by making one or two projects but the need of the hour is innovation at a mass scale. I want to appeal to the youngsters, students, faculties and universities from the sacred soil of the hundred year old Patna University to come forward with innovative ways to address the challenges faced by present day India. Can we find suitable technologies that are affordable, cheap, simple and user-friendly? If we encourage such small projects then these can convert into start-ups. The youngsters can develop the start-ups for innovating university education by the use of funds from banks under Mudra Yojana. Can you imagine that today India is the fourth largest start-up hub in the world? India can also achieve the top rank. If every youngster in India has a new idea for a Start-up then it can result in a revolutionary change. Hence I invite the universities of India, especially the University of Patna to promote innovation. We need to move ahead in this world.

India does not lack talent. India is fortunate to have 800million or 65 per cent of the country's population below 35 years of age. India is young and India's dreams are also young. I believe that the country that possesses such strength can achieve anything and can also fulfil all its dreams.

And so, right now Nitish ji placed a subject in great detail and you all supported it by your clapping. But I feel that central university is a matter of past. I want to take it one step ahead and so today I have come here for today's University programme to invite you all for the same. The reforms in the education sector in our country are progressing at a very slow pace. The mutual differences in our Academics are very intense. So, at every stage greater number of problems is arising rather than the reforms. The innovations and the reforms, that are needed in our education system especially in a higher education system in order to reach the world class level, are somewhat lacking. This government has taken some bold steps. A debate has been going on for quite some time regarding the autonomy of IIMs. The government felt that it used to provide a lot of funds to these institutions but the Institutions did not take any directions from the government. You will be happy to know that after a couple of years of this debate, for the first time IIM was made completely Independent and was professionally opened-up. However most of these newspapers did not cover it extensively but a few articles were definitely written regarding this. It was a big decision. Just like the Patna University is well known for creating IAS, IPS and IFS, similarly the IIMs across the country are known for creating CEOs. So, we decided to free the prestigious Institute of government rules and restrictions. I believe that now that the IIMs have been provided with this opportunity, it will strive towards fulfilling the aspirations and hopes of the country. I have requested the IIMs to also ensure the participation of its alumni in governing them. I also heard the Patna University to involve its rich and capable alumni in the path of the development of the university. You must have seen that the alumni of all the top universities of the world have played a significant role in the universities progress, not only in monetary terms but also the intellect, experience, status and position. We generally invite the alumni to some functions; honour them with garlands; get donations from them and the association ends there. The alumni are a great strength in themselves. So their association with the university should be more than a mere tokenism.

A short while ago I was talking about going one step ahead than making it a Central University and that I have come to the Patna University to invite it for the same. The Government of India has presented a dream before the universities of the country. Indian universities have not found any place among the world's top 500. Isn't it ironical that the country where its universities like Nalanda, Vikramshila, Taxila, Vallabhi had attracted the entire world about 1300 or 1500 years back did not find any place among the top 500 universities of the world? Don't you think that we should erase this slur and change the situation? We only have to change the situation and not an outsider. We should take this resolution and strive towards its accomplishment.

In order to achieve that, the government of India through its scheme wants to make 10 public Universities and 10 private universities, total 20 universities, as world class by freeing them of the government rules and regulations. These universities will be provided with 10,000 crore rupees over 5 years. This initiative is much more than declaring a university as a central university. These universities will not be selected on the whims of any politician or the Prime Minister or any Chief Minister but by an open competition. All the universities are invited for this challenge. The universities have to prove their capability through this challenge. In this way top 10 private and 10 public universities will be selected. The final selection will be done through a third party professional agency. The state governments and the universities will be responsible for this challenge group. Their performance will be assessed. Their road maps on the international platform will also be assessed and the top 10 universities will be freed of the government hold and will be granted autonomy. They will be free to decide their road maps. These universities will be provided 10,000 crore rupees within 5 years. This concept is several steps ahead of the concept of Central University. This is a big decision and Patna should not be left behind. Therefore, I have come here to invite Patna University. I request the university and its faculties to come forward and participate in this important scheme. I wish that this glorious Patna University may curve a niche in the world arena. I solicit your cooperation in taking Patna University ahead. My best wishes to you all.

You should fulfil all the resolutions you have made in this centenary celebration. With these feelings, I thank you all.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for four sewerage projects under the Namami Gange programme; and four National Highway projects, at Mokama in Bihar. The total outlay of these projects is over Rs. 3700 crore. 

Addressing a large public meeting, the Prime Minister said that he is delighted to come to a land closely associated with the great poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar Ji. He assured everyone that the Union Government and the State Government will do everything possible for Bihar's growth. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is working tirelessly to fulfil the aspirations of the people. He said the projects whose foundation stones are being laid today will give impetus to Bihar's development. 

He added that the Government is focussing on increased pace of road construction. The projects related to Namami Gange will help preserve the River Ganga, he said. 

Referring to the recent launch of the Antyodaya expresses, he said these will improve connectivity between Bihar, eastern India and other parts of the country. Asserting that good connectivity will lead to greater development, the Prime Minister said stress is being given to roads, railways, and waterways. 

The four National Highway projects for which foundation stones have been laid include: 

• 4-laning of Aunta-Simariya section of NH-31 and construction of 6-lane Ganga Setu

• 4 laning of Bakhtiyarpur-Mokama section of NH-31

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today spoke at the closing session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhawan. 

The Prime Minister thanked the Governors for the various inputs given during the course of the Conference. 

The Prime Minister said that India does not lack in ideas, resources and capabilities, but certain States and regions have lagged behind due to a governance deficit. He said various government schemes for the benefit of the poor, are better implemented in areas where good governance exists. Giving examples of schemes such as Mission Indradhanush, he said Governors can facilitate greater effectiveness of government initiatives. 

In order to strengthen the unity and integrity of India, the Prime Minister urged Governors to involve themselves in initiatives such as Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat; and Run For Unity.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today spoke at the opening session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhawan. 

He observed that all Governors can become catalytic agents for change in society, while upholding the sanctity of the Constitution. Mentioning the target of New India by 2022, the Prime Minister emphasized that this can be achieved only by making it a people's movement. 

He encouraged Governors to interact at length with students and teachers in this regard. Giving the example of the recent Hackathon conducted by the Union Government, where students had proposed technology solutions to several problems, he said Universities should be centres of innovation. 

In the same vein, he said youth in every State must focus on one sport. He encouraged Governors to lead by example on the cause of Swachhata, or cleanliness. He said Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019, is a source of inspiration, as we work towards an Open Defecation Free India. The Prime Minister said that festivals and anniversaries can be great motivators and energizers in the quest for change. He said that Governors can also motivate banks to give loans under Mudra to tribals, Dalits and women, especially in the period between Constitution Day on November 26th, and Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Diwas on December 6th. 

The Prime Minister encouraged Lt. Governors of Union Territories to share the best practices being adopted by them in areas such as solar energy, DBT, and making Union Territories kerosene free. He said these achievements must be extended across all Union Territories speedily.

Today is the occasion of birth anniversary of Loknayak Jaiprakash Ji and today is also the occasion of birth centenary of one of the closest aid of Loknayak Jaiprakash Shriman Nanaji Deshmukh. Both of these great souls made such a solemn pledge in their lifetime and they completely dedicated themselves, they spent every moment of their lives in order to realise that pledge for the welfare of fellow countrymen and the motherland. Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan had been the source of inspiration for the youth during the freedom movement. Quit India movement reached its peak in 1942. The British Raj had sent all the great leaders including Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel in jail and at that time Jayprakah Ji and Lohia Ji, youth like them took control of the movement by coming forward and they had become a source of inspiration of the youth of that era.

During that era of our freedom struggle Jayprakash Ji had become a source of inspiration for the youth as the people’s leader. However, when after the independence many stalwarts were searching for their place in the corridors of power it was Jayprakash Narayan who maintained a distance from the politics of power and after the independence Jayprakash Ji and his wife Shrimati Prabha Devi Ji opted the path of rural development and public welfare.

Nanaji Deshmukh, the country was not familiar with him much at that time. He dedicated his life for the country but when Jayprakash Ji was fighting a war against corruption, even before the emergency, once again Jayprakash Ji had joined the student movement due to the pain caused to him because of corruption, because of corruption at high offices of the country. Jayaprakash Narayan once again came in public life after taking inspiration from the student movement of Gujarat and it caused a lot of upheaval in the government in Delhi. And many conspiracies were being hatched to figure out how to stop Jayprakash Ji. And things went that far that a big assault was mounted on Jayprakash Ji in Patna when a procession was taken out during a public function. At that time Nanaji Deshmukh was standing next to him. And he put forward his hand to face that deadly blow. His bones were broken but he was able to shield Jayprakash Ji from that assault. And it was such an event that attracted the attention of the country towards Nanaji Deshmukh. Throughout his life Nanaji lived for the country. With the help of Deendayal Research Institute he developed such couples whom he taught to live for the country, to accomplish something for the country in any case, and he invited young couples with this formula. And hundreds of such couples came forward and he deployed those couples in the development work of villages. At a time when Morarji bhai was the Prime Minister, and it was the rule of Janata Party, Nanaji Deshmukh was invited to become a minister in the cabinet. Nanaji had politely refused to join the council of ministers by following the footsteps of Loknayak Jayprakash Ji and left the political life after the age of sixty for the rest of his life, for nearly three and a half decades he dedicated his life in development of rural life by making Chitrakoot, by making Gonda centre of his life.

Today, I’m happy that government of India is taking several steps on the occasion of the birth centenary of Nanaji Deshmukh to increase the people’s participation to develop the villages as per the dreams of those great souls and as per the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi as how we can move forward in that direction, how we can make our villages self dependent, how to make our villages free from poverty, free from diseases; even today the poison of casteism destroys our villages, it shatters the dreams of that villages, how to make our villages prosperous by thinking beyond casteism, how to make it the village that takes everyone along and where all the people collectively take a pledge for the welfare of the village.  The govt of India is taking several steps to boost the rural development based on public  participation.

Today; those people who think about the rural life, who have made contributions to rural life, who have mastery over various subjects of rural economy and rural agricultural life, more than 300 such people sat here throughout the day yesterday, they sat in different groups and they deliberated on the development of villages in modern context and these experienced people thoroughly debated the issue throughout the yesterday and an effort has been made to present the essence of that deliberation through a video just a while ago. However, I’d like to assure these people that the points that have been selected after their deliberations, the government of India will take note of them, it will take them seriously and the issues that are implementable, these reference points will be included in the schemes of government of India. These deliberations and discussions have taken place on the rural life of India in such a massive forum after a gap of several years. People from different corners of the country have come. The nature of different areas are different, their problems, their resources and their problems are different. If the development of a villages will be connected to the roots of the village as per its liking, its tendency and as per its nature then it will be a guarantee for a sustainable growth. Sometimes rural life cannot muster the courage to adopt those things that have been imposed from outside, these things that have been imposed on rural life as a foreign element end up in form of a conflict. And that is why it is our effort that we will develop a model for development of a village by first taking into account that village’s own strength, its own prowess with which the people of the village are familiar and which is appropriate for them. It requires minor modification. And for that purpose a support system is required from economic point of view, from the point of view of technology and if we move forward by strengthening it then the village easily adopts that thing. The village completely takes upon itself the journey of the development and it becomes a guarantee for sustainable development. Your deliberation is based on the ground realities and those things which are based on the ground realities; and I’m confident about the speed with which we want to carry out the rural development; we should keep one thing in mind that just having a desire for the development is not enough. And if we do our job in a time bound manner, if we fully implement our schemes for those who are beneficiaries of our programs, for those who are our target group, there should not be any diversion or delusion in those objects with which the scheme was started and we should try to implement it in a time bound manner and it should not be based on output but it should be rather based on the outcome. Just this is not enough that we have given that much fund but rather this should be the case that this was our target for this kind of budget and we achieved that. And if we make a comprehensive effort and if we do it in a time bound manner then I’m confident that when we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022 by then the pace of our development will be so fast that it can bring about the changes in that rural person’s life who had been waiting for the realisation of his dreams due to the current speed of development in our rural life during the last seventy years. Today, a rural citizen wants to live his life with the same facilities those are available to an urban citizen. The facilities that are available in the cities the same facilities should be available in villages. If the cities are glittering with the electricity then it should be the case with the villages as well, if the urban people can watch TV whenever they want to then the village people should also have the same facility and if a city student can carry out experiment by visit a school laboratory then this opportunity should also be available to rural students. If the city students are receiving technological education through a modern computer then the rural students should also get the same opportunity. They should also get the same opportunity to develop in the technological field.

These days, sometimes teachers are not willing to stay in villages, doctor wants to go back by the night; but the same facilities that are available in the cities, like tap water, like availability of optical fibre network, like the internet connectivity, round the clock availability of electricity and gas connection, if we succeed in providing these facilities then there will be a qualitative change in the life of rural people and it will also encourage people to stay in the village. If a teacher stays in the village, if a doctor, if a public servant stays in the villages then their presence becomes a big reason for brining the change in the rural life. And that is why it is our effort to move ahead in the crucial direction of bringing about the changes in rural life by following the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, by following the deliberations of Deendayala Upadhyay and also by following the ideals with which people like Nanaji and Jayprakash Ji had lived. Keeping in mind this stream of ideals our efforts are to go ahead in the direction of a change in rural life.

We were not able to provide anything to the last man due to lack of resources in our country; today, I’m not convinced with this kind of argument after forming the government at the central level. There is no dearth of resources in the country if we want to give the rights of the last person of the country to him. If there is any deficiency then it is the lack of good governance. You can notice changes in those states which have good governance and where the government machinery is committed for completing the job in a time bound manner. You see MNREGA, MNREGA has its one unique aspect, it was devised to provide employment to the poor people of rural areas. But the experience suggests that those states where poverty is more prevalent, less work is done under the MNREGA in those states. However, those states where poverty is not prevalent much but if the state is proactive, if good governance is there then they devise more schemes, they attach more people and are able to carry out more work. And that is why it is a continuous effort of our government to emphasise on good governance for the rural development.

Today, the digital dashboard – DISHA - that has been presented to you people, it is an important step in the direction of good governance. Everything can be centrally monitored due to it, things can be reviewed within a stipulated time and if there are shortcomings then the measures should be taken to correct them and if there is a policy problem then the policy should be modified and if person is problem then the person should be corrected. But first thing is that due to this DISHA dashboard this monitoring system will connect with every village of the country. And second thing is if we are able to arrange the vision of government of India, the schemes of the state governments and our members of parliament and district units in one common thread then we will certainly get the desired results if we accord priority to them. And that is why the government of India has done this important work of actively linking the people’s representatives through this DISHA dashboard. Member of Parliament reviews all these schemes by sitting with the district units. Priority is decided according to the needs. Things are not imposed from here. And this has led to a great success in speeding up the work. Success of democracy is not merely how many people cast their votes in the ballot box, how many people go for it. Unfortunately for many years our democracy has been limited to these things only, going to polling booth once in five years, putting ballot paper in the box or just pressing the button. And then whichever government is elected or whichever body is elected, whichever panchayat is elected, they will decide our fate for five years. I think democracy cannot be considered to be limited to this only. An important task of democracy is to choose a government of your own choice, but the success of democracy comes when the country is governed with the participation of its people. Development journey of village must proceed with public participation, development journey of city must proceed with public participation and hence it is important to have dialogue between government and people. There should be a dialogue about life. Right guidelines should move from top to bottom and correct information should move from bottom to top. If this two way channel is perfect then plans, policies and budget allocation, all things can be targeted at right place. And hence, today through a mobile app, a villager can send correct information through his mobile phone, and from the top correct guidance can be delivered to the last man standing and because of this the local body there, which is a government entity, is also under pressure because the villager says: Sir, you told that this is the scheme but my mobile phone says the scheme is different, now you tell me why this has not been implemented here. We are trying to accomplish this extremely big task of making the public aware and giving direction to the work by increasing interaction with the people and understanding its needs through this mobile app using technology.

Even today, many things have been inaugurated throughout the country. In the same way, a very important plant of Phonemics Center of the Agriculture Department was inaugurated today. Animal husbandry and agricultural sector are the focal points of our country’s rural economy. But along with that our rural artisans also have a huge contribution in the rural economy. And therefore, whether it is agriculture, animal husbandry, handloom or people associated with handicrafts, we are working towards strengthening the pillars of our economy by associating them. We have resolved to double the income of Indian farmers by 2022 when it will be 75 years of our independence, we are working towards it. On one hand we have to reduce the input cost for a farmer and on the other had we have to increase produce of farmers. If we have to move forward on both these things then we need to move towards modernity and take help of technology. Animal Husbandry, even if the number of livestock is low, but production of milk should be high. The more we move towards increasing per capita production of milk the more it will help the rural economy.

The demand for honeybee wax in place of chemical wax is increasing all over the world. Now days people world over are moving towards honeybee wax instead of chemical wax. If we encourage beekeeping in our villages, if scientific beekeeping is added to animal husbandry of our farmers it will increase the possibilities of extra income. Today, when people want to get rid of chemical wax, there is very huge market of honeybee wax, India has the capacity to capture this very huge market of honeybee wax, we want to move in that direction.

Be it fisheries, poultry farms, animal husbandry or agriculture, if we add timber farming along with animal husbandry or agriculture and we start timber farming on the edges of the fields then our country which imports timber, it will be saved from importing timber and farmers of our country will be able to earn so much from timber that they will never face crisis in their families. Five to ten years of hard work is needed and automatically results start to come in, we are working towards furthering rural development with such a comprehensive integrated approach.

Some work we do with the intention of completing them in a set time frame. I am glad, earlier dirt and filth became a part of rural life. People continued to tolerate, they assumed that it was their destiny. And gradually as they became aware they began to change. Open Defecation Free, a campaign has been started for the honor of rural mothers and sisters. A campaign for making toilets in a time bound manner was started. And today, gradually the situation has come, that till yesterday, which we used to call toilets, today they are called honor-houses. Honor-house is written on toilets. Really there could not be a greater gift for the honor of mothers and sisters which we can give them by making toilets. Our mothers and sisters have to go in open for defecation, they have to wait till the sun sets, and in the morning they have to go before sunrise. And if nature call comes during day time, how painful it must have been to our mothers and sisters? Till the time it is not experienced, this campaign of Open Defecation Free cannot be successful. And so whenever the issue of making toilets come, look at the dignity of those mothers and sisters, look at their problems. You will also feel that leaving all other work I must first construct and use toilet under Government of India’s toilet scheme.

Over two and a half lakh villages came forward to become open Defecation Free. They did it. I congratulate those villages from my heart, they have taken a very big step for the dignity of our mothers and sisters. And the village that honors its mothers and sisters is a virtuous village for me. I bow down to them, bow down to the villagers who have done this important task.

Today cleanliness has become the nature of our villages. They have also started taking responsibility. Even after 70 years after independence, many of our villages, 18 thousand villages are those which are still living in the 18th century. There is no pillar of electricity, no light bulb, these villages have never seen electricity. We took the initiative, announced from the Red Fort that we will bring electricity to 18,000 villages in 1000 days and I am happy that the state governments also assisted in it, government of India also accelerated it and today we are moving very fast towards that goal of bringing electricity to those 18000 villages, electricity has reached to almost 15000 villages. Now, when electricity has reached the villages we are not going to be stuck there only. Now our dream is that, be it a village house or a city house or any cottage house, every household should have electric bulbs. 24 hours of electricity should be provided, we have taken up this very big task. Poor families had to pay money for an electricity connection and so we have decided to give free connections and provide electricity and I am sure that once electricity is supplied then there will also be a change in their lifestyle, it will improve facilities for their children’s education. Their routine life in inside the house will change, we are moving towards this determined goal of providing round the clock electricity. To change the lives of rural people, there is a need to support the products produced in rural areas as a fashion statement in cities. If things made by ordinary people find some use in big households of a city then it would be a big help for rural economy. If you buy Diwali lamps made by potters from our villages then it will automatically light up the Diwali lamp in that potter’s home and this is not a difficult task for us. If we people living in the cities meet our entire life's needs from the point of view of rural economy then we will also feel a certain newness and there will be a feeling of contentment, therefore cities must become a market place for villages. It should not be that cities become market place only for food grains from villages, if everything that is produced in villages is developed for cities as market place, no village in my country can remain poor, no family in the village can remain poor and we can fulfill that dream of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji who had dreamed of Antyodaya. On the birth centenary of Nanaji Deshmukh, a postal stamp has also been released by the Government of India. I believe whenever this postal stamp reaches people through posts, they will naturally become eager to know more about Nanaji. Such great men, whose only purpose in the life was to live for the nation, bringing about changes in rural lives and conducting experiments for others on his own. After Nana ji started the work in villages, all the Presidents who assumed officer after the start of his work they always remained associated with his work. They continued to praise the work of Nana Ji and used to visit to see the projects themselves and this work is the reflection of unique skills of Nanaji. Today, on the birth anniversary of Nana Ji rural people from across the India have come. All the concerned departments of the Government of India have come together and we are moving ahead with the resolve to bring about changes in rural lives. And I’m confident that when we complete 75 years of independence in 2022; every village should make a solemn pledge, every villager should make a solemn pledge that I will do this thing for my village by 2022; and my village and I will collectively do this thing for the country. And if we move forward by taking this solemn vow then we will be able to realise those dreams of up-liftment of villages with which we have started our journey. I will once again urge you that the exhibition which has been organised here, I have gone to see that just a while ago; there are lot of things to tell to those who have come here; there are examples of successful experiments in the exhibition; I was keen to understand them; I used to halt quite often; I tried to see, tried to understand. I was delighted to see what kind of experiments are conducted in every state, what kind of new initiatives have been taken. How the technology has made inroads in the villages? I was happy to see all those things. I’d like to appeal to you people that however busy you might be or however early you may have to leave, please do watch each and everything of this exhibition thoroughly and also take the contact details of the relevant people. And which of those things are suitable to your village and how you can apply those things in your village? When we see something ourselves then we become well versed with the capabilities of that thing. And therefore I will request you people to spend few hours in this exhibition and observe everything and apply good things in your village. I once again salute Nanaji, bow down to Babu Jayprakash Ji and congratulate all my well-informed citizen brothers and sisters from all the villages and I thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the inauguration of the birth centenary celebration of Nanaji Deshmukh at IARI at Pusa in New Delhi.

The Prime Minister visited an exhibition on the theme ""technology and rural life."" The exhibition showcases good practices and applications, as well as schemes and initiatives of the Ministry of Rural Development. He interacted with some innovators and beneficiaries.

The Prime Minister offered floral tributes to Nanaji Deshmukh and Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan. He released a commemorative postage stamp on Nanaji Deshmukh.

The Prime Minister launched the DISHA Portal - a smart governance tool developed for MPs and MLAs for monitoring of implementation of various Programmes and Schemes of different Ministries in their constituency through a single portal. As on date, integration of datasets of 41 programmes and schemes of 20 Ministries has been achieved on this Portal.

He also launched Gram Samvaad - a citizen centric mobile app to serve and empower the rural citizens of India, by facilitating single window access for citizens to information at Gram Panchayat level, on various Rural Development programs. The App presently covers seven programs of the Ministry of Rural Development.

The Prime Minister digitally inaugurated 11 Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) Buildings and a Plant Phenomics Facility at IARI.

The Prime Minister addressed an audience of over 10,000 people, drawn from Self Help Groups, Panchayats, water conservation innovators, and beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

He said that today marks the birth anniversary of two great leaders - Nanaji Deshmukh and Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan, who devoted their life to the betterment of the nation.

The Prime Minister said that Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan was deeply popular among youth. The likes of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan and Dr. Lohia were active during the 'Quit India' movement, inspired by the clarion call of Mahatma Gandhi, he added. The Prime Minister said that Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan was never interested in power politics, and fought corruption. He said Nanaji Deshmukh also preferred to devote himself towards rural development and making our villages self-reliant, and free from poverty.

Just having the best ideas for development are not enough, the Prime Minister said. He added that initiatives have to be completed on time and the fruits of development must reach the intended beneficiaries. Efforts have to be comprehensive and 'outcome driven', not 'output driven', the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister said that facilities that are associated with cities must also be made available to our villages. He said that the real essence of a democracy is Jan Bhagidari and integrating people in the development journey of cities, and villages. Regular interaction with governments is required, he added.

Noting that lack of sanitation facilities is adversely impacting the development journey of villages, the Prime Minister said that is why the Government have been working to build toilets in rural areas.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with oil and gas CEOs and experts from across the world. 

Top CEOs and officials from Rosneft, BP, Reliance, Saudi Aramco, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Wood MacKenzie, IHS Markit, Schlumberger, Halliburton, Xcoal, ONGC, IndianOil, GAIL, Petronet LNG, Oil India, HPCL, Delonex Energy, NIPFP, International Gas Union, World Bank, and International Energy Agency were present at the meeting. 

Union Ministers Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, and Shri R.K. Singh, and senior officials from NITI Aayog, PMO, Petroleum Ministry and Finance Ministry were also present. 

The meeting was coordinated by the NITI Aayog. In their brief opening remarks, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, and Shri Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman NITI Aayog gave an overview of the work done in this sector. They also emphasized the expected growth in energy demand in India, and the significant progress made in electrification and LPG expansion. 

In a short presentation, CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant outlined the recent developments and challenges in the oil and gas sector in India. 

Various participants appreciated the progress and reforms made in India in the last three years. Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector. Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub, and regulatory issues came up for discussion. Many participants strongly recommended the inclusion of gas and electricity in the GST framework. The Revenue Secretary, Shri Hasmukh Adhia, highlighted the recent decisions of the GST Council regarding the oil and gas sector. 

Thanking the participants for sharing their views, the Prime Minister said that many suggestions received in the last meeting in 2016 have helped policy making. He also said that scope for reform in many areas still exists. The Prime Minister appreciated the focussed suggestions made by the participants. 

The Prime Minister thanked all participants for sharing holistic suggestions, keeping in mind India's unique potential and requirements in the oil and gas sector, instead of merely confining themselves to the concerns of their respective organisations. 

The Prime Minister observed that the suggestions made today covered policy, administrative as well as regulatory issues. 

The Prime Minister thanked the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and Rosneft, for their commitments and support to the energy sector in India. He appreciated the 2030 vision document of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Warmly recalling his visit to Saudi Arabia, he said many progressive decisions are being taken there in the energy sector. He looked forward to various opportunities for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia in the near future. 

The Prime Minister said that the status of the energy sector in India is highly uneven. He welcomed the suggestion made for a comprehensive energy policy. He stressed on the need to develop energy infrastructure and access to energy in Eastern India. He flagged the potential of biomass energy and also invited participation and joint ventures in coal gasification. He welcomed all possibilities for innovation and research in the oil and gas sector. 

The Prime Minister indicated that as India moves towards a cleaner and more fuel-efficient economy, he also wants its benefits to expand horizontally to all sections of the society, and in particular to the poorest.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone of Bhadbhut Barrage over the River Narmada. At a public meeting in Bharuch, the Prime Minister also flagged off the Antyodaya Express between Udhna (Surat, Gujarat) and Jaynagar (Bihar). He also unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone, and Inauguration of various plants of Gujarat Narmada Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. 

Addressing the public meeting, the Prime Minister said that the Antyodaya Express is a commendable initiative, which connects people and particularly helps those who are from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, and work far from their home. He said the train will make it easier for people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to go home for Chhath Puja. 

Neem coating of urea helped farmers and stopped corruption as well as theft, the Prime Minister said. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that Gujarat's strides in animal husbandry have helped farmers. He said that he had asked the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, to send a team to Gujarat and study the Pashu Arogya Melas. He added that a similar Mela had been organised recently in Varanasi, which the Prime Minister had an opportunity to visit.

Dear young friends,

 

You all are IITians. However, I’m such a person with whose name those two I-es were never attached. All of you are IITians, however, I remained TN since childhood. That TN of TEA meaning Tea Vendor. I was thinking that the youth of college were very sharp and they don’t take this much time. And exactly the same thing happened. Today is the 7th of October. A massive earthquake had struck on 26 January 2001 and after that such a situation was created which was not the path of my life and all of sudden I was entrusted with a new responsibility by swearing in as the chief minister in this very Gandhinagar on 7 October 2001. Neither I knew the system of governance, nor had I seen the assembly but a new responsibility was given to me. However, I had mentally vowed that I would not turn my back from hard work and today this country has always given me some or some other new responsibility and I am amongst you under this new responsibility.

Today, some rural young men and women from different parts of the country are present here, some old people are also among them, whom I have given the certificates before anyone else. I was asking them all sorts of question and I was surprised as they knew everything about what they were doing in the villages, how they have been helping people, what kind of training they have got, how they will use their training? They have been able to answer all of my questions. And I think this is a revolution. The world has seen that kind of knowledge revolution of technology in the last 50 years which was not seen by the country and the world in the last 300 years before that. Technology has become a part of life; technology has become a driving force in itself. And if any country wants to progress in such an era then it is essential for the people at every level in the country be it cities or be it villages, be it educated or uneducated, be it youth or be it an old person, it’s a must to connect them with technology for a bright future.

As Mahatma Gandhi had laid emphasis on literacy during the freedom movement; if literacy had its own strength during the freedom struggle similarly digital literacy is a very important force during the movement for good governance. And that is why it is an effort of government of India to take steps in the direction to provide digitally literacy to every village of the country and to every generation in the villages of the country. And today’s programme, there are nearly six crore rural households in the country and we have taken upon us the task of imparting the digital literacy to at least one person of each of these six crore families. We have created a module of 20 hours which is being taught to those people. Online exams are being conducted, he had to appear in the exam while sitting in front of a video camera and then only that person is being certified. And it is our experience that some one’s age, education, these things are not relevant for digital literacy, it doesn’t mean much, it is not important.

There was a time when Carl Marks philosophy was the guiding principle in the world. People used to quote the ideas of Karl Marx, like his theory of haves and have nots, those who have everything and those who have nothing. He has developed his political ideology on the basis of this divide. Whether it has succeeded or has failed, the wise people will discuss this thing. At present, that ideology is visible nowhere after gradually shrinking. Just a few sign boards of them have remained. However, in terms of technology we will have to make a cautious effort for a bright future of the country so that the digital divide does not emerge. If some people are expert in the use of digital technology and some others are completely oblivious then this kind of digital divide could cause a big threat to our social structure given the kind of changes are expected in it. And that is why for the development of social harmony and by incorporating the fundamental issues of development we have launched this campaign in the direction of digital literacy in rural India to remove this digital divide. We are aware that if we bring home a modern TV set that is operated through a remote then how do we feel initially? However, when a two three year old kid shuffles the channel as per the requirement, he learns how to turn on and turn off then even the old people of the family also feel like the need to learn these things. And then they also learn how to switch it off or turn it on. Has anyone seen the classroom where it is being taught how to forward a message on Whatsapp? Is there any institute in the country that teaches how to forward a message in Whatsapp? But you know that people have learnt how to forward a message in Whatsapp. I mean to say if we follow the path of user friendly technology then we can easily take the country in the direction of digital literacy. Digital literacy, digital technology and digital India are a guarantee for good governance and for transparency.

Government of India has conceived a path of development through JAM trinity. JAM J-Jandhan Account, A- Aadhaar, M-Mobile Phone, our government has been following the path of development by being present in the mobile phone of a common man as per his requirement by connecting these three things. A massive campaign has been launched in the country for laying the optical fiber network; an attempt has been made to lay the optical fiber network in the lakhs of villages of the country at a rapid pace. And today it has become possible to provide good education, long distance education through digital medium to our future generations, to our poor kids located in the far flung areas. And as the optical fiber network will gradually reach every village of the country it will completely transform the education system of that village, it will completely transform the health services and other public convenience facilities provided by the government. And we have been following the same design and as a part of that thing today; these people who have come from the different parts of the country; those who have done the course of community service centre; and there are several others who are going to enroll for this course and in the coming days this training will be imparted to one individual each in the six crore families. And it is going to become a means of livelihood for them as now the services will be delivered through them and we should make effort in that direction. Sometimes we experience this thing, you might have seen a lot of people who buy the latest mobile phones, who buy the best mobile phones after seeing its advertisement in TV or in a news paper or in a magazine or if they come to know about it through the Google Guru then the first thing they do is to buy that mobile. But you will find that 80% people are neither aware about the so many facilities available in that mobile nor they have a developed a habit of using them. Perhaps, you can find some people here in IIT as well who don’t have a habit of exploiting the full potential of a mobile phone even if they have the best models. And that is why if we are digitally literate only then we can make the best use of the money spent by us and in a way we can also add value. And that is why we have launched this campaign for digital literacy. And this digital literacy will play a big role in making the society a less cash society.

The BHIM App that is being developed by government of India, it’s a wonder for the other countries of the world. The data bank created through Aadhaar based digital biometric system is a wonder for the entire world. We have been moving forward in the direction of linking the development, linking the empowerment through that and I believe that it is going to be used in a very big manner. Today, I’m fortunate that I got the opportunity to publicly dedicate the new campus of this IIT. And if it was election time and if had decided to provide this land at that time, nearly 400 acres of land that too in Gandhinagar, and that too on the banks of river Sabarmati, you can imagine how costly this land is and had it been the election time when I had taken the decision then some people would have started speaking against it as they have been speaking against the bullet train these days. They would have said that Modi you are spending money on IITs at a time when the structure of primary education in Gujarat is not up to the mark. They would have certainly criticised it. However, it’s good that when I took the decision to provide the land then it was not the election time. However, now you will realise that how foresighted this decision was. And that day I had told, Sudhir Ji and people of the department would recall that that day I had said that IIT is a brand, IIT has become a brand in India, however, the brand of a campus among the IITs will be more powerful. In the coming days it will be discussed that which campus is like what. And that is why I have said that I need a campus in Gujarat that can become the top most campus among the best IITs. And today I’m happy to note that this campus has acquired the parity with the top IITs of the country. Campus has its own strength and faculty is the second strength of an institution and I’m happy as I was told that today 75% of faculty of IIT Gandhinagar has been trained abroad, who have gained expertise there and they have decided to devote their time and energy for the students of this IIT. And I welcome their decision. However, the government of India has posed a challenge for the educational institutions of the country. I want the IIT Gandhinagar to come forward to accept this challenge. Will you accept it? What happened to all the IITans? The response is coming forward from that side. This is for the first time that this kind of reform has been done in India’s education sector which was expected for several years but no one was able to muster the courage.

Today, even after 70 years of independence, we are nowhere in the top 500 universities of the world. Whether this stigma should be removed or not? Whether we can take our universities to that level in the world by 2022 when we complete 75 years of our independence so that we can also say that we too have done something. Can we do this thing or not? This is for the first time that the government of India has decided to select 10 public and 10 private universities through the challenge route. And nearly Rs. 1,000 crore will be provided. And if these 10 public and 10 private universities, if these universities win this challenge, if they come up and they establish global standards then they will be given this kind of freedom to demonstrate their strength by liberating them from the regulations of central and state governments. The government would not interfere in their syllabus, in their faculty or campus or in any other manner. They should decide all these things themselves and produce results. The government is willing to provide Rs. 1,000 crore for those 20 universities. Gandhinagar IIT has such a large campus of 400 acres and all the facilities are being created at a cost of Rs. 1,700 crore. I’m confident that Sudhir Jain and his entire team and all these youth should collectively come forward, they should take up this task. In order to develop a country it’s necessary that we create institutions from time to time. Gujarat can take pride on this thing that in the last 10 years it has given several institutions of global level to the country. Even today there is only one forensic science university anywhere in the world. Gujarat is the only place which has its own forensic science university. This is the only university in the world. Even today there is no university in India like the Indian institute of teacher education - IITE - that prepares best quality teachers. Students do graduation, post graduation in teaching and come out as the best of the best teachers from there. Gujarat is the first state in the country which has established a university like Indian Institute of Teacher Education. Gujarat is the first country which has established Children University. Nowhere in the world there is a Children University. Today, the world is moving in the direction of micro family. Mothers are busy themselves, fathers are busy themselves. The child is being left as a responsibility of the domestic help of the family. The time demands that we need to create such an institution for the proper development of our small kids, for properly tending them and the roots for their development as good citizens should be sown during the childhood. And this children university should conduct research on this topic. What kind of toys should be there for children, walls of their rooms should be painted in which color, what kind of songs should be played for children, what kind of nutritional values their food should have, what kind modern techniques should be used in teaching so they easily grasp things, there is a need to conduct research on all these topics.

Earlier their used to be joint families and the family used to be a university in itself. A kid used to learn one thing from grander mother and another thing from grandfather and yet another thing from his uncle. A kid used to learn one thing from mother and another thing from paternal uncle. In today’s micro families, the doors for this kind of learning have been shut on them therefore this idea was conceived and this Children University was established to take care of, to think about the kids of future generations. And this thing was conceived on this land of Gujarat.

There are three important areas in the field of crime, the first one is legal faculty, the second one is police and the third one is forensics for crime detection and Gujarat has worked on all these three things; national law university was created that will produce the best of the best lawyers and judges and it will take the responsibility of the judicial education part; a police university was created and there are only a handful of universities in the country for policing and Gujarat is one among those states. Gujarat was the second state in the country to set up a police university. Defence Force university was set up for those who want to join uniformed forces so that they can join that stream after the 10th or 12th and can complete their education there only so that they can learn communication deal, crowd management, crowd psychology management, so that he knows about the sections of Indian Penal Code of the country and he can opt for recruitment in police after getting educated. So the Gujarat took initiative to bring about a qualitative change in the country’s defence sector. And the forensic science university, you must be aware that today all the crimes have been solved and criminals have been arrested due to use of technology. If the strength of forensic science university; the more students of forensic sciences we develop the more forensic science will play the most important role in dealing with crimes be it cyber crime or any other crime, or be it protection from those crimes or be it detection of those crimes and ensuring punishment for criminals. So all these three faculties have been developed simultaneously on this land of Gujarat and it is going to make a very big contribution to the country. And today, those people, who have done some new experiments in the country or in the world, they have been associating themselves with these universities. And when today I am sitting among the IIT-ians then I’m aware that a big part of your time is being spent in the lab. You people keep doing new or novel thing but most of the time it is exam oriented innovation or exam oriented projects but I don’t want the youth of my country to remain stuck in this allay. The time demands that we lay emphasis on innovation.

Government of India has developed the institutes under the name of AIM under the NITI Ayog. Atal Innovation Mission or AIM and through them we have been providing money to those schools which have been selected through the challenge route for setting up tinkering labs and we inspire the students of 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 10thstandards for innovation. The natural talent that we have, it will have to go in for innovations in order to change the fortune of the country. The country which has mastery over Information Technology but Google is being created in some other country! The country which has youth who have mastery over IT but Facebook is being developed somewhere else! YouTube is being developed somewhere else and I want this thing, I challenge the youth of this country: please come forward and follow the path of innovation for changing the fortune of the country and the world. It’s not like that intelligence is somebody’s personal property. If once you engage with these things then you will also end up in discovering novel things and you will end up in giving so much to the country and to the world. Sometimes we have that tendency to do new things; but there is another way for innovation and I’d like to guide you and today I hope that you will pay attention to my suggestions. It’s a different thing to innovate on the basis of the academic knowledge that you have and the subjects you have studied like the basic structural engineering that you have studied. Another way is that you look at the problems and difficulties around you and then think whether I can solve this thing! And that poor fellow, he is leading a difficult life but I’m an IIT-ian and I will do something so that his life improves and that thing in itself will become an innovation. And sometimes it can be done on such a big scale that it can become a big business model. Our country has plenty of problems, for example cleanliness campaign is underway and why not our youth doing innovations do something to create wealth from the waste. Why not they take new and newer projects of innovation?

Today, lot of work is happening in the field of solar energy. Today, we have been making use of solar energy, wind energy, renewable energy and climate change but what kind of things we should innovate as per the country’s requirement so that we can provide at least one thing in every Indian home. Can we set every Indian family free from the expenses on cooking fuel as abundant solar light is available in our country? Why not we develop cooking equipments that use solar energy? Those equipments should be used for cooking food so that people don’t have to buy cooking fuel, so that they don’t have to use a fire stove? They should have their own solar plants, they should have two solar panels on their roof top so that the food as per the requirement of that household can be cooked. So will it save the expenses on the cooking fuel of kitchens of poor families, middle class families or not? We see these small things, minute things. Why should we not take them up for innovation and why should we not find solutions for them? And I am confident that IIT Gandhinagar will create a culture, it will develop a culture of innovation and that culture should be need based. And that innovation will be sustainable that is based on some needs and not based on some knowledge. It becomes scalable and it also gets the opportunity of becoming commercial and top companies also come forward to purchase them. So I would like the IIT to work in this direction.

And I’d like to share one more thing with the youths of IIT. Perhaps Gujarat is the first state in the country that has created an institute under the name of I-Create. Very few people would have heard its name. And as per my information it has become three or four years old but it’s building is yet to be dedicated to public. I’m not able to spare time for its dedication but I will certainly do so. This I-Create provides incubation to those people of the states and of the country who are interested in innovation. It has a lab, it has accommodation facility and government is willing to give opportunity to your ideas through it. You people should innovate in such a manner so that the systems to bring about the changes in the lives of the country can be easily developed. This I-Create is one of its kind in India and it has collaboration agreement with the best of the best innovation institutions in the world. I’m giving you this information which does not make headline in the news papers. But it is very important for the young generation which makes the future of the country. And friends that is why I expect this thing from you people and we have a time of five years till 2022 when India completes 75 years of its independence.

 

In 1942, Mahatma Gandhi had said: quit India and within the next five years the country rose up to the call in such a manner that the British had to leave the country. My fellow countrymen, if we also rise up to the occasion for five years to rid the country of poverty, to rid the country of casteism, to rid the country of corruption and to rid the country of nepotism then all these things can be achieved in the country. Friends please come forward and walk with me shoulder to shoulder. We have marched ahead with the pledge to accomplish these things.

And I’d like to tell one more thing to the youth of IIT. You people must have been told a lot of things, given a lot of advice at the time of convocation. You people live in such a grand building, you people have been getting education in such a grand building. Whether all these things became possible just because you had a sharp mind or just because your parents were wealthy people and they were in sound position so that they could send you here? Despite all these things, my young friends you people are here in such a grand campus, you people have been fortunate to obtain the best of the best education because some or some other poor person has contributed for this thing. You people have got from the share of some poor person’s rights. This 400 acres of land, if the government has sold this land for money and then constructed buildings for the primary education then how many buildings would have been constructed? Had the government constructed primary health care centres then how many PSE centres would have been constructed? But this 400 acres of land has been dedicated for the brighter future of my country. We have got these things as some poor section of our society has foregone its rights. And if I have these feelings then despite being an IIT-an my sensitivity for the society will never come down. And my intent of doing something for the society will never diminish. And if I live then I will live for the common man of my country and if I achieve something, if I’m able to accomplish anything then I will do it for the common man of my country. So you people also take this solemn pledge at the time of dedication of this new building. With this one expectation alone, I convey my best wishes to you people.

Thank you very much.

                My dear brothers and sisters of Surendranagar district who are present here in large numbers.

Whether Chotila would have ever thought that one day an airport will be built here? Whether Surendranagar district has ever thought this? Won’t you feel good if an airport is being built here? Should an airport be built here or not, yes? Will it be called development if an airport is being built here, aircraft take off from here and all the arrangements are being made here? Do you like this development? Should development take place? Is development necessary? Whether the development will change the future of Gujarat? Will the development change the future of your children? Well done!

 You ask the poorest of the poor, you ask him who don’t have a house whether he needs a house and he will say: yes. And if a house is to be provided to him, if we need to make arrangements for his accommodation then it is not possible without development. The development used to take place earlier as well but at that time if a politician had arranged for installation of a hand pump in a locality in some village then he would keep reminding the people this thing for the next three elections ‘that I had installed a hand pump at your place and please support me in the elections as I’ve arranged a hand pump for this place’. He used to ask for ensuring his victory in the elections as he has done developmental work at your place. And what was it? It was installation of a hand pump, installation of a hand pump for water. This was the definition of development.

 Today, this is such a government that has been supplying the water of mother Narmada to every village, every household by building such a massive pipeline. And if any district is going to get the maximum benefit in the entire Gujarat due to Narmada scheme then; then the name of district is…what is the name of that district? What’s the name? The name of that district is Surendranagar. The water of Narmada; mother Narmada has come to your homes to make this barren land a place of happiness. And it’s not like that the impact of Narmada will only touch the rural and agricultural sector. The Narmada water has a sort of power, that due to this water Surendranagar district is going to become a very big hub of industrial development in the coming days. Maximum opportunities of employment will be generated in Surendranagar district. It will become big a centre for education because when water is available then the government’s ability to development systems will go up. And this airport that is being built, will also contribute in the same manner. In the coming days it will create a competition for the development among Surendranagar, Rajkot or Morbi districts,  whether  whom should be  developed faster than the other. And it’s going to be a healthy competition. And that is why in the middle of Surendranagar district and Rajkot district, which are having the potential for fast development, the government is taking an important step today of laying the foundation for building a grand airport by spending hundreds of crore rupees. There will be some people who would not feel good even about this thing. But if you ask them to travel in bus, ask them why they travel in an aircraft then they will say that they need to reach early. So as if just they need to reach early and the rest of the people don’t have to reach early!

 It’s not that old era when only kings used to travel by air. And that is why I’ve said that I’d like to develop the country’s aviation sector in such a manner that a person wearing a hawai chappal (slipper) will be able to afford the air travel and you will be surprised to see this. These days aviation sector is getting importance world over. However, in India no aviation policy was made after the independence. Have you ever thought this thing? Government of India, did not have an aviation policy. We made the aviation policy after forming the government and it is not confined only to big places like Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Chennai, we have taken up this task of providing air connectivity to smaller places. Those places where there is no connectivity for long distances, and if the air travel to that place takes more than one hour, if the travel time is less than a hour then we have strengthened the aviation sector by fixing the ticket cost at Rs. 2,500. And so far 8 routes have become operational. Kandala is getting benefit in Gujarat, Mithapur is getting benefit. And small places will be connected in future due to this thing. Today, there are several states in India where two or three airports, airstrips are already present there. However, there will be a situation when in every state 10-15-20 airports will be operational. And that is why the way the number of air travelers are increasing, and you would be happy to note as I have got the latest information that the number of air travelers has gone up by 14%; and that is why I congratulate the people of Gujarat and people of this region for this work of Greenfield project that is being carried out in Rajkot. I’m happy that in this project, for this massive airport only 4% land was acquired from the farmers. Only 4% and the 96% land was barren land on which the airport will be constructed. That is why the barren land has been selected over the land of Surendranagar which is important from the point of agriculture. And we have used that land for the airport. As Vijay Bhai was talking about that the Rajkot airport has so many boundaries that these days its boundary wall is visible even from the bus stand. And that is why Rajkot and this entire area are getting developed. So by keeping the future in mind, and that day is not far away when international service will operate from this place. If someone is required to visit anywhere in the world then this airport located between Chotila and Rajkot is going to be used. So this very important work is happening today.

 Today, we have been conducting two other important programs in Surendranagar and Wadhwan. Soor-Sagar, it is going to become an ocean of happiness for you people in the future. Animal husbandry is going to develop due availability of water. Per capita milk production is also going to be increased. Our Soor-Sagar dairy; five-seven years ago. The earlier governments had made a law to prohibit the formation of dairies, I’m surprised why this thing would have been done! When I was chief minister then I had decided the government exchequer will help those who will come forward to form dairies and today the dairy industry has developed with full enthusiasm in almost every district of Saurashtra. There cannot be any greater help to cattle raisers than this thing. They should get the proper price for milk; and today I got the opportunity to dedicate the modernization work of a plant. And milk production is going to go up after the coming of this Soor-Sagar and mother Narmada and in the true sense of the work this has become the ocean of happiness for Surendranagar district and I wish you people that this ocean of happiness flourishes further.

 Dhoridhaja Dam, I still remember when I came here to welcome the Narmada water in Dhoridhaja Dam then the entire district was happy. Only a thirsty person knows the yearning for water, these people of Kutch-Saurashtra and Gujarat know that what availability of water means to them. There was a time, and in Wadhwan earlier the water was supplied once in 15-20 days. If the guests were expected then they were asked to please visit during the noon time as if they come during the night then host won’t be able to arrange water for their bathing the next morning. This region has faced this kind of days. And today, this kind of 300-350 kilometers long, this kind of water pipes are laid here to provide more water easily to people of Wadhwan Nagar. The newly constructed water tank and because of it the facility of potable water; and I believe that no matter how many blessings the sisters of this region give that will not be enough. These sisters who have been liberated from this hardship, whatever blessings they give that is not going to be enough. Today, the latest rebuilding of the road along Morbi, the widening of the road between Ahmedabad and Rajkot; and today’s generation can’t easily grasp these things but if you have time then please refer to the news papers of the time when BJP government was not in power. There were road accidents at least four times in a week on Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway. Several mothers lost their young children. Families were spoiled. There will be more than 100 big accidents in a year and it was due to the fact that the road was very narrow. And I still remember, at that time I was not in Rajkaran. We used to receive phone calls from Limbadi-Bagodara, and at that time mobile phones were not there, old phones were there, that a big accident has taken place and I used to rush our Ashokbhai from Ahmedabad. We were required to do this thing at least 2-4 times in a week. If you ask the people of Rajkot, if you ask the people of Surendranagar then there will be several families who would have lost some family members in the road accidents.

 When the BJP government was formed in 1995 and Keshubhai became chief minister then the first thing that was decided was to build roads to save those innocent people who had been dying in road accidents. And this thing was done by BJP government and as a result of that the numbers of road accidents have come down. And today the traffic has increased further. Government of India has decided that we should make it a modern six lane highway as roads and highways are essential for development. Speed is necessary for progress and when speed is essential then be it making the arrangements for the aircraft or be it widening of the roads, we should simultaneously focus on these things. Be it the road towards Morbi and widening of road to Morbi means strengthening the industrial activity. An industrial belt has been developed up to Kutch and this structure is going to help in that thing.

 And that is why today when I got the opportunity for simultaneous dedication and laying of the foundation stones for five projects in Panchal Panthak; and in just a few days, and the government of Gujarat is giving importance to Panchal Panthak for pilgrimage as well, and due to that thing the mother Godess Chamunda of Chotila, Trinetreshwar Tarnetar, Sundari Bhawani, Surajdeval, Bandiaveli, Jaria Mahadev, Gebinath, Avaliathakar, these all are our religious places in Panchal Panthak region, and the government of Gujarat has begun a great work for their development by connecting them with each other as Yatradham. We were thinking how to bring foreign tourists to our Tarnetar fair? But when an airport will be constructed in Chotila then it will not take much time for your Tarnetar fair to develop as an international fair. So in way, the development work should be directly related to the economy, it should cause economic progress. With this clear approach, Government of India has been placing emphasis on the journey of development in several corners of the country. I also welcome the Gujarat government for the consistent momentum that it has provided, for the new dimensions that it has provided to this developmental journey and today we are moving forward with the pledge of a developed Gujarat, a modern and prosperous Gujarat.

 We are completing 75 years of our independence in 2022. We have time of five years with us. Every citizen of the country should decide what he wants to contribute in these five years. It should not be like this that someone else should do something, government or municipality should do this or that thing. I will do it, I will certainly do this thing in next five years for my country, every citizen of the country should take this pledge. I request Surendranagar district that at a time when there is a possibility of a bumper crop, when mother Narmada has come to our homes then at this time there should not be a single farm in Surendranagar district that doesn’t use drip irrigation. And we should make our farming modern by using this drip-irrigation, by using micro-irrigation and sprinklers. If the farmers of Surendranagar district adopt drip-irrigation for farming then you just can’t imagine the kind of revolution we can bring. And it will be useful for us to judiciously use the water of mother Narmada and that is why the question of water has always been a question of life and death for Gujarat and when water has become available then we should love it more than our lives. We should not waste a single drop of it, we should not spend it without properly using it. This is the responsibility of every citizen of Gujarat.

 When we will celebrate 75 years of our independence in 2022, for that occasion we should make a solemn pledge, and this drip-irrigation, this micro-irrigation, scientific methods, use of technology, these all are going to play a very important role in our pledge of doubling the farmer’s income by 2022.

 I once again express my heartfelt gratitude for showering this amazing love, for your presence in such a large numbers, for your blessings and I see you people in such large numbers, I see people everywhere as far as I can see from Chotila.

 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail mother India)

Please say it aloud with your full strength by clenching your fists.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail mother India)

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail mother India)

Bharat Mata Ki Jai (Hail mother India)

                My dear brothers and sisters present here in large numbers,

Today, I see Dwarka in a different mood altogether, everywhere there is enthusiasm and spirit is high, it’s like I’m experiencing a new spirit in Dwarka. I convey my heartfelt regards to the people of Dwarka. I thank them. Today, the work that is being started in Dwarka Nagri, that is not just the construction of a bridge alone to reach Bet Dwarka. It’s not like that it’s just a structure made of bricks, stones and iron. Today, in a way, construction of this bridge, the work of linking the cultural heritage of Bet Dwarka with thousands of years old relations is happening.

Whenever I used to visit Bet and I used to see this bridge, used to see the clear water, I saw immense potential of tourism there. But, the government of India, you know it very well how much government of India liked Gujarat in the past. How many hardships we used to face? I still remember the condition of the people of Bet. They used to finish all the work before the sunset. Movement used to stop during the night time. Only water ways were available for the movement. It was a life of compulsions and hardships. My dear brothers and sisters of Bet know it very well if someone suddenly falls sick and he is required to be taken to hospital in the night then how difficult it was. And that is why this facility will be a big gift for the travelers from across the country.

Such a facility, which is going to meet the routine requirements of the people of Bet. Such a facility, that will strengthen the potential of development of tourism along the beaches, along the coast line of Bet. And if a traveler comes here but leaves immediately after offering obeisance to Thakur Ji then it doesn’t benefit much to the economy of Dwarka. However, if he stays in the night, he stays for two days and spends thousand or two thousand rupees then it provides livelihood to the poorest of the poor in the economy of Dwarka. People come to Dwarka due to the grace of lord Dwarkadheesh. But if they stay in Dwarka, and they will certainly stay in Dwarka if we will provide facilities to them. And that is why we have given priorities to development of those facilities for a tourist that if he comes then he feels like staying, feels like staying for one or two days. He feels like spending the evening on sea beach, so that he feels delighted by seeing the sunset. The government is continuously working to create this kind of facilities.

Please imagine the Dwarka of 8-10 years ago and Dwarka of today. How much things have changed? And tourism doesn’t develop by developing an isolated corner. It needs connectivity. The first place should be connected to the second, and the second should be connected to the third and so on. The entire world descends to watch the lions of Gir. However, after having seen the Gir lions if he gets the facility of wide roads or roads of two lanes, four lanes or six lanes to visit Porbandar and Dwarka then it becomes convenient for him. He feels like visiting. And the one who comes to see Gir lions, we should create a situation that he also feels like coming to pay respect to Dwarkadheesh. And who comes to pay respect to Dwarkadheesh then the facilities should be such that he feels like seeing the Gir lions. And that is why the government of India has modified the construction of national highway network in such a way that along with the construction of roads, in addition to providing speed and facility it should also be directly related to economic activity. And this facility should strengthen the economic activity.

Today, this work of widening of national highways up to Ghanutak and whenever I remember Ghanu, I’m reminded of my boys, we have very old workers there, farmers…, but they used to think about all these things. They used to think if we do this thing then it will be good, if we do that then it will be good. They consistently used to think about this thing. Today, we are going to spend a huge amount of money in widening of that road up to Ghanu. And today, in this programme, and one more district, even otherwise you can imagine about the project costing nearly Rs. 6,000 crore connecting Jamnagar, Junagadh to Porbandar districts. Please think of those days when Madhav Singh Solanki used to be the chief minister. At that time a photo was published on the front page of a news paper. And I still remember that image, at that time I was not in politics, I was working in social sector. At that time the then chief minister Madhav Singh came either in Jamnagar or somewhere in Jamnagar district to inaugurate a water tank. It was the concept of the governments at that time and please look at the concept of this government that what kind of bridges and roads are constructed by it. Getting your image published in a full page ad on the front page for inauguration of a water tank, their concept of development was limited to this thing.

The world has changed and we have to scale new heights of development in this changed world so that every Indian can face the world with confidence. This is the dream of every Indian to make this kind of India. This is not a dream of Narendra Modi alone. I’m just trying to fill colors in your dreams, I’m just trying to realise this thing. I’m working hard for this thing. As Nitin Ji told just a while ago that in the context of blue economy there is a region that has capability to give immense strength to the sea capital of Gujarat and also to the economy of the country.  Gujarat has a coast line of 1600 kilometers. Our fishermen brothers and sisters live along that coastline. Full potential of a blue economy is available on our sea shores. We want to develop our ports but we also want to follow the development model based on ports. We want to develop that kind of infrastructure that connects ports with roads, with rails and also with air strips, where ware houses and cold storages are available and the products produced by Indian farmers reach to the world market in the shortest possible time. And the farmers of the country get the maximum price. And that is why we are taking one step after another for development of these facilities. We have launched a new scheme and that is formulated under the blue economy for my fishermen brothers and sisters. And that scheme is; today our fisherman who has a small boat, he goes out in the ocean for fishing but he cannot go beyond 10-12 nautical miles and he is not able to catch enough fishes in this area; he works hard for long hours but comes back after catching half the fishes than required. Shall I allow my fishermen brothers and sisters to lead this kind of difficult life? Should I leave them on their fate? Whether our fishermen brothers and sisters do not have a desire to progress in life? Whether my fishermen brothers and sisters will not have a desire to provide good education to their children? Whether my fishermen brothers and sisters would not like to lead a good life by coming out of their shanties? And if we need to provide all these things then we will have to empower him financially. We will have to empower him. And that is why we have come out with such a scheme that some of our fishermen brothers and sisters who come forward collectively then the government will grant them loan on a concessional rate, will grant them a loan of Rs. 1.5-2 crore. So that he can afford to buy a big boat costing Rs. 1.5-2 crore, and the government will make arrangements for this thing. And if he has a big boat costing Rs. 1.5 crore, Rs. 2 crore then he can go beyond 10-12 nautical miles, he can go deep inside the ocean and there are plenty of fishes in the deep sea and if he is able to go into the deep sea then he will be able to catch three-four times more fish in half a day than what he usually catches in 3-4 days and he can come back to the shores by ensuring the earnings equal to three-four days. And there should be all the arrangements like cold storage etc. This kind of facilities we want to provide to our fishermen. We are taking it forward so that every fishermen brother can take advantage of it. It will change the lives of fishermen.

Kandla Port, the way it has been developed. When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat even then the Kandla port was there and I know very well what was its condition? We used to ask government of India to accord some priority to it. It was an opportunity but Kandla port was not in their priority list. And since the time we got the opportunity to work in the Government of India we have equally focused on the development of the ports of Gujarat as well. And as a result of that Kandla port has developed much more than it had developed in the last 25 years. And people get employment due to this thing. Our Alang, Alang was complaining from how many years? The development of Alang was discussed, hygiene of Alang was discussed. In a way, Bhavnagar’s Alang was a reason behind our identity in the world. At the same time, hundreds of questions were raised in the name of environment. National, international organisations used to raise questions. And it was the responsibility of government of India to think about it, to help in that thing, do something for laborers working in the Alang, to bring about some changes in their lives. And despite my continuous efforts at that time I wasn’t able to wake up the government of India. But today when we have got the opportunity to serve then we prepared a big scheme with the help of Japan; people only remember Japan for Bullet Train, these people forget that we have been moving ahead by devising a big scheme for development of Alang with Japanese collaboration. And due to that thing a big change is going to be brought about in the lives of my worker brothers and sisters of Alang.

The direction of change that we have been following, the efforts that we have been making to bring about development in the new and newer areas for changing the common man’s lives that is going to produce these results.  Mangrol and Veraval have been our traditional fishing hubs. Recently President of India visited that place. I’m extremely grateful to him for laying the foundation stone in Mangrol for such a massive scheme to speed up this project. In the coming days, this fishing hub is going to emerge as a very powerful factor for our fishing industry in this entire Bet region. Our entire coastal region is developing due to this blue economy and due to this tourism based economy and with them development of human resource is also taking place.

Today, I want to announce a gift for the people of Gujarat. And this thing is going to be useful for the country, it’s not only for Gujarat. It will take place on our coast and it will happen on the divine land of Dwarka. India is working in the direction of making its marine police extremely modern for the protection of our coastal borders. Their training will be different from the regular police as they will be completely responsible for the safety of coast line for up to five kilometers in the sea. So in order to to provide the training and research to marine police of the entire country and the biggest and the first such institute will be established in Mojap near the divine land of Dwarka. As we have a training institute inside the Jamnagar airport and people from all over the country take its advantage for air force. Similarly this training institute, this marine police training institute in the divine land of Dwarka for marine police, and this will be such an institute where thousands of people will stay and the training and visits of police personnel from all over the country would be an ongoing thing. You can imagine it very well what kind of huge economic activity will be related to this thing.

Brothers and sisters,

you people are busy in preparing for Diwali. And the festival of Diwali is very special in Gujarat and it is even more special for business community. And today I browsed the news papers of the entire country and they had this headline that Diwali had come 15 days in advance. And there is a Diwali like atmosphere everywhere when we took important decisions about GST yesterday. And we have said this thing on the day one that we would study the GST during the first three months of its implementation and whatever difficulties will be faced in those three months, whatever problems will be with the technology, with the rules; whatever problems will be regarding the rates and also the practical problems faced by the trading community; because we do not want the businessmen of the country to get stuck in red-tapism, get stuck in files and appeasing the officials; we would never want this kind of situation in India. And that is why yesterday our finance minister was able to get the approval for several important decisions on the basis of the information gathered in the last three months by convincing the GST council. And I’m happy that this decision has been welcomed by every corner of the country in one voice and this thing is the strength of the country. When people have faith in a government, when honesty is reflected behind decisions then despite the difficulties the country supports them fully. I am experiencing this thing and that is why I’m grateful to the fellow countrymen for welcoming our effort to make a simple tax GST even more simpler, and for this thing I am grateful to my countrymen and I welcome them.

Brothers and sisters of Dwarka,

Shrikrishna’s Dwarka is submerged and it was the desire of the people of the country and the world that to sanctify themselves by touching the original Dwarka by diving deep into the ocean. I have asked several experts to explore its possibility so that people can go to that ancient city where Lord Shrikrishna had lived and reigned and come back after touching its stones. And then you will see that entire India will be standing here in a queue in Dwarka. Development does not take place only due to talks. It requires a vision, a foresight. It requires a solemn pledge and in order to fulfill that pledge one has to completely dedicate himself and use his full strength. And today, ordinary people in any corner of the country have faith in our government; have expectations of development and expect to get benefits of that development. They don’t want their future generations to get stuck in the vicious circle of poverty and lead the life of penury. It’s our effort even if their current generation has been forced to live in the penury but their children should not be forced to lead the life in poverty. This kind of developmental journey is ongoing today and we have been establishing new benchmarks of development. Today, India has attracted the attention of the entire world towards itself. People of the world have come forward for making investments and as a result of this thing new employment opportunities will be created for the youth of the country. It has generated a possibility of changing the lives of farmers of this country. Several initiatives have been taken to empower the villages of Gujarat. Today, Gujarat is playing an important role in this journey of development; today Gujarat is playing an important role in the development of the country and for this thing I bow down to millions and millions of people of Gujarat and I thank them. And I also convey my heartfelt good wishes to the government of Gujarat for taking forward this process of development.

Jay Dwarkadheesh.

Jay Dwarkadheesh.

Jay Dwarkadheesh.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a public meeting at Chotila, in Surendranagar district. He laid the Foundation Stones for a greenfield airport for Rajkot; six-laning of Ahmedabad-Rajkot National Highway; and four-laning of Rajkot-Morbi State Highway. He also dedicated to the nation, a fully automatic milk processing and packaging plant; and a drinking water distribution pipeline for Joravarnagar and Ratanpur area of Surendranagar. 

The Prime Minister said that it was hard to imagine an airport in Surendranagar district. He said such development works empower citizens. 

He said aviation cannot be about rich people. We have made aviation affordable and within reach of the lesser privileged, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the definition of development has changed. From the days when handpumps were seen to be a sign of development, today the waters of the Narmada River have been brought for the benefit of citizens. He said Surendranagar district tends to benefit a lot from the waters of the Narmada. He urged people to use water responsibly, and conserve every drop. The Prime Minister said that the Sursagar Dairy would bring enormous benefit to the people.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today began his two-day visit in Gujarat by offering prayers at the Dwarkadheesh Temple at Dwarka. 

The Prime Minister unveiled plaques to mark the laying of foundation stones for a bridge between Okha and Beyt Dwarka; and other road development projects. 

The Prime Minister said he saw a new energy and enthusiasm in Dwarka today. He said the bridge whose foundation stone has been laid, is a means to reconnect with our ancient heritage. It will boost tourism, which will generate employment, he added, noting that development will be the key to promoting tourism. 

The Prime Minister recalled how lack of infrastructure, led to difficulties and challenges for the people of Beyt Dwarka, some years ago. 

The Prime Minister said that the development of the tourism sector cannot happen in isolation. He said that if we want to draw more tourists to Gir, we should also inspire the tourists to visit other nearby places like Dwarka. 

Building of infrastructure should enhance economic activities and add to the atmosphere of development, the Prime Minister said. We want development of ports and port-led development; the blue economy should help further the progress of India, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government of India is taking steps towards the empowerment of fishermen. He said Kandla Port is seeing unprecedented growth because resources were devoted to improve the port. He said a new lease of life has been given to Alang, and steps taken for the welfare of the labourers working there. 

The Prime Minister said that the Government is modernising the marine security apparatus. An institute for this will be set up in this Devbhoomi of Dwarka, he added. 

Speaking on the decisions taken by consensus in the GST Council meeting yesterday, the Prime Minister said that when there is trust in a government and when policies are made with best intentions, it is natural for people to support us for the best interests of the nation. 

The Prime Minister asserted that the Government wants to help fulfil the aspirations of the people, and fight poverty. 

The Prime Minister said that the world's attention is being drawn to India, and people are coming to invest here. ""I see Gujarat contributing actively to the development of India and congratulate the Gujarat Government,"" the Prime Minister added.

Your Excellencies, President Tusk and President Juncker,


Distinguished delegates,


Members of the media,


I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome President Tusk and President Juncker for the 14th India-EU Summit.


India values her multi-faceted partnership with the EU, and we attach high importance to our strategic partnership. India was amongst the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community in 1962.


The European Union has been our largest trade partner for a long time. It is also one of our largest sources of Foreign Direct Investment.


As the world’s largest democracies, we are natural partners. Our close relations are founded on the shared values of democracy, rule of law, respect for fundamental freedoms and multiculturalism.


We also share the vision of a multi-polar, rules-based international order. Since the 13th Summit in Brussels last year, our relationship has steadily gained momentum. To use the words of President Juncker a few days ago, India-European Union relations today have a good wind in their sails!

Friends,

I am heartily thankful to President Tusk and President Juncker for the productive discussions that we have had today on our wide-ranging agenda.

We have expanded the India-EU engagement into many new sectors and have agreed that we must continue our efforts to make it more comprehensive and beneficial, based on mutual trust and understanding.

Today, we have reviewed the progress in implementation of the decisions taken at our last Summit, and the Agenda 2020 announced last year.

We have agreed to strengthen our security cooperation and work together against terrorism. We will not only further strengthen our bilateral cooperation on this issue, but will also increase our cooperation and coordination in multilateral fora.


On Clean Energy and Climate Change, we are both committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Addressing climate change and promoting secure, affordable and sustainable supplies of energy are our shared priorities. We also reaffirmed our commitment to undertake mutual cooperation for reducing the cost of deployment of renewable energy.


We will strengthen our cooperation with European Union in developing Smart Cities and upgrading urban infrastructure.


I am pleased that the India-EU Horizontal Civil Aviation Agreement has now been operationalized. I am confident that this will enhance air connectivity between us and help to foster people-to-people contact.


An important aspect of our relationship is our cooperation in Science and Technology, and in Research and Innovation. In this context, I welcome the Agreement concluded today on mobility of young scientists and researchers.

The signing of loan agreements for development projects in India with the European Investment Bank is also a welcome step.


I also appreciate the decision of the European Investment Bank to fund solar-related projects in member countries of the International Solar Alliance.

We are also committed to working with the EU to further deepen our cooperation in strengthening our trade and investment flows.


Your Excellencies,



I thank you for your leadership and your contribution to the strengthening of the India EU strategic Partnership. It is my hope and expectation that your next visit to India would not be such a brief one!

 

Thank you.


Thank you very much.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed Company Secretaries at the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee Year of ICSI – the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.

 

On this occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated all those associated with ICSI. He said he is happy to be among those who are responsible for ensuring that companies follow the law, and maintain their accounts properly. He said their work helps establish the country's corporate culture. Their advice has a bearing on the country's corporate governance, he added.

 

The Prime Minister said that there are a few people in our country who attempt to weaken the honesty of our social structures, and lower the nation's dignity. He said that the Government is working towards cleansing the system of such elements.

 

The Prime Minister said that as a result of the efforts of the Government, the economy is functioning with less cash. The cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent, from 12 per cent before demonetization. The Prime Minister cautioned against people who only wish to spread a feeling of pessimism. The Prime Minister recounted instances in the past when the growth rate had fallen below 5.7 per cent, witnessed in the last quarter. He said that low growth rates, on those occasions, had been accompanied by higher Inflation, higher Current Account Deficit and higher Fiscal Deficit.

 

The Prime Minister said that there was a time when India was considered to be part of the Fragile Five economies, which were dragging back global recovery.

 

Acknowledging the decline in growth in the previous quarter, the Prime Minister said that the Government is committed to reversing this trend. He said several important reform related decisions have been taken and this process will continue. He asserted that the country's financial stability will be maintained. He assured the gathering that the steps taken by the Government will take the country to a new league of development in the years to come. He said that a premium would be placed on honesty, and the interests of the honest would be protected.

 

The Prime Minister outlined the massive increase in investment and outlays in some key sectors over the last three years. He said that 87 reforms have been carried out in 21 sectors in this period. He presented figures to show the quantum jump in investment.

 

The Prime Minister said that in the policy and planning of the Government, care is being taken to ensure that savings accrue to the poor and the middle class, even as their lives change for the better.

 

The Prime Minister asserted that as he works to empower the people and the nation, even though he faces criticism on some occasions, he cannot mortgage the country's future, for his own present.

My colleague in the council of Ministers, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Shri PP Chaudhary Ji,

President of Institute of Company Secretaries of India, Dr. Shyam Agrawal Ji and other dignitaries present on this occasion.

ICSI is celebrating its 50th anniversary today.  My heartfelt greetings to all those associated with the institution on this occasion.

It has been a privilege for me to be amongst the people who have been a part of this journey of the ICSI over the past 49 years and felicitate them. I am honored to be with the experts who ensure that every company in the country follows the law of the land, maintain complete transparency and do not fudge its .The onus is on you to see to it what should be the corporate culture of the country.

The motto of your institute is  Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara . It implies that one should speak he truth and follow rules and regulation. Your advice- right or wrong has an impact on the corporate Governance of the country..

Friends, on several occasions, it has been seen that the people do not tread the path which they ought to have done.  For example, both Yudhishtir and Duryodhan were taught by the same Guru, however their actions were altogether  different.

In Mahabharata, Duyordhan has been quoted as saying: Janami Dharmam Na Cha Mei Pravittih, Janami Adharmam Na Cha Mei Nivrittih. It means, ‘I know what is righteousness but I have no desire to follow that path, I also know what is wickedness but I have no desire to refrain from it.’

Your institution reminds such people of the values from this lesson of Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara.  Your institution plays an important role in institutionalizing the transparency and honesty in the country.

Brothers and sisters, Acharya Chanakya had said:

Eken Shushka Vrikshena

Dahya Manen Vanhi Na;

Dahyate Ta Vanam Sarvam Kuputren Kulam Yatha.

It means, ‘Even if a single dry tree in the forest catches fire, the entire forest is engulfed in the fire. In the same way, even if one member of the family does wrong, the reputation of the entire family is at stake’

Friends, this axiom applies in the context of the nation as well. A handful of people in our country have been engaged in harming its reputation, they have been trying to weaken our honest social fabric. The Government has launched a campaign to clean-up the system and the institutions from such elements once it assumed office.

Under this campaign immediately after the formation of the government, a Special Investigation Team – SIT, has been set up by the Cabinet in its first decision. It was suggested by the Supreme Court several years ago.

-Black Money Act was put in place to tackle the black money stashed abroad.

-Tax treaties with several new countries were signed and earlier tax agreements were amended. New ways were found in consultation with them.

- Insolvency and Bankruptcy Codes were enacted.

- Benami Property Law that had been lying in limbo for 28 years, was implemented.

- Good And Simple Tax- GST – that was stuck up  for several years was put in place.

- This is the government that has shown the courage to take the decision of Demonetization.

Brothers and sisters, This government has worked to strengthen the institutional probity in the country. As a result of relentless hard work by this government alone, we are having a less cash economy. 9th November, 2016 will be remembered as the opening day of corruption free movement in the history of India. The cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent after Demonetization. It used to be above 12 per cent before 8th November 2016. Was it possible if a new era of honesty had not been ushered in the country, in the economy of the country? Who knows it better than you about the easy exchange of black money earlier, and today people have to think at least 50 times before resorting to it.

Friends, There was another character, Shalya in the Mahabharata. Shalya was charioteer of Karna. On the other hand, Krishna was the Sarathi of Arjuna. This character, Shalya  always used to discourage those who were in the  battle field  and spread despair. He used to say, you don’t have the courage, your horses and chariot are weak and how would you fight. Shalya belonged to the Mahabharata era. But still we have some people having the same Shalya mentality. Such people take pleasure in spreading the despair. The slowdown in the GDP even in one quarter has become the biggest news item these days for such people. They are perpetually in a mode of pessimism saying how will you do it and what will happen next.

When the Doklam issue surfaced. They again tried to spread pessimism thinking, nothing can be done. Some people take pleasure is spreading pessimism. They get a good sleep out of it.  For them slowdown in GDP in one quarter is like a dose .There is a need to identify such people.    Friends, When the data suits their thinking, the institutions and processes appear correct to them. However, the moment, the same data is unsuitable for them, they immediately start questioning the institutions and its processes. It is very important to identify such people before arriving at a conclusion only then we shall tread the correct path of truth.

Friends, do you really feel that this is for the first time when the GDP growth of the country has reached to the level of 5.7% in a quarter? No it’s not. The GDP growth slipped to 5.7% or even lower 8 times during six years of the previous government. Nation’s economy has seen those quarters when the growth rate slipped down to 0.2 per cent, 1.5 per cent. That kind of slowdown was even more harmful for the economy since during those years India was also struggling with higher Inflation, higher Current Account Deficit and higher Fiscal Deficit.

If you look at the two preceding years before 2014 such as 2012-13 and 2013-14, the average growth rate was around 6%. Now some people may ask why I have picked up those two years only. Because, it won’t take much time for people with Shalya mentality to contest it. 

Friends, I have referred to those two years because the method to calculate the GDP growth has been during and those two years of the previous government and three years of this government. When Central Statistics Office, CSO released the figure of 7.4% GDP growth during the tenure of this government, some people dismissed it. It was their view that the GDP data did not match with their own understanding of the ground realities. These people said that they were not able to feel that economy was indeed growing at that rate. It means that it does not fit into their Shalya mentality.

Same Institutions were not of their liking , same processes were not of their liking at that time. But the moment, GDP growth rate came down to 5.7% , it lifted their spirit. They began telling, the institutions are correct. Same set of people used to state that they are not feeling it. Economy growing at a fast pace, was not acceptable to the.

So, these handful of people telling that there was something wrong with the new method of calculating the GDP. At that time these people were not talking on the basis of the data but they were talking on the basis of their gut-feelings and that is why they were not able to see the growth of the economy.

Brothers and sisters, But, as soon as the GDP growth slowed down to 6.1 and 5.7% in the two quarters the same data started appearing correct to those Shalya mentality economists.

Brothers and sisters, I’m not an economist and neither have I ever claimed so. However, today when so much of discussion is taking place about the economy, I would like to take you back in time. 

Brothers and sisters, there was a time when India was included in a group related to international economy called Fragile Five, unlike the groups today like, G-7, G-8 or G-20.

Fragile Five group was considered a dangerous group as not only their own economy was in shambles but they were also considered as a stumbling block in the recovery of global economy. India was named as a member of the same group. What it meant was that we can’t manage our economy rather become a problem for others and India was tagged along with Fragile Five group.

A person like me, who has little knowledge of economy is still unable to understand how such a thing happened despite the presence of those top economists at that time. You must be aware about thar around that time the issues hogging limelight were –the growth in the inflation rate rather than GDP growth, while growth in current account deficit and fiscal deficit were prominently in the news. Growth in the rate of  Dollar vis a vis Rupee used to be the headline in the newspapers while the growth of interest rate was animatedly debated . At that time, these parameters which reverse the growth trajectory of the nation were the favourite of a handful of people.

Now when the same parameters have shown marked improvements, development is in the right direction, a handful of people are still having a look at it with their colored vision. They can’t see the writing on the wall clearly and I want to bring this to your notice. I am also showing you the slides.

Rate of Inflation which was more than 10% has come down and this year the average is around 2.5%. Can you compare 10% with 2.5%. Current Account Deficit which was 4% has come down to nearly 1%. You can see it.

While improving upon the parameters, the Central Government has brought down the fiscal deficit from 4.5% under the previous regime to 3.5%.

Foreign investors have made record investments in India today. India’’s Foreign Exchange Reserve has gone up by 25% from around $30,000 crore to $40,000 crore.

The reforms in economy, the confidence, the success perhaps do not matter to a handful of people .Therefore it is for the nation to understand whether some people are striving for the interests of the country or just espousing the interests of others..

Friends, it is correct that despite attaining average growth rate of 7.5% over the past three years, GDP growth rate in April-June period this year saw a decline. We don’t deny it.  However, let me tell you that the Government is fully committed to reverse this trend, capable and we are ready to take decisions.

Many experts have agreed that the fundamentals of economy are strong .We have taken several decisions and the process is on. The financial stability of the country will be maintained. We would take every step to bring in more investments. and carry forward the momentum of growth.

I would like to assure that the steps taken by the Government would help India move into a new league in the years to come. According to Reserve Bank today, the estimates from the next quarter are expected to show a rise in the growth of economy which may reach eventually to 7.7%.   

Government is alert to reach out to and if needed to provide assistance to any sector following the structural reforms sector. It can be MSME or export sector or a part of our non-formal economy. I would like to reiterate from this forum that in the changing scenario, honesty will command a premium and the Government will protect the interest of honest persons.

I know that there is an element of apprehension among some of the traders who have joined the mainstream that whether their old records would be tracked seeing their new businesses. Let me assure you that any such thing is not going to happen. It might have happened with the earlier regime, since the rules at that time, their attitude and behavior was different. There can’t be a greater sin than stopping you from joining the mainstream. And hence, our Government is of the view that we welcome those who wish to join the mainstream. Please leave aside the old thinking. Don’t worry, we shall be there with you all the time. 

I would also like to tell about the GST. It has been three months since it has been implemented. We have seen closely what is working and what is not. We have sought feedback even on minor issues. The GST Council has been told to review all the bottlenecks and problems- related to technology, filling of forms among others and a solution be worked out involving all political parties and state Governments. I assure traders that we are not orthodox and conservative. We also don’t know everything. But if something needs to be done, we shall do it.    

We do not claim that we know everything. However, this is an effort to move in the right direction. Wherever there are obstacles, we shall try to overcome them based on our experience over the past three years and usher in reforms as and when required.

Friends, while discussing the state of economy with you, I would like to share the following details. I leave it to you to judge the implications of these details.

Friends, I have a firm belief that whenever you bought a new car, you won’t have purchased it under compulsion. You must have seen your household budget, the cost of educating your children, the expenditure over medical treatment of the elderly in the family. And then when you have the saving, you would have thought of buying a house or a car. This is the basic thinking of our society. In such a situation-

-What will be you take if the Sale of passenger cars in the country has grown by nearly 12% after June ?

- What would you say when you find that the sale of commercial vehicles too has registered a growth of more than 23% after June?

- What would you say when the sale of two wheelers in the country has registered a growth of over 14%?

-What will you say when the number of domestic air travelers has registered an increase of 14% over the past two months?

- What will you say when international air freight traffic has registered a growth of nearly 16%?

-What would you like to say when the number of telephone subscribers has registered a growth of over 14%?

-Brothers and sisters, these developments indicate that people are buying vehicles, new phone connections and using air travel. These indicators reflect the growth in demand in urban areas.

· Hence, if we look at indicators related to rural demand then the sale of tractors has registered a growth of over 34% in the recent months.

· Even in the FMCG sector, the trend of growth in demand is on the upside in the month of September.

-Friends, these things happen when the confidence among the people of the country grows up. When people of the country feel this thing: yes, the economy is strong.

- The recently released PMI Manufacturing Index reflects the expansive mode. And Future Output Index has crossed the figure of 60.

·-If we have a look at the recently released data, the production of coal, electricity, steel and natural gas has registered a robust growth.

·-Friends, even the disbursal of personal loan has registered rapid growth.

· The loans given by Housing Finance Companies and Non-Banking Finance Companies have registered significant growth.

-· Not only this, there is more investment in the mutual funds and insurance sector in the capital market.

· Companies have mobilized more than 25000 crore rupees in the first six months of this year through the IPOs. During the entire period of last year this figure was Rs. 29000 crore.

· In less than four months, more than 45,000 crore rupees have been invested in Non-Financial Entities through corporate bonds and private placement.

-This data reflects the broad base of financing in the country. It means that financing in India is no longer confined to bank loans alone.

-Friends, This government has continuously emphasized on the proper utilization of both time and resources.  One can see a clear difference in the pace of work during the three years of the previous government and this government.

· 80 thousand kilometers long rural roads were constructed during the last three years of the previous government. During the three years of our government, 1 lakh 20 thousand kilometers long rural roads have been constructed. It means a growth of 50% in the construction of rural roads.

-The previous Government during its last three years, had awarded the work to construct 15,000 kilometers long national highways. Our government has awarded the work to construct 34,000 kilometers long national highways in its three years.

·If you talk about the investment in this sector, then the previous government has spent Rs. 93,000 crore during the last three years of its tenure in land acquisition and on construction of the roads. This figure has gone up to Rs. 1.83 lakh crores in this government. It means this government has nearly doubled the investment.

Even you would be aware that how many administrative and financial steps are needed to be taken by the government for construction of highways. This data reflects that how the government has performed the role of a policy maker and policy implementer after bringing the country out of policy paralysis.

Similarly, if we talk about the railway sector:

· Nearly 1,100 kilometer long new rail lines were laid during the last three years of the previous government. In the three years of this government this figure has crossed 2100 kilometers mark. It means that we have laid the new railway lines almost twice as fast.

·During the last three years of the previous government, 1300 kilometer long railway tracks were converted in the double line. During the three years of this government, 2600 kilometer long railway track has been converted in the double line. It means that we have carried out the work of doubling of railway tracks twice as fast.

Friends, capital expenditure worth Rs. 1.49 lakh crore was made during the last three years of the previous government. During the three years of this government, this figure has gone up to Rs. 2.64 lakh crore. It means a growth of over 75%.

Now if I talk about the development of Renewable Energy sector, then:

·A total of 12,000 megawatt renewable energy capacity was added during the last three years of the previous government. If we talk about the three years of this government, then more than 22,000 megawatt renewable energy capacity has been connected to the grid power. It means that this government’s performance in this sector is nearly two times better.

·During the last three years of the previous government, it spent nearly Rs. 4,000 on the renewable energy. Our government has spent more than Rs. 10,600 crores in this sector in the three years.

·If we talk about the growth of shipping industry during the previous government, then the growth in cargo handling was negative during its tenure whereas during the three years of this government, it has registered an increase of 11%.

Friends, The government has been paying full attention for strengthening the social infrastructure of the country along with the strengthening of physical infrastructure related to important sectors like rail-road and electricity. We have taken major policy decisions and carried out financial reforms in the field of affordable housing which are unprecedented for the sector.

Friends, during the last three years of the previous government, it approved the projects worth Rs. 15,000 crores. While  this government has cleared projects worth Rs. 1.53 lakh crores during its first three years. This is a reflection of our commitment to provide houses to the poor people, to the middle class.

Brothers and sisters, More capital investment is required for this kind of developmental work that is taking place across the country. The government has stressed upon bringing more foreign investment in the country. 

-You might be aware that when the issue of reforms in the insurance sector was first discussed, the newspaper headlines used to say that if such a thing happens,  it would be a major economic decision. It was during the previous government. That government completed its term without bringing reforms in the insurance sector. We have brought in the reforms in the insurance sector. It happened during this government. However, this is the mentality of some Shalya mentality people that even this reform doesn’t seem big to them since it was not done during that time, and it could not be carried out by a government liked by them

-I would like to tell those people who have made this word – Reform - their theme song that we have carried out 87 small and big reforms in 21 sectors. Big changes have been brought about in the investment policies related to several sectors including construction sector, defence sector, financial services, food processing , or other sectors you name it. 

If you compare the total amount of foreign investment in India that has come after the liberalization and the foreign investment made during the last three years, you will realize the impact of economic reforms carried out by our government.

Brothers and sisters, you are from this field. However, the statistics which I am placing before you will leave you surprised. The liberalization time frame began after 1992. If I take it as the basis, let us compare what has been the impact from liberalization till 2014 and then from 2014 to 2017.

· 75% of the total foreign investment in the construction sector has come in the last three years alone.

· Even in the civil aviation sector, 69% of the total foreign investment has come in these last three years.

· 56% of the total foreign investment in the mining sector has come in the last three years alone.

· 53% of the total foreign investment in the computer software and hardware sector has come in the last three years alone.

· 52% of the total foreign investment in the electrical equipments has come in during the three years of this government.

· 49% of the total foreign investment in the renewable energy sector has come in during the three years of this government.

· 45% of the total foreign investment in the textile sector has come in the last three years alone.

· It may be surprising for you that the automobile industry which has already attracted plenty of foreign investment earlier, even in that sector 44% of the total foreign investment has come in during the last three years.

Growing FDI inflow in the country is proof of the fact that how much faith the foreign investors have in the country’s economy.

Our Policies, their implementation and our vision has raised the level of confidence..All this investment is playing an important role in increasing the rate of growth of the country’s development and job creation. Increase in road construction, expanding rail lines, doesn’t it need creation of jobs ? How did it happen? But Shalya mentality goes on.

Friends, this government realizes the value of every single penny earned by your hard work. That is why, the government’s policies and schemes are formulated in a manner that they help in not only making the lives of poor and middle class people easier,  but should also help them in saving the money.

Friends, This is the result of the government’s constant efforts that a LED bulb which was priced at Rs. 350 during the previous government, has now been brought down to Rs. 40-45 under the Ujala scheme by this government. Now you tell me,  whether it resulted in savings for a middle class or a poor person or not. I can’t understand why the cost of LED bulb at that time was Rs.350.?. This is a matter of research.

·So far more than 26 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country. If we consider an average reduction of Rs. 250 in the price of a bulb, even then the middle class of the country has saved nearly Rs. 6,500 crores on this account. These bulbs have reduced the electricity consumption in every household. It has resulted in the estimated savings worth Rs. 14,000 crores to the middle class families in just one year. Now you see the total savings on LED bulb purchase and electricity consumption becomes more than Rs.20,000 crores. This, in itself is empowering the middle class families.

·Due to the efforts made by the government, those local bodies are also reaping the financial benefits. They have been replacing their street lights with LED bulbs. As per an estimate, the municipality of a tier-two town has made on an average saving Rs. 10-15 crore. Now this money. is being spent for the development of the cities and spurring economic growth. .

- For the first time, the middle class has been given relief on the interest rates for construction of houses by this Government. You might recall, never before middle class was granted relief for construction of houses.

Government has always taken steps to ease the burden of the middle class, to provide the opportunities to the lower-middle class and for the empowerment of poor people, Steps are  being taken, policies are being formulated and implemented in a time bound manner. We have been pro active I this direction.

I am aware that sometimes I’ll have to face criticism for empowering the people and the country instead of handing out doles. However, I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present. Do we need to worry only about the power and the vote.? We have chosen the path which is difficult. However we are treading the right path keeping in mind the welfare of the  people. 

I have to often face criticism for this reason. Look, if you hand out doles, people will sing paeans for you.  I am being criticized. The vested interests feel aggrieved since my Government believes in transferring the money into the accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit transfer. It has ensured that ghost accounts are done away with. That is why such people won’t like PM Modi .

That is why our emphasis is on empowering the common man. I would like to tell my fellow citizens humbly that I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.

 Friends, This government has laid emphasis on the personal sector along with the private sector and public sector. Otherwise, the discourse was confined only to the private and the public sector. Personal Sector, which is connected to the personal aspirations of the people is equally important. That is why this government is extending every possible help to the youth who want to do something on their own, who want to fulfill their dreams.

· Loans of more than Rs. 3.75 lakh crore have been given to more than 9 crore account holders without any bank guarantee under the Mudra scheme.

· Out of these 9 crore people, 2.63 crores are the  youth who are the first time borrowers, it means that this is for the first time that they borrowed a loan under the Mudra scheme to start their business.

The government has been encouraging the self employment through the schemes like Skill India Mission, Stand-up India and Start-up India. Companies have been given financial incentives for bringing more and more people in the formal economy.

Brothers and sisters, If we take a look at some of the indicators related to formal sector employment, then:

-By the end of March 2014, there were 3.26 crore employees who have been actively contributing the provident fund money into the Employees Provident Fund Organization every month. In the last three years, this number has gone up to 4.80 crore. Some people forget this thing that this number cannot go up without growth in employment.

Friends, We have taken steps to ensure that the Government schemes bring in a qualitative change in the lives of poor people, lower middle class and middle class people.

Bank accounts of more than 30 crore poor people have been opened under the Jan-Dhan scheme. More than three crore women have been provided a gas connection free of cost under the Ujjwala scheme. Nearly 15 crore poor people have been brought under the coverage of government insurance schemes. The  Saubhagya Scheme has been launched a few days ago to provide free electricity connections to the poor people. These schemes have been empowering the poor people.

However, it is corruption and black money which have been a bane for the nation. Your institution and the company secretaries of the country have an important role in curbing the black money and corruption.

Registration of 2.1 lakh companies of the total 3 lakh shell companies, which were suspected of channelizing the black money following the note ban, have been cancelled.

I am hopeful that the level of awareness among the directors will be increased and companies will become more transparent following this cleansing operation against the shell companies.

Friends, This period is of immense changes, of transformative changes in the history of the nation.

The importance of a transparent and honest administration is now understood in the country. The recommendations made by the ICSI played a positive role in formulating the Corporate Governance Framework.

Now it is the need of the hour for you all to play an active role in producing a new business culture. Nearly 19 lakh new citizens have come under the scope of indirect taxes following the implementation of GST. Be it a small trader or a big trader, he should adopt the honest tax system inbuilt in the GST. It is also your duty to encourage the business community in this regard. Lakhs of students have been enrolled with your institution. Can your institution take this responsibility that it will train one lakh youth about small-small things related to GST? They can help small businesses and traders in their area linking them with GSTN, in filing returns after receiving a training of 7 to 10 days.. It will open up a new avenue of employment. If it is taken up in organized way, even one lakh would be small number.

Friends, nation celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022. We must have a dream to fulfill the aspirations and wishes of our freedom fighters and great leaders who spent their prime of life in jails, struggled for independence throughout their life and sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country. Every Indian citizen should have the dream like the one in 1942 during Quit India Movement, when people decided that they won’t stop till Britishers leave India. We should also move ahead with a dream for 2022, in75 th year of our independence.   

Friends, I want some promises from the ICSI for 2022 when the country will celebrate the 75th year of its independence. These promises will have your pledges and you should fulfill it- .

· Can you take the responsibility of making the country a high tax compliant society by 2022?

· Can you ensure that there will not be a single shell company in the country by 2022?

· Can you ensure that by 2022 every company in the country will honestly pay the taxes?

· Can you establish an honest business culture in the country by 2022 by expanding the scope of your help?

I hope that in the beginning of its golden jubilee year, the ICSI will embark on a journey to meet these goals with guidelines and will also include them in its work culture.

Once again, Congratulations to you all in this Golden Jubilee Year.

I would like to assure my fellow citizens that we do not take offence to the recent spate of criticisms of the Government on the economic front. The Government is sensitive towards the concerns of the people. We take even the harshest criticism in our stride. We would strive to carry forward the nation of 1.25 billion on the road to growth and development with humility,  and keeping in mind the interests of the people with the same rhythm and fast pace.  

I would also like to tell our critiques humbly that we do not subscribe to the view that all the critiques are wrong. However, we should desist from creating an atmosphere of pessimism in the country.

I showed you the glimpses of a parameter which reflects the strength of our economy. There are many other parameters which prove how strong is our economy and a clear reflection of the decision making powers of the Government. This is the proof of the direction and momentum of the Government. The economic strength is also reflected in the rising confidence about India both inside the country and abroad.

We should not ignore it. Let us march ahead for building a New India with a renewed vigour,  zeal, confidence and culture.

Congratulations to you all on the Golden Jubilee. Since you belong to this field, I thought of sharing my views on this issue with you and I am quite hopeful that through this platform, it will reach out to the fellow citizens.

Once again many- many greetings

Thank You.

                All the Swachchagrahi brothers and sisters present here,

 Today is 2nd October; it’s the birth anniversary of venerated Bapu, and also the birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri. How far we have come in the last three years? I still remember that I was in the United States to attend a meeting at United Nations and I came back very late in the night of the 1st October and in the morning of the 2nd October I came out to clean with a broom. However, at that time all the news papers, media and all our friends from allied parties, I mean all political parties, all of them criticised me so much saying: the 2nd October was a holiday and we had spoiled the holiday of kids. Whether the kids will go to school or not? Why kids were engaged in this work? Lot of such things happened.

And it’s my nature that I tolerate lot of things silently because my responsibility is such that I should tolerate and gradually I’m also improving my capacity for forbearance. However, today after three years; we kept working on this thing without wavering, without any reluctance and we persisted on this thing because I had full faith in the teachings of Bapu, because the path shown by Bapu can never be wrong.  

I still have the same belief, however, it doesn’t mean that there are no challenges. There are challenges but can we allow the country to remain like this just because there are challenges. Just because there are challenges, shall we only take up those things that will ensure regular praise for us? Shall we run away from this kind of work, shall we? And I feel that, today, those citizens who have been saying this thing in one voice. It’s not like that there was no dirtiness in front of our eyes. It’s not like that we too were not responsible for spreading the dirtiness in some way and it’s not like that we don’t like cleanliness either. There cannot be a human being who doesn’t like cleanliness.

If you go to a railway station and there are four benches but two of them are not clean then you don’t sit there, you sit on a good place. Why? Because our basic nature prefers cleanliness. However, the only gap that remains in our country is the lack of feeling that I myself should do this thing. There are no differences in the country over the issue that there should be cleanliness. The problem was always like that who should do it? And let me tell you one more thing and I have no hesitation in saying this thing, and it’s possible that tomorrow I may face even more criticism but why should we hide anything from our countrymen? Even if a thousand Mahatma Gandhis come, even if a lakh Narendra Modis come, all the chief ministers come forward, all the governments join hands even then the dream of cleanliness can never be realised, it can never be realised. However, if 1.25 billion Indians come forward then this dream can be realised in no time.

Unfortunately, we have made plenty of things the responsibility of the government, we take them as the government’s duty. As long as these are considered the responsibility of common man till then there will no problem. You see, Kumbh fair is being organised. Every day the people equal to the population of a small country of Europe gather on the banks of river Ganga. However, they manage all these things themselves, they do their own things and it is going on from centuries.

If we move forward by accepting the strength of the society, move forward by accepting the people’s participation, move forward by reducing the government’s role and increasing the society’s role; then this movement will continue to succeed despite questions being raised. I’m confident of this thing. And today I’m happy that there are some people those still make fun of it, those who criticise it and they are the ones who never came forward to participate in the cleanliness campaign. It’s their choice, they may have some reservations. And I’m confident that by the time of completion of five years the country’s media will not publish this thing that who were working, who have been participating in the cleaning programme. The photos of those people are going to be published who were running away from this campaign, who were against it. Their photos are about to be published because when the country accepts something then you may or may not like it but you are forced to associate yourself with the issue.

Today, this cleanliness campaign, it no longer belongs to venerated Bapu, it no longer belongs to Government of India or state governments or municipalities. Today, the cleanliness campaign has become this country’s common man’s own dream. And whatever success has been achieved so far, it’s not my slightest claim that that success belongs to the government. This success doesn’t belong to Government of India or to the state governments, this success belongs to those countrymen who crave for cleanliness.

We have got self rule, and the tool for this self rule was passive resistance. The tool for great India is cleanliness. If Satyagrahi was at the centre of self rule then Swachchagrahi (who insists on cleanliness) is at the centre of a great India. And we too know this thing that whenever we visit some country of the world and when we see the cleanliness of that place then after coming back we discuss this that how clean it was, I was so impressed by the cleanliness. And when people tell me these things then I ask them: You must have felt good after seeing the cleanliness of that country. Did you see anyone throwing the garbage? They reply that we didn’t see any such thing. Then I tell them precisely that is our problem.

And that is why we did not discuss the issue openly, I don’t know why were we afraid to discuss this thing. Politicians and governments did not discuss the issue as they were apprehensive in case it becomes their responsibility. Oh brother; if it becomes your responsibility then let it be so. What’s the problem? We are accountable people, our accountability is there.

And today what is the situation due to cleanliness? This ranking for the cleanliness that is taking place: which city is cleanest of all, which ones are the second and the third? And when their rankings are declared then it is being discussed in every city. A pressure is being created on the politicians, on the governments from the bottom that look that city got good marks in terms of cleanliness. What are you doing? Then civil society also comes in the picture saying: look, this was behind us, it has beaten us; let us do something. A kind of positive, competitive atmosphere is being created. And a positive result of that thing is also being reflected in this entire system.

It’s true that the toilets were constructed but they were not used. But when these kind of news come in then it’s not something bad. They wake us up, we should not get angry due to them. Yes, it would have been better if they mention this thing that: look, this is the responsibility of the society, of the family, of the individual that they stress upon using the toilets.

I’m always there, earlier I used to work with a social organisation, I joined politics very late. I was working in Gujarat, there was an accident involving Machu Dam in Morvi, thousands of people were killed, the entire city was submerged in the water so I was deployed for service, for cleaning the city. All the work related to cleaning the city were going on, they went on for nearly a month. Later, we people, some members of the civil society and also through the NGO it was decided that we will construct houses for those whose homes have been destroyed. So we adopted a village. We collected the money from the people and we wanted to rebuild the village; it was a small village, there might have been some 350-400 houses. When we were designing the layout then I insisted a lot on this thing that in any case there must be a toilet. Then the villagers used to say that: we don’t need toilet, we have a big open field here, please don’t construct the toilet, instead just increase the size of the room little bit. But I told them that I would not compromise on this thing. We will construct a room as per the funds available with us but the toilets will be constructed in any case. So, in any case they were going to get it free of cost therefore they did not argue much and it was constructed.

And when I again visited that area nearly after 10-12 years then I felt the need to meet old associates as I had worked in that area for several months, so I went to see them. And after visiting that place, I regretted a lot as goats were kept in all those toilets constructed by us. So this is the tendency of the society. It’s not the fault of that person who constructed it, neither it is a fault of the government if it insists on this thing. The society has its own nature. We are required to bring about the changes while understanding these limitations.

Can anyone tell me that whether all the schools in India have been constructed as per the requirement or not? Whether teachers have been employed as per the requirement or not? Whether all the facilities, books etc. have been provided to the schools as per the requirement are not? They are there in large quantities. However, given the status of facilities the status of education is low. So the government after making all these efforts, after spending the money and constructing the buildings, after appointing the teachers; and if it gets the cooperation of the society then it won’t take much time to achieve 100% literacy. The same infrastructure, the same number of teachers can achieve 100% literacy but it is not possible without the cooperation of society.

If the government thinks that the task will be accomplished if we construct the buildings, if we pay salary to teachers. Yes, we can take satisfaction that earlier it was this much and we have done that much. But if there is people’s participation, if a kid takes admission in a school then it stops attending the class. And now even parents don’t ask him to go to school. The issue of toilet is also similar to this. So cleanliness as a responsibility, the more we create this kind of atmosphere then everyone will also think 50 times before doing something wrong.

And you see, our kids, small children, the households that have sons, grandsons and granddaughters. In a way they are the biggest ambassador of my cleanliness mission. These kids, if grandfather throws something somewhere then these kids ask them to remove it, they tell them not to throw those things there. This kind of atmosphere should be created in every household. If kids accept something then why can’t we do the same?

How many kids have been dying just because of not cleaning their hands, because of not being able to clean their hands with soap before having their meal? But as soon as you mention this topic, people will say: how can we buy soap; how can we get water; Modi will only deliver lecture; how the people will wash their hands? Oh brother, if you can’t wash your hands then leave it, but those who can wash their hands, at least, let them do that.

Look, there may be thousand reasons to criticise Modi. Everyday, I give you some or some other reason, you should utilise that. But we should not make fun of such things or do politics over the need to bring about the change in the society. We should follow a collective responsibility and you will see that things will change.

 You see, these kids have done a great job. I had been posting the pictures of these kids on social media on daily basis, I used to post them with a lot of pride. I, personally, don’t not know these kids. But when I saw the picture of that kid who has shown enthusiasm for cleanliness, I used to post them and they used to reach to millions and millions of people. It’s okay brother! Why is he doing that? This essay competition, whether the cleanliness can be ensured through essay competitions? An immediate response would be that it can’t ensure cleanliness. Cleanliness can be ensured through drawing competition? No.

 Ideological movement is also necessary for cleanliness. Development does not take place by mere development of the system unless an ideological movement is also being launched. So this effort to produce films, the efforts to bring creativity, essay writing; all these things are an attempt to provide an ideological basis to cleanliness. And when something finds a place in our minds in the form of an idea, finds a place as an essence then it becomes very easy to follow that thing. So this is the reason behind associating these activities with this campaign. And I would like; you see, there was a time when I felt a lot of pain; and it’s not the fault of those who were doing those things therefore I don’t blame them. However, it’s a commercial world, everyone has a tendency to push those things where there is a possibility of making some money and everyone will be interest in making some money.

If you watch the television programmes that were produced four-five years ago in which if some kids were shown performing the job of cleaning in a school then it used to become a news story; teachers were criticised for making the kids to do the cleaning job in the schools. And it used to provide the opportunities to parents; they used to rush to the school asking: ‘Will you educate our kids or will you make them to do the job of cleaning?’ Today, this has brought about such a big change that if kids are doing the cleaning of a school then it becomes the headline of TV news. It’s not a small thing.

And I think what would have happened if the media had not made this entire movement its own agenda? It’s three years since then and the print and electronic media of this country has completely associated itself with the cleanliness programme; and at times they are two steps ahead of us.

And I have seen that these kids, the films about these kids have been given regular slots by some TV channels. This is the issue: how to involve all the people? The more they get involved, and you see that now we got that opportunity for the progress of our country, we must take our country to that destination by 2022. We don’t have to remain silent like this. And if want to do this thing then it’s a big thing.

Any person, if our house is not clean and some guest visits us; even if they come for some marriage proposal but if things are scattered here and there then he will think that everything else is fine, the boy is also well educated but the house is in such a poor shape; so why should we marry our daughter in this family? And he will go back. If someone comes from outside and visits India, sees Agra, Taj Mahal, what a wonderful places, but if he looks around the monuments then he will be puzzled. So how can we tolerate such a situation?

Who is at fault? My point is not this. And it is possible if all of us work together; this thing has been demonstrated by my countrymen in the last three years; it’s been demonstrated by the civil society and by the media. And if there is so much support and even then if we are not able to build momentum in these things then one day all of us will have to hold ourselves accountable.

I want that all of us should stress upon these things, we should take them forward. With the help of data, we just explained our progress to you people, but even now, despite building the momentum this is something which must be done on regular basis only then it will succeed.

 There are temples in the villages but not everyone goes to the temple. It’s human nature, some don’t go to temples. Despite a temple being there in the villages, some people don’t go. Same is true about mosques and gurudwaras. People may attend one or two functions there. So this is the tendency of the society, the life goes on and such people move on in their own world. We have to involve them, we have to make efforts. And when we make efforts then things will happen.

 As per the data, it appears that the speed is fine, direction is fine too. A campaign to construct toilets in the schools was launched. And when our daughters go to school then they are mindful of these things. They ask questions, they check the facilities and after that they take admission. Earlier it was not like this, it was like that: we will manage. Why should we manage? Why should our daughters tolerate these things?

 And you can never realise the power of cleanliness unless you look it from the point of view of a woman. You think about that mother in whose house everyone has a right to throw waste material and other things here and there. That mother does it all alone, when all other go out for work or go to school, she keeps cleaning the house for two hours, she keeps doing this back-breaking work for hours, two hours. You should ask that mother: how do you feel when we put our things in order before going out? That mother would certainly say that it was back-breaking work, it’s good that you put your things in order so I’m able to finish the work in 10 minutes. You please tell me, be it a mother of middle class, higher-middle class or lower middle class or be it a poor mother whose half a day was spent in cleaning; if all the members of the family keep their things at right place, they may or may not help that mother in cleaning the house but if they just keep their things in order then what a big relief it will be for that mother? Whether we could not have done this thing earlier?

And that is why I have only one yardstick about cleanliness in my mind. You can imagine this thing. I want to ask the men. You urinate on any intersection. Please forgive me for using this kind of language. You must have seen the situation of those mothers and sisters who sometimes go out to market to buy something. They too will have to face nature’s calls. But they don’t relieve them in the open, they suppress these things till the time they get back home. What are these values? And if these values are there in her daughter, in her sister in her family then how it is that men don’t have them? Because, as a man we believe that we have all these liberties. And unless these changes take place we cannot understand the cleanliness in real terms.

You see that those mothers and sisters living in the villages, even the mothers and sisters living in slums in cities, they wake up early and go out, go into woods to relieve themselves. Since there are risks then they go out in a group of 5-7 people and if they feel the nature’s call after the day break then they wait till the evening; you just imagine what kind of suppression of the body it is. What will happen to the health of that mother who needs to defecate at 9-10 in the morning but she is not able to go out due to daylight, who continues to wait till 7 in the evening thinking she would go out to relieve her in the dark. You tell me, what would be the situation of that mother? If you have this kind of sensitivity then you don’t have to watch TV channels, don’t have to listen to a TV anchor, you will not need a Prime Minister or a state government to understand cleanliness; this in itself will become a part of your responsibility.

 And that is why I’d like to call upon the countrymen. Unicef has released a report recently, it has conducted a survey of nearly 10,000 those households who have constructed toilets, they compared the present situation with the earlier one. And it is their estimate that on an average it entails the expenditure of 50 thousand rupees per annum over treatment of diseases per family due to lack of toilet or lack of awareness about cleanliness. If the head of the family falls ill then all other things just stop. And if the ailment is severe then two members of the family are required to look after him. He needs to borrow money at a high interest from a money lender for the treatment. So in way, a burden of nearly Rs. 50 thousand falls on a poor family.

But if we adopt cleanliness as our religion, if we accept cleanliness as our own responsibility then we can save the burden of Rs. 50,000 on a family and also lessen the burden of those difficulties that fall on the family due to that disease. We may or may not put money into his pocket but these fifty thousand rupees are of great help to him in his life. So these surveys, this information that is given to us, all of us should follow that as a social responsibility.

A lot of people meet me after becoming the Prime Minister. Political workers, retired officers and also some of those who work in the social sector meet me. They are very polite and very affectionate. At the time of leaving, they politely hand over their bio data and ask me to get back to them if I need their assistance for anything. They say: ‘I’m always there for anything.’ They are so polite that I also ask them politely to spare some time for cleanliness. And they don’t come back again.

You please tell me, they had come to me seeking some work, they came with nice bio-data but after considering all these things if I just asked them to do this thing then they don’t come back again. See, no work is small or big, no work is lowly. If we lend our support then it will become big so we should give it that respect.

I’d like to heartily congratulate all those who have worked hard in these 15 days to once again provide momentum to this thing. However, all these things, and I still say that it’s just a beginning, a lot still needs to be done. Those kids who have participated in this thing with enthusiasm, those school teachers who encouraged them – some would have produced films, some would have written essays, some of them dedicated themselves in the cleaning, some schools even went out, spent up to half an hour in the morning to create atmosphere in different parts of villages.

 I’m surprised; some people; statues of great souls; we, all the politicians, all the political parties fight so much for installation of the statues of great souls. However, after the installation no one is willing to take the responsibility of cleaning that statue. Everyone feels that he or she follows those leaders and their statues should be installed. However, the people from the same community, their own followers are not interested in cleaning the statues; and then it is open for any bird to sit on top of it and do whatever it feels like.

These, these are the evils of our social life. And that is why it is responsibility of all of us. It is not my point of view that someone is good or bad. We all have to think this thing. And if all of us will reflect then results will be certainly there. And that is why I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen, to all the Satyagrahis and Swachchagrahis. We should once again dedicate ourselves to the nation on the occasion of the birth anniversaries of venerated Bapu and Lal Bahadur Shastri; we should give priority to cleanliness; and cleanliness is something that can be done by anybody who may not be capable of, who cannot do anything else for the service of the country. This is such a simple thing. As Gandhi Ji had said during the freedom movement: ‘If you can’t do anything else then you just spin the wheel, this is your contribution towards freedom.’

I feel that every Indian can do such a small thing to make a Great India (Shreshtha Bharat) that I will spare 5, 10, 15 minutes, half an hour, I will do something. And you will see that there will be a natural change in the country and one thing is very clear that in the world we will have to look at India through the eyes of the world. We must do that and in any case we will accomplish that.

 

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed an event to mark Swachh Bharat Diwas: the 3rd anniversary of the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission, and the conclusion of “Swachhata hi Seva” fortnight.

 He said 2nd October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri; and is an occasion to reflect on how far we have travelled towards our goal of Swachh Bharat.

 He recalled how the  Swachh Bharat Movement had been initiated three years ago, amid immense criticism. He said he is convinced that the path that Mahatma Gandhi has shown, cannot be wrong. He said that even if there are challenges, that does not mean one must shy away from them.

 The Prime Minister said that today people are expressing their desire for cleanliness in one voice. He asserted that Swachhata cannot be achieved through the efforts of leaders and governments, but can only be achieved through the efforts of the society. Jan Bhagidari has to be appreciated, the Prime Minister said, adding that today, Swachhata Abhiyan has become a social movement. He said that whatever has been achieved till date, is also the achievement of the Swachhagrahi people of India.

If Swaraj was achieved by the Satyagrahis, Shrestha Bharat would be achieved by the Swachhagrahis, the Prime Minister said.

 Mentioning the Swachhata rankings of cities, the Prime Minister said they have engendered a positive, competitive atmosphere. Swachhata needs a revolution of ideas as well; and competition gives a platform of ideas to the concept of Swachhata, he said.

 The Prime Minister congratulated all those who contributed during the “Swachhata hi Seva” fortnight; but added that a lot more needs to be done.

 The Prime Minister gave away awards to winners of national essay, painting and film competitions, and also visited a digital display gallery.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for revision of pay scales for about 8 lakh teachers and other equivalent academic staff in higher educational institutions under the purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and in Centrally Funded Technical Institutions, following implementation of the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission for Central Government employees. 

The decision will benefit 7.58 lakh teachers and equivalent academic staff in the 106 Universities / Colleges which are funded by the UGC/MHRD and also 329 Universities which are funded by State Governments and 12,912 Govt. and private aided colleges affiliated to State Public Universities. 

In addition, the revised pay package will cover teachers of 119 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions viz. IITs, IISc, IIMs, IISERs, IIITs, NITIE. etc. 

The approved pay scales would be applicable from 1.1.2016. The annual Central financial liability on account of this measure would be about Rs. 9,800 crore. 

The implementation of this pay revision will enhance the teachers' pay in the range of Rs. 10,400 and Rs. 49,800 as against the extant entry pay due to the implementation of the 6th Central Pay Commission for the pay of teachers. This revision would register an entry pay growth in the range of 22% to 28 %. 

For the State Govt. funded institutions, the revised pay scales will require adoption by the respective State Governments. The Central Government will bear the additional burden of the States on account of revision of pay scales. The measures proposed in the revised pay structure are expected to improve quality of higher education and also attract and retain talent.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between India and Japan on establishing a liquid, flexible and global LNG Market.

The MoC will promote bilateral relationship between India and Japan in the energy sector. It will contribute to the diversification of gas supplies for India. This will strengthen our energy security and lead to more competitive prices for consumers.

The MoC provides a framework to cooperate in facilitating flexibility in LNG contracts, abolition of Destination Restriction Clause and also explore possibilities of cooperation in establishing reliable LNG spot price indices reflecting true LNG demand and supply.

Background:

India and Japan are major consumers of energy in the world. In the LNG sector, Japan is the world's largest importer and India is the 4th largest importer. Under the Japan-India Energy Partnership Initiative signed in January 2016, the two sides had agreed to work together in promoting well-functioning energy markets and affirmed to promote a transparent and diversified Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market through the relaxation of Destination Restriction Clause.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the renaming of Kandla Port as Deendayal Port.

 Ports in India are generally named after the city or town in which these are situated.  However, the Government, in special cases, after due consideration, have renamed the Ports after great leaders in the past.

By renaming Kandla Port as ""Deendayal Port, Kandla"", a grateful nation would be remembering the invaluable contributions made by one of the greatest sons of India, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay. This will inspire the People of Gujarat, particularly the Youth, who may not be fully aware of the contributions made by the great leader.

 

Background:

 

There have been public demands from various quarters in Gujarat, especially from Kachhh district, to rename 'Kandla Port' as 'Deendayal Port, Kandla'. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (25.9.1916 - 1.2.1968) was a prominent leader, who pledged his life to the service of the nation. He devoted his entire life serving the nation and worked among the masses and dedicated and sacrificed his life for the upliftment of the Poor & Working Class at the same time. Upholding the values of democracy founded on tolerance, discipline, selflessness and respect for the law of the land, all his actions were based on the principles of ‘Integral Humanism’. Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly for Indianisation of democracy, honouring the public opinion, selflessness and respect for law of the land.  Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay dedicated his entire life for public service and was the epitome of simplicity, honesty and selfless service for the poor and down-trodden.

 Since the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay was to be celebrated on 25th September, 2017, it was felt that it would be most appropriate if the decision to rename the Kandla Port as Deendayal Port was made as a part of the birth anniversary celebration of this great national leader.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved two new World Bank supported schemes of Rs. 6,655 crore - Skills Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) and Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement (STRIVE). SANKALP is Rs 4,455 crore Centrally sponsored scheme including Rs. 3,300 crore loan support from World Bank whereas STRIVE is a Rs. 2,200 crore - central sector scheme, with half of the scheme outlay as World bank loan assistance. SANKALP and STRIVE are outcome focused schemes marking shift in government's implementation strategy in vocational education and training from inputs to results. 

There has been a long felt need for a national architecture for promoting convergence, ensuring effective governance and regulation of skill training and catalysing industry efforts in vocational training space. The two schemes shall address this need by setting up national bodies for accreditation & certification which shall regulate accreditation and certification in both long and short term Vocational Education and Training (VET). The architecture shall help, for the first time in the history of vocational education in India, to converge the efforts of various central, state and private sector institutions thereby avoiding duplication of activities and bringing about uniformity in vocational training thus, creating better impact. 

Both the schemes are aimed at institutional reforms and improving quality & market relevance of skill development training programs in long and short term VET. In past many government schemes such as Vocational Training Improvement Project (VTIP) have focussed on strengthening ITIs and over 1600 ITIs have already been modernized under the schemes. STRIVE scheme shall incentivize ITIs to improve overall performance including apprenticeship by involving SMEs, business association and industry clusters. The schemes aim to develop a robust mechanism for delivering quality skill development training by strengthening institutions such as State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), ITIs and National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) etc. The schemes shall support universalization of National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) including National Quality Assurance Framework (NQAF) across the skill development schemes of central and state governments thus ensuring standardization in skill delivery, content and training output. 

The schemes shall provide the required impetus to the National Skill Development Mission, 2015 and its various sub missions. The schemes are aligned to flagship Government of India programs such as Make in India and Swachhta Abhiyan and aim at developing globally competitive workforce for domestic and overseas requirements. To this end, over 700 industry led institutions are being set up for providing job oriented skill training to lakhs of aspirants. An innovative challenge fund model has been employed to select and support proposals to set up such institutions in identified sectors and geographies. 66+ India International stalling institutions are being promoted to focus upon skill training as per global standards for overseas placements. Over 30,000 aspirants shall be trained in IISCs and get certificates from International Awarding Bodies (lABs). Upgrading 500 ITIs, as model ITIs across India and improving their industry connect, is also envisaged by ushering in reforms such as on-line examination, centralised admission, improving efficiency and transparency in the system. 

National Policy of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 highlighted the need of quality assurance measures such as building a pool quality trainers and assessors. SANKALP envisages setting up of Trainers and Assessors academies with self-sustainable models. Over 50 such academies are to be set up in priority sectors. DOT, MSDE has already made significant progress in this direction by setting up a number of Institutes for Training of Trainers (IToT) in public and private sector, offering training in over 35 trades. The schemes shall leverage such institutions for training the trainers in both long & short term VET thereby bringing about convergence. Additional trainer academies shall be set up on the basis of identified sectoral and geographical gaps. 

Greater decentralization in skill planning will be ensured by institutional strengthening at the State level which includes setting up of State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) and allowing states to come up with District and State level Skill Development Plans (DSDP/SSDP) and design skill training interventions to suit the local needs. SANKALP aims at enhancement of inclusion of marginalized communities including women. Scheduled Castes (SCs), Schedule Tribes (STs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWD) to provide skill training opportunities to the underprivileged and marginalised section of the society. 

The schemes will develop a skilling ecosystem that will support the country's rise in the Ease of Doing Business index by steady supply of skilled workforce to the industry. The schemes will also work towards increasing the aspirational value of skill development programs by increasing the marketability of skills, through better industry connect and quality assurance.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the All India Institute of Ayurveda, in New Delhi, to the Nation. The first ever All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) is set up along the lines of AIIMS. As an apex institute under the Ministry of AYUSH, the AIIA will bring synergy between the traditional wisdom of Ayurveda and modern diagnostic tools and technology. Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent Charge) Shri Shripad Naik was also present on this occasion.

Speaking on this occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the gathering on the celebration of Dhanvantari Jayanti as Ayurveda Divas. He complimented the Ministry of AYUSH for the establishment of the All India Institute of Ayurveda.

The Prime Minister asserted that nations cannot progress unless they value and cherish their history and heritage. Those nations who leave their heritage behind, are destined to lose their identity, he added. The Prime Minister said that when India was not independent, its knowledge, and its traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda were belittled. The Prime Minister said that the Government is working towards establishing an Ayurveda hospital in every district of the country. He said that more than 65 AYUSH hospitals have been developed in the last three years.

In his welcome address, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik announced that the Government, with the active participation of the private sector will endeavour for a three-fold increase in Ayurveda facilities in next five years. The Minister said, “India will celebrate her 75th Independence Day in 2022, on this occasion we are endeavouring for a three-fold increase in Ayurveda facilities in next five years.”

Shri Naik further added that massive investment is needed to achieve this target. So, the government is also encouraging the private sector to invest in the field of Ayurveda. He appealed to practitioners, students and followers of Ayurveda, to take benefit of programs like Skill India, Digital India, Swastha Bharat-Swaccha Bharat and Start-up India, to fulfill the dream of ‘Ayushman Bharat’.

The minister informed the gathering about the steps taken by his ministry to promote Ayurveda and other alternative systems of medicine. He said that in the past two years people’s interest and faith in Ayurveda has increased manifolds. The number of Ayurveda hospitals is increasing even in the private sector. The Ministry has published an ‘Ayurveda standard guideline’ to standardize medicines and treatments in this ancient therapy system. The Pharmacopeia Commission of Indian medicine is working for the standardization of medicines.

Shri Naik said that to popularize the Indian systems of medicine the world over, the Ministry has opened Ayush Information Cells in 29 countries. Ayurveda chairs have also been established in a number of countries. The Ministry has signed an MOU with the National Health Organization of USA for development of Ayurveda and Yoga.

On this occasion, The Prime Minister released the “Ayurvedic Standard Treatment Guidelines”. These guidelines were developed by the Ministry of AYUSH. The Prime Minister also gave away the Yoga Award to the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, Pune, which was announced earlier this year on the occasion of International Day of Yoga.

The All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) has been set up with a total campus area of 10.015 acres with a budget of Rs.157 Crore. It has an NABH Accredited Hospital and an Academic Block. Out Patient Services are being provided in the hospital block of the AIIA and medicines are given free of cost. Currently clinical specialties running in the hospital block are Neurological & Degenerative Disease Care Unit, Rheumatology & Musculoskeletal Care Unit, Diabetes & Metabolic/Allergic Disorders Care Unit, Yoga, Panchakarma Clinic, Kriya Kalpa, Diabetic Retinopathy Clinic, Kshara Evum Anushastra Karma and Infertility Clinic. It also has pathology, biochemistry, microbiology and radiology laboratories/diagnosis facilities. The indoor patient department has provision for 200 beds.

The Ministry of AYUSH has requested All State Governments, State AYUSH Directorates, all Ayurveda colleges/ teaching institutions, AYUSH/Health Universities, Associations of Ayurveda Practitioners, Ayurveda Drug Industries and all supporters/ well-wishers and stakeholders of Ayurveda in India and abroad, to observe Ayurveda Day on 17th October, 2017 year and undertake various activities such as organizing public lectures / seminars / exhibitions / radio talks etc., as a part of the Ayurveda Day celebrations.

                Speaking at the valedictory session today, the Minister of Road Transport, Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari said that Yoga has a huge potential for generating employment opportunities. He said that to capture these opportunities we have to give professional training to practitioners of yoga. He insisted that a systematic yoga education syllabus should be prepared and scientific research should be developed in a professional manner.

Addressing the valedictory session, the Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent Charge), Shri Shripad Yesso Naik expressed his happiness over the overwhelming response from the people across the globe to participate in the Conference. He said that the level of participation has forced us to think to organise a bigger event than this in the coming years.

Shri Shripad Naik explained that the Western countries are showing much interest towards Yoga and in USA alone, nearly 20 million people are practicing Yoga. This number is increasing average by 5% every year he added. The Minister also informed that the USA military training has adopted Yoga in its training curriculum and many other countries like UK, European countries, and south eastern countries are increasingly practising Yoga.

The AYUSH Minister also said that our Government is committed to the development of AYUSH systems especially Yoga not only in the country but outside as well. He further said that several modern medical institutes have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjuvant treatment for many of the disorders. Shri Naik said that in India also, the system of Yoga is gradually gaining popularity as a best mode of alternative therapy to the modern medical system. Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey said that both modern medicine and yoga understand the need for total health and even the World Health Organization has recently added a new dimension to the modern understanding of health by including spiritual health in its definition of the “state of health’. Shri Choubey said that Spiritual health is an important element of yoga and now that even the WHO has come around to understanding this point of view, there is hope for a true unification of these two systems. Secretary (AYUSH), Shri C.K. Mishra, Special Secretary, Shri Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Managing Director of Patnjali Acharya Balakrishna, founder vice chancellor of S-VYASA shri H.R. Nagendra and, renowned Yoga Guru from Austria Swami Maheshwarananda were also present in the inaugural function.

The two day conference consisted of seven technical sessions and a panel discussion on different aspects of Yoga and Wellness including recent research trends, Integrated medicine, non communicable diseases, mental health, women health, cancer, pain management and policy making. The purpose of the conference was to provides a common platform for the AYUSH and Allopathy Practitioners, Researchers, Academicians, Policy Makers and students and enable them to capture and understand various dimensions of the yoga for wellness.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that India’s Space Mission to Moon, “Chandrayaan-II”, will take place in 2018, most likely in the first quarter of the year. 

Addressing the inaugural session of the 5-day Asian Conference on Remote Sensing here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said that India has today emerged as the world's frontline nation in the field of Space Technology. This, he said, is in itself a glorious vindication of the dream seen by the founding fathers of India’s Space Programme, like Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan. 

Giving credit to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for giving fresh impetus to Space Research, Dr Jitendra Singh said, it was during the last three years that India could launch a South Asian Satellite which would be also providing inputs and benefits to the neighbouring countries. In addition, he said, the biggest achievement in the last over three years is that the Prime Minister personally intervened to arrange a brainstorming of Space Scientists with each of the different Ministries and Departments in Government of India to promote the application of Space Technology in infrastructure and development works. In this context, he referred to widespread application of Space Technology in carrying out the Urban Development programmes, including Smart City programmes, the use of Space Technology for geo-tagging of MGNREGA and the assistance from ISRO for the manning of Railway crossings. 

Chairman ISRO, Shri Kiran Kumar, who was the Guest of Honour on the occasion, spoke about the various achievements of India’s Space capability in the field of Disaster Management. Veteran Space Scientist and President of the Indian Association of Remote Sensing, Dr Shailesh Nayak also spoke on the occasion. At the event, awards were presented to outstanding Space scientists under different categories. The 5-day conference is being attended by over 500 eminent foreign delegates and some of the world’s most distinguished faculty in the field of Space Science.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said here that India has vindicated the Nuclear Peace Mission of the founding father of India’s Nuclear Energy Programme, Dr Homi J. Bhabha.

Delivering the inaugural address at the 9th Nuclear Energy Conclave yesterday at national capital, Dr Jitendra Singh said, after 60 years, we are now in a position to claim to the whole world, how India’s Nuclear Programme has emerged as a major resource pool for the growing energy needs of the country for its economic growth and development. He said, even though at present almost 60% of power generation in India is from coal and other sources, but in the years to come, green sources of energy, including the nuclear energy will be playing a major contribution.

Congratulating the organizers of the conference for having included in their programme this year focused sessions on application of nuclear energy for medical irradiation in patients and other such situations, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the enormous non-electricity applications of nuclear energy are either not known or they are now put into use. In this context, he cited his personal experience of having promoted the application of nuclear energy in the last one year or so in diverse fields including irradiation of agricultural and food products and non-destructive cleaning of the monumental structures.

Describing Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi as a man with a natural temper for science, Dr Jitendra Singh said, it was a huge advantage in the last three years to have someone like him at the helm, because this enabled us to give a special impetus to expansion of our Nuclear Energy Programme in the country. For example, he said, it is during his regime that an out-of-box decision was taken to enter into joint ventures with other PSUs for setting up new nuclear installations, which would help the Department of Atomic Energy to overcome the constraints of finances. It was also during these three years that the Atomic Energy programme which was confined mostly to southern States of India was brought to the northern States as well and in this endeavor, an atomic plant is already in the process of being set up in Gorakhpur, Haryana near Delhi, he added.

Not only this, Dr Jitendra Singh said, India is today a frontline nation of the world in its nuclear energy capability which is going to multiply three-times in the years to come. This, he said, is also the most befitting example of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” mission.

Eminent nuclear scientists, Dr Anil Kakodkar, Dr S.K. Sharma and others, also spoke in the inaugural session.

ORDER

 

            At the time of General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1998, a new initiative for State funding of recognized political parties through free use of the State owned Television and Radio was introduced under directions of the Commission vide its Order, dated 16th January, 1998.

                India produces 163.7 million tonne milk in 2016-17 worth over Rs.4 lakh crore: Shri Radha Mohan Singh 

Rs.67 crore allocated to Bihar under Rashtriya Gokul Mission: Shri Singh 

Shri Radha Mohan Singh addresses Pashu Arogya Mela in Motihari

 

Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that India is emerging as a leader among the milk-producing nations and added that in 2016-17, 163.7 million tonne milk was produced in the country, which is worth over Rs.4 lakh crore. Shri Singh said it today at the Pashu Arogya Mela in Semwapur, Motihari.

Agriculture Minister said that in 2015-16 total milk production in Bihar was 8.29 million metric tonne, which was 5.33% of the whole country. Bihar has 6.67% of the country's total cattle population. Therefore, there is a need to increase milk production and productivity in the state. Shri Singh said that Comfed/Sudha are playing important roles in collection, processing, and marketing of milk in Bihar. Shri Singh said dairy farming has been a traditional source of livelihood and it has a deep connection with the agricultural economy. At present, there are 19 crore cattle in the country, which amounts to 14% of the total cattle population of the world. Out of them,15.1 crores are Indigenous cattle, which is 80 % of the total cattle population. The country's dairy cooperatives provide an average of 75 to 80 percent of its sales to the farmers. In Bihar, Comfed/Sudha are providing an appropriate value of the milk to the farmers through cooperative agencies. In comparison to 15 million men, 75 million women are engaged in this field.

The Minister said that India has 30 crore bovines, which is 18% of the total bovine population of the world. The country’s indigenous bovine is the result of traditional and scientific knowledge and hardwork of hundred years. Today, we have 40 breeds of cattle along with Yak and Mithun and 13 breeds of buffaloes.

Shri Singh said that indigenous animals are more suitable for the country, particularly suitable for climate and environment of their reproductive areas. Mainly so, Indigenous breeds are least affected due to climate change.

Shri Singh said, Bachaur is the indigenous cattle breed of Bihar. There is 6.73 lakh Bachaur cattle breed in the region, out of which 2.99 lakh are reproductive animals. He said that there is a huge possibility of increasing productivity of Indigenous breeds in the country through commercial farm management and balanced nutrition. For the first time, the government has initiated Rashtriya Gokul Mission with an objective to conserve and propagate indigenous breeds in an organized and scientific manner. Till now Rs.1,077 crore has been sanctioned for the proposals received from 27 states under the scheme. And so far, Rs.499.08 crore has been released under this scheme.

Shri Singh said, Rs.67 crore has been allocated to Bihar under Rashtriya Gokul Mission.  And so far, Rs.22.5 crore has been sanctioned for the implementation of this scheme. This scheme will help in increasing milk production and milk productivity in the region.  Under this programme, 1250 MAITRI centres are being set up to facilitate artificial insemination for cattle on the doorstep. This will also give a new direction to the conservation of the indigenous breeds.  Along with other components, setting up of Gokul Gram is also included under Rashtriya Gokul Mission. One Gokul Gram will have 500 animals with high genetic quality, out of which 300 will be reproductive animals. The Gokul Grams will rear Lal Sindhi, Sahiwal and Gir breeds along with Bachaur.

Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, in his inaugural address gave the projections of agriculture production and productivity of the country to meet the demand of the nation. Shri Shekhawat pointed out the role of research and development for combating the challenges faced the farmers in past like Bengal famine etc. Shri Shekhawat praised the performance of agriculture, fisheries, horticulture and other sectors for record production during current year but still there is a scope for further improvement to meet the ultimate demand of the nation. He pointed out that India is importing about 68% of cooking oil and thus there is the challenge for farmers and scientists to decrease the import of cooking oil and make the availability of the cooking oil sufficient to feed the nation. In his address Shri Shekhawat said that olive oil consumption has increased five times from last ten years and there is large probability for enhancing its acceptability due to high value index. Thus it becomes challenge for scientists to produce the quality planting material and work on different research aspects of olive for making it a success story for lost of the states in the nation. India has a vast potential for olive cultivation which need to be tapered by the joint efforts of scientists and farmers. At the end he praised the efforts made by the scientists of ICAR-CITH, Srinagar for the olive cultivation under Kashmir conditions a success story.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that in order to provide strategic development to the horticulture sector, so as to increase farmers income, a pioneer project called CHAMAN, has been launched three years back by the Government. This project is being implemented by Mahalanob is National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) using remote sensing technology and is likely to be completed in March 2018. This was told by the Shri Singh in New Delhi today during a presentation on CHAMAN.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Horticulture sector is one of the major drivers of growth in Agriculture sector. This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers thereby augmenting their income. It also provides higher employment opportunities in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Thus it has gained significant prominence in the recent years. It is a matter of pride that India is the Second largest producer of Vegetables and Fruits in the world and is First in the production of Banana, Mango, Lime and Lemon, Papaya and Okra.

Shri Singh informed that CHAMAN is a pioneer project in which remote sensing technique is being used for strategic development of horticulture sector as also to increase the farmers’ income. It gives methodology for preparing reliable estimates of horticulture crops. Union Agriculture Minister said that this methodology will help the farmers to generate better income.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the income of farmers will increase by growing selected crops in the high suitable areas identified under CHAMAN in the current Jhum /waste lands. Besides this, the Post-Harvest damages of farmers would be significantly reduced by creation of desired Post Harvest Infrastructures like cold storages etc. thereby increasing their income. In addition the Geo-Spatial Studies like crop intensification, orchard rejuvenation and aqua-horticulture would further help the farmers’ to grow their horticultural crops in a profitable manner which will help doubling their income.

Union Agriculture Minister informed that it is proposed to hand over the interim reports of North Eastern States Site Suitability Studies to the respective State Governments by January 2018 for immediate consideration. The waste land/ jhum land areas identified for one crop in one district each of North Eastern States, under site suitability studies would be utilised by the State Governments to take up the projects of development of these areas on priority. On completion of this Project, the Geo-Spatial Studies would be conducted in all major states of the country.

Shri Singh told that on completion of this project, the methodology developed for seven important horticulture crops would be made operational in all the States. The remote sensing technology would be extended to other horticulture crops in future.

Shri Radha Mohan Singh also told that apart from these, various flagship programmes of the Ministry such as PMFBY, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Soil Health Card, Rashtriya KrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) etc. are using remote sensing, GIS and GPS tools for their effective implementation.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that government is giving preference to women under various policies such as organic farming, self-employment scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, etc. The Minister added that women can propel the country towards second Green Revolution and they can change the landscape of the development if they get opportunities and facilities. Shri Singh said this today during Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Diwas celebration at New Delhi.

Smt. Krishna Raj, Central Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Smt. Archana Chitnis, Minister of Women and Child Development, Madhya Pradesh Government, Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra, DG ICAR were also present at the event. Shri Singh informed that last year the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Ministry had decided to observe October 15 every year as Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Diwas.

Shri Singh said that the decision was inspired by the celebration of October 15 as International Women's Day by the United Nations Organization. And today, all the Agricultural Universities, Institutes, and KVKs are celebrating Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Diwas.

Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister said that under the current scenario, women's contribution to the prevention of climate change and management of natural resources cannot be denied. They play multi-dimensional roles in agriculture. They are contributing in every field of agriculture - from sowing to planting, drainage, irrigation, fertilizer, plant protection, harvesting, weeding, and storage. Apart from this, they are active in other activities like cattle management, fodder collection, milk and allied activities related to agriculture such as beekeeping, mushroom production, suction farming, goat rearing, poultry, etc.

Shri Singh said that within the agricultural sector, the wage workers working on the basis of socio-economic status and regional factors, working in their own land, and also in the management of various aspects of agricultural production, women play important roles through labour supervision and participation in post-harvest operations.

The Minister informed that according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, women's contribution to Indian agriculture is about 32 percent, while in some states (such as Hills, Northeast, and Kerala) contribution of women to agriculture and rural economy is more than men. Women are involved in 48 percent agriculture-related employment whereas 7.5 crore women are playing a significant role in milk production and livestock management.

Shri Singh said to strengthen women’s participating in agriculture and allied activities and to improve their access to land, loans and other facilities, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has policy provisions like joint leasing for both domestic and agricultural land under National Policy for Farmers. Under Agriculture policies, provisions of issuing Kisan Credit Card to women and creating livelihood opportunities through livestock practices agricultural processing are mentioned. Therefore, the aim of the Ministry is to increase agricultural production and productivity and make policies for the welfare of the farmers. Shri Singh added that the aim is to ensure that women contribute effectively in agricultural production and productivity and get better livelihood opportunities. Therefore, proper structural, functional and institutional measures are being promoted to empower women, to build their abilities and to increase their access to input technology and other agricultural resources and various initiatives have been taken in this regard.

Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister informed that keeping in view the key role of women in agriculture, in the year 1996, the Ministry established ICAR-Central Institute for Women in Agriculture in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha. This institute works on various aspects related to women in agriculture.Apart from this, more than 100 institutes of Indian Council of Agricultural Research have developed techniques to reduce the hardships of women and empower them. There are 680 agricultural science centers in the country.Each Krishi Vigyan Kendra has a home science wing. In the year 2016-17, 21 techniques related to women were evaluated and 2.56 lakh women were trained in agriculture-related fields like sewing, manufacturing, value addition, rural handicraft, animal husbandry, beekeeping, poultry, fisheries, etc.

Shri Singh further said that apart from this, at least 30% of the funds are being earmarked for women under various schemes/programs and development related activities. To ensure various beneficiary-oriented programs/schemes reach them, the emphasis is on the formation of women self-help groups (SHGs) to connect them with micro-credit through activities like capacity building and giving them access to information and to encourage their participation in planning and decision-making process. The Ministry is also making pro-women and women supporting measures.

                Embryo transfer technology (ETT) has revolutionized the breeding strategies in Bovines as a tool to optimize the genetic improvement in cattle.

Department of Animal husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries in co-operation with 12 States has undertaken a Mass Embryo Transfer programme in Indigenous Breeds under the scheme, National Mission on Bovine Productivity. It has been planned to carry out 440 embryo transfers during October 2-10, 2017 throughout the country. The programme is implemented with the objective of conservation and development of indigenous breeds under Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

Through the use of ETT, (i) a farmer can get a 5-6 fold increase in number of offsprings , (ii) the calves so born will be of high genetic merit and (iii) the offsprings born will be free from diseases.

The programme has been initiated in 12 ETT centres across the country from 2nd October and will continue till 10th October 2017. Under this programme, embryos of higher genetic merit indigenous bovines are being transferred in to surrogate cows. Embryos of Indigenous breeds such as Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi, Ongole, Deoni and Vechur have been proposed to be transferred under this programme. On first day of ET programme held on 2nd October, 35 Nos. of embryos were transferred in to recipients. Remaining will be transferred on different days till 10th of October 2017.

The technology now being taken up to the doorstep of the farmers will result in rapid propogation of high genetic merit indigenous cattle.

                1.         The Government has been examining the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO) with a view to enhancing the accessibility and affordability of essential medicines at reasonable prices to the poor and needy while providing sufficient opportunity for innovation and competition to support the growth of the Pharmaceutical Industry. The Government has been actively interacting with the Industry and other stakeholders on these issues. Any impression regarding tightening of price control is both misleading and misplaced.



2.         Under the provisions of DPCO, the prices of only those medicines  are fixed which are in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), numbering about 850 against more than 6,000 medicines available in the market of various strengths and dosages.  This constitutes approximately 17% of the total pharmaceuticals market, in value terms.  There is an Expert Committee which continuously evaluates the list of Essential Medicines.

3.         Important issues under consideration of the Department are i) treating the drugs which have become non-scheduled as non-scheduled drugs without any freezing of their prices for a further year; ii)  revision of the list of scheduled medicines on the basis of revision of NLEM by incorporating only additions and deletions to the list so that the prices of only ‘’new medicines” which are added to the NLEM will be fixed by NPPA; iii) limiting the determination of overcharged amount of a medicine found to be sold at higher than the ceiling price to the stock available with the defaulter; iv) In case of negative WPI, mandating the NPPA to change the ceiling price of scheduled drugs and not require the individual drugs to also reduce their MRPs if they are already lower than such revised ceiling price; etc.  Other issues include new provisions for using Institutional price data for fixation of prices of those scheduled medicines which are being supplied directly to the Healthcare Institutions.

4.         Any changes in the methodology of calculating ceiling prices of scheduled medicines are presently  not under consideration.

5.         As regards “new drugs” as defined in DPCO 2013, the Government is considering a change in the method of approving their prices. The Government is in consultation with the Industry to explore doing away with the present practice of deciding a new price for each applicant of “new drug”, which is causing considerable time delay in launch of the new drugs in the market by the manufacturers. 

6.         The Department has constantly interacted with stakeholders and would further consult all concerned before finalising these proposals.

Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananth Kumar today announced that Government will make revised quality standards for Caustic Soda mandatory for both domestic manufacturers as well as for imports. This step has been taken to give a boost to the domestic industry, under Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Make in India’. 

The revised quality standards, compliant with Bureau of India Standards (BIS) specifications, would necessitate the industry to produce caustic soda using the modern and more energy efficient membrane based technology. Mandating compliance to revised BIS specifications will allow superior grade caustic soda to be produced and imported in the country which would be beneficial to human health and environment. Disclosing this in a meeting with Alkali Manufacturers’ Association of India, the Minister assured the industry of Government of India’s continued support for growth of the Alkali Industry in India, on lines which are congenial to health and environment. 

Before adoption of latest energy efficient membrane cell technology, Caustic soda was produced using an outdated mercury based technology which led to ingress of mercury in the final product which could be harmful to health and environment.

The Jaipur and Srinagar Airport got First and Second rank respectively in the category of 2-5 million passengers in ACI-ASQ Survey. Dr. Guruprasad Mohapatra, Chairman, Airports Authority of India along with his team received the ACI-ASQ Award at a function held in Mauritius on 17th October 2017. The Chairman congratulated both APDs for their stupendous achievement and challenged more AAI airports to compete and win at ACI-ASQ Awards in their respective categories in future.

This is for the second consecutive time that Jaipur Airport has been rated the Best Airport in the World in the traffic volume of 2 to 5 million passengers per year. Jaipur was ranked as the Best Airport in the World catering to a traffic volume of 2 to 5 million passengers per year in 2016 also. 

The Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards are the aviation industry's most prestigious accolades. The awards recognize the airports which have achieved the highest passenger satisfaction ratings in the ASQ Survey - the world's benchmark measure of airport excellence. It is the only worldwide programme to survey passengers at the airports on their day of travel. Every year, the programme delivers some 600,000 individual surveys in 41 languages in 84 countries. It measures passengers’ views on 34 key performance indicators, including airport access, check-in, security screening, restrooms, stores and restaurants. Each airport uses the exact same survey, creating an industry database that allows airports to compare themselves to other airports around the world. The ASQ programme also has a feature that facilitates sharing of best practices among airport operators.

The World Bank, today released the Doing Business (DB) Report, 2018. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) is pleased to announce that India ranks 100 among 190 countries assessed by the Doing Business Team. India has leapt 30 ranks over its rank of 130 in the Doing Business Report 2017.

 

The DB Report is an assessment of 190 economies and covers 10 indicators which span the lifecycle of a business. The table below provides a comparison of this year’s and last year’s report. India has improved its rank in 6 out of 10 indicators and has moved closer to international best practices (Distance to Frontier score). The credit for this significant improvement is credited to the mantra of “Reform, Perform, Transform” given by the Prime Minister, wherein a strong leadership has provided the political will to carry out comprehensive and complex reforms, supported by a bureaucracy committed to perform. The Government has undertaken an extensive exercise of stakeholder consultations, identification of user needs, government process re-engineering to match Government rules and procedures with user expectations and streamlined them to create a more conducive business environment. An extensive exercise is also undertaken to increase awareness among users about reforms to ensure extensive use of newly created systems.

This edition of the report acknowledges India as a top improver, with an improvement of 30 ranks compared to last year’s report, the highest jump in rank of any country in the DB Report, 2018. India is the only country in South Asia and BRICS economies to feature among most improved economies of the DB Report this year.

                 The Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhu took a review of the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) related initiatives taken by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, for strengthening the IPR regime in the country.

The Government of India has been working relentlessly to streamline IP processes and modernization of IP offices through steps such as comprehensive e-filing facilities made available for patents and trademarks, auto-allotment of patent applications to ensure uniformity and utilization of the specialized expertise of all examiners and controllers and by auto generation of trademark certificates. Examination of Patent applications has increased over three times in the last six months compared to the same period last year. 

To reduce the pendency, 458 Patent and 59 Trademark examiners have been appointed in addition to the existing manpower. Pendency in Patent examination is targeted to be brought down from the present 7 years to 18 months by 2019. The pendency of Trademark applications at the examination stage has been reduced drastically – the time taken for examination has been brought down from 13 months to less than one month.

Innovation is widely recognized as a central driver of economic growth and development. In this context, DIPP has also signed an institutional agreement with the Punjab State Council of Science and Technology to establish India’s first Technology and Innovation Support Center (TISC) at Patent Information Centre, Punjab, under the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) TISC program. Another TISC is being established at Anna University, Chennai. 

Talking about the importance of IPR and innovation the Commerce and Industry Minister said, “India is now at the forefront of innovation and developing new ideas. In such scenario, protection of IPRs becomes extremely important.” On this occasion, Secretary DIPP Shri Ramesh Abhishek provided the details of how recent initiatives by the Government of India are transforming the IP landscape in India. 

The Government has been spreading awareness about IPRs in schools and efforts are on to include IPRs in school curriculum. The awareness drive is also being carried forward in universities and industries as well. 

The Government has been engaging with people on social media platforms as well. The #LetsTalkIP campaign has gained momentum and this initiative aims to bring about a radical change with respect to awareness on Geographical Indications (GIs) and India’s rich cultural heritage. A logo design and slogan contest for GIs of India has also been launched on the MyGov.in website. 

On this occasion, the Minister also launched the official website of the Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), which is a professional body created under the aegis of DIPP to ensure focused action on issues related to IPRs and smooth implementation of the objectives of the National IPR Policy adopted in May 2016.  The website can be accessed at www.cipam.gov.in.  It will provide regular updates on the latest IP trends – statistics on applications filed, examined, grants and disposal for various IPRs. It would provide information on the various initiatives being taken by the Government to strengthen the IPR regime in the country.

 The Cell for IPR Promotions & Management (CIPAM) under the aegis of the Department of Industrial Policy Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has launched a logo and tagline/slogan contest for Geographical Indications (GIs) of India on MyGov.in website.

 A Geographical Indication (GI) is primarily an agricultural, natural or a manufactured product (handicrafts and industrial goods) originating from a definite geographical territory. Typically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness, which is essentially attributable to the place of its origin. Some of the examples of registered Indian GIs are Darjeeling Tea, Tirupathi Laddu, Kangra Paintings, Nagpur Orange, Kashmir Pashmina etc.

 GIs are not only part of our rich culture and collective intellectual heritage, but they also supplement the incomes of our rural farmers, weavers, artisans and craftsmen across the country. The promotion of GIs is in line with the Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ campaign and therefore, it is our responsibility to preserve and protect them.

 Taking forward its ongoing social media campaign #LetsTalkIP to promote Indian GIs, DIPP aims to launch a certifying GI mark/logo that can be used to identify all registered GIs irrespective of the categories, and a suitable tagline/slogan for promotion of GIs. This will also help in engaging more people on the subject of GIs and making them aware about the benefits of a GI tag.

  DIPP has taken several initiatives for promoting awareness and outreach on GIs. One of the ways to promote GIs could be to present them as gifts. In this context, CIPAM has also launched “Gift a GI” campaign to enhance the visibility and thus help in branding and promotion of registered GI products. DIPP is also working with State governments to spread awareness on GIs.

This contest is an opportunity for creators who aspire to see their creation recognized on a national platform. The last date for receiving entries is 17th November, 2017. The winning entry will receive a cash award of Rs. 50,000/- each, for logo design and slogan for GIs of India.


 The details of the logo competition for ‘Design a Logo and Suggest a Tagline Competition’ can be obtained from MyGov.in online platform.

  The complete list of all registered GIs in India can be viewed here. http://www.ipindia.nic.in/registered-gls.htm

                Footwear Design & Development Institute (FDDI) has been declared an ‘Institute of National Importance’ under Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India. The FDDI bill was passed by the Parliament in July 2017. The Provisions of FDDI Act 2017 have come into force from today, according to the Notification published in The Gazette of India on October 5, 2017.

The Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Shri C.R. Chaudhary said here today, that the commitment of the Government to resolve the degree issue has culminated in the grant of the status of ‘Institute of National Importance’ to FDDI. With this, the government has also ensured upgradation of FDDI to a position of eminence so as to enable the Institute to effectively serve the Sector/Industry.

To empower the youth of the nation and to help them march alongside the Prime Minister’s Skill Development mission and Make in India initiative, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India proposed the FDDI INI bill to Parliament. FDDI, after becoming an INI, now has the autonomy to design its courses as per the requirement of the industry, and award its own degree to the students. FDDI can now independently develop and conduct courses leading to graduate and post graduate degrees, doctoral and post-doctoral courses and research in the areas of footwear and leather products design and development and allied fields.

Presently FDDI is imparting skill based graduate and post graduate courses in the fields of footwear, leather goods, retail and management to around 2,500 students across eight campuses spread over India. With the enhancement of the status of FDDI as an Institute of National Importance by the virtue of the FDDI Act, 2017, the institute will now be able to enroll around 2,500 more students in the upcoming admission session, across its 12 campuses, out of which four new campuses will become functional with the next academic session.

FDDI is a premier Institute, serving as a ‘One stop solutions provider’ in footwear, leather and allied industry. Since its inception in 1986, FDDI has been playing a pivotal role in facilitating Indian industry by bridging skill gaps in the areas of footwear, leather, fashion, retail and management. FDDI has been functioning as an interface between the untapped talent and industry and its global counterparts, by fulfilling the demand of skilled man power with its specific curriculum, state of the art laboratories, world class infrastructure and experienced faculty.

The Commerce and Industry Minister, Shri Suresh Prabhu attended an Informal WTO Ministerial Gathering in Marrakesh, Morocco from October 9 to 10. The meeting was held in preparation for the Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11) of the WTO scheduled to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 10 to 13 December 2017. Ministers and delegates of 35 WTO member countries exchanged views on what could be realistically achieved and the possibilities for compromise. The objective of the informal gathering was to provide political impetus to the negotiations and guidance on potential outcomes.

Shri Prabhu, led discussions on behalf of the developing world and reiterated commitment to the Doha Round. He referred to the agreed objectives of the agriculture negotiations in the Doha Round and called for continuation of the reform process and to avoid further widening and perpetuation of the imbalance between developed and developing countries. He pointed out that any meaningful reform in agriculture must first seek to reduce the disproportionately large subsidies of the developed countries.

In his statements at the meeting, the Commerce & Industry Minister spoke about India’s priorities and position as regards various issues under discussion in the WTO for outcomes at MC11. He emphasized that a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes must be a part of the outcomes achieved, as this is an issue of tremendous importance not only to India but also several other developing countries. Shri Prabhupointed out that a solution on this issue would give a strong signal of determination to end hunger and achieve food security, as mandated in the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2.

Emphasizing on the importance of special and differential treatment for developing countries, the Commerce & Industry Minister said India would be willing to engage on proposals that recognized this right for all developing countries without exception. He pointed out that in India, the total number of people dependent on agriculture in one way or another is close to 600 million, with nearly 98 per cent of Indian farmers being low income or resource poor and mostly engaged in subsistence farming. Under such circumstances, it was imperative for India to balance trade liberalization with the need to protect the livelihood of its farmers, he said.

 Shri Prabhucalled upon WTO members to first deal with the issues which were already under negotiation, before moving on to new ones.

On the issue of discipline on fisheries subsidies the Commerce & Industry Ministeralsostressed on the importance of suitable special and differential treatment provisions and the need to make a clear distinction between large scale commercial fishing and traditional fishing. He pointed out that in India a large number of small, largely resource poor fish workers depended on traditional fishing activity as a source of livelihood. He observed that developing countries like India, possessing very low fishing capacity, would also need to retain policy space to promote and create such capacity. 

Shri Prabhu also spoke about the importance of a transparent and inclusive process of negotiationsat the WTO and the need to do all preparatory work before MC11, so that only issues, which have matured for conclusion, are taken forward to the Ministerial Conference. India’s stance was very well received from all quarters making the visit a big success.

On the sidelines of the meeting, the Commerce & Industry Minister also held marathon bilateral meetings to push India’s trade in a comprehensive manner. He met Ministers from the EU, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Rwanda, Morocco, as well as the Director General of the WTO.

             - Introduces new OTP based option for consumer ease with two other convenient options 

             - Industry welcomes the move and pledges support to the government 

 In a bid to expedite compliance of telecom service providers with the Hon. Supreme Court's order dated 6th February regarding linking of Aadhaar card with mobile number and reverification process of mobile users, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a comprehensive instruction on Wednesday.

 As per the new rules, the DoT has introduced three new methods to link the registered mobile number with Aadhaar i.e. OTP (One Time Password) based, App based and the IVRS facility. These new methods will help subscribers to get their mobile number linked to Aadhaar without visiting the stores of the telcos. For the ease of senior citizens and the people with disability and chronic illness, DoT has also recommended for the re-verification at subscribers’ doorstep. According to the new guidelines, the telecom operators should provide an online mechanism for people to request such service and based on availability schedule the visit and complete the process.

 Speaking on the development, Shri Manoj Sinha, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Communications, said “The Aadhaar number system was designed to allow all residents of the country access to critical government services and important information that they may need from time to time. Mobile penetration is increasing rapidly in the country and the subscribers need to be provided with the ease of linking of the Aadhaar number with the mobile number. It is the government’s endeavour to improve convenience and reduce time and energy spent by consumers to accessing government information and services that is their right to access.”

 Representative of COAI stated, “The latest clarifications from the DoT are aligned with what the industry, and the subscribers need at this time. While, it will take a little time to implement the directions, we are working closely with the government to improve and enhance the convenience of our consumers for undertaking Aadhaar based e-KYC linking of their mobile number. We are implementing all the necessary processes so as to be able to use the additional methods prescribed including OTP, App based and the IVRS facility. We expect it to get much faster and easier for individual mobile subscribers to comply with the e-KYC norms using their Aadhaar Registered Mobile Number (ARMN).” 

In a circular in August, DoT had given instructions to the telecom service providers to provide iris or fingerprint based authentication of Aadhaar. The new regulations have specified that the telecom service providers must deploy iris readers for this purpose within a reasonable geographical area.  

Further, in keeping with privacy rules, the DoT has mandated that telecom service providers’ agent should not have access to the subscribers’ e-KYC data and only the name and address of the subscribers should be visible. Subscribers can verify or re-verify their mobile numbers from anywhere in the country irrespective of which service area their mobile connection belongs to.

                Soldiers and officers of various army and para-military units like CRPF, BSF, BRO, ITBP, etc. are deployed in remote and far flung areas to protect Borders of India. The soldiers and officers are working day and night without bothering about difficult weather conditions and as they are posted away from their homes and headquarters, there is a constant requirement for them to speak to their family and also to their Headquarters. They use only DSPT service provided by BSNL because there is no other means of communications available in those areas.

Briefing the media here, the Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that in order to use the facility of DSPT, the soldiers & officers at present are required to pay monthly fee of Rs.500/- and call charges of Rs.5/- per minute. But, looking at the requirement of Soldiers & Officers and also the heavy cost they have to incur for talking to their family members, government has taken an important decision on the auspicious occasion of Diwali. Shri Sinha said, from Diwali day (19th October, 2017), no monthly fee will be taken for using DSPT service, that is, the current monthly fee of Rs.500/- will be ‘Zero’ from tomorrow. And also, the present telephone charges of Rs.5/- per minute is being reduced to Re.1/- per minute.

With this special Diwali Gift from Government of India, Defence personnel can now talk without worrying for more expenses to their home and their Headquarter. The Minister also wished the jawans and officers and their family members A Very Happy Diwali.

                The Minister for Communications Shri Manoj Sinha today launched the Sampoorna Bima Gram (SBG) Yojana and an initiative for expansion of clientele base of Postal Life Insurance.  Talking to media after launching the schemes here, the Minister said that the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to provide banking services through the postal network needs to be taken forward to provide affordable life insurance services to people living in rural areas of the country. He said that all villages under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana will be brought under its ambit.

The Minister said, under Sampoorna Bima Gram (SBG) Yojana, at least one village (having a minimum of 100 households) will be identified in each of the revenue districts of the country, wherein endeavour will be made to cover all households of that identified village with a minimum of one RPLI (Rural Postal Life Insurance) policy each.  Coverage of all households in the identified Sampoorna Bima Gram village is the primary objective of this scheme.

Shri Sinha said, under the scheme expansion of clientele base of PLI, it has now been decided that benefits of PLI will no more be confined to Government and semi-Government employees, but will also be available to professionals such as Doctors, Engineers, Management Consultants, Charted Accountants, Architects, Lawyers, Bankers etc. and to employees of listed companies of NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange).  The decision has been taken to enlarge the cover of social security and bring maximum number of people under the protection of Postal Life Insurance (PLI). He said that the postal policies have low premium and high bonus, unlike the Private ones.

The Minister added that the Government is committed to the cause of complete wellbeing of citizens of this country.  Expansion of clientele base of Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and ensuring coverage of Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) to all households of Sampoorna Bima Gram villages in each district of the country is a step in that direction. These two major initiatives being undertaken by Department of Posts will serve as an instrument of securing lives of people as well as enhancing financial inclusion.

Postal Life Insurance (PLI), introduced in 1884, is one of the oldest life insurance schemes for benefit of Government and semi-Government employees.  Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI), introduced on March 24, 1995 on recommendations of Malhotra Committee, provides insurance cover to people residing in rural areas, especially weaker sections and women living in rural areas. Low Premium and High Bonus is the unique feature of PLI and RPLI schemes.  As on March 31, 2017, there were 46.8 lakh PLI and 146.8 lakh RPLI policies across the country.  

The insurance industry in India has undergone transformational changes after liberalisation of the insurance sector in the year 2000, subsequent to setting up of the insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).  In such a competitive scenario, it is felt that there is an urgent need for Postal Life Insurance (PLI) / Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) to redefine itself.

                The First International Consumer Protection Conference on “Empowering consumers in new markets” for the South, South East and East Asian Countries was held on 26 to 27 October 2017 in New Delhi. His Excellency Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India inaugurated the Conference which was attended by 1600 participants that included delegates from 19 countries, Senior dignitaries from the Central Government, State Governments from India, Presidents of the Consumer Commissions,  as well as private sector, consumer associations and academia. Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, Secretary-General of UNCTAD addressed the conference in the Inaugural session.

 

The Prime Minister during his inaugural speech stated that Consumer Protection is one of the priority areas for the Government. Government’s vision is a step further from Consumer Protection to Consumer Empowerment and to Protection of Consumer Interests.

 

 The Conference was chaired by Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. The deliberations and exchange of experiences led to the following conclusions:

 

The comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection is a priority for Governments and stakeholders in ensuring more effective and better-coordinated protection efforts in all countries and across all areas of commerce.

 

Wide stakeholder participation and engagement of consumer associations, businesses, and the academia is necessary for a successful consumer policy-making and enforcement.

 

The protection of consumers’ rights in the digital context is important for a sustainable and inclusive development of e-commerce, which also needs to address cross-border cooperation and enforcement.

 

Consumer protection is essential for well-functioning financial markets, and efforts should be devoted to achieve financial consumer literacy and inclusion.

 

Consumer education is paramount to maximize consumer empowerment, needing new and innovative ways to reach and enhance consumers’ knowledge of their rights and obligations in the marketplace.

 

The needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers must be attended to, in all sectors of commerce and across all areas of consumer protection including legislation, enforcement action and redress systems in accordance with their particular needs and interests.

 

            On the suggestions of the Prime Minister it was felt that due to increasing globalisation and the world changing into a single market, it is important to learn from each other’s experiences and reach a common understanding. The possibility of building a Regional Coalition for consumer protection needs to be explored.

 

Creating a structured mechanism for communication, mutual sharing of best practices, creating new initiatives for capacity building and starting joint campaigns in this regard should be pursued in mutual interest.

 

Keeping in view the future challenges a roadmap with a clear vision for moving forward and institutionalizing regional cooperation may be explored.

 

Towards meeting these objectives, it was decided that Regional Consumer Protection Conferences on biannual basis will be considered, in consultations with countries in the Region regarding the structure and organisational details.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the two days International Conference on Consumer Protection for East, South, South East and Asian Nations on the theme “Empowering Consumers in New Markets” in New Delhi, today.  The Prime Minister in his inaugural speech congratulated the Department of Consumer Affairs for holding this important event and mentioned that East, South and South East Asian countries have a shared heritage. These nations have long history of trade. This in itself paves way for mutual cooperation in the area of consumer protection. Shri Modi said that it is the consumer that helps markets grow and trade expand. The Prime Minister thanked the delegates from countries and UNCTAD for associating with India in holding this conference. He drew attention of the gathering to the traditions and laws of ancient India as old as 2500 years and Vedic period, when laws existed for preventing unfair trade practices, abuses and adulteration of products.

Shri Modi said, in India, Consumer is considered as God in trade premises. ‘Grahak Devo Bhava’ is the dictum for consumer satisfaction. While mentioning the unique nature of CP Act 1986, He mentioned the new Consumer Protection Bill which is on the top priority of the Government. The Prime minister mentioned several important efforts taken by his government across various sectors like Housing, Energy, Standards, Healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and procedures that has resulted in financial benefits to consumers.

He drew attention to demonetization and the GST regime that introduced a new business culture which will ultimately bring down prices for consumers. Redressal system that is efficient is the corner stone of democracy, he asserted.

While talking about various sectoral initiatives he mentioned the, importance of good governance, Jandhan Yojna, Make in India programme, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and provision of free LPG to the poorer sections of society, technology driven  PDS system and Aadhar based transparency system, etc that have protected consumer interests and how specific consumers are benefitted and their hard earned money saved. On the digital front he said efforts are on to ensure that at least one member in a rural family gets digitally educated so that the rural population can derive benefits from various government schemes and are able to use UPI, BHIM etc. Finally, while concluding his speech the Prime Minister mentioned the need for trans-national cooperation especially in Asian region on cross border issues based on mutual trust.

Shri Ram Vilas Pawan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution,  welcomed the delegates from East, South and South East Asian Nations for being in New Delhi to attend this first ever Asian Conference on consumer protection.

Shri Paswan explained various initiatives taken by the Govt in furthering consumer protection. He made specific reference to the New Consumer Protection Bill which is likely to replace the old Act soon and the new BIS Act with specific emphasis on Hallmarking Scheme for ornaments. For protection of consumer interests and their hard earned money, he mentioned, several measures have been taken including Hall Marking of Gold.

Secretary General, UNCTAD, Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi in his address elaborated on globalization and the resultant challenges it brought to consumers. He mentioned the backdrop against which the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection were revised in 2015 and the commendable role India has played. He said that this Conference is an ideal opportunity to learn from best practices and exchange information, and suggested some points for consideration of India to consider in the implementation of UN Guidelines, such as  Provision of high quality ICT infrastructure at affordable prices, Consumer safety from hazardous goods, complete disclosure of all information for guidance of consumers, redressal system that is rapid and affordable for consumers in shortest time possible and regulations against identity theft and provision for data privacy protection.

Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) on 24.10.2017 reviewed the price and availability situation of onion with all the concerned stakeholders. It was indicated by Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) as well as the Trade Association that Kharif crop of onion has started arriving in markets in producing areas like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Prices in areas producing Kharif onions have already started moderating. The stakeholders informed that the recent rains have not affected the standing crop of onions. Supply of Kharif onion from producing regions has also started arriving in Delhi. Arrivals of Kharif crop is expected to increase significantly within a week. This would improve availability in consuming areas like Delhi as well, thereby, helping moderate prices. Trade Association informed that there is enough onion stock available from the Rabi crop also to meet the demand till Kharif arrivals pick up. Department advised Trade Associations to be in readiness to import and supply onions in case prices do not moderate as expected because of unscrupulous activities. Such imports will be facilitated.

The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary today sought the response from the representatives of the State Governments on the letter sent by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on September 12, 2017 to the States for identification and tracking of properties belonging to around 2.09 lakh companies which had been struck-off by the Central Government. Till then, the figure of struck-off companies presently stands at around 2.25 lakh. Mr. Chaudhary insisted that the process of identification of such properties needs to be completed at the earliest and requisite information be shared with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in a time bound manner.

 

                   The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary was speaking at the Meeting held today in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under his chairmanship to discuss the follow-up action by the States on properties belonging to the companies struck-off from the Register of Companies by the Central Government under Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013.

 

          At the outset of the meeting, the Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary emphasized that tackling the menace of Shell Companies is an imperative element of fight against Black Money. He said that such fight against corruption was meant to be a multi-pronged one and it was necessary for all stakeholders, including the States, to play their role in this fight. He stressed that such a drive shall unearth benami properties which shall discourage illegal and corrupt practices in the system thereby creating a healthy economic environment for honest businessmen. Mr. Chaudhary highlighted that this whole exercise shall go a long way in creating an atmosphere of confidence and faith in the corporatesystem paving the way for ease of doing business in India. The interest of stakeholders would be protected and the image of the country in the global business arena and fora would substantially improve.

 

                     During the aforesaid Meeting, additional State-wise information pertaining to such companies was shared with the State representatives. The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary expressed confidence that since the country-wide land records had been computerized, it would not take much time for the States to provide the requisite information to the district authorities as also to the Central Government.

 

The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary impressed upon the State representatives that consequent upon striking-off of these companies from the Register of Companies, any transaction pertaining to properties owned by such companies, by the Directors or authorized signatories of such companies on behalf of the companies, would be void ab initio and a nullity till such companies are restored by an order of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)under Section 252 of the Companies Act, 2013. In fact, by virtue of the company’s name having been struck-off from the Register of Companies under the Companies Act, 2013, its identity as a legal person had been lost and hence, the legal ownership of properties belonging to such a company was non-existent.

 

 The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary clarified that it was the duty of the District Administration to prevent any transaction of such properties and exercise due diligence based on the information shared by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. He impressed upon the State representativesto ensure that requisite directions are urgently issued to all the district authorities dealing with registration of properties to put appropriate mechanism in place so as to prevent transactions in properties belonging to such struck off companies.Mr. Chaudhary also advised that the erring officials allowing registration of transactions in such properties by ignoring the requisite directions, may be subjected to disciplinary action, because permitting and registering transactions in such properties was illegal, as the companies owning such properties stand dissolved under the Companies Act, 2013.

 

The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Chaudhary expressed confidence that the support of the States in this drive against black money would ensure its success in ushering a clean and effective Corporate Governance in the country.

                In what is undoubtedly a major breakthrough in its fight against black money and shell companies, vital information has been received by the Government of India from 13 banks regarding the bank account operations and post-demonetization transactions of some of the 2,09,032 suspicious companies that had been struck off the Register of Companies earlier this year. It may be recalled that after being struck off, operation of the bank accounts of these 2,09,032 suspicious companies were restricted for discharge of their liabilities only.

These 13 banks have submitted their First Instalment of data. The data received from them pertains to merely about 5,800 companies (out of more than 2 lakh that were struck off) involving 13,140 accounts. This in itself is a revealing figure. Few of the companies have been found to have more than 100 accounts to their names. The highest grosser among these is a company having 2134 accounts, followed by others having accounts in the range of 900, 300 etc.

The data pertaining to the pre demonetization account balances and transactions conducted from the accounts of these companies during the demonetization period is even more startling.

It is informed that, after separating the loan accounts, these companies were having a meagre balance of Rs 22.05 crore to their credit on 8th November, 2016.

However, from 9th November, 2016 i.e. after the announcement of demonetization, till the date of their being struck off, these companies have altogether deposited a huge amount of Rs. 4,573.87 crore in their accounts and withdrawn an equally large amount of Rs 4,552 crore. With loan accounts, there was a negative opening balance of Rs 80.79 crore.

Disturbing factors have been identified of companies having multiple accounts with miniscule or negative balance as on 8th November, 2016 which have then deposited and withdrawn amounts going in several crores from these accounts. The accounts were thereafter again left as dormant accounts with paltry balance. As mentioned earlier, this exercise of swindling the authorities was carried-out post demonetization till the companies were struck off. In some cases, certain companies have gone more adventurous and made deposits and withdrawals even after being struck off.

For example, in one of the Bank, 429 companies having zero balance each as on 8th November, 2016 have deposited and withdrawn over Rs 11 crore and left again with a cumulative balance of just Rs 42,000 as at the date of freezing.

Similarly in the case of another Bank, more than 3000 such companies, most having multiple accounts, have been located. From having a cumulative balance of about Rs. 13 crore as on 8th November, 2016, these companies have deposited and withdrawn about Rs 3800 crore, leaving a negative cumulative balance of almost Rs 200 crore at the time of freezing of their accounts.

It needs to be re-emphasized that this data is only about 2.5% of the total number of suspected companies that have been struck off by the Government. The huge money game played by these companies may well be the tip of an iceberg of corruption, black money and black deeds of these and many more of their brethren.

The investigative agencies have been asked to complete necessary investigation in a time bound manner. The country and honest citizen may well look forward to a more cleaner tomorrow.

                An exhibitions entitled “Decorated Arms & Armours” displaying select daggers, swords, armours as well as pistols from National Museum’s reserve collection, which represents different time period, region, technique and customs associated with these beautiful masterpieces, began here today. Director General, National Museum Dr. B.R. Mani inaugurated it. The exhibition will be on displayed till 5th November, 2017. 

The history of Indian arms and armours begins in pre and proto historic times, however in the historical context they are testified by several sculptures, painting and coins during the medieval period, there was considerable ingenuity and craftsmanship in manufacturing them. 

During the Sultanate and the Mughal rule, weapons underwent significant modifications, and weapons with Persian, Arab and Turkish influences became common. Examples are the Shamsheer from Persia and the Zulfikar from Arabia. 

A variety of daggers, imported weapons for self protection and hand to hand combat were also in vogue. There were regional variants like the Jamadhar, Jambia and Khanjar of Mughal the Chura of Afghans, the Khapwa of Rajputs, the Qurauli of Sikhs and the Khukri of Nepalis. Many daggers were adorned with ivory, jade, crystal and soap stone and sometimes embellished with calligraphy. 

From pre-historic period to the later Gupta period, we find that arms and armour were basically of a functional nature and do not bear much of an aesthetic element. It was from the medieval period that arms and armour began to be profusely ornamented. 

The ornamentation on weapons began to symbolize an individual's identity his political power and economic authority. The study of ornamented arms and armour is interesting for the part they played in shaping our history and on the technical side, where arts were applied in various ways the ornamentation techniques, the metallurgy and utility of various materials such s gold, silver, copper, brass, jade, crystal, agate, ivory, horn, mother of pearl, tortoise shell, wood, hide, precious and semi-precious stones etc. 

The arms and armours of the common man were used on the battlefield or for hunting were often plain and the decoration kept to a minimum. However, arms and armour of the nobility, military commanders and elite warriors were adorned with precious decoration especially for ceremonial use. 

Weapons used by the Royal houses of different dynasties were usually embellished with decorative designs bearing testimony to the fact of historical personalities. The edged weapons like swords, daggers, spears etc were extensively decorate3 with hunting scenes; and several other patterns. Manyof the arms also bore the name of their owners. 

Arms, most importantly ornamented daggers were the most common gifts presented to distinguished individuals in recognition of their services. A custom which was prevalent right from the ancient times is still practiced in many parts of India. The arms and armours which made up as gifts were opulently decorated. The decoration constituted things from everyday life and were subjected to a symmetrical arrangement, with pommel itself shaped like the head of horse, figures of deities and parrot among others.

                In an unscheduled Hot Line requested by Pakistan, Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen AK Bhatt spoke to his counterpart at 1400h today. Pak DGMO alleged that Indian security forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the Line of Control. Lt Gen AK Bhatt emphatically stated that retaliatory firing by Indian troops has only been carried out in response to unabated support given by Pak Army to armed terrorists who infiltrate across the border and target Indian Army posts with heavy caliber weapons. It is in response to such actions that Indian Army troops retaliate. 

DGMO further clarified that Indian Army always maintains impeccable standards of professionalism and does not target civilians. On the contrary Pak Army, has employed civilians at the forward posts and accorded permission for permanent locations of civilians in the vicinity of Pak Army posts. These civilians have repeatedly been used for gaining information of our locations and providing guides to the terrorists while crossing the LC. 

Lt Gen AK Bhatt impressed upon the Pak DGMO that while Indian Army will continue efforts to ensure peace and tranquility on the borders, however, support provided to terrorists while crossing LC by Pak Army is the prime reason for any collateral damage and is attributed to Pak Army aiding infiltration across the LC. He reiterated that this support to terrorism by Pak Army is unacceptable and the Indian Army will continue to take all retaliatory measures as well as retain the right to punitively respond to such provocative acts of aggression from Pak side in future too.

Naval cooperation had progressed most encouragingly in recent years and the increasing scale of operational interaction is indicative of a growing understanding between the two navies.

Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman interacted with CII representatives consisting of Indian companies and foreign OEMS at a round table on Energising ‘Make in India’ in defence sector.

The present government has taken a series of significant policy initiatives, including promulgation of DPP 2016 which gives highest priority to indigenous design and  manufacture of defence equipment, introduction of Strategic Partnership model, liberalization of FDI norms and providing a level-playing to private industry.

In the round table, a wide range of issues relating to private participation in defence manufacturing, including matters relating to licensing, taxes and duties, speeding up of procurement processes, streamlining of the offsets regime and creation of a tiered defence industrial ecosystem with full integration and skilling of manpower in the MSME sector were discussed.

The present government is fully committed to removing all the stumbling blocks and facilitating private participation in defence manufacturing with the objective of bringing high value foreign investment into the defence sector, building indigenous capabilities, fostering absorption and assimilation of technologies, and ensuring self-reliance in meeting the country’s defence needs by providing a level playing field.

Raksha Mantri issued directions to the team of officers headed by the Defence Secretary for time bound action on key issues raised at the round table, including the resolution of licensing with the Ministry of Home Affairs, tax related matters with the Ministry of Finance, commercialization of technologies developed by DRDO and timely conclusion of procurement proposals.

                Exercise Indra 2017, the first tri-service exercise between India and Russia, entered its final phase today, wherein the Task Force comprising of Armoured, Mechanised Infantry and Infantry elements, ably supported by Fighter Aircrafts and Armed Helicopters successfully extricated a humanitarian aid convoy from a terrorist attack. A terrorist attack on a humanitarian aid convoy was simulated as per the exercise setting. The humanitarian assistance was aimed for trapped civilians in a counter insurgency environment under UN mandate. The attack tested the response mechanism of the Combined Task Force of Indian and Russian Defence Forces. The terrorists were successfully isolated and the humanitarian aid convoy was escorted to safety. Simultaneously, Fighter Aircrafts and Armed Helicopters pulverized the target in an exceptional display of firepower while Artillery elements comprising of 122mm GRAD and howitzers further softened the target.  Armoured Tanks closed in on the target along with Mechanised Infantry elements and cordoned off the entire area, and the stage was set for the Infantry to launch the final assault.

Later, speaking to the media, Maj Gen ND Prasad, the Task Force Commander of the Indian contingent expressed his happiness at the professional synergy displayed during the entire exercise not only between the Air force, Navy and the Army elements of the Indian Defence Forces, but also between the Indian and Russian Defence Forces, in spite of constraints of different language. He stated that the manner in which the exercise is being conducted between India and Russia is a reflection of the high level of professionalism of both sides and that the exercise has proved to be a great learning ground. Rear Admiral Biswajit Dasgupta, the Naval Component Leader and Air Commodore RGK Kapoor, the Air Force Component Leader reiterated that the synergy on display between the three services of both sides has reinforced the importance of tri-service cooperation and is the harbinger of things to come in future operations.

The last drill of Exercise Indra 2017 will be carried out on 28 Oct 2017 when the amphibious landing will take place wherein landing of ground forces at Cape of Klerk training area will be undertaken by Indian and Russian Naval Elements with Air Support.

Earlier, the active sea phase of Naval component commenced on 26 November in the Sea of Japan. For the last few days personnel of both the countries were put through various tactical and operational manoeuvres. They displayed high levels of professionalism and the exercise has generated an outstanding level of professional synergy and understanding of each other’s doctrines, concepts and methodology of execution of operations.

The Air Force component undertook various practice missions by combined Indo-Russian crew in Fighters, Transport and Helicopters during the training phase. These aircraft formed an integral part in the Joint Ops that was undertaken today and will also provide Air Support for tomorrow’s amphibious landing mission.

The exercise will culminate on 29th October in a grand closing ceremony which will be held at Vladivostok.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman received the French Minister for the Armed Forces, Ms Florence Parly, in South Block today. Minister Parly is visiting India from 26-28 October, 2017 on her first official visit as the French Minister for the Armed Forces.

The Ministers reviewed ongoing initiatives to further strengthen bilateral defence cooperation as a key pillar of the strategic partnership between India and France. They also discussed regional and international developments of mutual interest.

A range of measures to expand military to military ties, including enhancing the scope of their joint exercises, in particular the VARUNA naval exercise scheduled in early 2018, were agreed upon. Both countries will also actively explore additional measures to facilitate operational level interactions between their respective armed forces.

The Ministers reiterated their strong intention to further expand bilateral cooperation on counter- terrorism. Recognising the growing significance of maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and the need for greater maritime domain awareness, India and France will further expand information sharing arrangements building upon the Technical Arrangement on Exchange of White Shipping information signed earlier this year.

The two Ministers also comprehensively reviewed developments in defence equipment and industry cooperation, where France is a major partner. They agreed to strongly support projects for defence manufacturing under the Make in India initiative as well as promote defence technology and R&D cooperation.

                The four-day Naval Commanders’ Conference concluded on 27 Oct 17 where the senior leadership of Navy reviewed major operations, training and administrative activities undertaken in the last six months.

During the Conference, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri addressed and interacted with the Naval Commanders, which was also attended by senior MoD officials. The Hon’ble RM reviewed the combat readiness of the Navy, pace of modernisation and progress of various acquisition and infrastructure related cases. She complimented the IN for maintaining a high operational tempo, ensuring the maritime security of the country and sustained efforts in support of the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ initiatives of the Government. The Hon’ble RM brought out that it was a matter of pride that all 34 warships presently under construction were being built indigenously. She also complimented the Navy on the successful conduct of tri-lateral exercise ‘MALABAR 17’ and informed the Commanders that during the recently concluded ADMM Plus, keen interest was evinced by various ASEAN nations in exercising with the Indian Navy, which spoke highly of the IN’s professional standing and competence.

Chairing the conference, Admiral Sunil Lanba, the CNS, addressed the Naval Commanders and stressed focus on four key areas; ‘Combat Capability and Role- Worthiness’, ‘Ensuring Primacy of Core Professional Tasks’, ‘Develop a Motivated, Trained and Committed Team’ and ‘Increase Familiarity and Comfort in IN’s Maritime Areas Of Interest’. The CNS shared his views on the current security scenario and emphasized the need for the IN to remain outcome oriented in all endeavours, both at sea and ashore.

The Commanders also had an opportunity to interact with the Chiefs of the Indian Army and IAF. The Service Chiefs brought out the complexities in current security situation where the spectrum of threats ranged from possible conventional conflict to inimical actions by state and non-state sponsored terrorists/ elements and natural disasters and calamities. The Service Chiefs elaborated their vision and the path being charted by the respective Services towards operational readiness and actions in progress towards improving tri-Service cooperation.

 Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog also interacted with the Commanders and gave his perspective on ‘Make in India’ with specific reference to building a vibrant defence industrial base, which would be pivotal in spurring the manufacturing sector growth and make India an export oriented economy.  Sh. Amitabh Kant also stressed the importance of demand aggregation digitising legacy processes.

As part of the annual theme, the Commanders brainstormed to fine tune the execution of ‘mission based deployment’ involving ships, aircraft and submarines beyond the immediate neighbourhood for providing sustained presence in the IOR. Critical enablers such as refits/ maintenance philosophy, op-logistics and HR measures for sustained operational effectiveness were also discussed in detail. Approval of a new Transition cycle for ships from Maintenance periods to Operational Deployments that allowed for a focussed and gradual transition of ships from periods of maintenance layoffs to full scale operations was one of the milestones achieved during the conference. The Commanders resolved to focus efforts on the Navy’s ability to deploy and sustain in tandem with the new Mission-based deployment concept, which would result in greater presence and visibility in IOR.   

In his closing address, the CNS emphasised the need to optimise efforts, exploit the potential of each and every personnel, encourage innovative thinking and harness available technology. The CNS urged the Commanders to put in concerted efforts to realise the ‘way ahead’ arrived at during the deliberations on various agenda points and exhorted the Commanders to keep an unwavering focus on combat readiness at all times.

                Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman addressed the Naval Leadership this morning during the ongoing Naval Commanders’ Conference (24-27 Oct 17) being held at New Delhi. This is the second edition of this year’s bi-annual Naval Commanders’ Conference.

At the very outset, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri complimented all personnel of the Indian Navy for securing the maritime interests of the nation. Taking note of the recent developments in our maritime neighbourhood, she emphasised the need for the Indian Navy to be strong at sea, and be ever ready and vigilant to counter any challenges in the maritime domain. 

The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri acknowledged the high operational tempo maintained by the Navy in the last one year through regular deployment of ships, submarines and aircraft from the South China Sea and Sea of Japan in the East to the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean in the West and the shores of Australia in the South including the focused efforts to deter piracy attempts off the Gulf of Aden. Participation in a number of bilateral exercises and the unprecedented success of the Exercise MALABAR with the US and the Japanese Navy earlier this year were lauded by the Raksha Mantri.

Recognising the lead taken by Indian Navy in indigenisation and self-reliance, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri stated that it is the collective responsibility of Service Headquarters, the Ministry and the Industry to promote a more vibrant ecosystem percolating down to the MSMEs, to encourage development of equipment and systems in India and to reduce import dependence in the Defence sector. 

She took note of the critical capability shortfalls that the Navy is facing in ship-borne multi-role helicopters, conventional submarines and mine counter measure vessels, which need urgent redressal to maintain the combat edge of the Navy. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri assured the Commanders’ that that these issues were being given due impetus and efforts were in hand to mitigate these shortcomings at the earliest.

The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri also commended the efforts of the Navy to constructively engage with the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) littorals to build their capacities and enhance their capabilities. She also mentioned the initiatives taken by the Indian Navy to impart practical training for naval personnel from IOR littoral nations on a regular basis. Institutionalising a full-fledged regional-forum to help find collective solutions to matters maritime in the IOR and facilitate projection of India’s and Indian Navy’s strategic and operational vision to a wider regional and global audience through the ‘Goa Maritime Conclave’ to be held early next month was also praised by the Hon’ble Minister. She further stated that MILAN 2018 at Port Blair early next year would be an excellent forum to get the littoral Navies on a common platform to discuss regional maritime issues and security challenges. 

Concluding her address the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri stated that maritime interests of a nation have a vital relationship with its economic growth and these shall be protected at all costs by ensuring a strong and credible Indian Navy. 

The four-day long Naval Commanders’ Conference is in its third day of deliberations wherein the top-level leadership of Navy is reviewing major operational, training and administrative activities undertaken in the last six months. The conference also reviewed IN’s readiness to deploy over the entire range of missions in the maritime domain (the new Mission-based Deployment Concept).

Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre emphasised the need to focus on the enhancement of incentives for National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets both in education and employment. He was inaugurating the 22nd Joint State Representatives and Additional / Deputy Directors General (JSR&A/D) Conference of the NCC here today.

Commenting that NCC plays an important role in nation building Dr. Bhamre said, NCC is responsible for moulding our youth into becoming responsible, disciplined and motivated citizens and for providing leadership in all walks of life. He said the popularity of the NCC is reflective in the long list of institutions waiting to join the NCC. The expansion of cadet strength from 13 to 15 lakh in the next few years would help the cause to some extent. He stated that the government has recently drawn up fresh areas of priority with regard to expansion of NCC. ‘I believe that Naval Wing NCC in coastal areas, border and LWE areas need greater impetus for the expansion. We also need to encourage more girls to join NCC’ he further said.

Dr. Bhamre also appreciated the performance of NCC on the occasion of Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, International Yoga Day and all social activities that serve national interest simultaneous to conventional training. He also called upon the state governments to honour their commitment with regard to provisioning of manpower, funds and suitable infrastructure for raising new NCC establishment in their states.

DGNCC Lt Gen Vinod Vashisht, gave a presentation on the progress and achievements of the NCC over the years. He emphasised on the need for providing tangible and substantial incentives to NCC cadets so that they are well compensated for their dedication of time and energy to train with the NCC. This would also motivate others to join the NCC and enable the nation to have a disciplined and trained work force in the future. He also complimented all Directorates for successful conduct of various training activities.

JSR&A/D is a biennial event attended by the senior representatives from all states of the country and the NCC heads of the states. The control and conduct of NCC activities is a joint responsibility of the Central and State Governments in terms of policies, finances, administrative and other aspects. This conference provides a platform to plan, implement and coordinate the NCC activities in the entire nation. 

This year achievements of NCC included the voluntary participation of more than 07 lakh cadets and staff on the occasion of Yoga Day pan India. NCC has also once again been felicitated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for its nationwide efforts during the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan. A number of adventure activities were undertaken by the organization to nurture the spirit of adventure amongst the cadets. 

All representatives from the states confirmed their commitment to promote and help the NCC in form of infrastructure, training facilities, compensating benefits to cadets and funds in their respective states to help groom the potential leaders for tomorrows India.

The Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre has said that the quest for indigenisation must be the foremost concern of any organisation as it is even more important in Defence sector as it leads to self-reliance which is critical to national security. He was inaugurating a seminar on Solutions to Problem Statements with a theme ‘Indigenous Technological Empowerment of the Indian Army’, here today.

 

Dr. Bhamre stated that significance of indigenisation must be fully absorbed by all stakeholders and must implement ‘Make in India’ in all future acquisition programmes. He appreciated that the Indian Army has not only organised a series of initiatives towards this objective, but also created the Army Design Bureau, which is a unique organisation to facilitate interaction and seek participation of the Indian industry and the academic community. Commenting that technology has permeated into all facets of daily existence, he said its relevance in warfare is most critical and always the side with access to better technologies will always win. “True self-reliance in Defence, therefore will flow out of fully home-grown technology”, he said. The Raksha Rajya Mantri mentioned that the government in the recent past launched several initiatives to develop technologies in niche sectors like defence and aerospace. There is a Technological Development Fund in the Ministry of Defence for specific projects. He said initiatives like the Skill India and Startup India will further create the necessary eco-system in the defence sector to realize a fully Made in India platform.

 

 Dr. Bhamre said the government has put defence at the core of its ‘Make in India’ programme and further stated that various companies are expressing their willingness to invest in India by utilizing the country’s highly talented and skilled manpower. This has a huge potential and to even export the products to friendly foreign countries. Dr. Bhamre also inaugurated an exhibition of Solutions and Innovations at the venue.

 

            Speaking at the function the Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat said that the Army has encouraged the academia and the industry in the country to come and understand the requirements with regard to equipment that is needed by the Army.

 

Secretary General, FICCI Dr. Sanjaya Baru, CMD Bharat Forge Ltd Shri Baba N Kalyani and Lt Gen (Retd) Subrata Saha also spoke on the occasion.

 

The function was attended by senior officials from the Indian Army, Ministry of Defence, FICCI and several representatives from the industry and academic community.

                Indian Air Force carried out major landing operations on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway, about 60 km west of Lucknow, today. The series of landings took place close to Bangarmau in Unnao District of Uttar Pradesh, where a 3 km stretch was specially prepared for such operations. The landing operations commenced at around 1015 hrs and continued till about 1200 hrs. A total of sixteen aircraft participated in the operation which comprised IAF’s frontline Air Superiority Fighters including the Sukhoi-30, Mirage-2000 and Jaguar fighter aircraft. These aircraft took off from Bareilly, Gwalior and Gorakhpur respectively. In addition, the IAF carried out drills in which Garud Commandos were inserted and extricated for ground operations, by the C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft which took off from Hindon airbase.

A team of Senior IAF Officials headed by Senior Air Staff Officer HQ CAC, IAF Allahabad Air Marshal AS Butola were present to oversee the operations. While the operation was conducted under the aegis of HQ CAC, Bamrauli Allahabad, Air Force Station Bakshi Ka Talab Station Commander, Gp Capt J Suares and his team, were responsible for the overall control and coordination of the exercise.

On site arrangements were made for a Mobile Air Traffic Control, Radar Control, Meteorological Facility, Aerospace Safety and Security Control. In addition, to deal with any situation, crash, firefighting, rescue and medical teams were positioned. IAF sought assistance from State Government authorities for temporary closure of the expressway and other matters like crowd control, etc. A large number of police personnel were stationed along the stretch to ensure smooth conduct of operations.

The exercise commenced with an impressive short landing by the C-130 which on its landing roll itself started off loading the Garud Commandos and their vehicle in manoeuvre called Combat ERO (Engine Running Offload). Immediately on disembarking from the  C-130, the Commandos took up position on either side of the airstrip to cordon it off for the fighter operations. This was followed by two sets of 3-3 Mirages, five SU30s and three Jaguars.   All 14 fighter aircraft carried out a roller/touch and go manoeuvre on the expressway. The C-130 then returned for another short landing to extricate the Garud Commandos.

Over the past few years, IAF has been increasing its efforts to utilise certain straight stretches of National Highways for emergency landings. Such highway stretches are planned to be used in emergencies, if an active airport is not available for some reason. These operations increase the flexibility in the use of Air Power. In addition, use of transport aircraft for quick insertion of forces for Human Assistance and Disaster Relief into civil area and Special Forces in case of contingencies has been validated.

IAF had already carried out landings by fighter aircraft for the first time on the Yamuna expressway on 21 May 2015. The stretch of Agra – Lucknow expressway was earlier activated for the first time for IAF operations in November 2016 in which six fighter aircraft of the IAF landed on the expressway. However, in this exercise, IAF included the Jaguar fighter aircraft for the first time. Also for the first time, IAF’s C-130J transport aircraft participated in highway landing operations for insertion and extrication of Garud Special Forces. While the operations on 24 October 2017 required the closure of the portion of the expressway for road traffic, through the excellent support of the UP State Government and UPEIDA, once the planned works are completed, such road traffic closure will not be required henceforth. Two diversion roads on either side of the airstrip are near completion. In addition, wire fencing on both sides is also being undertaken to keep the airstrip clear of stray animals. Two parking areas for aircraft at both ends of the airstrip are also nearing completion.

Several countries like Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, Singapore, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, etc. have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies or war like events.

This operation has majorly boosted IAF’s capability to undertake unhindered operations even during non-availability of standard runways. It has demonstrated the expert flying skills of its fighter and transport aircrew, and the capability of its ground crew in activating such expressway airstrips on short notice. Such activations of highway stretches all across India are planned to be practised regularly by the IAF in future.

                In pursuance with India’s ‘Act East Policy’, Indian Naval Ship Sukanya under the command of Commander SA Deodhar, NM arrived at Belawan Indonesia this morning to participate in the 30th edition of CORPAT (Coordinated Patrol) and 3rd Bilateral exercise between the Indian Navy and the Indonesian Navy. The exercise is aimed to foster closer maritime ties with countries located on the rim of the Indian Ocean.

The upcoming bi-lateral exercise CORPAT scheduled from 24 Oct – 05 Nov 17 is a demonstration of India’s commitment to its ties with Indonesia and to the maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region. The two navies have been carrying out Coordinated Patrols (CORPAT) on respective sides of the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) twice a year since 2002. The aim of the CORPAT is to enhance mutual understanding and inter-operability between the navies, prosecute vessels involved in unlawful activities, conduct SAR and take measures against Sea Pollution.

Defence relations between India and Indonesia have been growing steadily with regular joint activities and interactions between the armed forces of the two countries. These interactions would also provide opportunities for extensive operational and training engagements and contribute substantively to the maintenance of good order at sea. The exercise seeks to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship between India and Indonesia, and underscore India’s partnership and solidarity with friendly countries of the region. As part of the Indian Government’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ surveillance, Search and Rescue and other capability enhancement activities.

During the stay at Port Belawan, various activities such as official calls, formal reception on board ship, ship open to visitors, guided tours for Indian naval personnel and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations have been planned.

                Following is the full text of the statement at 4th ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus) in Philippines today.

Thank you Mr Chairman.

Your Excellency Delfin Negrillo Lorenzana, Secretary of National Defence, Republic of Philippines

Fellow Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen,

ASEAN occupies pride of place in Asia’s institutional architecture. The centrality of ASEAN has served as an anchor of stability in the region. For us in India, ASEAN’s continuance in this role is vitally important.

Indeed, India’s relationship with the ASEAN is a central pillar of our Act East Policy. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has noted, this is at the core of our dream of an Asian Century.

We also support greater ASEAN unity, in spirit and in purpose. ASEAN states have taken the lead in steering effective functioning of successful regional groupings such as the East Asia Summit and ADMM Plus.

Establishing this inclusive dialogue mechanism on defence and security issues under the aegis of ADMM Plus between ASEAN and its dialogue partners has laid down a strong foundation of trust and confidence.

In a short span of time, the ADMM-Plus has emerged as a credible and effective platform which has forged practical co-operation among the armed forces of member countries in key areas. In doing so, we have been guided by the principles of consensus, transparency and mutual respect for each other’s priorities and sensitivities. These principles should continue to be the basis for our future endeavours.

Ladies and gentlemen,

India has taken active part in all ADMM Plus mechanisms and contributed effectively to their success. A shining manifestation of our focus on practical co-operation and jointmanship was the Force 18 combined Field Training Exercise on Humanitarian Mine Action and Peace Keeping Operationsorganised in Pune, India last year, which witnessed enthusiastic participation from nearly 350 defence personnel from member countries.

This year, India has taken on the co-chairmanship of the 3rd cycle of Experts’ Working Group-Military Medicine (EWG-MM) along with Myanmar. We will take forward the work done by earlier co-chairs, Singapore, Japan, Russia and Thailand by deepening our engagement in the area of medical operations especially in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) missions.

I wish to underline India’s commitment to actively engage in the EWG process, and contribute effectively to initiatives by our other ADMM Plus partners. 

Colleagues,

The global strategic and security situation is constantly evolving and has thrown up fresh and serious challenges. The defence and security scenario in our shared region has also witnessed significant changes recently. Our countries now need to simultaneously prepare for traditional (military) and non-traditional threats.

The nuclear and missile tests conducted by DPRK, in violation of its international commitments, have triggered serious concern. India has deplored these tests. We remain concerned about the proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies which has adversely impacted India’s national security and that of the entire region. It is important that DPRKs’ proliferation linkages are investigated and those who have supported its nuclear and missile programme are held accountable.

Terrorism and radicalization pose one of the most immediate and serious security challenges to our societies. I wish to commend our host the Philippines for resolutely addressing the serious threat posed by terrorists in the southern part of the country and reiterate India’s zero tolerance for terrorism anywhere and under any circumstances. There are no good terrorists.

Terrorism is now a trans-national phenomena which requires strong collective action by all members of the global community. New developments in Social Media and Cyberspace have expanded the threat, as these are exploited by terrorists to develop less visible but lethal ways and means of manipulating minds of the people.

The transnational activism of terrorist groups, the spectre of returning foreign fighters and the conduct of irresponsible states that provide safe havens, funding and even encouragement to terrorist groups all need to be addressed together and comprehensively. Terrorism anywhere is a threat everywhere.

India has taken resolute measures to fight the scourge of terrorism from across its borders. We fully recognize the role ofjoint mechanisms with our partners and the role of international and regional forums in fighting this menace. The recent, BRICS Summit Declaration condemning all forms of terrorism and identifying a number of terrorist organisations engaged in dastardly acts was a positive step. India believes that ADMM Plus provides a forum for defence ministers of the region to address the critical issue of terrorism collectively in all its forms and manifestations. We should be clear and unequivocal in our condemnation of terrorism.

Maritime security continues to be another key concern. India supports freedom of navigation, overflight and commerce throughout the region. Nations should resolve maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law. We support a rules based order for oceans and sea that is critical for the continued growth and development of the Indo-Pacific region.

 

Given the occurrence of rapid climate change and natural disasters, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) is another area that will need continued and focussed attention from all of us. India fully supports the implementation of various initiatives undertaken by the forum. India is also increasingly shouldering its responsibilities in this area. We have emerged as first responders in HADR situations in the region on numerous occasions. India has also placed its capabilities at the disposal of our partners, and we continue to build regional capacities to deal with natural and humanitarian disasters.

Mr. Chairman, distinguished colleagues,

Capacity-building among the ASEAN countries to addressing all these shared security challenges needs to be accelerated. Expert Working Groups (EWGs) have proved to be an important cog in the ADMM wheel and have served us well in the identified areas. They can do more in terms of capacity building.

We have had detailed and comprehensive discussions on “Regional security Architecture” under the umbrella of East Asia Summit workshops.  A number of concepts and ideas have been proposed by the member countries.  India has also actively taken part in these workshops and put forward its Proposal of “A Dialogue-Centered Asia-Pacific Security Architecture”. We share the common view that we need to continue discussions for strengthening regional security architecture whilst keeping ASEAN centrality at its core.

I also whole-heartedly welcome annual meetings of the ADMM Plus instead of biennial meetings. This would lead to added opportunities to develop co-operative mechanisms capable of delivering tangible outcomes. Operationally, we also hope that there would be greater complementarity and synergy with other forums, especially the EAS.

Let me conclude by expressing India’s deep commitment and continued contribution for the realisation of the objectives set by this august forum. We wish Philippines all the very best for the upcoming Summits.

This is my first foreign visit since taking over as Defence Minister of India last month. I look forward to exchange views on practical cooperation and new learnings from my more experienced Ministerial colleagues.

Thank you!

MJPS/RP

                INSV Tarini entered Fremantle (Australia) port today during it’s maiden voyage to circumnavigate the globe. This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. The vessel is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprises Lieutenant Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta.

Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, Hon’ble Raksha Mantri had flagged-off INSV Tarini from Goa on 10 Sep 17. The vessel has covered 4800 Nautical miles from Goa, crossing the Equator on 25 Sep 17 and the Tropic of Capricorn on 06 Oct 17.

The indigenously-built INSV Tarini is a 56-foot sailing vessel, which was inducted in the Indian Navy earlier this year, and showcases the ‘Make in India’ initiative on the International forum.

The expedition titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’, is in consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. It also aims to showcase ‘Nari Shakti’ on the world platform and help revolutionise societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of their participation in challenging environs.

The vessel would return to Goa in April 2018, on completion of the voyage. The expedition is being covered in five legs, with stop-overs at 4 ports: Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), and Cape Town (South Africa).

The crew has also been collating and updating meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), as also monitoring marine pollution on the high seas. They would interact extensively with the local populace, especially children, during the port halt to promote Ocean sailing and the spirit of adventure.

The vessel is likely to depart Fremantle on 05 Nov 17.

                INS Kiltan (P30), third Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) stealth corvettes built under Project 28 (Kamorta Class) was commissioned into the Indian Navy by Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman at an impressive ceremony held at Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam today, 16 October 2017. Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral HCS Bisht, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Naval Command, Rear Admiral VK Saxena (Retd), CMD, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited, Kolkata (GRSE), Kolkata, Commodore MB Kunte (Retd) first Commanding Officer of erstwhile Kiltan and a host of other dignitaries were also present during the commissioning ceremony. The event marked the formal commissioning into the Navy of the third of the four ASW Corvettes, indigenously designed by the Indian Navy’s in-house organisation, Directorate of Naval Design and constructed by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited, Kolkata.

On arrival at the Naval Jetty, Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman was received by Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chief of the Naval Staff. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri was presented with a Guard of Honour and was introduced to the dignitaries’ present prior commencement of commissioning ceremony.

Welcoming the gathering, Admiral Sunil Lanba stated that this commissioning marks yet another milestone in our journey of indigenous warship building. The Indian Navy is deeply committed to the principle of indigenisation and the Government’s thrust on ‘Make in India’. Commissioning of four ships in the last year, all built in Indian shipyards, is a testimony of our resolve. Our commitment to indigenisation also assumes special significance as we have steadily broadened our indigenisation efforts beyond ship building. We have achieved considerable success with indigenous sonars such as Abhay and HUMSA-NG as well as weapons such as Varunastra and BrahMos. These achievements are a result of the Indian Navy’s proactive and integrated approach to achieve self-reliance said the Admiral.

.This was followed by reading out the Commissioning Warrant of the Ship by the Commanding Officer, Commander Naushad Ali Khan. Subsequently, hoisting of the Naval Ensign onboard for the first time and ‘Breaking of the Commissioning Pennant’ with the National Anthem being played marked the completion of the Commissioning Ceremony.

During her address post commissioning of INS Kiltan, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman congratulated the Indian Navy, M/s. GRSE, other Indian PSUs and a host of small and medium scale industries, which have contributed towards building this fine ship. She emphasised that the Navy’s relentless pursuit of self-reliance through indigenisation is highly appreciable and this has helped the Indian Navy to seamlessly transform from a Buyer’s to a Builder’s Navy. She highlighted that the addition of INS Kiltan to the naval fleet is a reaffirmation of this transformation. She further exhorted that we need to benchmark our shipbuilding practices to international best practices and produce quality ships in a shorter time frame and at competitive costs. She further stated that the Government fully appreciates the nation’s defence requirements and requisite finances for the Armed Forces and Defence industry would be made available for the modernisation and development plans of the Navy. The Raksha Mantri later unveiled the Commissioning Plaque and dedicated the ship to the nation.

Regarded as a very prestigious acquisition, INS Kiltan is one of the most potent warships to have been constructed in India. The ship’s keel of was laid on 10 August 2010 and launched on 26 March 2013. Her maiden sea trials commenced on 06 May 2017 and finally was handed over to the Indian Navy by GRSE on 14 October 2017. The sleek and magnificent ship is propelled by ‘Combination of Diesel and Diesel (CODAD)’ propulsion system of four diesel engines to achieve speeds in excess of 25 knots and has an endurance of around 3,500 Nautical Miles.

The ship has enhanced stealth features resulting in a reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS) achieved by X-form of hull and superstructure along with optimally sloped surfaces. The very low under water acoustic signature makes it a ‘silent killer on the prowl’. This has been achieved by using advanced techniques for propeller design and mountings of main machinery. The ship’s advanced stealth features make her less susceptible to detection by the enemy and help in effective employment of soft kill measure like the Chaff.

More than 80 % of the ship is indigenous with state of the art equipment & systems to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare conditions. Also, P-28 weapons and sensors suite is predominantly indigenous and showcases the nation’s growing capability in this niche area. INS Kiltan is the first major warship with superstructure entirely of composite material.

Weapons and Sensors have been installed/ interfaced on this composite superstructure for the first time on a major warship. Composite superstructure fitted on INS Kiltan ushers the usage of advanced engineering materials on Indian Naval warships with significant improvement in weight and stability parameters.

Apart from her integral ASW capable helicopter, the formidable array of weapons include heavy weight torpedoes, ASW rockets, 76 mm caliber Medium Range gun and two multi-barrel 30 mm guns as Close-in-Weapon System (CIWS) with dedicated fire control systems. She is also fitted with indigenous missile decoy rockets (Chaff) and advanced ESM (Electronic Support Measure) system to detect and map enemy transmissions and direction finder equipment. The ship boasts of a highly advanced Combat Management System and a sophisticated Integrated Platform Management System.

The ship gets her name from old INS Kiltan (P79), a Petya class ASW ship that served the nation for 18 years before being decommissioned in June 1987. Named after the coral island belonging to the Lakshadweep group of islands in India, the ship has a total complement of 15 officers and 180 sailors. The sleek and magnificent ship spans 109 meters in length, 14 meters in breadth with a displacement of 3,300 tonnes and can rightfully be regarded as one of the most potent Anti Submarine Warships to have been constructed in India.

With the changing power dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region, INS Kiltan will augment the Indian Navy’s mobility, reach and flexibility whilst proudly flying the Indian Flag. The ship is manned by a team comprising 13 officers and 178 sailors with Commander Naushad Ali Khan at the helm as her first Commanding Officer. The commissioning of Kiltan will add a new dimension to the ASW capability of the Indian Navy and the Eastern Fleet in particular. The multifarious missions that can be undertaken by the ship truly reflect the enhanced multi-dimensional capability of the Indian Navy.

                In pursuance of India’s Act East Policy and demonstration of India’s commitment to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific Region, Indian Naval Ships Satpura and Kadmatt are visiting Sasebo, Japan from 12th to 15th October 2017. The visit of these ships is part the Indian Government’s initiatives to strengthen the long standing, mutually supportive and strong relationship between Japan and India. This historic relationship spans across the entire spectrum of engagement between both countries – cultural, spiritual, economic and security.

The visiting Indian Naval ships will engage with the JMSDF in formal calls, as also professional, social and sporting interactions. After completion of the harbour phase, the ships will take part in Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with the Murusame Class destroyer, JS Kirisame.

Since the first ‘Navy to Navy Staff Talks’ between the two nations in November 2008, naval ties have reached new heights with bilateral and multilateral exercises and enhanced cooperation in information sharing, meteorology and oceanography, disaster management and military training. The defence and security interaction between both countries has since expanded to encompass a Defence Policy Dialogue and a Maritime Affairs Dialogue.

Regular bilateral and multilateral maritime exercises have been the foundation for strong naval relations. The erstwhile Japan – India Maritime Exercise (JIMEX) led to Japan participating in the ‘MALABAR’ exercise (a tripartite naval exercise between India, the US and Japan) since 2014. JMSDF Ships Izumo and Sazanami participated in the recently concluded edition of ExMALABAR off Chennai. Both navies have participated in each other’s International Fleet Reviews (IFR) by deputing ships and high level delegations – while INS Sahyadri participated in the IFR at Yokosuka in October 2015, JS Matsuyuki participated in the IFR at Visakhapatnam in February 2016.

The Indian Navy and JMSDF also have strong bilateral defence training cooperation, including at very senior levels. Further, in order to enhance interoperability and understanding, seminars and short term exchange programs are conducted regularly in both countries with participation from both navies. This exchange has expanded to sporting interaction in the form of JMSDF participation in the annual international Admiral’s Cup Regatta at the Indian Naval Academy for the first time in 2016. India looks forward to continued participation from the JMSDF and an invitation has been extended for the 2017 edition as well.

Both navies look forward to enhanced cooperation in the fields of military technology, white shipping, training, intelligence sharing, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and exchange of subject matter experts in various fields. With relations between both countries at an all time high and more avenues under consideration, the future looks promising with safer sea lanes and highly modernised navies helping in fulfilling each other’s obligations.

                1.         During the Army Commanders Conference the issue of services being non-combatants was discussed. Some personnel from Army Service Corps (ASC) have expressed apprehensions that since they are non-combatants they should not be considered for posting to field areas.  It is highlighted that Army in its Affidavit in Supreme Court has mentioned the following:-

 

(a)       To boost strength essential in Line of Control, Low Intensity Conflict, Counter Insurgency and Counter Terrorist environment a number of Officers, JCOs and Other Ranks from Combat Support Arms and logistic units are posted on tenure basis in infantry (Counter Insurgency/ Counter Terrorist units). This also provides much necessary operational experience to these Officers, JCOs and Other Ranks. It is submitted that their performance in such roles has been noteworthy.


(b)        Army performs its role in war and peace as a whole and not in isolated compartments. Each Arm/ Service has designated role and function.

(c)        Combat Arms/ Combat Support Arms/ Services are operational entities of Army which has clear and defined roles with charter of duties. Further, without diluting the role played by Services in maintaining logistic support to Combat Arms during operations it has been the consistent stand of the Army during litigation that   Commanding Officers (COs) of ASC, Ordnance and Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) are not required to largely remain in contact with front line forces where major combat may take place during operations. Therefore, ages of Command of Services could be higher than those of arms, where COs are expected to move forward in the combat zone, where their physical efficiency becomes relevant.  It was never in dispute that all arms and services are combatants. Hence, at no stage has the Army referred to Services Units being non-combatant Units.

 

2.         In addition Chief of Army Staff on assuming the appointment had mentioned that he would consider all arms and services at par and they would get their dues that they deserve. Some aberrations, if these are being perceived by any particular arm or service are being addressed during the Conference. The anguish amongst some personnel on discrimination in their status, needs to be put to rest and the COAS has assured that necessary corrections, where needed will be addressed.

                Two Indian Air Force Garuds, part of a joint security team were martyred in a gunfight during Combined Cordon and Search Operation today in Hajin Village of Bandipora district, Kashmir. The Garuds were operating with the Army.

 

On the night of 10 Oct, an Intelligence report was received by Army, which conveyed that 5-6 terrorists were hiding in a house in Hajin village.  The joint team laid a cordon around the house today at 0400 h. Terrorists ran out of the house lobbing grenades and firing indiscriminately towards the cordon party. Two terrorists firing indiscriminately ran towards the position of Garuds who challenged them and killed two terrorists. In the intense operation two IAF Garuds {Sergeant Khairnar Milind Kishor and Corporal Nilesh Kumar Nayan} sustained serious multiple bullet injuries and were evacuated to Base Hospital, Srinagar where they succumbed to the injuries and were martyred.

                The bi-annual IAF Commanders’ Conference was inaugurated by the Raksha Mantri this morning at Air Headquarters (Vayu Bhavan). Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, welcomed Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman and Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre and introduced the IAF Commanders to them.

The CAS briefed the Raksha Mantri on the current status of the IAF and the efforts that have been made in the recent past. During her address the Raksha Mantri said that the devolved powers given to the Service Chiefs should be fully utilised for achieving their capabilities. The Minister said that Air Force alongwith Ordnance Factory Board and DRDO should make an assessment about indigenisation under ‘Make-in-India’ programme. She said that the budgetary allocations should not be viewed as a constraint and should be looked at to acquire what is absolutely necessary. She said that the Government is committed to fill the gaps which have arisen due to lack of timely decision making in the last decade.

The Chief of the Air Staff while addressing the Commanders emphasised the need for continuous effort and training to maintain IAF's cutting edge.

Territorial Army (TA) celebrated its 68th Raising Day here today. As per tradition, the TA fraternity led by ADG TA Major General DA Chaturvedi, called on the President Shri Ram Nath Kovind and payed their respect to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. In the run-up to the Raising Day several events were organised across the country. In Delhi the TA organised a half marathon on October 02, 2017 in the true spirit of Citizens’ Army and also to promote healthy life style. The event comprised 5 Km, 10 Km and 21 Km run and was flagged off from Army Parade Ground, Delhi Cantt by DGMO Lieutenant General AK Bhatt, and Lt Col (Hony) Kapil Dev. The event was rich by its participation with over three thousand Defence personnel and their families taking part in various categories. TA symphony Band performed at the iconic India Gate on October 08, 2017 which attracted large crowds who were enthralled by the excellent music of the Band and added to the patriotic fervour of the evening. The TA is citizen's army of volunteers, who have the zeal to contribute towards the country's defence. The Territorial Army provides an ideal opportunity to the youth of the country to receive military training in their spare time and serve the Nation in times of national emergency and internal disturbances. 

The TA is in the process of expanding its footprint with raising of one Infantry Battalion (TA) at Nicobar and an Ecological Task Force Battalion for drought region of Marathwada, in Maharashtra. Also, case for raising of one Composite Ecological Task Force for National Mission for Clean Ganga is in final stages of approval. These new raisings and especially the unit for Namame Ganga Mission will allow the TA to contribute immensely in a National cause. In near future the unique strength of TA could be an ideal platform to build national effort during disaster management.

The TA has achieved many glorious feats and earned laurels during the past wars of 1962, 1965 and 1971. It has displayed its grit and courage in operations Pawan, Vijay and Parakram. For outstanding performance in various operations, the TA personnel have been conferred with numerous awards. The award of Kirti Chakra (Posthumous) to Maj David Manlun of 164 Inf Bn (TA) (H&H) NAGA and Army Commander’s Unit Citations awarded to three TA units on the occasion of Independence Day 2017 bears testimony to the bravery and unrelenting spirit of the Terriers.

After Independence in 1947, the Territorial Army Act was enacted on 18 August 1948 by the Constituent Assembly resulting in the constitution of the present Territorial Army. The TA started functioning through re-designation and re-organisation of 11 Indian Territorial Force Infantry units. The TA’s first camp was formally inaugurated by Shri C Rajagopalachari, the first Indian Governor General of India on 09 October 1949 and therefore, 09 Oct is celebrated as TA Day every year. 

With Savdhani and Shoorta as the emblem, the 47,000 strong TA comprises 46 non-departmental units, funded by Ministry of Defence and 18 departmental units, funded by various State Government and Central Ministries like the Oil sector, Railways and Environment. 42 Infantry Battalions with 70% of TA troops being deployed on Counter Insurgency/Counter Terrorism environment have achieved a high degree of op focus and synergy with relentless efforts. 10 Home & Hearth Battalions deployed in Eastern and Northern theatre and three Engineer Regiments deployed in Northern theatre for maintenance of LC Fence are tasked in challenging operational environment and have shown exemplary professional standards, commitment, devotion and dedication to service.

Departmental units of the TA have always risen to the occasion to support the national effort in rail communications, oil and natural gas refining and supplies. Ecological Task Forces have been addressing the environmental concerns in their assigned areas on a war footing and have achieved commendable results. The Ecological Force has also taken a unique initiative to help the people of border villages in Malari region of Uttarakhand by planting 4160 saplings of Walnut and Chilgoza to provide them livelihood and prevent economic migration.

In a very sad accident on 6 October 2017, one MI-17V5 crashed near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. The accident occurred in high altitude area while the helicopter was undertaking maintenance sortie. The post is not connected by any road. 

Immediately seeing the accident, all soldiers of the post commenced the recovery effort in the treacherous terrain. As the helicopter had caught fire, the recovery was difficult. On 06 October, the mortal remains of the crew and the soldiers who died in the helicopter crash were collected from the wreckage and were promptly moved to the nearest helipad. 

Due to constraints of the carriage effort in high altitude area, helicopter cannot carry full load. Mortal remains were wrapped in available local resources instead of improvised body bags or coffins. This was an aberration. 

Mortal remains arrived at Guwahati Base Hospital by 2P.M. on 6 October and thereafter post-mortems and other formalities commenced. 

Immediately after the post-mortem, all the mortal remains were placed in the wooden coffins with full military honours. Consequent to paying of tributes as per full military honours, mortal remains of all the personnel have been sent to respective next of kin. 

Carriage of mortal remains, wrapped in local resources as in this case, is an aberration. Body bags, wooden boxes will be ensured. 

Armed Forces always ensure full military honour to the fallen comrades.

A piracy attempt on the high seas was foiled by an Indian Naval warship on 06 October 2017

INS Trishul a stealth frigate of the Indian Navy whilst on Anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden, was escorting a merchant vessel MV Jag Amar when she detected a boat carrying out suspicious manoeuvers in the vicinity of the merchant ship.

INS Trishul closed the boat for investigation and launched her integral helicopter to investigate. The skiff was carrying items identified as piracy triggers and some small arms with ammunition. Marine commandos boarded the pirate boat and neutralised all piracy triggers in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures. The merchant vessel Jag Amar with all 26 Indian crew is safe and is continuing her passage. The skiff and her crew were released.

The Indian Navy has been deploying a warship in the waters in and around the Gulf Of Aden since 2008 and has safely escorted hundreds of merchant vessels through these treacherous waters. Indian ships are mandated to prevent piracy and are not mandated for regional law enforcement. The actions taken by the ship are the rationale for the continued deployment of Indian ships for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.

                Minister of State for Defence Dr Subhash Bhamre has appreciated the Information Technology initiatives of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD) that are in tune with the Government thrust on Digital India and e-governance. He was speaking at a function to mark 271st Annual Day of DAD here today.

He particularly admired the two initiatives of the Department i.e., Defence Travel System (DTS) and the Comprehensive Pension Package (CPP) for Defence Pensioners, earlier announced in the Union Budget 2017-18. Dr Bhamre said that he was hopeful that the department would meet the objective set out in the budget speech for the two projects.

Dr Bhamre assured that the Department was committed to reaching out to each and every pensioner ensuring timely and correct disbursement of pension to them. Through ‘Aashrya’ (Pension Disbursement Project), the department fulfils its mandate of timely and accurate disbursement of pension to the defence pensioner’s/family pensioner’s/defence civilian pensioners through the Defence Pension Disbursement Offices (DPDOs). The department has also launched a new project ‘Suvinay’ developed in house, to transform and ensure seamless data transfer for pension sanction and generation of Electronic PPOs (Pension Payment Orders). The CPP will ensure timely and seamless sanction and disbursement to Defence Pensioners with a new set of dedicated service centres.

Speaking on the issue of One Rank One Pension (OROP), Dr Bhamre said, the department has ensured timely payment of OROP to the tune of Rs 9,231.26 crore to around 20.42 lakh pensioners. The Department has also completed pension revision as per the multiplication factor recommended by the 7th Pay Commission and released arrears of Rs 6,783.95 crore.

On the issue of DTS, Dr Bhamre said, the Defence Travel System or e-Ticketing project of the department has done away with the most cumbersome management and control of the Railway Warrants, etc. The DTS is a secure electronic web-based system to replace the costly and time consuming system of booking of railways ticket through warrants. Out of approximately 10,700 units 5,600 units are on board. Average rail ticket booking per day is 16,000.” Around 10.7 lakhs profile have been created on DTS portal. However, need is to bring all defence units on board. For which concerted efforts from Services is also required.

On this occasion, Dr Bhamre also presented the ‘Raksha Mantri Awards for Excellence’ to the officials of the Department selected for their outstanding contribution in the areas of Procurement process streamlining in Air Force, Dynamic website for salary to soldiers in Army Medical Corps and e-audit of OROP.

The occasion was marked by the presence of Defence Secretary Shri Sanjay Mitra, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa, Financial Advisor (Defence Services) Shri Sunil Kohli, senior officials from the Army, Navy and Air Force, Ministry of Defence as well as heads of Paramilitary Forces. The occasion also witnessed the screening of a video song dedicated to soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces composed by eminent Carnatic singers ‘Trichur Brothers’.

The Department traces back its history to 1747 when the first Pay Master was appointed for paying the Garrison at Fort William, Kolkata. The Department was re-designated as Defence Accounts Department from Military Accounts Department in 1951.

                The current Indian Military Advisory and Training Team has been deployed at the Senior Command and Staff College (SCSC) in Jinja, Uganda since April 2016. Their contributions to the curriculum revision, student assimilation enhancement and capability building of the local directing staff have been appreciated by no less than the President of Uganda. The team, through its rapport and positive interaction, has been successful in mobilising the local Indian community in provisioning a state of art gymnasium to the SCSC. With equipment that’s been imported from Dubai, the gymnasium’s net worth is more than $30,000 US. It was inaugurated by the High Commissioner of India to Uganda, His Excellency Sh Ravi Shankar and then handed over to the Chief of Defence Forces of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), Gen David Muhoozi, who while graciously accepting the same, hailed it as a ‘one of kind asset for the entire UPDF’. He thanked the Indian contingent for the focused dedication towards the betterment of the UPDF which he felt was contributing immensely towards the development and consolidation of Indo-Uganda relations.

                Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of the Naval Staff is visiting Vietnam on a bilateral visit from 04 to 07 October 2017. The visit aims to consolidate cooperation between the Armed Forces of India and Vietnam and also to explore new avenues of defence cooperation.

During his visit, the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of the Naval Staff will hold bilateral discussions with His Excellency, Mr Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Hon’ble Prime Minister of Vietnam, His Excellency, General Ngo Xuan Lich, Hon’ble Defence Minister of Vietnam, Senior Lieutenant General Phan Van Giang, Chief of General Staff and Vice Minister of National Defence, Vietnamese Armed Forces, and Rear Admiral Pham Hoai Nam, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People’s Navy. In-addition to holding important bilateral discussions, the Admiral will also be visiting the National Defence Academy of Vietnam, where he will interact with student officers and faculty members and deliver a talk on the ‘Importance of Maritime Power’. He will also visit Vietnam People’s Navy ‘Naval Region 4’, Vietnam Naval Academy and lay a wreath at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. 

India has historical linkages with Vietnam that dates back many centuries, though the countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1972. Defence cooperation between India and Vietnam has been robust with the primary focus being Maritime Cooperation. India signed a Protocol on Defence Cooperation Agreement in 1994. The partnership was thereafter elevated to Strategic Partnership in 2007 and a MoU on Defence Cooperation between the countries was signed on 05 November 2009. A ‘Joint Vision Statement for 2015-20’ was signed by the respective Defence Ministers in May 2015 and the Strategic Partnership was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in September 2016, during the visit of the Hon’ble PM to Vietnam. 

The Indian Navy cooperates with the Vietnam People’s Navy on many issues, which include operational interactions, training and exchange of Subject Matter Experts in various fields through the medium of Staff Talks. The Vietnam People’s Navy also participates in the ‘MILAN’ inter-Navy interactions organised at Port Blair by the Indian Navy. Warships from Indian Navy have been regularly visiting ports at Vietnam, with Indian Naval Ships Satpura and Kadmat recently making port call at Hai Phong from 23 to 27 September 2017. The Vietnamese Navy ship Dinh Tien Hoang, a Gepoard Class Frigate, also visited Visakhapatnam in February 2016, for participation in the ‘International Fleet Review - 2016’.

The Indian Army and Air Force also maintain robust cooperation with the Vietnamese Army and Air Force. Officers from the Vietnamese Army and Air Force undergo training at various Indian defence training institutes including National Defence Academy, Defence Services Staff College and National Defence College. Both the Services also carryout exchanges of Subject Matter Experts and pursue a structured cooperation mechanism through the medium of Staff Talks of their respective Services.

                The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) has sanctioned Rs 200 crore for flood affected reconstruction works in the four North Eastern States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. 

This was disclosed here today by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh. 

Pertinent to mention that during his visit to Northeast in August this year to review the flood situation in the four States, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had announced a flood relief package of Rs 2,000 crore. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, this year had witnessed unprecedented floods and the rainfall was more than 100% higher than that in the preceding months during the same period of time. As a result, he said, the damage was colossal and the relief and rehabilitation operations also got disrupted. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, a high-level committee has also been constituted to monitor the flood related operations and plan for future roadmap to avoid such situations. 

Referring to the keen interest and priority shown by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that not only the Prime Minister began monitoring the flood situation right from day one, but he was also personally calling up the Chief Ministers of the concerned States for the latest feedback and also offered important tips and advice. 

Earlier today, Senior Sikkim leader and Member of Parliament, Shri P.D. Rai called on Dr Jitendra Singh and updated him about preparations for the upcoming ""Start up Conference"" to be held in Gangtok on the 24th of November. He also thanked Dr Jitendra Singh for the financial and other logistic support offered by the Ministry of DoNER for successful conduct of this conference. 

The first-ever airport at Sikkim coming up at Pakyong is ready to become functional soon, informed Dr Jitendra Singh.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the North Eastern Council (NEC) will be reoriented and developed as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the North Eastern States with necessary resources, knowledge and skill to execute innovative and strategic vision for the region. Addressing a combined meeting of the senior officers of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) and NEC here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said this will be in keeping with the changing times and the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi as laid down by him during his visit to Shillong to attend the NEC Plenary meeting in May 2016. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said the NEC was set up way back in early 1970s with the intention to give special focus to the development of this region. However, he said, much has changed since then and with the setting up of an exclusive and separate Ministry of DoNER in 2004 during the tenure of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there has also been sometimes overlapping of functioning of the two institutions. Therefore, he said, the NEC requires to be reshaped after the identification of thrust areas and critical gaps in order to take up as many development initiatives as possible within the annual budgetary allocations. 

During the last three years of the Central Government, Dr Jitendra Singh said the budgetary allocations for both Ministry of DoNER and NEC has been increased. Moreover, the execution of the various development works has been expedited and in the about last two years, the spending of funds has been increased by 65% to 70%. This has happened partly because of bringing in the ease in procedures as well as by using the modern technology for submission of DPRs and UCs through space satellites and other means, he added. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said the NEC will have the role of a visionary as well as a strategic leader for all the eight states of the region, wherein it could lay down the roadmap for each of the separate States and areas based on specific requirements, specific attributes and specific needs. In this context, he said, NEC could also take up the leading role of promoting the bamboo industry as well as food processing entrepreneurship. 

Dr Jitendra Singh issued instructions for initial written draft underlining the new format of NEC to be prepared within a timeline of one month, which could be discussed and redrafted within short time. 

Secretary, DoNER, Shri Naveen Verma, Secretary, NEC, Shri Ram Muivah and other senior officers of Ministry of DoNER as well as NEC were present during the meeting.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the Northeast is fast emerging as the new ""StartUp"" destination for youngsters from all over India.

Addressing the two-day National Convention on ""Transforming Northeast India"" here yesterday, Dr Jitendra Singh said, with the improvement in connectivity and transport facility in the last two years, coupled with concentrated administrative focus, more and more youngsters are now heading towards the North-Eastern States to venture into entrepreneurship and take advantage of its unexplored potential. Citing an example, he said, for instance, whereas in certain areas of Northeast, including States like Arunachal Pradesh, while almost 40% of the fruit goes waste on account of lack of adequate storage and transport facilities, the same can be used to produce and manufacture fresh and pure fruit juice at a much more cost-effective price.

In an hour long interactive session with the youngsters, Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out to another area for future StartUps and said during the peak season of tourism when there is no accommodation available, even mediocre hotels charge exorbitant fares which are sometimes equal to 5-star hotel fares in a metropolitan city. However, he said, as the ‘home tourism’ trend has picked up in the recent two to three years, several youngsters are now making a fortune out of this hitherto unexplored avenue. Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the new airports coming up at Pakyong in Sikkim, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Shillong in Meghalaya, which along with a time-bound plan to lay broad-gauge rail track, would bring in further ease of business. Another sector of entrepreneurship which is fast emerging in Northeast, Dr Jitendra Singh said, is the medical and healthcare sector. For years, he said, there has been a trend for patients to shift outside the region, mostly to Kolkata or Vellore, but the encouragement given to the private corporate sector has now resulted in the opening of new hospitals within the region itself and young entrepreneurs are taking the lead. In this regard, he also referred to the initiative taken by DoNER Ministry to promote public-private partnership with some of the leading corporate players.

While the women in Northeast are already empowered and professionally more active as part of their tradition, Dr Jitendra Singh pointed to the recent initiatives of encouraging Self Help Groups to promote household entrepreneurships, in which young StartUps have also come forward and opted to work in the sector of handloom and textile. To further reinforce this effect, the Union Textile Ministry has also initiated some exclusive schemes and initiatives for North-Eastern States. Dr Jitendra Singh called upon the youngsters to make the best use of Government of India’s “North East Industrial Promotion Policy” as well as the special budgetary support offered to the industry. Member of Parliament, Shri Vinay Sahasrabuddhe also addressed the convention.

                The newly appointed Governor of Meghalaya, Shri Ganga Prasad called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and exchanged inputs about various aspects of the political and administrative scenario in the State. 

Dr Jitendra Singh informed the Governor that the Ministry of DoNER has decided to fund the upgradation of Air strip at Shillong Airport. 

The North Eastern Council (NEC), Dr Jitendra Singh said, which was set up in the early 1970s, long before an exclusive Ministry for the Northeast Region was established, also has its headquarters in Shillong. He said the Ministry had now started an extensive exercise to reorient and rejuvenate the NEC in a new format so that it could perform the effective role of an important resource-cum-research centre for the entire region and could be developed as the hub of innovation for the upliftment of entire Northeast. A proposal in this regard, he said, has already been circulated and is presently under the active consideration of the Government of India. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said it goes to the credit of the Union Government that States like Meghalaya, which had never seen a train, are now soon going to be on the rail map of India. He said the priority accorded by the present government to the Northeast is evident from the fact that Shri Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister after about 40 years who visited Shillong for the Plenary Meeting of the NEC.

                The Government has constituted a high-level committee for proper management of the water resources in the North Eastern Region (NER) under the Chairmanship of Vice-Chairman, Niti Aayog. This is a sequel to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Guwahati in August this year to review the flood situation and relief work in the North Eastern States.

The Committee would facilitate optimising benefits of appropriate water management in the form of hydro-electric power, agriculture, bio-diversity conservation, reduced flood damage erosion, inland water transport, forestry, fishery and eco-tourism. Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) will serve as the coordinating point. The Committee will submit its report, including Plan of Action, by June, 2018.

During the review of the flood situation with the Chief Ministers of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, the Prime Minister had announced constitution of a High-Level Committee for holistic management of water resources in the NER.  The meeting noted that the optimum management of water resources is a cross-cutting task which requires multi-sectoral interventions and concerted strategy, including management of catchment areas in upper reaches involving concerned Central Ministries and State Governments.

 The Brahmaputra and Barak river systems which account for one-third of India’s run off, are highly prone to floods.  Brahmaputra is one of the largest river systems in the world and causes considerable distress and costs on the region through frequent flooding and erosion.

The terms of reference of the Committee include:

i)    Appraisal of existing mechanism/institutional arrangements for management of water resources of the North Eastern Region.

ii)    Identification of gaps in the existing mechanism/institutional arrangements for optimal management of water resources of the NER.

iii)   Suggest policy interventions required for optimally harnessing the water resources for accelerating development in the NER

iv)    Spelling out of actionable measures required for optimizing the management of water resources in the North-East.

v)   Chalking out a Plan of Action for dovetailing of the schemes/programmes of concerned Union Ministries, their attached offices and autonomous bodies as well as the schemes of the respective North-Eastern State Governments.

The Committee includes Secretaries from the Ministries of Development of North Eastern Region, Department of Border Management, Department of Space, Power, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and National Disaster Management Authority  and Chief Secretaries of all the 8 states in NER as Members.   The Committee may co-opt or invite as special invitees Secretaries of other Ministries / Departments as well as experts who have domain knowledge in the matter.

                A group of students from Arunachal Pradesh called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today.

Addressing the students, Dr Jitendra Singh said that North East is on the priority of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Highlighting various initiatives for the North East India, he said that Government has taken various steps to promote the rail, road and air connectivity in North East. He said that construction of new airport at Itanagar will begin soon. He also said that the second Film and Training Institute of India (FTII) will be set up in Arunachal Pradesh, the first being in Pune, Maharashtra. He also said that region-based road development scheme for NE region namely “North-East Road Sector Development Scheme” (NERSDS) has also been started for maintenance, construction and upgradation of such roads, which remain neglected because of being interconnecting roads between two States as a result of which they remain un-owned and had thus gained the dubious distinction of being described as “orphan roads”.

The Minister said that priority is also being given to promote tourism in the North eastern states. Speaking on the ‘Act East Policy’ of the Government, he said that North East region shares similarity with neighbouring countries in terms of culture, lifestyle and food habits. He said that, keeping this fact in mind, the NE states should focus on manufacturing such products that will find market in these places and promote trade in North eastern states.

Highlighting various youth-centric initiatives taken by the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), the Minister said that foundation stone has been laid for the Barak hostel for students from North East in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in Delhi and a Hostel exclusively for Northeast girl students in Bengaluru. He said that a North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre will soon be set up in Dwarka, New Delhi.

On the occasion, the Arunachal Pradesh youth also gifted Dr Jitendra Singh clay idols made by them on the lines of ‘Make in India’ programme of Government of India. The Minister congratulated the youth for this unique initiative of promoting indigenous manufacturing and promoting ‘Make in India’ flagship programme of the Government which aims at providing employment opportunities to youth of the country. He also appealed to the youth to make efforts in the direction of indigenous manufacturing that will help boost economy and provide them employability.

                The Union Cabinet on 24th October 2017 approved a Rs. 7,002 crore plan for construction of permanent campuses for six new IITs, to be completed by 31st March 2020. Each campus will have facility for housing 1,200 students, beginning from the academic year 2020-2021.

Currently, these institutions are functioning from temporary campuses with a total strength of 1,530 students. After construction of the campuses, this strength will go up to 7,200.

The Hon’ble Finance Minister in his Budget Speech 2014-15 had announced establishment of five new IITs in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir, Goa and Chhattisgarh. Further, in the Budget Speech 2015-16,establishment of an IIT in Karnataka was announced.

In pursuance to the Budget announcements, the academic sessions in IITs at Tirupati and Palakkad started in 2015-16 and in IITs at Dharwad, Bhilai, Jammu and Goa in 2016-17, from their respective temporary campuses.

Background

The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for construction of the permanent campuses was prepared by a team from Mentor Institutes of these IITs, according to which Rs. 20304.88 cr. were solicited for construction of the permanent campuses over a period of 7 years.

After consultation with NITI Aayog, DST, DSIR, MEITY and D/o Expenditure, this proposal was considered by EFC in its meeting held on 17-7-2017. The EFC recommended Phase-A of the proposal at an outlay of Rs. 7002.42 cr. for 3 years beginning 2017-18 as per the below break-up:

                Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shri Satya Pal Singh has said that the new education policy is in final stages and it would be announced in December. Inaugurating a 'National Academic meet' in Thiruvananthapuram today, Dr. Singh said the policy envisages to 'correct' the course of education system in the country, that has followed a colonial mindset. He pointed out that unfortunately after independence, most of the academicians followed the footsteps of British and Western scholars and deliberately denigrating Indian culture. Stating that the biggest challenge being faced by the education system and the government is 'how to de-colonise the Indian mind' and the government is working on the policy in this regard. The Minister said it will be the first education policy that was discussed layer by layer and threadbare. 

Dr. Singh said improving the quality of education from the primary level, making higher education affordable to people and accessing higher education to more are some of the major issues faced by the education system. He said skill development is one of the major areas the government has given thrust upon. 

To prevent the exodus of students to foreign countries seeking education, Dr. Singh said the higher education institutions should be developed to the standard of Centres of International Excellence. He said accessibility to higher education in the country is only 25.6 per cent while in USA 86 per cent Germany 80 and in China 60 per cent. The Minister pointed out that the aim of the government is to improve the higher education system in the country to make available to more students. Stating that higher education is very expensive, Dr. Singh said it has to be made more affordable to all sections in the society. 

Indicating that changes are necessary in the Right to Education Act, Dr. Singh said the Act lacks teeth. The Act provides right to compulsory primary education. But what is the remedy if parents do not send their children to school. So many things have to be done in improving the primary education in the country', he added. 

The meet was organised by Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram as part of the navathi celebration of P Parameswarn, Director of Vichara Kendram.

                Exhorting the children to spread the message of ‘Clean Air’ throughout the nation, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, said that the “Run for Clean Air” campaign is the harbinger of positive energy for Clean Air.  With Deepawali festivities in the air, Dr. Harsh Vardhan told the gathering of students that the scientists have been asked to develop Zero-pollution fire-crackers that do not cause health hazards to children. Flagging off the “Run for Clean Air” campaign along with Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, from India Gate lawns here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the ill-effects of pollution cause the maximum problems for children.  He added that combating pollution and protecting the environment can be effectively done through small steps by each and every citizen of the nation.  The Minister pointed out that when children take a pledge, they ensure that the campaign becomes a success.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan also administered a Pledge to promote Clean Air on the occasion.  

 Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Mahesh Sharma pointed out that Swacchata (cleanliness) has to be a collective endeavour.  He added that the legacy that we leave behind in terms of Clean Air is very important.  The Minister emphasised that Clean Air is crucial for the children of future generations.  

 About 10, 000 children from various schools from Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) were present on the occasion.  The Clean Air Campaign has been launched to create a mass movement to reduce air pollution. Swachh and Swasth Bharat cannot be achieved without Swachh Hawa. The idea behind the Campaign is to entrust a sense of responsibility among people, so that they consider clean air as a collective responsibility.  The campaign organised today by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is an extension of the ‘Harit Diwali-Swasth Diwali Campaign’.  Today’s campaign coincides with the birth anniversary of former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.   Both the Ministers paid tributes to Dr. Kalam on the occasion. 

 Eminent singer, Ms. Durga Jasraj, sang a couple of compositions, including a song on the importance of Clean Air. 

  Environment-friendly slogans on banners dotted the India Gate lawns.  Some of the messages on posters read - “Sab milkar karo virodh, roko Paryavaran ka durupayog” (Everyone must oppose, prevent the misuse of environment), “Saansein rahi hain tham, aao Paryavaran bachayen hum” (Breathing is getting affected, come, let us protect the environment), “Mera Shahar Saaf ho, ismein sab ka haath ho” (Let my city be clean with everyone’s participation), “Hum sab ka ek hi naara, saaf-suthra desh hamara” (All of us have only one slogan - Let our nation be neat and clean)

                The External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj has appealed to people to extend their help in finding the parents of Geeta, a deaf and mute girl, who had returned to India from Pakistan. 

Smt. Sushma Swaraj in her appeal televised today said that whosoever helps in finding the parents of Geeta, he or she will be rewarded with one lakh rupees. She said in her recorded video on ANI released on Twitter @ANI and @DDNewsLive that people especially in the states of Bihar and Jharkhand must come forward to provide information about the Parents of Geeta alias Guddi if they know of someone who lost their girl child some ten or twelve years ago and could be Geeta’s parents. 

She added that probably Geeta belongs to either Bihar or Jharkhand as she has indicated through sign language. 

In her message, EAM Smt. Sushma Swaraj also thanked Edhi Foundation of Pakistan for their support in caring for Geeta while she was in Pakistan. 

Smt. Sushma has also appealed to the media and the people at large to spread this message to the maximum people so that Geeta is able to meet her parents soon.

                The Government of India and the World Bank today signed a $200 million Loan Agreement for the Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project. 

The Project will support the Government of Assam to facilitate agri-business investments, increase agriculture productivity and market access, and enable small farm holders produce crops that are resilient to recurrent floods or droughts in the state. 

The Agreement for the Project was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Mr. Ravi Kota, Principal Secretary, Finance, Government of Assam, on behalf of the Government of Assam; and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Operations Manager, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank. 

After the Agreement, Mr Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that Assam is simplifying several regulatory procedures related to doing business, agricultural marketing, and fisheries amongst others. He said that the project will help the State increase agricultural productivity by strengthening the farming systems, raise private sector investments to promote agri-enterprises which will create better job opportunities for the youth in the State. 

The Project will be implemented in over 16 Districts of Assam. Over 500,000 farming households will directly benefit from the Project. At least 30 percent women are expected to participate in project activities. Specific focus will be given to women-led enterprises and their participation in the decision-making process of farmer producer organizations. 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Hisham Abdo, Operations Manager, World Bank said that the Government of Assam aims to double farm incomes in the State and transform the agricultural sector into a stable source of growth and economic development. He said that this project will serve as the nucleus to fulfill the State’s much larger vision of an agriculture-based rural transformation. 

The focus on geographic clustering of the production base for certain commodities will help agri-enterprises take advantage of existing and future market opportunities that they may not necessarily achieve alone. The cluster approach will allow for combining efforts, making use of synergies, and pooling resources to increase the competitive advantage of these products, while at the same time share the risks involved in introducing improved products or entering previously untapped markets. Successful clusters will also continuously innovate and adapt ‘best practices’ across agricultural value chains. 

Mr. Manivannan Pathy, Senior Agricultural Specialist and World Bank’s Team Leader for the Project said that the value addition and market led production systems supported through the project are expected to play a vital role in enhancing the competitiveness of the agriculture sector. He said that this will be done by facilitating policy reforms, fostering private-public dialogue and catalyzing a wider private sector development in the agribusiness ecosystem of Assam. 

Another key component of the project will be to promote market-led production that can deal with the vagaries of climate change. Assam’s agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to climate variability and the state experiences recurrent floods and droughts. Currently, more than 50 percent of the paddy growing areas are prone to flooding, submergence and drought. A market-led production system will take advantage of the rapidly changing market, introduce crops that are resilient to climate change, increase production and manage risks for farmers. 

The $200 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 7-year grace period, and a maturity of 16.5 years.

The Government is likely to raise Rs. 750 crore through disinvestment of 5% of paid-up equity shares of NLC India Limited (NLCIL) through Offer for Sale (OFS) mechanism. 

The Government approved disinvestment of 3% equity shares of NLCIL as base offer, with an option to retain oversubscription upto additional 2% equity shares. Trading for Non-Retail portion took place yesterday i.e. on 25th October, 2017 at a floor price of Rs. 94. Government accordingly decided to retain the over-subscription by revising the total offer size from 3% to 5% of equity shares. Trading for retail category took place today i.e. on 26th October, 2017. Retail investors were offered discount of 3.5% over cut-off price for non-retail category. The retail portion was subscribed 2.90 times. The cut-off price for retail category was at Rs. 95.80 while for non-retail shares was Rs. 94.60. 

Post-disinvestment, the Government of India’s shareholding in NLC will come down to 84.32%.

Following are the highlights of the presentation made by ministry of finance secretaries at the press conference held today

 

I. INDIA A HAVEN OF MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

 

Strong economic growth

 

·            India grew at a very strong pace of 7.5% p.a. in the three years of 2014-17 with growth exceeding 8% in 2015-16.  There was a temporary slippage in growth in the last two quarters thanks to transitional effect of Demonetisation and GST.  That effect is now over, with all indicators – IIP, Core Sector, Index, automobile, consumer spending etc. pointing out a strong growth pick up, there is expectation of very good growth from second quarter of current year itself.

·            The current global economic outlook is marked by relatively stronger activity in both advanced economies and emerging market & developing economies. Global economic activity is on the course of gradual improvement and the world GDP is projected to grow at the rate of 3.6 per cent and 3.7 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively, after remaining subdued in 2016, when it was 3.2 per cent. Significant improvement in investment, trade, and industrial production, coupled with strengthening business and consumer confidence, are supporting the recovery.  This would also help in growth of exports which is reflected in strong export growth of 25.6% in September 2017 with April-September growth averaging nearly 12%.

 

Inflation has been brought under control

 

·            The decisive steps taken by the Government along with decline in crude prices from its high levels in 2013-14 and benign global prices of tradables helped the economy to get out from inflationary spiral to relatively stable prices. Inflation declined from nearly double digits in 2012-13 and 2013-14 to an average of less than 5 per cent since then. Between July 2016 and July 2017, the inflation rate was close to 2 per cent. Inflation based on CPI is currently within the target of 4 per cent and is expected to be close to 3.5 per cent for the financial year 2017-18. Inflation is currently well within the target of 4 per cent. However, the RBI has projecting it to increase to 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of the current financial year, a little higher than 4 per cent target, but within the range of 4+/-2 per cent.  

·            Headline inflation based on Consumer Price Index (Combined) averaged 4.9 per cent in 2015-16 as compared to 5.9 per cent in 2014-15. CPI inflation for 2016-17 averaged 4.5 per cent. The year-on-year inflation in April-September 2017 was 2.6 per cent as compared to 5.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 



 

External sector indicators have improved significantly despite global sluggishness

 

·         Along with lower inflation, lower level of current account deficit has brought about much of macro-economic stability in the last 3-4 years. Current account deficit was at dangerously high level of over 4 per cent in 2011-12 and 2012-13, leading to a significant instability in the exchange rate of the rupee. With significant improvement in the current account balance as reflected by lower levels of current account deficit, the volatility in the exchange rate also declined considerably.



·         World trade volume (goods and services) growth continued to decelerate in 2016 to 2.2 per cent from 2.8 per cent in 2015 (IMF’s WEO, October 2017). It is projected to pick up with growth of 4.2 per cent in 2017 and 4.0 per cent in 2018.

India’s Merchandise trade

 

·         Exports declined in 2015-16 primarily on account of the sluggish global demand and imports declined due to steep decline in international crude oil prices as well as the decline in the prices of other commodities. During 2016-17, exports grew by 5.2 per cent while imports increased by 0.9 per cent, helping in narrowing the trade deficit. Merchandise exports and imports grew by 11.5 per cent and 25.1 per cent respectively in dollar terms during April-September 2017, resulting in widening of trade deficit from US$ 43.4 billion in April-September 2016 to US$ 73.1 billion in April-September 2017.

·         The current account deficit (CAD) for 2015-16 was 1.1 per cent of GDP as compared to 1.3 per cent of GDP in 2014-15. The CAD further narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 on the back of the contraction in the trade deficit that narrowed to US$ 112.4 billion in 2016-17 from US$ 130.1 billion in 2015-16. However, current account deficit widened to US$ 14.3 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) during Q1 2017-18 from US$ 0.4 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) during Q1 2016-17, mainly on account of higher trade deficit in this period.

 

Robust foreign direct investment

 

The gross FDI flows to India in 2016-17 amounted to US$ 60.2 billion, as compared to US$ 55.6 billion in 2015-16 and US$ 45.1 billion in 2014-15, indicating the improved global confidence on the Indian economy. During April-August 2017, the gross FDI inflow in the economy was US$ 30.4 billion, higher as compared to the inflow of US$ 23.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 

Foreign exchange reserves

 

Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 370 billion at the end of March 2017 as compared to 360.2 billion as at end March, 2016. As on 13th October 2017 the foreign exchange reserves exceeded US$ 400 billion. With increase in reserves in the last couple of years, most reserve-based external sector vulnerability indicators have improved.

 



 

Steady improvement in fiscal situation and fiscal consolidation is on track

 

There has been a steady consolidation of fiscal deficit in the last few years. Fiscal deficit of the central government had reached alarmingly high level of close to 6 per cent 2011-12 and averaged over 5 per cent between 2011-12 and 2013-14. The government is committed to fiscal consolidation path and has shown a steely resolve to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 and further to 3.2 per cent as per the Budget estimates in 2017-18.



Fiscal deficit of the Government of India as a ratio of GDP was 3.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 3.5 per cent for 2016-17 [Revised Estimate] and is budgeted to be 3.2 per cent in 2017-18. Focus on expenditure rationalization with plugging loopholes in public expenditure and innovative revenue raising efforts have helped to achieve this.

 

From the angle of internal and external public debt stock, India does not face serious fiscal solvency related issues. Government of India’s total outstanding liabilities-to-GDP ratio is budgeted to decline from 46.7 per cent by year-end 2016-17(RE) to 44.7 per cent by year-end 2017-18.

 

Tax revenue (net to Centre) is increased by 16.8 per cent in 2016-17 (Provisional Actual) and it is budgeted to grow by 11.3 per cent in 2017-18.

Fiscal deficit during April-August is 96 per cent of the full-year budgeted fiscal deficit on account of front loading of expenditure, but we are reasonably confident that full year budgeted ratio of fiscal deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP will not be breached.

 

II. TRANSFORMATIONAL REFORMS

 

Landmark Reform in the form of GST

 

Subsuming a large number of Central and state indirect taxes, the GST has been a landmark reform that has been implemented with effect from 1st July 2017. The launch of the GST represents an historic economic and political achievement, unprecedented in Indian tax and economic reforms, which has rekindled optimism on structural reforms. This has resulted in unified tax across the country and has helped in removing transport restrictions on the movement of goods resulting in their faster movement and help in creating common market, reduction in corruption and leakage and further help in Make in India programme. It is expected to provide boost to revenues, investment, and medium-term economic growth. Despite the teething troubles that the government and the GST Council are addressing, initial results in the form of revenue raised seem encouraging.

 



 

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

 

Another game changing reform has been The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) that was enacted on May 28, 2016, with an aim to consolidate the laws relating to insolvency of companies and limited liability entities (including limited liability partnerships and other entities with limited liability), unlimited liability partnerships and individuals, presently contained in a number of legislations, into a single legislation. The Code provides a comprehensive, modern and robust insolvency and bankruptcy regime, at par with global standards and even better in some aspects.

 



 

The Government moved at a quick pace to implement the Code. About 2050 applications have been filed before NCLT so far, of which, 112 applications have been admitted and another 146 have been rejected or withdrawn. The default underlying admitted applications range from a few lakh of rupees to a few thousands of crores. The announcement of 12 large defaulters by the RBI will expand this sharply.

 

Crusade against Black Money including demonetization

 

The initiatives like: (a) Special Investigation Team on Black Money, constituted in May, 2014 for monitoring investigations and reviewing the framework for curbing black money; (b) Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, enacted w.e.f. 1st July 2015; (c) the Income Declaration Scheme, 2016; and (d) enactment of the comprehensive Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, w.e.f. 1st November, 2016 had made varying degrees of success in the fight against black money generation and holding. The follow-up to these measures in terms of demonetization of the high denomination notes w.e.f. the expiry of 8th November, 2016 effected a body blow on black money.

 

Housing Development

 

Government has announced various measures in the Budget 2017-18 to promote growth of the economy which, inter alia, include push to infrastructure development by giving infrastructure status to affordable housing, higher allocation to highway construction, focus on coastal connectivity. The other growth promotion measures include: lower income tax for companies with annual turnover up to Rs 50 crore; allowing carry-forward of MAT credit up to a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present; further measures to improve the ease of doing business; and, major push to digital economy. The Budget also targeted to provide higher agricultural credit and to increase employment significantly.

 

Institutional reforms

 

Institutional reforms including expenditure rationalization and progressive elimination of leakages in public delivery through stress on targeting and direct benefit transfer; instituting a profoundly impactful financial inclusion programme; measures to improve policy transparency in governance and decision-making; Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) programme for DISCOMs; liberalization of FDI norms in various sectors; and approval of National Intellectual Property Rights Policy for laying down the future roadmap for intellectual property in India.

 

Improved ease of doing business

 

The complementarities built around the flagship Make-in-India programme, including comprehensive measures for improving the ease of doing business, encouragement to budding entrepreneurial talent under the Start-up India and Stand-up India Initiatives and advertisement and global campaign, have evidently improved India’s global ranking as a business destination. India has launched eBiz platform for creating a business and investor friendly ecosystem by making all business and investment related clearances and compliances available on a 24x7 single portal, with an integrated payment gateway.

 

Radical changes in FDI policy regime; most sectors on automatic route for FDI

 

The Government radically liberalized the FDI regime on 20thJune 2016, with the objective of providing major impetus to employment and job creation.  This is the second major reform after the major changes announced in November 2015. Now most of the sectors would be under automatic approval route, except a small negative list. Changes introduced in the policy include increase in sectoral caps, bringing more activities under automatic route and easing of conditionalities for foreign investment. With these changes, India is now one of the most open economies in the world for FDI.

 

Ambitious Disinvenstment Programme

 

Progressively higher revenues have been raised from disinvestment in public sector undertakings in the last three years and the government has a very ambitious target of raising much higher revenues in the current financial year.

 



Reaching Welfare Programme for poorest families in North-East Corners

 

In order to help the poorest of the poor, and to improve their living conditions, particularly that of women, the government has provided over 3 crore LPG connections between May 2016 and June 2017 which will replace the dirtier traditional fuels that are health hazard. Similarly in order to secure poor people from shocks of man-made and natural disasters, total enrolment under Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Swasthya  Bima Yojana was14 crore persons by September 2017.

 



 

III. INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH

 

Government has consistently increased Public Expenditure on Infrastructure in order to boost employment and provide renewed impetus to economic growth. Government of India’s total expenditure this year has crossed Rs 11.47 lakhs crores (upto Sept ‘17), out of the budgeted expenditure Rs 21.46 lakhs cr. (an increase of Rs. 1.2 lakhs cr. over last year).

 

Special thrust of this drive is on key development sectors including Rural Roads, Housing, Railways, Power, Highways and Digital Infrastructure. The Capex target of Government of India for 2017-18 is Rs. 3.09 lakhs crores, which is 31.28% higher than last year, out of which Rs. 1.46 lakhs crores has been spent on capital works till September 2017. In addition, Government of India had fixed a Capital expenditure target for CPSEs for 2017-18 at Rs 3.85 lakhs crores, out which capex spending of Rs 1.37 lakhs crores has been achieved by CPSEs till Sept’17.

 

Railways

 

·         A target of Rs.1,31,000 crore has been made for Capital Expenditure for the Railways. Against the target, an expenditure of Rs.50,762 crore has been achieved. The main thrust is on upgrading the infrastructure to improve safety, laying of new lines and providing passenger amenities.

·         The following are the key among the capital works completed : New Lines (Construction) (Rs.4531.93 cr), Gauge Conversion (Rs.1842.24 cr), EBR-Partnerships (Rs.11504.29 cr), Track Doubling (Rs.4069.60 cr), Traffic Facilities (Rs.517.05 cr), Rolling Stock (Rs.8214.11 cr), Leased Assets-Principal Component (Rs.7781.97 cr), Road Over/Under Bridges (Rs.1068.09 cr), Track Renewals (Rs.2837.72 cr), Electrification Projects (Rs.1119.17 cr), Passenger Amenities (Rs.539.73 cr), Investment in JV/SPVs (Rs.1263.52 cr), Metropolitan Transport Projects (Rs.446.16 cr), etc.

 

Saubhagya (Pradhan Mantri  Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana)

 

·         Under this program, Universal Electrification is being taken up to provide last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in the country by Mar ’19. This is an addition to the ongoing Scheme of Rural Electrification (Deen Dayal Upadhay Gram Jyoti Yojana).

·         Outlay proposed is Rs.16,320 crores, involving GoI support of Rs.12319.50 crores

 

Rural roads – PM Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)

 

·         In order to complete Phase-I and II of PMGSY, Government of India, along with States, proposes to spend Rs. 88,185 crores over 3 years starting 2017-18. This will result in construction of 1,09,302 km of rural roads covering 36,434 habitations.

·         In addition, roads worth Rs 11,725 crores, involving 5411 km of upgradation of existing roads and construction of new roads in 44 LWE districts, will be completed by 2019-20.

·         Universal Affordable Housing for All is being implemented and accelerated to give a big boost to the construction sector. Under PMAY (Urban), 1.2 crore units will be built with an outlay of 1,85,069 crores over next 3 years. Under PMAY (Gramin), 1.02 crore units will be built (51 lakhs units this year) with an outlay of Rs. 126,795 crores by Centre and States by March ’19.

 

Bharatmala Pariyojana

 

·         Taking forward it’s commitment to providing more efficient transportation, Government has debottlenecked the Roads sector and significantly stepped up the Highway development and road building program. In order to further optimise the efficiency of movement of goods and people across the country, Government is launching a new Umbrella program. This Road Building Program, for 83,677 km of roads involving capex of Rs.6.92 lakhs crores over next 5 years.

·         Out of this, Bharatmala Pariyojana to be implemented with an outlay of Rs.5,35,000 crores will generate 14.2 crores mandays of jobs.

·         The following categories of roads (34,800 km) have been proposed under BMP

This will be financed by providing Rs. 0.97 lakhs crores from CRF and Rs. 0.59 lakhs crores as Gross Budgetary support.

·         ToT Monetisation: For the first time ever, monetisation of 82 operating highways under a low risk Toll – Operate- Maintain-Transfer (ToT) Model has been initiated with a private investment potential of Rs 34,000 cr. The 1st bundle of 9 NH stretches of 680.64 Km has been put out to tender by NHAI with potential monetization value of Rs. 6258 cr.

 

Given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy and the continued public spending at substantially enhanced levels in comparison to previous years, Government has taken several steps to improve the investment climate in the country. The comprehensive economic reforms undertaken by the government have resulted in unprecedented levels of foreign direct investment in the last 3 years. However, the domestic investment of the private sector continued to be affected by the growing contamination of loans advanced in the past, which have now become unsustainable. Besides affecting the general investment climate these non-performing loans have also necessitated an unprecedented levels of provisioning, particularly in the public sector Banks. This in turn has affected their lending capabilities that has particularly affected the Medium and the Small scale sector. It may be seen that while many corporates have accessed the bond market in the recent past, it is the MSMEs that have been deprived of capital due to the inability of the Banks that are weighed down by the excessive burden of very demanding provisioning norms. This called for effective steps for creating a conducive environment in which PSBs could provide loans to the private sector, especially the Medium & Small Scale industries.

 

IV. RECAPITALIZATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS

 

 

·         Government Commits to Unprecedented Strengthening of Public Sector Banks

·         Rs. 2,11,000 Crore Front-loaded Bank Recapitalisation to Clean Up Legacy of NPAs

·         Credit Growth to Take-off through Recapitalised Banks

·         Banks to Give Big Push to MSMEs for Jobs and Growth

 

Government has decided to take a massive step to capitalise PSBs in a front-loaded manner, with a view to support credit growth and job creation. This entails mobilization of capital, with maximum allocation in the current year, to the tune of about Rs. 2,11,000 crore over the next two years, through budgetary provisions of Rs. 18,139 crore, recapitalisation bonds to the tune of Rs. 1,35,000 crore, and the balance through raising of capital by banks from the market while diluting government equity (estimated potential Rs. 58,000 crore).

 

Government actions are not limited to addressing capitalisation of PSBs. Definite steps will be taken alongside capitalisation to enable them to play a major role in the financial system. PSBs having 70% market share in the banking space will be geared for greater growth and to contribute through enhanced credit off-take.  The stage has been set with a ‘MUDRA Protsahan’ campaign across the country.

 

There will be a strong push on enabling growth of MSMEs through enhanced access to financing and markets, and a drive to finance MSMEs in 50 clusters. While Ministries concerned will spearhead and provide momentum, banks will undertake speedy processing of loan applications in a hassle-free manner. Fintech companies will be roped in to cut down the appraisal process and generate quality loan applications. MSMEs will be handheld by extending support through:

 

ü  Compulsory TReDS (Trade Receivables electronic Discount System) registration by major PSUs within next 90 days, for shortening the cash cycle

ü  Sector-specific Mudra financial products, such as Mudra Leather, Mudra Textiles, etc.

ü  100 bank-approved MSME project templates for speedier credit

ü  Revamped udyamimitra.in portal, so that banks compete for financing MSME projects

ü  Drive for registering MSMEs on the GeM (Government electronic Marketplace) portal and e-commerce platforms

 


	
		
			
			It may be recalled that aggressive loaning to sectors with excess capacity and poor due diligence created large stressed assets, which grew to 11.9% by March 2014.

			 

			Asset Quality Review (AQR) carried out in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of NPAs. Expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were reclassified as NPAs and provided for. PSBs initiated cleaning up by recognising NPAs and provided for expected losses.

			 
			
			
			
			
		
	


Gross NPAs in PSBs rose rapidly from 2015, from 5.43% (Rs. 2,78,466 crore) in March 2015 to 13.69% (Rs. 7,33,137 crore) as of June 2017. Provisioning for expected losses grew substantially. From 2014-15  to  2017-18 Q1, Rs. 3,79,080 crore provisioning was made, whereas during the preceding ten years total provisioning was Rs. 1,96,937 crore only. This was the right approach to dealing with expected losses on account of stressed loans.

Indradhanush Plan for recapitalising and revamping PSBs was announced by the Government on 14.8.2015. Government envisaged capital need of Rs. 1,80,000 crore till 2018-19. Accordingly, Government made provision   of  Rs.  70,000   crore   and projected market-raising of capital by banks to the tune of Rs. 1,10,000 crore. So far, Government has infused capital of Rs. 51,858 crore in PSBs.  PSBs, under stress due to AQR and NPA recognition, have so far been able to raise Rs. 21,261 crore from the market. The launch of Indradhanush before the sharing of AQR findings by RBI with PSBs in December 2015 enabled PSBs to successfully remain Basel III compliant despite high NPA and consequential provisioning requirement identified through AQR. The present decision further builds upon Indradhanush.

 

Government also undertook several legislative changes to facilitate recovery and resolution of stressed assets. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was enacted as a unified framework for resolving insolvency and bankruptcy matters. The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) and the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (which governs Debt Recovery Tribunals) were amended in 2016 to facilitate faster recovery. Further, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 was amended this year to enable Government to authorize RBI to direct banks to initiate the insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

 

These bold steps taken over the last three years not only addressed legacy issues but gave a strong impetus to reforms aimed at rebuilding the strength of PSBs. The process of building stronger, bigger banks has begun with the consolidation of State Bank of India and the announced recapitalisation will give it greater impetus. A differentiated approach will be followed for this, based on the strengths of each PSB.

 

The unprecedented recapitalisation and the initiatives announced today are expected to have a noticeable impact in the near-term, contributing to accelerated economic activity, employment and growth of the economy.

 

V. STRONGER ECONOMIC GROWTH AHEAD

 

The real growth of the economy as measured by the GDP growth showed a steady improvement when it averaged 7.5 per cent between 2014-15 and 2016-17 vis-à-vis 5.9 per cent in the previous two years. Although there has been some reduction in the growth in the last few quarters, one expects it to be a temporary blip and going by the available indicators the downslide seems to have bottomed out and can expect the GDP growth to start rising again.

 

As per the 4thAdvance Estimates of production of food-grains released by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare for 2016-17, the production of total food-grains is expected to be 275.7 million tonnes, 9.6 per cent higher as compared to last year’s total food-grains production of 251.6 million tonnes. As per the 1st Advance Estimates for 2017-18, the foodgrains output for Kharif season is likely to be 134.67 million tonnes as against 138.52 million tonnes as per the 4thAdvance Estimates of 2016-17.

 

Despite subdued global economic condition and resulting lower levels of demand for India’s exports demand, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew by 4.6 per cent during 2016-17 as compared to a growth of 3.3 per cent in 2015-16 (as per the revised IIP series. During April-August 2017 the general IIP growth was 2.2 per cent as compared to a growth of 5.9 per cent in the same period of previous year. During August 2017, the IIP registered a growth of 4.3 per cent, significantly higher than the growth of (-) 0.2 per cent in June and 0.9 per cent in July 2017. The sales of passenger vehicles registered a growth of 11.3 per cent for September 2017 and 9.2 per cent for April-September. Similarly, the sales of commercial vehicles increased by 25.3 per cent in September 2017 and 6 per cent for April-September 2017.

 



 

As per IMF’s assessment in October 2017, India’s growth is expected to be at 6.7 per cent in 2017 and 7.4 per cent in 2018. IMF has also projected that India’s growth would increase to 8.2 per cent by 2022. China’s growth in 2016 was 6.7 per cent and is expected to be at 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively.  We expect strong growth rebound in the quarters and years ahead – may be better than even IMF’s projections.

                Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India and the Government of United Arab Emirates (UAE) to mobilise long term investment into National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), the first investment agreement between NIIF Master Fund and a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) has been signed today. The investment from ADIA Group would be 1 billion USD.

As a part of the agreement, ADIA will become the first institutional investor in NIIF’s Master Fund and a shareholder in the NIIF’s investment management Company.

Six domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) viz. HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Limited, HDFC Asset Management Company Limited, Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited, ICICI Bank Limited, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited, Axis Bank Limited will also be joining the NIIF Master Fund alongwith ADIA apart from Government of India.

Commenting on the development, Secretary Economic Affairs, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, said: ""This is a significant milestone in operationalisation of NIIF. This Agreement paves the way for creating significant economic impact through investment in commercially viable infrastructure development projects "".

The NIIF was created, after a decision by the Union Cabinet on 29.7.2015 and was envisaged to be established as one or more Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) under the SEBI Regulations. The proposed corpus of NIIF is Rs. 40,000 Crores (around USD 6 Billion). GOI’s contribution to the NIIF shall be 49% of the total commitment at any given point of time. NIIF has been mandated to solicit equity participation from strategic anchor partners, like overseas sovereign/quasi-sovereign/multilateral/bilateral investors.

Two companies viz. NIIFTL, the trustee of the fund and NIIFL, the investment management company were incorporated in 2015. A Governing Council has been set up under the chairmanship of the union Finance Minister Shri Arun  Jaitley to act as an advisory council to NIIF.

A few investors viz. Government of UAE, RUSNANO, QIA, RDIF and Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development (JOIN) have signed MoUs with the NIIF. In addition, DEA has signed terms for cooperation on the NIIF with the US Treasury and the UK Treasury. An India-UK Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF) has been announced in April 2017. The fund shall be set up under the fund of funds vertical of NIIF, and shall have anchor commitments of GBP 120 million each from Government of India (through NIIF) and Government of UK.

                Atal Pension Yojana currently has over 69 lacs subscribers with contribution of Rs. 2690.00 crores. Chairman, PFRDA Shri Hemant G Contractor however emphasised the need of increasing the pension coverage in India at a recently concluded conference on Atal Pension Yojana. The conference organised by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) in the national capital saw participation from all major banks, representatives from NPCI, SCHIL, SIDBI, Access Assist and some major MFIs.

A large section of the society still does not have access to pensions and this is a cause of concern for PFRDA and Government, Shri Contactor said. Congratulating the winners of the contest organised by PFRDA the Chairman said that APY has made progress in covering the intended subscribers but much remains to be done. He mentioned that on an average, a little less than 2% of the eligible population is covered under APY and hence a lot has to be done to provide people a regular access to old age income. He also touched upon the issues of persistence in the APY accounts and asserted that the objective of the scheme is to provide pension and this will only happen if the contribution in the account has been regularly paid. He urged the APY Service Providers to educate the subscribers on the importance of the same. He also urged upon the APY Service Providers i.e Banks and Post Offices under Department of Post to achieve the targets allocated by government by putting in their best efforts.

A video message of Shri Rajiv Kumar, Secretary DFS was played during the occasion. Shri Rajiv Kumar mentioned that Atal Pension Yojana is flagship program of the Government of India under financial inclusion and financial security. The pension coverage in this country is at around 12% and banks and other stakeholder need to work towards greater coverage under the scheme. He also said that DFS is monitoring the progress under the scheme and targets allocated under the scheme to banks should be accomplished. He touched upon the subject of providing a digital platform for APY by PFRDA i.e e-APY. Secretary Shri Rajiv Kumar congratulated the banks on their performance under the campaigns and urged them to continue the work.

While the government has a pension scheme for the BPL persons but the amount is meagre and is not sufficient for old age needs. 9% of the population of India, i.e 110 million people are over 60 years and by 2030 this figure is expected to cross 180 million. The 60 plus age groups is the fastest growing demographic in the country. With increase in longevity of the people, disintegration of the joint family system in India and inflation, there is greater need for old age than ever before. Currently pension benefits are available India basically to the organised sector. Atal Pension Yojana introduced in 2015 by Government of India provides a self- contributory savings pension scheme with guaranteed pension of Rs. 1,000/- to Rs. 5,000/- with a very low contribution by the subscriber. All banks and Department of Post have pushed the product to the interiors of the country. APY has option for increasing the pension amount from Rs. 1000/- to any other amount up to Rs. 5000/- as per the savings capacity of the subscriber, and further allows the spouse to continue the account in the event of the death of the subscriber before the age of sixty years. PFRDA has also been engaging with various State Governments for providing co-contribution under the scheme. With the introduction of e-APY through Aadhaar, the banks will be able to effectively utilise the digital platform for greater coverage.

                Urges the Fund to diligently explore steps to achieve consensus on the Review of Quotas

Emphasises need for bringing finality to Shareholding Review by the 2018 Spring meetings

 

      The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley today participated in the IMFC Restricted Breakfast session in Washington D.C. The discussion sessions focussed on the Dialogue on Policy Challenges. While observing that the World Economic Outlook for this year and the next was reassuring,  Sh Jaitley took note of the caution advised for the medium term. He appreciated the focus on cyber security in the Early Warning Exercise and emphasized that the entire global financial system is vulnerable to this threat, more so because it is so interconnected. In this regard, the Finance Minister highlighted three policy challenges. The first was the risks posed to emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) by the US Federal Reserve’s bold steps towards restoring normal monetary conditions. The second was the global slowdown in Investments and the third was employment.

While discussing these challenges, the Finance Minister stated that he would urge the international community to make a fair and unbiased assessment of the macro-prudential and capital flow management measures available to and used by countries to manage short-term capital volatility. Besides, finding ways to revive investment is critical to sustaining global growth and collective and co-ordinated action needed to be explored in this regard. He also observed that India is currently one of the few large economies in the world in the virtuous phase of its demographic transition and the most important priority of the government was to find ways to provide employment to the 12 million young people entering the workforce annually.

Sh Arun Jaitley also attended the IMFC Plenary Session focusing on the institutional issues. The Union Finance Minister highlighted the big structural reform initiatives taken by India – Goods and Services Tax (GST), Demonetization and Insolvency and Bankruptcy code. He also underlined that short term adverse impact of both GST and demonetization measures are mostly overcome and the recent data in manufacturing sector indicate that India’s growth story is soon getting back to its normal course. He also mentioned about substantial reduction in both high value cash notes as well as cash as such in the economy thanks to demonetization. Sh Jaitley expressed his mixed feelings at the apparent lack of progress in converging to a consensus on the Review of Quotas. To achieve such an outcome, he urged the Fund – the Board, the Management and the Staff – to diligently explore the space offered by the three objectives laid out in the IMFC Communiqué in October 2016: reduce misalignments, shift quota shares in favour of dynamic emerging economies and protect the shares of low income countries and small states.

The Union Finance Minister Sh Arun Jaitley also attended the 96th Meeting of the Development Committee Plenary of the World Bank. The items on the agenda included the World Development Report 2018, Maximising Finance for Development, Progress Report to Governors on Shareholding and Forward Look Implementation Update.

Shri Arun Jaitley stated that during this financial year, India consolidated its steady growth through systemic reforms that enabled significant progress in formalizing the economy, building macroeconomic fundamentals, creation of digital economy and financial inclusion. The newly rolled out Goods and Services Tax was a transformative reform that has unified 1.3 billion people into one single market.

The Finance Minister strongly urged for bringing finality to the Shareholding Review by the Spring meeting 2018 in a spirit of consultation and co-operation. Drawing attention to the downward trend in lending to MICs, he urged the Shareholders of World Bank Group not to forget the pockets of poverty in LMICs, where concessional finance continues to be indispensable. Sh Jaitley also expressed that resources required for achieving the twin goals, Climate targets and SDGs by 2030 were substantial and that the World Bank must, to quote the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, act with Speed, Skill and Scale. Finance Minister thus called for quick consensus for capitalizing the Bank and IFC to meet legitimate expectations of development financing for these institutions.

During his other engagements in the day, Shri Arun Jaitley also held bilateral meetings with the Finance Ministers of UK and Sri Lanka. The discussions covered a wide spectrum of bilateral collaboration to strengthen the cross-country relationships.

On the sidelines, Secretary (EA) Shri S C Garg also held meetings with Mr Bowman, DG, International at HM Treasury, UK and discussed areas of mutual collaboration, issues being faced by Investment and projects being undertaken by respective countries and commonality of their positions in various multilateral fora. Besides this, Secretary (EA) also held meetings with President of IFAD, Chairperson of ICBC; Chief Representative of JBIC; CFO of World Bank; CEO of IFC; Vice-president ADB and Director of Euro-money Conference.

The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley was in Washington DC to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He was  accompanied by Mr. Urjit Patel, Governor, RBI; Secretary Economic Affairs, Shri S.C. Garg; and other officials.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley today participated in the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting in Washington D.C. The discussion focused on the agenda items pertaining to Global Economy and Framework for Growth, Compact with Africa and International Financial Architecture. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley is presently on a one week visit to USA mainly to participate in Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF among others.

As co-chairs of G20 Framework Working Group (FWG), India made the lead intervention during the Second Round of the Session on ‘’Global Economy and Framework for Growth’, which discussed the IMF’s G-20 Report on ‘Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth(SSBG)’. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley stated that the Report was a useful starting point for studying present challenges facing the global economy and in formulating G-20 response towards addressing these challenges. The Finance Minister observed that it is important to understand the global spill-overs of domestic policy actions of individual member countries especially on matters related to trade and financial regulation and suggested that the subsequent versions of the IMF SSBG Report can consider examining the possible analytical tools that can be used for examining policy spill-overs. However, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley noted that for this to be possible, a more detailed understanding of the underlying methodologies must be provided to members. In addition, clear descriptions of the policy scenario in each country, the availability of policy space, key challenges and recommended actions may also be shared. This would allow for improved identification of challenges which are relevant to all members, as well as policies that can be undertaken in a coordinated manner.

The G-20 Session on Compact with Africa discussed the update received on the progress on Compact with Africa and work of the Africa Advisory Group. The Session on International Financial Architecture (IFA) discussed issues related to monitoring capital flows, strengthening global financial safety nets and enhancing the capacity of MDB’s for mobilizing finance for infrastructure investment.

The Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jiatley is currently on a one week official tour to Washington D.C. to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He is accompanied by Dr. Urjit Patel, Governor, RBI; Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg and other officials.

                To reduce the cascading of taxes arising on account of non-inclusion of petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas and crude oil in GST and to incentivise investments in the E&P (exploration and production) sector and downstream sector, the GST Council in its 22nd meeting held on 6thOctober, 2017 has made the following recommendations for GST rate structure for Specified Goods and Services:

i. Offshore works contract services and associated services relating to oil and gas exploration and production in the offshore areas beyond 12 nautical miles shall attract GST of 12%;

ii. Transportation of natural gas through pipeline will attract GST of 5% without input tax credits (ITC) or 12% with full ITC;

iii. Import of rigs and ancillary goods imported under lease will be exempted from IGST, subject to payment of appropriate IGST on the supply/import of such lease service and fulfilment of other specified conditions.

Further, GST rate on bunker fuel is being reduced to 5%, both for foreign going vessels and coastal vessels.

Notifications to give effect to the above proposals will be issued shortly.

                Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) organised a conference on National Pension System (NPS) for Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) at the India Habitat Centre (IHC), New Delhi with the objective of informing CPSEs benefits and features of NPS and of addressing their queries on NPS. Based on the recommendation of the 3rd Pay Revision Committee, the Department of PSE notified dispensing with the condition of minimum 15 years of service and superannuation from CPSEs to avail the pension benefit implemented by CPSEs. Separately, the Government has also amended the Income Tax Act providing for tax free migration of superannuation funds to NPS. This provision will facilitate the CPSEs to implement NPS for their employees. The total employee strength in CPSEs stood at 12.91 lakh (excluding contract workers) in 2014-15. The Conference saw an active participation of more than 55 CPSEs with around 150 participants.

In his Inaugural Address, Dr. Badri S. Bhandari, Whole Time Member, PFRDA welcomed the participants and expressed the endeavor of PFRDA to expand NPS across all the sectors in the country in affordable and sustainable manner. He explained the benefits of NPS and communicated the returns generated by Pension Funds since inception, which has been over 10% since inception. As on 30th September, 2017, there were 1.78 crore subscribers and Rs.2.06 lakh crore of AUM under NPS. The growth in subscribers and the asset under management jump stood at 27% and 47%, respectively.

Shri Hemant G. Contractor, Chairman, PFRDA, delivered the Keynote Address on the origin of NPS. The need for fiscal sustainability led to the shift from defined benefit model to defined contribution model of pension scheme and this shift has necessitated empowering subscribers with financial literacy as they have a better understanding of where and how their funds are invested. He advised that NPS provides choices to subscribers in the matter of choosing their fund manager, investment pattern etc. Individuals can now subscribe to NPS upto the age of 65 years and can defer the purchase of annuity to three more years post retirement and defer lump-sum withdrawal in phased manner over a period of 10 years.

Shri Sanjay Gupta, CMD, Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd emphasized on the need of starting early and avail the compounding benefit on investments to have old age income security. He appreciated the various investment options available to the subscribers under NPS.

The event was graced by the eminent panellist- Shri Anand Singh Bhal, (Adviser, Department of Public Enterprises), Shri Kumar Shardindu, (MD & CEO, SBI Pension Funds Pvt. Ltd) and Shri Rambir Dalal, (Director, BSR & Co LLP). The discussion brought to fore the imminent need of financial literacy to enable the subscribers reap the benefits of choices of investment products and digitization to deepen the reach. Factors like rising longevity, disintegrating joint families and rising aspirations necessitate investment in pension schemes for old age security.

The conference also hosted presentations on features and benefits of NPS, on system capabilities and operational processes for implementation of NPS, and on the NPS implementation in NALCO. Presently, 5 CPSEs have joined NPS- National Aluminium Company Limited, Konkan Railway Corporation Limited, India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, National Handloom Development Corporation Ltd, REC Ltd and ITPO.

                Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has embarked upon several digital friendly steps for extension of the benefits of APY to the citizens of India. PFRDA has developed the process to offer APY enrolment through eNPS platform for wider reach. Under this channel a complete end to end digital environment for subscription is enabled without submission of physical form at the convenience of the customer without visiting bank or post office.

So far APY is available for subscription through Banks, BCs and through internet banking. Now, APY is available on eNPS platform and any eligible Indian citizen can enroll through the APY@eNPS channel by visiting www.enps.nsdl.com. The customers of the Bank can visit eNPS portal and submit Aadhaar/ Bank Name and Savings Bank Account Number to join the scheme. The benefits of APY@eNPS are:

• Paperless registration

• No need for visiting Bank Branch.

• Online enrollment can be made 24*7 at the customer's convenience.

• No Need for having internet banking Id.

Punjab National Bank is the first Bank to operationalize APY@eNPS and quite a few other banks are expected to launch this platform shortly offering Aadhaar enabled APY enrollment.

Any person in the age group of 18 to 40 years with a savings bank account and Aadhaar can register for APY by providing the minimum information in the APY@eNPS portal as rest of the information will be auto populated from the respective bank. This new feature not only makes it easy for the subscriber to join the APY but also reduces the workload for the Banks/Postal Branch which are implementing the APY.

                The last date for filing GSTR-1 for the month of July, 2017 is 10th October, 2017. An extension of two months has already been given. There will be no further extension given to taxpayers for filing their GSTR-1 return for July. Taxpayers who have not yet filed their GSTR-1 for July are advised to do so immediately. 

Once a taxpayer files GSTR-1 by 10th October, the corresponding entries in GSTR-2A of his buyer shall get auto populated. The buyer shall finalize his GSTR-2 after making modifications (additions, corrections or deletions), if required, in GSTR-2A. The Input Tax Credit (ITC) shall be availed by the buyer based on his GSTR-2. If a taxpayer does not file GSTR-1 by 10th of October, then his buyer may face difficulty in availing ITC of the tax paid on his supplies. It is therefore advised that all suppliers of goods or services, especially B2B suppliers, furnish their outward supply details in GSTR-1 by the due date so that no difficulty is faced by their buyers in availing ITC and the return cycle can be completed in due course.

The GST Council, in its 22nd Meeting which was held today in the national capital under Chairmanship of the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley has recommended the following facilitative changes to ease the burden of compliance on small and medium businesses:

 Composition Scheme

1.      The composition scheme shall be made available to taxpayers having annual aggregate turnover of up to Rs. 1 crore as compared to the current turnover threshold of Rs. 75 lacs. This threshold of turnover for special category States, except Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand, shall be increased to Rs. 75 lacs from Rs. 50 lacs. The turnover threshold for Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand shall be Rs. 1 crore. The facility of availing composition under the increased threshold shall be available to both migrated and new taxpayers up to 31.03.2018. The option once exercised shall become operational from the first day of the month immediately succeeding the month in which the option to avail the composition scheme is exercised. New entrants to this scheme shall have to file the return in FORM GSTR-4 only for that portion of the quarter from when the scheme becomes operational and shall file returns as a normal taxpayer for the preceding tax period. The increase in the turnover threshold will make it possible for greater number of taxpayers to avail the benefit of easier compliance under the composition scheme and is expected to greatly benefit the MSME sector.

 

2.      Persons who are otherwise eligible for composition scheme but are providing any exempt service (such as extending deposits to banks for which interest is being received) were being considered ineligible for the said scheme. It has been decided that such persons who are otherwise eligible for availing the composition scheme and are providing any exempt service, shall be eligible for the composition scheme.

  3.      A Group of Ministers (GoM) shall be constituted to examine measures to make the composition scheme more attractive.

 Relief for Small and Medium Enterprises

4.      Presently, anyone making inter-state taxable supplies, except inter-State job worker, is compulsorily required to register, irrespective of turnover.  It has now been decided to exempt those service providers whose annual aggregate turnover is less than Rs. 20 lacs (Rs. 10 lacs in special category states except J & K) from obtaining registration even if they are making inter-State taxable supplies of services. This measure is expected to significantly reduce the compliance cost of small service providers.

5.      To facilitate the ease of payment and return filing for small and medium businesses with annual aggregate turnover up to Rs. 1.5 crores, it has been decided that such taxpayers shall be required to file quarterly returns in FORM GSTR-1,2 & 3 and pay taxes only on a quarterly basis, starting from the Third Quarter of this Financial Year i.e. October-December, 2017. The registered buyers from such small taxpayers would be eligible to avail ITC on a monthly basis. The due dates for filing the quarterly returns for such taxpayers shall be announced in due course. Meanwhile, all taxpayers will be required to file FORM GSTR-3B on a monthly basis till December, 2017. All taxpayers are also required to file FORM GSTR-1, 2 & 3 for the months of July, August and September, 2017. Due dates for filing the returns for the month of July, 2017 have already been announced. The due dates for the months of August and September, 2017 will be announced in due course.

6.      The reverse charge mechanism under sub-section (4) of section 9 of the CGST Act, 2017 and under sub-section (4) of section 5 of the IGST Act, 2017 shall be suspended till 31.03.2018 and will be reviewed by a committee of experts. This will benefit small businesses and substantially reduce compliance costs.

7.      The requirement to pay GST on advances received is also proving to be burdensome for small dealers and manufacturers. In order to mitigate their inconvenience on this account, it has been decided that taxpayers having annual aggregate turnover up to Rs. 1.5 crores shall not be required to pay GST at the time of receipt of advances on account of supply of goods. The GST on such supplies shall be payable only when the supply of goods is made.

8.      It has come to light that Goods Transport Agencies (GTAs) are not willing to provide services to unregistered persons. In order to remove the hardship being faced by small unregistered businesses on this account, the services provided by a GTA to an unregistered person shall be exempted from GST.

Other Facilitation Measures

9.      After assessing the readiness of the trade, industry and Government departments, it has been decided that registration and operationalization of TDS/TCS provisions shall be postponed till 31.03.2018.

10.  The e-way bill system shall be introduced in a staggered manner with effect from 01.01.2018 and shall be rolled out nationwide with effect from 01.04.2018. This is in order to give trade and industry more time to acclimatize itself with the GST regime. 

11.  The last date for filing the return in FORM GSTR-4 by a taxpayer under composition scheme for the quarter July-September, 2017 shall be extended to 15.11.2017. Also, the last date for filing the return in FORM GSTR-6 by an input service distributor for the months of July, August and September, 2017 shall be extended to 15.11.2017.

12.  Invoice Rules are being modified to provide relief to certain classes of registered persons.

            The GST Council under Chairmanship of Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley has in its 22nd Meeting held at Delhi today approved a major relief package for exporters.

Mindful of the difficulties faced by exporters post-GST leading to a decline in export performance and export competitiveness, the Council had last month set up a high power Committee on Exports under Revenue Secretary Shri Hasmukh Adhia to recommend suitable strategies for helping this sector. This Committee had five senior Government functionaries from the Centre and an equal number from the States as members.

After wide ranging discussions with major Export Promotion Councils including FIEO, AEPC, GJEPC, EEPC, CLE, CHEMEXIL, PARMAEXCIL and Handicrafts EPC etc. and interacting with all stakeholders the Committee presented its recommendations to the Council today.

The Council identified the major difficulties constraining the export sector are on account of delays in refunds of IGST and input taxes on exports and working capital blockage as exporters have to upfront pay GST on inputs and capital goods for export production or for procuring goods for export. Another difficulty was that the duty credit scrips such as MEIS was losing value due to its reduced usability as it could no longer be used to pay IGST / GST.

The Council was unanimous that it is in the national interest to take all possible measures to support the exporting community, which earns valuable foreign exchange and provides significant employment especially in the small and medium sector. Accordingly, the Council approved the following package of relief and incentives for exporters with immediate affect:–

a.       Within the next 4 days i.e. by 10.10.2017 the held-up refund of IGST paid on goods exported outside India in July would begin to be paid. The August backlog would get cleared from 18.10.2017 and refunds for subsequent months would be handled expeditiously. Other refunds of IGST paid on supplies to SEZs and of inputs taxes on exports under Bond/LUT, shall be processed from 18.10.2017 onwards. For this, the Council agreed to suitably empower Central and State GST officers so that exporters get refunds from one authority only. Related matters of settlement of funds are being resolved.        

b.       To prevent cash blockage of exporters due to upfront payment of GST on inputs etc. the Council approved two proposals, one for immediate relief and the other for providing long term support to exporters. Immediate relief is being given by extending the Advance Authorization (AA) / Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) / 100% EOU schemes to sourcing inputs etc. from abroad as well as domestic suppliers. Holders of AA / EPCG and EOUs would not have to pay IGST, Cess etc. on imports. Also, domestic supplies to holders of AA / EPCG and EOUs would be treated as deemed exports under Section 147 of CGST/SGST Act and refund of tax paid on such supplies given to the supplier.

c.       Merchant exporters will now have to pay nominal GST of 0.1% for procuring goods from domestic suppliers for export. The details would be released soon.

d.      The permanent solution to cash blockage is that of ""e-Wallet"" which would be credited with a notional amount as if it is an advance refund. This credit would be used to pay IGST, GST etc. The details of this facility would be worked out soon. The Council desired that the “e-Wallet” solution should be made operational w.e.f. 1st April 2018.

e.       Exporters have been exempted from furnishing Bond and Bank Guarantee when they clear goods for export.

f.       Specified banks and Public Sector Units (PSUs) are being allowed to import Gold without payment of IGST. This can then be supplied to exporters as per a scheme similar to Advance Authorization.

g.       To restore the lost incentive on sale of duty credit scrips, the GST on sale-purchase of these scrips is being reduced from 5% to 0%.

h.       GST on bunker fuel is being reduced to 5% for both coastal vessels and foreign going vessels. This will boost coastal shipping. It will also improve India's competitiveness. 

The Council is confident that these measures would provide immediate relief to the export sector and enhance export competitiveness of India. The Council also decided to continue to monitor the situation closely so that going forward all required support continues to be extended to this important sector.

                Government of India and European Investment Bank (EIB) today signed the Finance Contract for lending of € 300 million for Bangalore Metro Rail Project Phase II Line R6. The agreement was signed by Shri S. Selvakumar, Joint Secretary (BC), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. Andrew McDowell, Vice President, EIB, on behalf of the EIB.

Bangalore Metro Rail Project Phase II is to be jointly financed by the European Investment Bank (€500 million) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (€300 million). The first tranche of Euro 300mn was signed today. The project envisages extension of East-West & North-South lines for Bangalore Metro Rail which includes a total length of 72.095 km (13.79 km underground) and 61 stations with 12 underground stations. The project implementation period is 5 years from date of commencement of the Project.

The objective of the project is to bring in a quantum improvement in the transportation sector in the city in tandem with the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and other modes of urban transport. The project aims to ensure modern transport facility for the commuters. The spinoffs of the project would include employment opportunities, benefits to the economy, reduction of number of vehicles on road, less fuel consumption, reduction in air pollution, reduction in passenger travel time and also improvement in the aesthetic value of the city.

The Government has taken note of the decision of the RBI Monetary Policy Committee to keep the policy rate and policy stance unchanged. 

Following is the text of statement issued by Ministry of Finance in response to RBI unveiling its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement today. 

“We have noted that this decision has been made by the MPC in light of the underlying analysis which implies: (i) a downward revision of the real GVA growth forecast for 2017-18 from 7.3 percent to 6.7 percent, which leads to a widening of the output gap; and (ii) a marginally upward revision of the CPI inflation forecast for the second half of the year meaning an average inflation for the year 2017-18 as a whole of less than 4 percent. 

Government welcomes the institution building initiatives, including : finalising the Peer to Peer NBFC financing regulations which would improve financing for smaller firms; 

and increasing retail participation in government securities via aggregation of bids by stock exchanges.”

                The Government of India has decided to reduce the Basic Excise Duty rate on Petrol and Diesel [both branded and unbranded] by Rs. 2 per litre with effect from 4th October, 2017. This decision has been taken by the Government in order to cushion the impact of rising international prices of crude petroleum oil and petrol and diesel on Retail Sale Prices of Petrol and Diesel as well as to protect the interest of common man. 

The Revenue loss on account of these reductions in excise duty is about Rs. 26,000 crore in a full year, and about Rs. 13000 crore during the remaining part of the current financial year. 

Earlier due to the increase in the international prices of Petrol and Diesel, during the last few weeks, the Retail Selling Prices (RSP) of Petrol and Diesel at Delhi have risen to Rs. 70.83/litre and Rs. 59.07/litre respectively, as on 2nd October 2017. This rise in the prices of Petrol and Diesel is also reflected in WPI inflation, which has increased to 3.24% for the month of August 2017, as compared to 1.88% for the month of July 2017.This also prompted the Government to act swiftly in this regard.

                The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley said that as far as GST is concerned, we have space for improvement eventually once we become revenue neutral to think in terms of bigger reforms such as lesser slabs, but for that we have to become revenue neutral plus. To ensure this, the Finance Minister said that we have to certainly ensure larger presence. He said that there are no grey areas in implementation of tax laws. The Finance Minister said that the taxes which are payable have to be paid and which are not payable, then the same are not to be paid. He asked the young officers that in case of doubt, move straight. 

The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley was delivering the Valedictory Address at the NACIN Founding Day and Passing-out Ceremony of the 67th Batch of IRS (C&CE) at NACIN in Faridabad, Haryana today. 

The Finance Minister told the Officers that they will get the option of choosing the path of working with dignity, self-respect and honesty from the very beginning of their career. The peer group is the best to judge the performance of an officer, the Minister concluded. 

National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes and Narcotics (NACIN) celebrated its Founding Day today i.e. on Sunday, 1st October at NACIN Complex, Faridabad for the First time. It started as a Training School in 1955 on 1st October. The Founding Day Ceremony was presided by the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley.

The 2015 batch of Indian Revenue Service (IRS,C&CE) which has passed-out from the Academy after completing their professional training consisted of 147 officer trainees including 32 women officers. These young officers will be at the helm of administering the GST, India’s biggest tax reform since independence. 

During the passing-out ceremony, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley awarded medals to the five officer trainees who have excelled in different areas of training for their exceptional achievement. Young officer Dr. Farah Zachariah was awarded with the Finance Minister’s gold medal for being the overall best officer trainee.

                Union Minister of Food Processing Industries, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal chaired the Curtain Raiser Press Conference held here today for the World Food India 2017 expo, a vibrant three-day business platform scheduled from 3rd-5th November, 2017 in New Delhi. As India gets ready to host its biggest food event aiming to transform the food economy and double farmers’ income, Smt. Badal gave a glimpse of the grandeur and the immensity of the event to industry leaders, heads of foreign missions and media in an interactive session. Minister of State for Food Processing Industries, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti also graced the occasion with her presence.

 Outlining her vision for World Food India 2017, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, “India is the second largest producer of food, leader in milk, fruits & vegetables, cereals and marine. It has a huge potential with 127 agro climatic zones and proximity to food importing nations. With a 1.3 billion population, and a retail sector that is set to treble by 2020, it offers a large demand driven market.” She affirmed that the Government of India is creating the right infrastructure - with schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana, an enabling environment and an innovation culture to foster strategic partnerships in the food processing industry to create an advantage to all the stakeholders. World Food India 2017 provides that platform for global partnerships to achieve the said goal.

 Thanking Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi for his vision and leadership, Smt Badal said the government is making all efforts to ensure food safety and security across the country. The Minister added that the event which will showcase the best infrastructure and technology from various countries will also help find effective solution to the challenges facing the food industry in India, ranging from food wastage to wastage of crops due to extreme climatic conditions. This, Smt Badal added will help in minimizing the challenges faced by the farmers of the country due to the environment factors and lack of direct contact with the market.

 Smt. Badal also said that the potential of India in the food processing industry will be realized during this event. With World Food India 2017, the Minister said, India is poised to attract an investment target of roughly US$ 10 billion in food processing sector, which will generate 1 million jobs in the next 3 years. She added that the World Food India platform will reinvigorate India’s position as a ‘Global Food Factory’ and a ‘Global Sourcing Hub’.

 Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, elaborating on the efforts taken to organize this grand event, expressed confidence in India’s food sector and the opportunity that it presents to the world. She added that this event would give recognition to India in the Food Processing sector globally and would reduce food wastage, increase food security and aid in generating employment as it would attract youth towards the sector.

 Shri JP Meena Secretary, Ministry of Food Processing Industries said this event will be one of the 1stInternational Mega Events to attract investment & trading in the Food Processing Sector in India. The event will showcase an exhibition and include special sessions, conferences and networking opportunities for the participants. More than 800 global & domestic exhibitors will be a part of the exhibition that will have a separate organic pavilion apart from special sections on cold chain, sectors. Another highlight is the section for Women Entrepreneurs in the food processing industry.

 In a nutshell, the World Food India 2017 gears up to host over 2,000 participants, over 200 companies from 30 countries, 18 ministerial and business delegations, nearly 50 global CEOs along with CEOs of all leading domestic food processing companies, and representatives of 28 States in India, Shri Meena added.

 Germany, Japan and Denmark are Partner Countries to World Food India whereas Italy & Netherlands are Focus Countries. They were represented by H.E Mr Kenji Hiramatsu, Ambassador of Japan to India; H.E Mr Peter Taksøe-Jensen, Ambassador of Denmark to India; H.E Mr Alphonsus Stoelinga, Ambassador of Netherlands to India; H.E. Lorenzo Angeloni, Ambassador of Italy to India who expressed keenness to deepen their investment commitment to India, to enable mutual exchange of best practices, technology and to be a part of the revolution in the food processing industry which will take place in India.

 CEOs and senior executives of leading Indian and global food chains including ITC, Walmart, Nestle, Kelloggs and Metro Cash & Carry India etc. present at the Curtain Raiser reinforced their commitment to wholeheartedly participate at the event and making it a success. It was unanimously observed that with one-sixth of World’s population and a vast pool of resources, India shoulders the responsibility to become the Global Food Value Chain Hub and the private industry players have an important part to play in this endeavor.

 Referring to the softer aspects of food, Smt. Badal remarked, “With World Food India, we are inviting the World to come and refresh their experiences of Indian food, spices, ingredients and cuisines.” Curated by Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, the ‘Food Street’ is set to be World food India’s most attractive highlight.  A brainchild of Smt. Badal, Food Street is an experiential platform that will bring together culinary practices, flavours, fragrances from the world's cuisines, and celebrate India's rich cultural heritage and diverse uniqueness of its produce to create contemporary renditions and fusion food. Addressing the event, Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, the brand ambassador and curator of Food Street said the secrets of the rich traditional Indian cuisines will be showcased during the event. This event will project India as the land of ‘Chhat-ras’ or the six flavours found in our cultural heritage, he added.

 The Curtain raiser session coincided with the celebration of World Food Day, wherein Smt. Badal pledged to wage a war against food wastage with #NoWasteOnMyPlate campaign. The campaign lends itself to the strategic intervention that World Food India 2017 will provide in achieving two most critical goals of the Government - doubling farmers’ income by 2022 and reducing post-harvest losses by bringing together global and Indian leaders to collaborate and co-develop solutions across India’s food value chain.

 The event is supported by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Development of North East Region, Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Civil Aviation.

                Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare released a comprehensive report on “Large Scale Food Fortification in India – The Journey So Far and Road Ahead” at the national ‘Conclave on Nutrition Security: Partnership & Convergence’ organized by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) on the occasion of World Food Day, here today. Shri Choubey also launched the food fortification website at the function. Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, MoFPD and Secretary, MoHFW (Designate) and Smt. Vijaya Srivastava, Special Secretary and FA (MoHFW), were also present at the function. 

Delivering the keynote address, Shri Choubey stated that it is not enough that the food is available but the food should be nutritious as well. He emphasized on the need to raise awareness about nutrition rich food and cautioned people against food adulteration. 

At the function, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India introduced its new initiative ‘Indian Food Recovery Alliance (IFRA)’ – A coalition of food recovery partners in country to fight the issue of hunger and also prevent food loss and food wastage in India. 

The food recovery partners showcased their existing models of food recovery and showcased an integrated web-based platform that is being developed. This web based platform, released on a pilot level, allows interested donors, individuals and volunteers to register themselves to be a part of this initiative. The donors will be able to track all the data, information and the status of the food they donate through their personal logins. This platform will also provide guidance to citizens, food businesses and various food recovery agencies on prevention of food loss and food waste, and safe recovery of surplus food. 

During the conclave, FSSAI also discussed & reviewed the progress on food fortification so far, shared the experiences and key leanings and convened various stakeholders to discuss the way forward. Directives have been issued from the key Central Ministries and dynamic State government like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and UT Chandigarh have set up cross ministerial working groups. Development partners have pledged support with resources. 

Through creating a network of networks from entities across sectors in India and leveraging the power of technology, FSSAI’s aim is to create an ease of communication among all the stakeholders so that everybody can take a step closer towards reducing food wastage in a uniform direction. With respect to fortification, the next phase involves wide consumer outreach to build awareness and sensitise people to the need for fortification. 

Also present at the function were Shri Ashish Bahuguna, Chairperson, FSSAI, Shri Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI, along with other senior officers of the Ministry and representatives of development partners and civil society organizations.

""Let no child suffer from any vaccine-preventable disease"". This was stated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi as he launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) at Vadnagar in Gujarat, today. Through this programme, Government of India aims to reach each and every child under two years of age and all those pregnant women who have been left uncovered under the routine immunisation programme. The special drive will focus on improving immunization coverage in select districts and cities to ensure full immunization to more than 90% by December 2018. The achievement of full immunisation under Mission Indradhanush to at least 90% coverage was to be achieved by 2020 earlier. With the launch of IMI, achievement of the target has now been advanced. 

Shri Vijaybhai Rupani, Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Smt. Anandiben Patel, Ex-Chief Minister of Gujarat, Nitin Bhai Patel, Dy Chief Minister of Gujarat and Shankarbhai Chaudhary, Minister of State, Gujarat Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education, Environment and Urban Development were also present at the launch function along with other dignitaries. 

Speaking on the occasion to a packed audience, Shri Narendra Modi stated that the Government has made immunization a people's and a social movement. The Prime Minister made a strong appeal to all those present in the audience and the country men and women to own the programme in order to make all efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality. 

The Prime Minister also highlighted other achievements of the Government including the new National Health Policy 2017 which has been unveiled after fifteen years, and is people-centered. “Regulating of the prices of stents has immensely helped a large section of the country by reducing the cost of healthcare on the middle income group and poor families”, Shri Narendra Modi added. The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction at the success of the Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan where private doctors have volunteered to provide free ANC services to pregnant women on the 9th of every month along with government doctors. 

Speaking at the function, Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, said that the unwavering support of the Prime Minister has always been a source of great inspiration. He added that improving the health status of the children of the country is amongst the top priorities of the Government. Shri Nadda informed that the four phases of Mission Indradhanush have reached to more than 2.53 crore children and 68 lakh pregnant women with life-saving vaccines including 5.21 lakh children & 1.27 lakh pregnant women in Gujarat. Through this mission, we have accelerated our progress towards our target of 90% full immunization coverage, he stated. Earlier the increase in full immunization coverage was 1% per year which has increased to 6.7% per year through the first two phases of ‘Mission Indradhanush’. 

With a sharpened focus on high priority districts and urban areas, under IMI, four consecutive immunization rounds will be conducted for 7 days in 173 districts -- 121 districts and 17 cities in 16 states and 52 districts in 8 north eastern states -- every month between October 2017 and January 2018. Intensified Mission Indradhanush will cover low performing areas in the selected districts and urban areas. These areas have been selected through triangulation of data available under national surveys, Health Management Information System data and World Health Organization concurrent monitoring data. Special attention will be given to unserved/low coverage pockets in sub-centre and urban slums with migratory population. The focus is also on the urban settlements and cities identified under National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). 

Intensified Mission Indradhanush will have inter-ministerial and inter-departmental coordination, action-based review mechanism and intensified monitoring and accountability framework for effective implementation of targeted rapid interventions to improve the routine immunization coverage. IMI is supported by 11 other ministries and departments, such as Ministry of Women and Child Development, Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Youth Affairs among others. The convergence of ground level workers of various departments like ASHA, ANMs, Anganwadi workers, Zila preraks under National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), self-help groups will be ensured for better coordination and effective implementation of the programme. 

Intensified Mission Indradhanush would be closely monitored at the district, state and central level at regular intervals. Further, it would be reviewed by the Cabinet Secretary at the National level and will continue to be monitored at the highest level under a special initiative ‘Proactive Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI)’. 

This Intensified Mission is driven based on the information received from gap assessment, supervision through government, concurrent monitoring by partners, and end-line surveys. Under IMI, special strategies are devised for rigorous monitoring of the programme. States and districts have developed coverage improvement plans based on gap self-assessment. These plans are reviewed from state to central level with an aim to reach 90% coverage by December 2018. 

An appreciation and awards mechanism is also conceived to recognize the districts reaching more than 90% coverage. The criteria includes best practices and media management during crisis. To acknowledge the contribution of the partners/Civil Society Organization (CSOs) and others, Certificate of Appreciation will be given. 

At the function, the Prime Minister also dedicated the GMERS Medical College, Vadnagar to the nation and launched the Innovative Mobile Phone Technology for Community Health Operation (ImTeCHO) for improving coverage of community based maternal, neonatal and infant health services to reduce neonatal and infant mortality in Gujarat by empowering health staff through use of innovative mobile phone application. GMERS Medical College serves nearly 400-500 outdoor patients and 80-100 indoor patients daily.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has been adjudged as the best department for its contribution during Swachhta Pakhwada, an inter-Ministry initiative of Swachh Bharat Mission of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The Health Ministry observed the Swachhta Pakhwada from 1st February, 2017 to 15th February, 2017. The award was presented to the Ministry on 2nd October, 2017, the third anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission. Shri C K Mishra, Secretary (HFW) received the award on behalf of the Ministry.

Swachhta Pakhwada activities were organized and observed within the Ministry offices, in Central Government Hospitals and in public health facilities of the states across 36 States/UTs. More pertinently, in addition to the envisaged activities, some of the key contributions include mass awareness generation initiatives through rallies, street plays, painting competitions etc., leveraging the participation and support of public representatives, NGOs, school children and the community. These activities are considered critical for sustaining the swachhta movement.

During the Swacchta fortnight, all hospital/clinics were also directed to install waste bins for segregating waste and massive cleaning drives were undertaken in all the hospital wards and hospital premises. Doctors, nurses and medical staff along with patients and visitors carried out sensitization drives on the importance of safe sanitation and hygiene.

The Swachhta Pakhwada culminated with inspection and special sanitation drive undertaken by the Minister for Health and Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda on 15th February 2017. The Minister along with the staff of the Ministry participated in cleaning of corridors of Nirman Bhawan and inspected various rooms and areas of the Ministry. Unwanted and old files and records were also weeded out during Swachhta Pakhwada from various Divisions of the Ministry.

Swachhta Pakhwada started in April 2016 with the objective of bringing a fortnight of intense focus on the issues and practices of Swachhta by engaging GOI Ministries/Departments in their jurisdictions. An annual calendar is pre-circulated among the Ministries to help them plan for the Pakhwada activities. The Ministries observing Swachhta Pakhwada are monitored closely using online monitoring system of Swachhta Samiksha where action plans, images, videos related to Swachhta activities are uploaded and shared. For the Pakhwada fortnight, observing ministries are considered as Swachhta Ministries and are expected to bring qualitative Swachhta improvements in their jurisdictions.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today asked the young police officers to brace themselves up for terrorist threats emerging from the cyber world. Addressing the Passing Out Parade of IPS Probationers at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) in Hyderabad, Shri Rajnath Singh said the world is today grappling with the menace of terrorism and extremism; internet is being used by organisations like the ISIS to spread hate. We are not untouched by this menace, he added. 

The Union Home Minister, however, expressed satisfaction, saying our Intelligence and Security Agencies have been successful in countering these sinister designs. Central Government is all committed to strengthen the security structure of the country. He said we know that State Police Forces need Central Government help to tackle the present problems and all that might arise in future. We need to work towards Modernisation of Police Forces. Keeping this in mind our Government last month approved a Rs.25,000 crores package for Police Modernization, he added. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said we will have to find a permanent solution for problems like terrorism and extremism. We are working towards that direction. In next five years we have to eliminate extremism, terrorism and communalism from the nation, he added. 

Paying rich tributes to Sardar Patel, Shri Rajnath Singh said the National Police Academy (NPA) reminds us of Sardar Patel's love for the country and his commitment and dedication towards nation building. The foundation of national integration that Sardar Patel laid after Independence will continue to inspire us. Political Map of today's India is the result of Sardar Patel's effort. Sardar Patel was the architect of All-India Services which was meant to ensure integrity and unity of India; Indian Police Service is an integral part of it. All India Services not only provided a unified administrative structure but also helped in keeping the unity and integrity of India intact. Tomorrow is Sardar Patel's Birth Anniversary. Let us bow to the leader who was the main force behind unified India, he added. 

Encouraging the young Police Officers, the Union Home Minister said the police should not be a brute force but it should be a civilised force. As young police officials you all can be role models for youth. And I believe that your hard work will play a major role in this. 

Addressing the newly inducted IPS Officers, Shri Rajnath Singh said that in the initial years of your career, you all will work closely with the public. You will find that people have great expectation from police officials. The police service will provide you an ocean of opportunities. You will have to maintain professional and intellectual integrity while serving for the country. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that the people will come to you not for sympathy but empathy. You should maintain good conduct and behaviour during your service. To meet these expectations will be a challenge as well as a responsibility and opportunity too. Positive attitude and decisiveness will also play an important role in your working. While taking a decision, officials should always ask this question whether it is in favour of justice or not. I have seen that the officials possessing these qualities are respected by politicians and all sections of society. Honesty and Integrity should be most important for all of you. Never compromise with it. Hard work, positive attitude, honesty and justice along with right decision making are the four attributes that I want to dedicate to you. These qualities help you in building your reputation and this is your biggest capital, he added. 

The Union Home Minister said India is ambitious but its aspirations have a strong cultural base. Shri Rajnath Singh said we all are contributing in making of the New India and you all have to be very important part of it. 

Shri Rajnath Singh also announced the grant of Rs.5 Crore for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy Welfare Fund from the Home Ministry Welfare Fund. On the occasion, the Union Home Minister inaugurated the new Library Complex of the NPA and took salute of an immaculately turned out Parade. He also presented trophies and medals. 

Congratulating the medal winners, Shri Rajnath Singh said the biggest medal which you all can win will be the appreciation of your colleagues and the public. 

136 Officer Trainees including five each from Bhutan and Nepal and four from Maldives completed 45 weeks of basic training at the NPA. The batch comprised of 22 Women Officers. Director, SVPNPA, Ms. D. R. Doley Barman, Executive Director, Nepal Police Academy, Additional Inspector General of Police Shri Devendra Subedi, Col. Rinzin Dorji of Royal Bhutan Police and Shri Ali Sujau, ACP of Maldivian Police Force and Senior and Retired Police Officers were present.

                The Ministry of Home Affairs has liberalised the Arms Rules to boost “Make in India” manufacturing policy of the Government as also to promote employment generation in the field of manufacturing of arms and ammunition.

The liberalisation of the Arms Rules will encourage investment in the manufacturing of arms and ammunition and weapon systems as part of the “Make in India” programme. The liberalised rules are expected to encourage the manufacturing activity and facilitate availability of world class weapons to meet the requirement of Armed Forces and Police Forces in sync with country’s defence indigenization programme. The liberalised rules will apply to licences granted by MHA for small arms & ammunition and licences granted by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), under powers delegated to them, for tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, defence aircrafts, space crafts, warships of all kinds, arms and ammunition and allied items of defence equipment other than small arms.

The salient features of the liberalised rules are:

(i)         The licence granted for manufacturing shall now be valid for the life-time of the licensee company. The requirement of renewal of the license after every 5 years has been done away with.

(ii)        Similarly, condition that the small arms and light weapons produced by manufacturer shall be sold to the Central Government or the State Governments with the prior approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs has been done away with.

(iii)       Further, enhancement of capacity up to 15% of the quantity approved under licence will not require any further approval by the Government. The manufacturer will be required to give only prior intimation to the licensing authority in this regard.

(iv)       The licence fee has been reduced significantly. Earlier the licence fee was Rs. 500/- per firearm which added up to very large sums and was a deterrent to seeking manufacturing licenses. The licence fee will now range from Rs. 5,000/- to the maximum of Rs. 50,000/-.

(v)        The fee for manufacturing licence shall be payable at the time of grant of license rather than at the time of application.

(vi)       Single manufacturing licence will be allowed for a multi-unit facility within the same State or in different States within the country. 

A notification for the Arms (Amendment) Rules, 2017 has been issued by MHA on October 27, 2017.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh attended the 56th Raising Day Parade of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) at 39th Bn, ITBP, Lakhnawali Camp, Surajpur, Greater Noida today. The Minister of State for Culture (I/C) and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, DG, ITBP Shri R K Pachnanda and senior officers were also present on the occasion. Shri Rajnath Singh took the salute and inspected the Raising Day Parade. Led by Mahila contingent, Commando, Skiing, Mountaineering, Anti-Naxal Operation, paratroopers, mounted column, and different frontier contingents, the parade showcased all aspects of the Force. Recently inducted Snow Scooters, different types of All Terrain Vehicles and high end SUVs, Pol Net etc were included in the march past for the first time. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Home Minister said that the ITBP jawans have made supreme sacrifices while protecting the border in difficult circumstances at altitudes ranging from 9,000 feet to 18,000 feet. He said that ITBP not only protects Indo-China Border, but also plays responsible role in country’s internal security. The ITBP jawans are deployed in North East and Left Wing Extremism affected areas also, he added. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that he has himself visited the BoPs at Indo-China Border and seen how the ITBP jawans perform their dutiues in difficult situations and low temperatures of -40 degree Celsius and scarcity of oxygen. He said that he has recently visited the BoPs of Rimkhim, Mana and Lapthal in Uttarakhand and experienced the lives of ITBP jawans deployed there. He further said that the Ministry for Home Affairs has received a proposal for 50 new BoPs and it will be considered. 

The Home Minister said that a ‘model BoP’ is being made at Ladakh with the purpose to maintain a uniform 20 degree Celsius temperature inside the BoP. After this, the model BoPs will be replicated in other parts also, he added. Speaking on the difficulties faced by ITBP personnel in snow bound areas, he said that the facility of snow scooters is being given to the jawans in these areas for patrolling and this facility will be given in other areas also. Shri Rajnath Singh said that the upgradation work has also started in 35 BoPs. 

Speaking on the connectivity issues in these areas and the costs involved, he said that on the occasion of Diwali, the soldiers were given a gift in this regard and the call charges of Rs.6.50/- per minute have been reduced to Re.1/- per minute. He also said that the soldiers posted above the height of 11,000 feet are provided with Light Weight Special Clothing. In this regard, he said that same will soon be implemented for the soldiers posted above 9,000 feet and mountaineering equipment will also be provided to them. He also appreciated DG, ITBP for making the recruitment process in ITBP transparent. The Home Minister also said that Chinese language training will be imparted to the soldiers posted on China border during their basic training. 

Shri Rajnath Singh appealed to the officers to adopt family of one martyr each and take their responsibility. He said that ‘Bharat Ke Veer’ portal has been launched to help the families of martyrs and an effort is being made to provide financial assistance of a minimum of Rupees one crore to the family of the martyr. He also said out of this fund, help should also be provided to the soldiers who have suffered disability in line of duty. 

On this occasion, 06 personnel were conferred with President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service while 26 personnel were conferred with Police Medal for Meritorious Service. 

In the special medal category for serving animals of the Force, Horse ‘Black Beauty’ from Basic Training Centre, Bhanu and Dog ‘Machhli’, from 29th Battalion deployed in Anti-Naxal Operations in Chhattisgarh were conferred with Best Horse and Best Canine Medals by the Home Minister. 38th Battalion was adjudged as ‘Best non-border Battalion’ whereas 1st Battalion as ‘Overall Best Battalion’ for the year 2017 and presented with trophies. 

Different demonstrations were presented after the Parade. Demonstration by ‘Janbaaz’ motor cyclists and Silent Drill with weapons by Mahila personnel were introduced for the first time by the ITBP. Demonstration on Yoga and House Clearing Drill were also included in the demonstrations. 

Raised in 1962, the ITBP guards 3488 KMs long borders in the Himalayas on the BOPs at altitudes ranging from 9K to 18.7 K ft. Apart from border guarding, the Force is also deployed for Anti-Naxal Operations and other Internal Security duties.

                The Police Commemoration Day is observed on October 21st every year. The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh will attend the Police Commemoration Day Parade at the Police Memorial Ground here tomorrow. On the occasion, he will also lay wreath and pay homage at the Police Memorial.

The day commemorates the sacrifices of ten policemen while defending our borders with China in 1959. Indian Police personnel were responsible for manning the 2,500 mile long border of India with Tibet until the autumn of 1959.

On October 20, 1959, three reconnaissance parties were launched from Hot Springs in North Eastern Ladakh in preparation for further movement of an Indian expedition which was on its way to Lanak La. While members of two parties returned to Hot Springs by the afternoon of that day, the third one comprising of two Police Constables and a Porter did not return. All available personnel were mobilized early next morning in search of the missing personnel. A party of about 20 Police personnel led by Shri Karam Singh, DCIO proceeded ahead on horseback, while other followed on foot in three Sections.

At about mid day, Chinese Army personnel were seen on a hillock who opened fire and threw grenades at the party led by Shri Karam Singh. Since there was no cover, most personnel were injured. Ten of our brave Police Personnel attained martyrdom and seven others sustained injuries. The seven injured were taken prisoners by the Chinese while the remaining managed to escape. Bodies of the ten personnel were returned by the Chinese only on November 13, 1959, a full three weeks after the incident. These bodies were cremated with full Police honours at Hot Springs.

The Annual Conference of Inspectors General of Police of States and Union Territories held in January 1960 decided that October 21 would henceforth be observed as ‘Commemoration Day’ in all Police Lines throughout India to mark the memory of these gallant personnel who were killed in Ladakh and all other Police personnel killed on duty during the year. It was also decided to erect a memorial at Hot Springs and, every year, members of Police Forces from different parts of the country trek to Hot Springs to pay homage to those gallant martyrs. Since the year 2012, the Police Commemoration Day Parade is being held at the National level at the Police Memorial, Chanakyapuri.

So far since Independence, 34,418 Police personnel have sacrificed their lives for safeguarding the integrity of the nation and providing security to people of this country. During the last one year, from September 2016 to August 2017, 383 Police personnel have laid down their lives.

He said natural disasters know no manmade boundaries and hence countries will have to come together at global and regional levels. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s 10-point agenda on DRR could be the focal point to take us forward, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh said India has pioneered the use of space applications and imaging in DRR and we have been able to reduce the loss of lives considerably. He said the Prime Minister himself personally micro-managed rescue and relief efforts during the 2014 Kashmir floods and also monitored the flood rescue and relief efforts in Assam, Bihar and Gujarat this year.

Dr Jitendra Singh said such exercise provides a platform for sharing the best practices, methodology and response mechanism amongst the BIMSTEC member nations in the field of Disaster Management. He appreciated the commendable role played by NDRF as a lead Agency in conducting this First BIMSTEC DMEx- 2017 successfully. He emphasized the need of better coordination, cooperation and sharing of best practices for effective disaster management in the region. Forums like this are opportunities to share and learn from each other’s experience, he added.

Shri Sanjay Kumar, Director General NDRF quoted that during the informal consultations at the BIMSTEC Leaders’ Retreat held in Goa (India) on October 16, 2016, the leaders agreed to undertake BIMSTEC Annual Disaster Management Exercise. Further, during BIMSTEC senior officials’ meeting in Kathmandu (Nepal) on Feb 7, 2017, India offered to host the first BIMSTEC Annual Disaster Management Exercise. Accordingly, the concept of first BIMSTEC DMEx was conceived and NDRF was entrusted to plan and conduct this first exercise as a lead agency. DG, NDRF thanked all the delegates and their team members for their active participation in the exercise & hoped that this Exercise would go a long way in formulating an effective disaster response mechanism among the BIMSTEC member nations. Further he added that it is very reassuring to be a witness to the progress made by all the countries in the region towards disaster preparedness in general and disaster response, in particular.

Referring to the Supreme Court’s recent judgment recognizing the right to privacy as a human right, Justice Misra said that the range of human rights has been expanding. The NHRC and State Human Rights Commissions should seek the courts’ intervention if on an issue of human rights violation the public authorities do not comply with their recommendations. He said that mutual respect for each other’s rights should be valued. 

Earlier, addressing the gathering, Chairperson, NHRC, Mr. Justice H. L. Dattu said that by adopting human rights as a way of life, a fundamental change can be brought about to eradicate the scourge of poverty, ignorance, prejudices and discrimination based on sex, caste, religion, disability and other forms in society. 

Justice Dattu highlighted various activities of the Commission and the new initiatives taken as part of its consistent endeavour to make people aware and engage them towards promotion and protection of human rights. In this context, apart from other activities of the Commission, he also highlighted the NHRC’s Short Film Award Scheme which has generated tremendous response. Justice Dattu also said that in order to strengthen human rights protection mechanism, the Commission has further streamlined the complaint management system and expanded the scope of its activities to maximize its outreach. 

Earlier Mr. Ambuj Sharma, Secretary General, NHRC in his welcome address said the Commission has been relentlessly making efforts to create an enabling environment for the promotion and protection of various human rights including socio-political, economic and culture rights, through its broad-based mandate. 

On the occasion Justice Misra also gave away awards to the winners of Essay and Painting Competitions on themes related to human rights.

                On the initiative of the Government of India, the first ""Bay of Bengal Initiative For Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Corporation, Disaster Management Exercise (BIMSTEC DMEx)”-2017 is being organized in New Delhi and NCR region from October 10-13, 2017. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is the nodal agency for conducting this Exercise with the support of Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Today a Joint Field Training Exercise on Earthquake Disaster (Collapsed Structure Search & Rescue) was conducted at NTH Complex, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad with the active participation of all seven member nations of BIMSTEC- Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal. Delegates/Rescue Teams from all seven nations have participated with great zeal in this training exercise.

For the purpose of giving it the actual feel of disaster (Exercise), a Custom Check Post, Reception & Departure Centre (RDC), Multi Nation Coordination Centre, On-Site Operation Coordination Centre (OSOCC), Command Post, Communication Centre, Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), Community Centre, Base Medical Station & Rehabilitation Centre were properly established by NDRF as per the International Search & Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines for familiarization & exercise purpose at NTH Complex, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad. In the beginning, functioning & response mechanism of all Centres including International Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) mechanism & Coordination Structure were briefed to all the delegates and participating teams by NDRF officials. To familiarise the delegates with the various state-of-the-art equipment, an exhibition on disaster response equipment was also held at the NTH Complex, Ghaziabad with the active participation of the Private Firms.

As per the scenario painted, it was presumed that thousands of buildings collapsed after an impact of earthquake (magnitude on Richter Scale 7.8) in National Capital Region (NCR) and Northern part of the country. Large number of people were expected to be trapped under debris of the collapsed structure. Retrieval of injured from collapsed house was a mammoth task for the responders and the Central Government agencies. Considering the huge impact of the disaster, BIMSTEC member countries offered assistance to the Government of India which was accepted.

Rescue Teams of all BIMSTEC nations promptly responded as per their assigned role and demonstrated quick response, CSSR skills/professional capabilities with the help of hi-tech equipment to extricate trapped victims from debris of the collapsed structures. Trained canines were also used for tracing the trapped victims. Various state-of-the-art disaster management gadgets and tools were also effectively utilized by the rescue teams to trace out the trapped victims from the debris.

Joint Field Training Exercise was conducted under the overall supervision of Shri Sanjay Kumar, Director General, NDRF and was witnessed by representatives from Senior Officers of MHA, MEA, NDMA, NDRF, Army, State representatives & other senior dignitaries.

A summing up session was held at NTH Complex, Kamla Neharu Nagar, Ghaziabad to get feedback from the participating delegates. All the delegates appreciated the efforts of Govt. of India and BIMSTEC Secretariat. The delegates were impressed by the efforts of NDRF in hosting this mega event.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the four-day first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation Disaster Management Exercise (BIMSTEC DMEx-2017) here today. The Exercise is being conducted by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) as the lead agency from October 10-13, 2017 in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). At the 17th BIMSTEC Senior Officials Meeting held in Kathmandu, Nepal on February 7, 2017, it was decided that India would organize the first annual Disaster Management Exercise for the region.

Addressing on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh extended warm greetings to all delegates from BIMSTEC nations that have come together to participate in this joint exercise. He said that their presence for this exercise represents their governments’ commitment to regional co-operation in the area of disaster risk management.

Expressing concern over the disasters, the Home Minister said, in the recent monsoon season, floods and landslides have affected millions of people across almost all the BIMSTEC countries. This is yet another reminder of the importance of improving our disaster preparedness, he emphasised. Shri Rajnath Singh said that over the period 1996 to 2015, the BIMSTEC countries have lost 317,000 lives to disasters. In these disasters more than 16 million people in BIMSTEC countries have lost their homes and economic losses are also high and escalating, he further added. He said, in terms of number of extreme weather events – floods, droughts, heat waves and cyclones – the future is not going to be any better and the frequency and intensity of such events is likely to rise in view of the climate change. However, if we make our communities, our towns and villages, and our economic activities resilient, we can reduce the losses, the Home Minister said. He said that the improved disaster preparedness is a corner stone of this effort and in this direction, all the BIMSTEC nations have made significant progress over the last two decades. Highlighting the progress of various nations, he said that the cyclone preparedness programme of Bangladesh is recognized as a global best practice and the last mile connectivity of Tsunami early warning system in Thailand has significantly improved preparedness in coastal areas.

Speaking on India’s efforts in this direction, Shri Rajnath Singh said that we are making concerted efforts to reduce preventable deaths and other losses and are also analyzing the patterns of disaster mortality and taking focused steps. He said that India’s effective handling of Phailin and Hudhud in the recent past is the direct outcome of over a decade of policy initiatives and enhancement of early warning capabilities, advance preparation, training and capacity development.

He expressed hope that over next few days besides focusing on joint exercise, delegations will have opportunity to share their country’s experience. He said that success of this joint exercise will depend on not only the work that will be done over next few days but also follow-up work after the exercise.

The Home Minister said that over a period of time we need to use exercises to develop a pool of BIMSTEC disaster responders spread across all participating nations. These building blocks will ensure that when need arises, we can mobilise an effective response and help each other in a timely manner. He expressed sincere belief that BIMSTEC nations need to join hands to mitigate disasters since they face problem of floods on a regular basis.

Shri Rajnath Singh said if the BIMSTEC member states start sharing the hydrological data of transnational rivers with downstream countries, it will certainly help the nations in risk reduction and better disaster preparedness. We need to build a consensus on regular sharing of hydrological data of transnational rivers, he emphasised.

Shri Rajnath Singh reiterated India’s commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with other BIMSTEC nations in achieving its common goals in reducing disaster losses and explore all possible avenues of collaboration. He said that India has established the Tsunami early Warning System for the Indian Ocean Rim Countries. We have deployed our National Disaster Response Force in other affected countries for response operations, he said. He informed that prior to BIMSTEC, India has hosted joint bilateral exercises with SAARC countries and also hosted a joint meeting on disaster risk management of all the BRICS nations. Last year we hosted the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh said that in May this year India launched South Asia Geostationary Communication Satellite that will improve communication, weather forecasting, etc. He assured that India will work with the same level of commitment under BIMSTEC and is indeed looking forward to moving hand in hand with the BIMSTEC nations. He thanked BIMSTEC country delegations for coming to India for this joint exercise.

BIMSTEC Secretary General, M Shahidul Islam said that it is a great honour and privilege for him to be present at the first disaster management exercise. He expressed happiness at the fact that this exercise is being organised when BIMSTEC is completing 20 years of its formation this year and this is the reflection of true spirit of regional cooperation. He said that disaster management is of high priority because Bay of Bengal region is one of the most disaster prone areas of the world and has witnessed many disasters in the recent past. He expressed concern that during disasters, apart from human loss, economic loss is also huge which affects the GDP of the country. He said that we have little control over natural calamities, so we need to focus on disaster risk reduction. We need to learn from each other and our past experiences, he added. He emphasised that coordination and quick response must go hand in hand. He further said that various structural and non-structural systems have been put in place which has reduced the human loss. The Secretary General also said that people to people contact is very important along with institutional framework. He said that this exercise is just a beginning for a larger cooperation.

During his welcome address, Shri Sanjay Kumar, DG, NDRF said that the first phase comprising a Preparatory Meeting was held in Delhi NCR on August 8-9, 2017, during which the modalities for this exercise were discussed. He said that this exercise will provide a platform to member countries to share best practices and coordination for disaster management among BIMSTEC nations. This is an opportunity to review and discuss the disaster management plans, he added. He said that this exercise will facilitate the regional cooperation for effective disaster response. The disasters cannot be prevented, but certainly be managed, Shri Kumar said. He also emphasised on integration of latest technology in this regard.

The Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs, Ms Preeti Saran said that BIMSTEC region has over one fifth of world’s population and development of BIMSTEC countries is crucial for the development of world as a whole. She said that regional cooperation under BIMSTEC also spurs the development of North East region. She said that sharing information, joint action and capacity building are important and this exercise is a step in this direction.

Delegation and response teams of all seven BIMSTEC nations i.e. – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand were present during the session. Representatives from Embassies/High Commission of BIMSTEC nations in Delhi, MHA, MEA, NDMA, NIDM, NDRF, SDRF, senior officers of CAPFs and state representatives were also present. Over 150 delegates of BIMSTEC member nations are participating in this event.

During the four-day exercise, the delegates from the member nations will share their experiences in the varied fields of disaster, training and its mitigation. Various events during the exercise include a Table Top Exercise after the inaugural session to provide participants with an opportunity to review and discuss disaster response plans and sharing of best practices of one nation with the other. Other exercises such as Joint Field Training Exercise on earthquake disaster at Ghaziabad, Joint Field Training Exercise on Flood Rescue at Wazirabad will also be conducted.

The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) needs to upgrade and technologically advance itself to face and counter any incident of cyber terrorism. Addressing the Passing Out Parade of Assistant Commandants (Executive), Sub Inspectors (Executive) and Assistant Sub Inspectors (Executive) at the CISF Regional Training Centre (RTC) Arakkonam, in Vellore district of Tamil Nadu today, Shri Rajnath Singh said a specialised Wing in the CISF should be created to conduct regular cyber security audits and build capacities to deal with cyber-terrorism.

Pointing out that cyber-terrorism has emerged as a major terror threat facing several countries in the world, the Union Home Minister said the cyber terrorists use digital tracks to attack important institutions, buildings and installation.

Shri Rajnath Singh also called upon the CISF to conduct regular security audits of all important buildings and installations. The CISF should strengthen its security mechanism based on these audit reports and also by adopting new technological solutions, he added. The Union Home Minister said the CISF needs to maintain its core competence against terrorism so that our strategic installations are not hit by any terrorist group. Shri Rajnath Singh said India is one of the fastest emerging economies of the world. Certain anti-India forces are not able to appreciate these visible economic trends in India, he added.

Noting with satisfaction that the CISF has largest number of women among the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), Shri Rajnath Singh said he’s confident the CISF will be the first Force to achieve 33% reservation target for Women. The CISF has crossed many milestones during its journey of nearly 48 years since inception. The role of CISF has been further diversified and expanded with rapid increase in globalisation and liberalization, he added. Applauding the excellent turnout of the Parade, the Union Home Minister also congratulated the trainers who have trained these CISF probationers. He said training is the most important pillar of any force. Shri Rajnath Singh said he is hopeful the training given to probationers will help them in performing their duties.

During the Dikshant Parade, the Union Home Minister also awarded medals and prizes. Shri Rajnath Singh later laid the Foundation Stone of the Sub-Officers’ Ladies Hostel, at the CISF RTC, Arakkonam. The Director General, CISF, Shri O.P. Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba chaired a special meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) to sensitize all the stakeholders about the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction and to discuss implementation of the same, here today. The meeting was attended by Members of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Members of NEC, Relief Commissioners/Secretaries (Disaster Management) & representatives of the States and Union Territories. The 10 point agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction was announced by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi during the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) held in November last year in New Delhi. 

Addressing the participants, the Union Home Secretary, Shri Rajiv Gauba, said that 10 point Agenda announced by the Prime Minister is a vision document based on three important global frameworks on disaster and sustainable development, namely Sustainable Development Goal, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and Paris Agreement on Climate Change. He emphasized that interconnectedness and cooperation among different stakeholders including Central Government, State/UT Governments and other stakeholders could help achieving the targets announced by the Prime Minister. Shri Gauba said that India is one of the most disaster- prone countries. He further added that due to climatic and topographical divergence, different disasters affect different parts of the country. The NDMA can play a role to set up a mechanism for regular monitoring, he added. He also stressed upon the time bound and specific deliverables for disaster risk reduction on implementation of 10 Point Agenda. 

Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, NDMA made a presentation on the subject and highlighted the initiatives taken by the Central Government in this regard. He said that PM’s 10 Point Agenda gives concrete ideas for implementing Sendai framework. Shri Kishore said that for the implementation for 10 point agenda, many factors are important such as participation of all stakeholders including Government, private sector, Academia & multi-lateral institutions, tangible & measurable outcomes, well defined time-frames, linkages across each of the ten points, dedicated capacity to monitor implementation and a communication strategy for mobilization. He also highlighted some of relevant actionable points for the stakeholders including mainstreaming DRR in flagship schemes of the Government, development of disaster insurance mechanisms for home-owners in disaster prone areas, inclusion of women units of National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force, undertaking a national level disaster risk assessment along with an online platform, developing an e-platform to map expertise and resources on highly specialized aspects of disaster response, developing a social media strategy for disaster risk management in the country, developing national guidelines for post-disaster recovery and systematically documenting post-disaster recovery work and lessons learnt. 

Representatives from various State Governments and Central Ministries also gave their suggestions/inputs in implementation of the agenda and in making the country disaster resilient. They also spoke on the efforts taken by their respective States and Central Ministries for implementing the agenda. Among the main points discussed were the issues such as non-availability of disaster experts in States, use of technology in disaster management, raising of SDRF battalions in States, regional cooperation among states, and sharing of information on lightning forecast etc. 

After discussion, it was agreed that Central Ministries would prepare road map for implementing 10 point agenda by December 2017. It was also agreed that States would discuss the PM’s 10 point agenda in their State Executive Committee and chalk out time bound plan with specific outcome for implementing the PM’s 10 point Agenda by December 2017.

                Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has expressed serious concern over the living conditions of large number of construction workers and urged the builders to ensure dignified living for them by ensuring necessary basic facilities. He spoke on the issue after releasing a commemorative stamp on the occasion of the 25 years of Indian Builders Congress (IBC) here today.

Shri Puri reminded the 5,100 members of the IBC that it was their solemn responsibility to ensure decent living conditions with facilities for cooking, bathing and toilets for workers at construction sites under Clause 19 H of General Contract Conditions and Contract Labour (Regulation) Act. The Minister said this was not being generally complied with which is not acceptable. The Minister asserted that construction workers make yeomen contribution to economic growth of the country and deserve to be treated with dignity.

Noting that the IBC aims at improving the built environment, Shri Puri said that the living environment of workers at construction sites is equally important.

Shri Puri said that the real estate sector kept evolving with the progress of economic reforms and the resultant economic growth, but had run into hurdles due to inadequate self-regulation and lack of regulatory mechanism. This has necessitated the Real Estate Act that was made a reality by this Government last year after eight long years it was first proposed. Shri Puri asserted that the real estate sector is finding the going bumpy but will soon settle at a new normal as all the stakeholders are working at enabling such a new normal.

                Land pooling in Delhi, expected to meet the rising demand for residential and other needs besides stimulating economic growth is now further simplified for speedy execution. Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will now act more as a facilitator and planner as against the role initially envisaged for it as a part of simplification of execution of land pooling policy.

Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Lt. Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal met in Nirman Bhawan and discussed various aspects of the Land Pooling Policy and decided to make some changes in the policy decided earlier. Shri Duga Shanker Mishra, Secretary (HUA) and Vice-Chairman of DDA also participated in the discussion.

Originally, land pooled under the Policy was to be transferred to DDA which was to act as the Developer Entity (DE) and undertake further sectoral planning and development of infrastructure in the pooled land. The Minister and LG today decided to do away with this requirement and land title continues to be with the original land owners.

DDA was asked to immediately initiate spatial and services planning for the five zones covered under Land Pooling Policy so that the policy could be given immediate effect after finalization of regulations under the Policy.           

While both the Minister and LG expressed concern over delay in implementing Land Pooling Policy, Shri Puri thanked Shri Baijal for his initiative in having 89 villages declared as urban areas under the Delhi Municipal Act, 1957 and 95 villages as Development Areas, as required for the implementation of land pooling. DDA was directed to formulate necessary regulations under the Policy in accordance with the changes in a month time. DDA was also asked to ensure single window clearance mechanism for according necessary approvals for speedy implementation.

Land Pooling Policy covers the greenfield areas in five zones viz., J, K-1, L, N and P-II coming under the Master Plan of Delhi-2021. To incentivize dense development for effective utilization of scarce land resource in the national capital, the Policy permits enhanced FAR of 400 as against the present 150. To promote affordable housing, an additional FAR of 15% is also allowed.

About 22,000 hectares of land is expected to be pooled which could meet the needs of about 95 lakh people. Land pooling would catalyse economic, social and civic development of the national capital besides triggering substantial investments and employment generation.

Under the Land Pooling Policy, 60% of pooled land would be returned to land owners after infrastructure development, if the pooled land is 20 hectares and above and 48% if the land pooled is between 2 and 20 hectares. Of the 60% of returned land, 53% will be for residential purpose, 5% for city level commercial use and 2% for Public and Semi-public use. In the other case, the same would be 43%, 3% and 2% respectively.

Affordable houses for Economically Weaker Sections to be built under the Policy shall be of the size of 32-40 sq.mtres. Half of this housing stock shall be retained by the Developer Entity to house Community Service People working for the residents/owners of the Group Housing. These houses will be built at the site or at premises contiguous to the site allotted. The other half of affordable houses shall be sold to DDA at the base cost of Rs.2,000 per sq.ft  for further sale to beneficiaries.

            Come Wednesday next, the famous Central Vista of the national capital will not be the same any more. The present famed special lighting on eight select days in a year and a few hour every night façade lighting of the icononic North and South Block buildings, a visual treat over the years,  will move from being static to dynamic, offering an entirely a new further enhanced aesthetic experience. The new dynamic façade lighting over an area of 21,450 sq.mtrs has the potential to present an amazing 16 million colour combinations, displaying a wide range of patterns and themes during the night time with colours changing every few seconds.

            Installed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), an attached organization of the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, the new dynamic façade lighting of the two famed buildings will be switched on by Shri Mahipal Singh, the senior most support staff (Multi Tasking Staff) of the Ministry of Home, housed in the North Block on Wednesday next at 6.30 am. The new lighting system will be on show for the benefit of media and the people of Delhi.

            The new lighting will be on show from 7.00 pm to 5.00 am all through the year with full capacity prime time lighting from 8.00 pm to 9.00 pm. With inherent dimming facility, the electrical load will be 25% during 7.00-7.30 pm and 10.00 pm to 5.00 am while the load will be 50% during the remainder of the night.

            The entire network of new dynamic lighting using the state of the art RGB LED technology with 40 kms of unified power and data cabling has central computerized control with automated selection of colour combinations, with selection of timing, dimming and switching on and off facility, individual and combined control of light fittings etc through Ethernet based controller.

            It is capable of providing both volume and focus lighting to highlight the architectural features of the historical buildings, a fine blend of the traditional Indian and British architectue, further enhancing the grandeur, treating the visitors to a new feast of colours. The frontal façade, loggia, central dome, flag posts etc., will be highlighted by the new lighting using narrow, medium and wide degree beam angles as required. The light fittings have external lenses to enable change of beam angles as per site requirement. It has an inherent capability and versatility for choosing different colour themes and schemes on special occasions.

            The new dynamic façade lighting has a multitude of advantages over the present conventional special lighting on show on special occasions like the Independence Day and the Republic Day and some national festivals and façade lighting. New The lights and fixtures are more durable, cost effective, energy efficient and environment friendly. The present lighting covers an area of 16,750 sq.mtres.

            The annual saving on account of new lighting of 21,450 sq.mtres of façade area in respect of replacement, maintenance and operation cost will be Rs.86.40 lakhs.  The life of the new LED light fittings is over one lakh burning hours, coming to about 25 years as against only 10,000 burning hours for the existing. Energy consumption by the present limited conventional lighting using LED, Metal Halide and Sodium Vapour light fittings is Rs.17.00 lakhs per year, double that of the extended year round new dynamic lighting with an energy consumption of only Rs.8.40 lakhs per year.

            All new light fittings are dust, vermin and moisture proof with outdoor weather protection of the highest order (IP-66) with robust design. It also conforms to the most stringent international regulatory framework of environmental and technical parameters (RoHS, UL and CE). It will not have any effect on the sand stone structures of the North and South Block buildings.

            Care has been taken to protect the heritage character of these famed buildings. All light fittings are outdoor and placed either on the ground in front lawns or on roof top.

            CPWD that has put in extensive efforts towards conceptualization, designing and execution  informed the Ministry that the initial investment of Rs.15.40 cr for the new lighting will be recovered in just 6 to 7 years and thereafter the system becoming virtually free of cost as against the costs being incurred every year now.

            Under the present lighting system, fifty thousand three watt LED bulbs in strings nailed on the walls of the iconic buildings are being used for special lighting on eight occasions in a year besides 170 lamps of 400 MW/250 MW Metal Halide and Sodium Vapour for façade lighting and 72 LED lights for security lighting. The new dynamic lighting system with 800 fittings will do away with all of these.

                The Government is committed to ensure a decent living habitat to all in urban areas and in particular, for the poor and has taken various initiatives in this regard, asserted the Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri today. The flagship new urban missions launched during the last three years constitute an integrated urban habitat model, he further said. 

Shri Puri spoke at a programme organized by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on the occasion of ‘World Habitat Day’ on the theme ‘Housing Policies : Affordable Homes’ in New Delhi. 

The Minister said the new urban missions launched by the Government like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) is at the core of ensuring affordable homes to the poor and the needy while other missions like the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) aim at enabling the much needed basic infrastructure for a decent habitat. 

Under PMAY(Urban), the Ministry has so far approved construction of 28,57,321 affordable homes for Economically Weaker Sections, Low and Middle Income Groups with an investment of Rs.1,54,180 cr. Central assistance of Rs.44,278 cr has been approved for these houses. 

Shri Puri said that the Government has taken several initiatives to give a boost to housing sector and in particular to affordable housing to meet the housing needs of the people. He further noted that the real estate sector has run into some problems for various reasons and he had reasons to believe that this sector will soon bounce back. Shri Puri said after a long time, the Government has brought this sector under a regulatory framework in the interest of the sector. 

Shri Puri, while referring to the Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030 noted that India’s performance would be the key to achieve these goals at global scale. Noting that 15 of the 17 SDGs are in the domain of urban local bodies, he said the Government is endeavoring to improve the capacities of city governments.

Rajghat, the Samadhi of the Father of the Nation in the national capital , has for the first time acquired a new feature that could appeal to the large number of visitors. Vice-President of India Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today unveiled a 1.80 metre tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of the 148 Birth Anniversary of the champion of country’s independence.

It is mounted on a two feet high pedestal clad with granite. The famous message of Gandhi ji “Be the Change You Wish to See” is inscribed on the front side of the pedestal. Installation of the Statue is a part of a large number of improvement works at Rajghat undertaken during the last three years. 

Over 10,000 people visiting Rajghat daily and foreign dignitaries pay homage to the Father of the Nation at the simple black stone platform marking the place where Gandhi ji was cremated. The new statue would offer another spot for them to pay their respect to the great soul.

                Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B), Sh. N. K Sinha has called upon the Indian Information Service Probationers to continuously upgrade their professional skills to meet the demands of the changing communication paradigm. He was speaking at an event in New Delhi today that marked the successful completion of Induction Training (Phase I) of IIS Group ‘A’ Probationers of 2016 Batch conducted by the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC). Sh. Sinha who is also the Chairman of IIMC observed that probationers provide the energy of youth that should be tied with the experience of senior officers for making Government communication speedy and effective. He also asked IIMC to include learning of one additional Indian and one foreign language as part of its IIS training curriculum. Later Sh. Sinha presented certificates to the twelve IIS probationers who successfully completed the training.

Earlier in his welcome address DG IIMC Sh. KG Suresh noted that the communication scenario had rapidly transformed in the last few years with the advent of new technologies. This, he said, necessitated government communicators to be adequately equipped to deal with the changing media landscape and proactively use all possible communication channels to inform the citizens about Government policies and programmes.

The event was also attended by other senior officers of the Ministry of I&B, Media Units and the faculty and staff of the Institute. IIMC is the training academy for IIS officers.

                Minister for Information & Broadcasting and Textiles Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani has said that the model structure of broadcasting should focus on democratized viewership. This should be based on an accurate measurement system that reflects the strength of regional languages, varied tastes of viewers/consumers and bridges the divide on issues related to agenda setting, creative content and revenue between the mainstream and regional platforms. Smt. Irani stated this while delivering the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture 2017 here today on the topic “Model for Broadcast landscape for Democracies”



 

Elaborating further, the Minister said that while broadcasting sector is based on business propositions and technological upgradation, the Mann ki Baat programme of the Hon’ble Prime Minister was an ideal example of how a technology platform blended PM’s message with citizen understanding and awareness of the issues highlighted by him in each episode.

Talking about the prevailing trends in the News segment of the broadcasting landscape, Smt. Irani said that News today had become a “Spectator Sport” as technology had blurred the lines between content and broadcast. As a consequence, while a certain section of the Media Space adhered to codes, ethics and conduct rules, the other segment was driven by rush for TRP’s, eyeballs thereby being influenced by the “Headlines competing with Hashtag”. This was extremely important in the light of the social media explosion taking place in the country which provided a new pathway for information dissemination.



 

Speaking on the profile of the public broadcaster Smt. Irani said it had placed public interest before business and profit interest as in the case of private channels. It was incumbent upon Prasar Bharati to speak freely and fairly for the progress of the nation. The Minister called upon the public broadcaster to weave stories on the lives of ordinary people which could have an impact both within India and abroad. This would also enable it to weave information with the citizenry of the country.

The Minister mentioned it would be the endeavour of the I&B Ministry to promote the concept of “Design Thinkers” for content generation in the digital space in the light of the growing use of technology by the young generation in areas of internet, mobile content and Animation & Gaming. This would also incorporate the elements of the New India vision envisaged by the Hon’ble Prime Minister by 2022.

Highlighting the fulcrum strength of Ministry of I&B, Smt. Irani said that the Information Service officers profile would be strengthened in the future by giving them skill sets along with an integrated administrative exposure so as to enable them to serve policy and programmes of the people through the medium of information. This would be along the lines of Sardar Patel’s vision of creating a steel frame to serve the people through the channel of information dissemination.

 

The annual lecture was organized by the All India Radio as a mark of respect to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India’s first Minister of Information and Broadcasting.  These lectures were started in 1955 and the first Memorial lecture was delivered by Sri C. Rajagopalachari. In this series, the speakers in the previous years included Dr. Zakir Hussain, Shri Morarji Desai, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and other luminaries.

Second Tripartite meeting to discuss the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was held at Ooty, Tamilnadu on 11.10.2017.  This meeting was held under the Chairmanship of Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, the Minister of State(Independent Charge) for Labour & Employment  to discuss the provisions of the Amendment Bill modified on the basis of suggestions received by representatives of plantations owners, trade unions and State Governments during first Tripartite Committee meeting. 

During the meeting, Shri Gangwar said that objective of the amendment to the Plantations Labour Act, 1951 is to balance the requirement of both plantation workers and plantation owners.  The Minister said that he wanted to discuss the provisions of the bill before finalizing the draft amendment Bill.  He further added that Central Government would ensure better working conditions for the workers by way of providing improved welfare facilities to them and at the same time making the plantation financially viable and competitive.

Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, Smt. M. Sathiyavathy also emphasized that the intention of the proposed amendments to Plantation Labour Act, 1951 is to provide enabling provision so that the welfare facilities to be provided under the statute may either be provided by the plantation owners themselves or by giving effect to the various schemes of either Central Government, State Government, Local Bodies, Panchayats or appropriate agencies. However, the ultimate responsibility would be that of the plantation owners to provide welfare facilities.

            During discussion most of the stakeholders appreciated that the suggestions provided by them during the first tripartite meeting have been incorporated.  Representatives from various State Governments acknowledged the fact that the enabling provision would reduce the financial burden on the plantation owners. At the same time, it would not be absolved the plantation owner responsibility. 

It was also mentioned by the representatives from Trade Unions and State Government that the workers should not be paid less than the Minimum Wages and alongwith amendment the emphasis should also be laid on the implementation of various provisions of the Act.

            Some other specific suggestions were also provided by representatives of plantation owners, Trade Unions and State Government.  They were assured that the suggestions  provided would be examined and incorporated if required in such a manner that it is beneficial to both workers and the plantation owners.

            Smt. M. Sathiyavathy also mentioned that  the execution of the provision of this Act are in the ambit of State Government and so all the plantation state should take active role in its proper implementation.

            Prior to the meeting Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister for Labour & Employment(IC)  alongwith other officials of the Central Government visited a tea plantation at Coonoor  to have a feel of the quality of existing welfare facilities for the workers and also the challenges being faced by the plantation owners in the  changing economic scenario.

            This on field information would further contribute in framing an effective and relevant Plantation Labour Amendment Bill so that it leads to a win-win situation for both plantation workers and plantation owners.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Labour & Employment, Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar inaugurated the disabled friendly building of National Career Service Centre for Differently Abled (NCSC-DA) in Guwahati today. The Union Minister expressed his desire to expand the Ministry’s footprints in the North East Region with the motive of Labour Welfare at various levels.

Shri Gangwar reiterated that the NCSC-DA building would be an inspiration for others to emulate the model apart from bringing positive changes in the lives of Persons with Disabilities. He also applauded the contribution of the State Government not only for their support in the construction of building but also to have synergy in other areas too.

The Guwahati building has been constructed at cost of Rs. 10.40 Cr.  The land for the building was provided by Government of Assam. The state-of-the-Art building is unique in nature of its kind in the State of Assam and is one among 8 buildings constructed so far for National Career Service Centres for Differently Abled (erstwhile VRCs).

The objective of the NCSC-DA is to evaluate the residual capacities of PwDs, impart non formal skill training & extend the vocational rehabilitation assistance for economically mainstreaming them.

Govt. of India is also implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a Mission Mode Project for transformation of the National Employment Service to provide job matching and other employment services in a transparent and user friendly manner. The NCS Portal is hosted at URL www.ncs.gov.in and supported with a toll free number 1800-425-1514 to assist and guide the youth including PwDs. More than 100 Model Career Centres have been established.

Shri Gangwar also recalled his visits to the North Eastern States as Minister of Textile, to boost the Textile Industries of the Region. Shri Gangwar also expressed his happiness over the detailed and constructive discussion on issues of significant importance. 

The Review Meeting was attended by Labour Ministers and Labour Secretaries for North Eastern States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura and Shri N Biren Singh, Chief Minister of Manipur, inaugurated the meeting. The review meeting discussed issues like implementation of the Schemes on Child Labour, Plantation Workers, ESIC Works, Social Security Schemes, BOC Workers Cess Fund, Mines Safety, etc, and for further betterment. 

The Chief Minister, Shri N Biren Singh in his address stated the statistics about various measures taken up by his Government in the field of improving the worker's conditions of his State.

Shri Gangwar requested the North Eastern States to utilize the BOCW Cess funds of Rs.27,000 Crore, which is available for the safety, health and welfare of Construction Labourers.

The government of India has recently ratified ILO conventions on Child Labour. Eradication of Child Labour has been taken very seriously. On the 26th September 2017 Ministry of Labour & Employment has launched an exclusive Portal called PENCIL Portal to ensure a better mechanism to eradicate Child Labour.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Shri Giriraj Singh launched MSME Delayed Payment Portal – MSME Samadhaan (http://msefc.msme.gov.in) here today, empowering micro and small entrepreneurs across the country to directly register their cases relating to delayed payments by Central Ministries/Departments/CPSEs/State Governments. Shri Arun Kumar Panda, Secretary, Ministry of MSME along with other dignitaries and senior officials from the Ministry were also present.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Giriraj Singh said that the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with cases of delayed payment to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). As per the provisions, the buyer is liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests to the supplier on the amount at three times of the bank rate notified by Reserve Bank in case he does not make payment to the supplier for the supplies of goods or services within 45 days of the day of acceptance of the goods/service or the deemed day of acceptance.

Background:

The Portal will give information about the pending payment of MSEs with individual CPSEs / Central Ministries, State Governments, etc. The CEO of PSEs and the Secretary of the Ministries concerned will also be able to monitor the cases of delayed payment under their jurisdiction and issue necessary instructions to resolve the issues. The portal will greatly facilitate the monitoring of the delayed payment in a more effective manner. The information on the portal will be available in public domain, thus exerting moral pressure on the defaulting organisations. The MSEs will also be empowered to access the portal and monitor their cases.

Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India had constituted a Committee to review the existing Haj Policy of the Government for 2013-17 and to suggest framework for new Haj policy 2018-22. The Committee presented its Report to the Union Minister of Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in the presence of Secretary (Minority Affairs), Shri Ameising Luikham, Chairman of Haj Committee of India, Shri Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser, Ambassador of India in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Shri Ahmed Javed, other Members of HCoI and senior officials of the Ministry of Minority Affairs in Mumbai today.

 

Haj is one of the most complex organizational tasks undertaken by Government of India outside its borders. Although a five day religious congregation, it is virtually a year-long managerial exercise. Indian Haj pilgrims who constitute one of the largest national group perform Haj through two streams - (i) the Haj Committee of India (HCOI), and (ii) registered Private Tour Operators (PTOs). HCOI established under the Haj Committee Act 2002 is responsible for making the arrangements for pilgrims performing Haj through them. All arrangements for the HCoI pilgrims in Saudi Arabia are coordinated by the Consulate General of India, Jeddah. The Haj quota for India fixed by the Saudi Arabian Government was fixed at 1,36,020 after Haj 2013. In 2016, 135,902 pilgrims performed Haj out of which 99,902 went through HCoI and 36,000 through PTOs. The Haj quota was substantially increased to 1,70,025 for Haj 2017 out of which a quota of 1,25,025 was allocated to HCoI and 45,000 to PTOs.

 

            In terms of the Supreme Court directions regarding Haj Policies for the HCoI and PTOs, it was decided to review the existing Policies and frame a new Policy. Accordingly, Ministry of Minority Affairs constituted a Committee with Shri Afzal Amanullah, IAS (Retd.), former Secretary to Govt. of India and Ex CGI, Jeddah as Convenor and Justice S.S. Parkar, Retd. Judge of Bombay High Court, Shri Qaiser Shamim, IRS (Retd) & former Chairman, Haj Committee of India, Shri Kamal Faruqui, noted Chartered Accountant & Muslim Scholar as Members. Shri J. Alam, Joint Secretary, in-charge of Haj, Ministry of Minority Affairs was the Member Secretary of the Committee.

 

            The Terms of Reference of the Committee included the following;

 

(i)            Review the existing Haj policy pertaining to HCoI and PTOs in the light of its objectives and achievements.

(ii)          Examine implications of various directions of the Supreme Court with regard to the existing policy and to suggest suitable amendments in the said policy in the light of such directions.

(iii)        Review the effectiveness of arrangements made by HCoI for Haj pilgrims’ accommodation and air travel including issues related with Haj subsidy.

(iv)        Examine the effectiveness of inter-relationship and coordination in the functioning of Haj Committee of India and CGI.

(v)          Examine the aspects of transparency, consumer satisfaction and disclosure requirements for PTOs to protect interest of the Haj Pilgrims with a view to make the new policy of greater assistance to the pilgrims.

(vi)         Suggest measure for ensuring fair competition among PTOs and enhanced value for services provided by them.

(vii)      Examine any other issues relevant to Haj policy for HCoI and PTOs.

(viii)    Suggest the framework for new Haj policy for HCoI and PTOs in the light of the above.

 

            The Committee started its work on 15th February, 2017 and had a number of meetings to compile the information and finalise its report. It had extensive consultations with all the stake holders, community leaders and general public. It held meetings in Mumbai, Kolkata and New Delhi for interaction with the Haj Committee of India and various State/ Union Territory Haj Committees and also interacted with private tour operators and their associations in Mumbai. The Committee met with the officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and airlines engaged in the Haj air charter operations including Air India and Saudi Airlines, officials of Ministry of Shipping and Shipping Corporation of India. The Committee invited suggestions from the general public by publishing an advertisement in all the leading newspapers in Hindi, English and Urdu and had personal interaction with the public and other stakeholders on 25th May, 2017 in New Delhi.

6.         The Committee visited Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in April, 2017 to see the entire gamut of Haj arrangements undertaken by Consulate General of India (CGI), Jeddah at various places in KSA. The Committee interacted with Consul General and his team on the role and functions of the Consulate and had discussion on effectiveness of inter-relationship and coordination between HCoI and CGI. The Committee interacted with the operational functionaries of Moassasa and officials who are involved in Haj operation viz. representatives of Naqqaba Sayyarat, Maktabul Wukla, Adillah Establishment, Saudi Airlines and GACA etc. The Committee also interacted with a cross section of Indian community based in Saudi Arabia to elicit their views. During their visit, the Committee also undertook field visit of Makkah and Azizia where the buildings for the Indian pilgrims are hired, Mina, Muzadalifa and Arafat and Metro Train Stations of Mashaer region.

                The Vice-President Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu inaugurated the Vigilance Awareness Week, 2017 here today.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must ensure that the benefits of democratic governance reach every citizen in our country. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the ‘Vigilance Awareness Week’ with the theme “My Vision-Corruption-free India”, organised by the Central Vigilance Commission. The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K. Sinha, the Central Vigilance Commissioner, Shri K.V. Chowdary and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 The Vice President said that we should go to the roots of corruption and strike at it. He further said that constant vigilance is required to see that the vast beautiful tree of our country is not eaten up by weeds and pests. The tree must be protected, preserved and nourished continuously by rejuvenating the entire eco-system, he added.

The Vice President said that Sardar Patel represents the best values in the Indian tradition so far as governance is concerned and he integrated the country and also was a shining example of integrity and probity in public life. He further said that we must draw inspiration from Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s messages and his life. His sense of realism and pragmatic approach to issues allowed him to face challenges and demonstrate his successful leadership qualities, he added.

 The Vice President said that honesty and integrity are essential components of social capital. They add value to the economic capital and intellectual capital of any society and country, he added.

 The Vice President said that procedures and implementation of laws should become more citizen-centric. Each citizen should be able to access quality services without harassment, undue delays and corrupt practices, he added.

 The Vice President said that all out efforts should be made to improve the educational system to inculcate strong values, ethical conduct and commitment towards the welfare of the society at large. He further said that the Central Vigilance Commission is trying to promote “Integrity Club” in schools and colleges and this initiative will no doubt pay rich dividends in future.

 Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has followed the principle of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.  Emphasising on the integrity, he said that the civil servants are the tools of governance and results cannot be achieved by bad tools. He said that the Governemnt has followed the approach so to have zero tolerance towards corruption and at the same time to provide protection to the honest officers.  The Minister said that not only the magnitude of, but acceptability of such crimes also matters. He said that the ultimate goal of any successful society has to be the target of incorruptibility of society at all levels. He further said that the recent steps taken by the Government such as demonetization show its will, conviction and strength. He also highlighted other initiatives of the Government such as abolition of interviews at lower levels and self-attestation. Dr Jitendra Singh said that RTI portal has also been set up where RTI can be filed online from anywhere.  He also complemented CVC for working towards preventive vigilance. He also said that we should resolve towards making India corruption-free by the year 2020.

Shri K. V. Chowdary said that the CVC has adopted multi-pronged strategy to fight corruption consisting of punitive measures, preventive measures and participative measures which are complementary to each other. The punitive measures alone do not yield serious results, he added. He said that the overall systems should be improved and possible reasons for delays should be identified. He also said that to give recognition to the reforms and good work done by organization in the field of punitive, preventive and participative vigilance, the Vigilance Excellence Awards have been instituted in two categories from this year onwards.  He also said that the Commission is developing an Integrity Index based on bench marking of internal processes and controls within an organization as well as management of relationships and expectations of external stake holders. He further said that initially Integrity Index will be developed for 25 organisations including Government organisations and PSUs and will be replicated in other organizations also. This Integrity Index will be developed with technical support form IIM, Ahmedabad, he added.  He said that “My Vision-Corruption Free India” has been chosen as theme of this year’s Vigilance Awareness Week and awareness programmes will held to educate masses on this theme.

The Vice President of India gave away the Vigilance Excellence Awards for good work done by officers and organizations in the field of punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.

                The 24rd  lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), was delivered by Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, here yesterday on the topic “New India @ 2022”.

In his lecture, Dr Rajiv Kumar spoke about many facets of India’s development, covering a broad historical perspective of our national development over time. He spoke of development as a mass movement, and discussed the three transformations that India is simultaneously going through – economic, social and political.

The different stages of India’s transformation were explained in a historical perspective, each period being characterized by deepening mass participation corresponding to the phase of economic, social and political transformation. The period from 1857-1942 was the period of India’s freedom struggle, which culminated in our political independence in 1947. The period from 1947 to 2017 was the period of post-independence India, accompanied by corresponding economic, social and political transformations. These transformations would become more significant with increasing mass participation in future, each future period being explained as a  point in time, viz., 2017  (Sankalp se Siddhi), 2022 (New India) and 2047 (Sarvashreshtha Bharat). The roadmap for future development was discussed in detail, with specific goals established for the various transformations envisaged, such as Poverty Free India, Dirt and Squalor Free India, Corruption Free India, Communalism Free India and Terrorism Free India.

The lecture was followed by a lively question and answer session where the audience put several questions on issues of contemporary relevance to the distinguished speaker.

This lecture was attended by full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR as well as CMDs, Directors and other officers of Government Ministries/Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Nationalized Banks, and other Organizations.  The webcast of the lecture may be viewed online and is available on the website of the Central Vigilance Commission  www.cvc.nic.in.

In line with the broader strategy and emphasis on preventive vigilance, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) believes that the next level of systemic change can be through the tool of Integrity Index. The CVC has therefore decided to go in for development of the Integrity Index-based on bench-marking of internal processes and controls within an organisation as well as management of relationships and expectations of outside stakeholders.

The Integrity Index will bring out annual scores/rankings of Public Sector Undertakings/Public Sector Banks and Financial Institutions/Departments/Ministries of Government of India by linking the essential drivers of vigilance with long term efficiency, profitability and sustainability of public organizations and create an internal and external ecosystem that promotes working with Integrity in public organizations.

CVC has adopted a research-based approach for creating an integrity index that various organizations can use to measure themselves and which will evolve with changing needs and with this view IIM-Ahmedabad has been engaged to develop the Integrity Index. Being a new initiative, initially 25 organizations have been selected for development of the Integrity Index (as per list attached). Subsequently, it is proposed to extend the Integrity Index concept to all other CPSUs and organizations of Government of India. The management of all 25 organizations have been involved in the development of Integrity Index.

The main objectives for which the Integrity Index is to be established are:

1.      Define what constitutes Integrity of Public Organizations

2.      Identify the different factors of Integrity and their inter-linkages

3.      Create an objective and reliable tool that can measure the performance of organizations along these above factors

4.      Validate the findings over a period of time to improve upon the robustness of the tool that measures Integrity

5.      Create an internal and external ecosystem that promotes working with Integrity where public organizations lead the way.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today met a group of students from border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, who were on a visit to the national capital. The students belonged to the age group of 16 to 20 years and are studying in different government schools or government degree colleges.

Arrangements were made for the students, many of whom were visiting Delhi for the first time, to visit the museum of Rashtrapati Bhavan which was a rare and unique experience for them at this tender age. In addition, they went for sightseeing to historic destinations like Red Fort and Qutub Minar. Dr Jitendra Singh suggested that a visit could also be arranged for them during the Parliament Session so that they can witness the proceedings.

In a lively interaction, Dr Jitendra Singh answered a wide range of questions from the students and also responded by offering his views on a number of current topics as well as elaborating several youth-centric initiatives taken by the Central Government. He said, these young students are going to have the privilege of being the architects of New India which is soon going to emerge as a global power. He said, most of the students in this age group have their aspirations but need to work out their inner aptitude and their inner capacities.

Dr Jitendra Singh said, the students, living in border districts of Poonch and Rajouri, have the privilege of being globally connected with their counterparts across the world. Many of them, who have moved out to other parts of the country, have made a name for themselves at a young age.

The students were accompanied by Deputy Superintendent of Police, J&K Police, Ms. Preeti Verma, who coordinated the visit.

                 The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh participated in the MUDRA Promotion Campaign in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir today.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and Stand Up India are the two major schemes initiated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that will bring about a massive transformation in the lives of millions of youth across the country.

Dr Jitendra Singh said job and placement are the two key words in the lives of millions of educated youth, therefore schemes like Mudra Finance were inspired by the idea of employability rather than employment. He said schemes like Mudra reflect the sensitivity of the Government towards the need for a behavioral shift that is required of the people to inculcate certain values for sustainable progress. We believe these schemes will usher a change in mindset of people in general from seeking employment to self-employment and then towards job-providing, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh further said technology is also being leveraged to expedite the economic progress. We also need to be innovative in our approach at the level of State Government. We have unexplored resources within the state. He said that the first thing we need to do is to assess the skill-profile required to explore and exploit these local resources. Then only can we properly train the human resource available and leverage the whole process for the overall development of the state.

Later Dr Jitendra Singh along with other dignitaries visited the stalls set up by the participating banks, insurance companies and other agencies including UIDAI, SIDBI, NPC (National Payments Corporation), JKEDI, Tourism Department, Horticulture and Handloom. J&K State Finance Minister Mr. Haseeb Drabu, Principal Secretary Finance, J&K, Shri Navin Kumar Chawdhary and Chairman, J&K Bank, Mr. Parvez Ahmed were also present during the function.

Few films were also screened on the occasion. These films depicted the Stand-Up India and Mudra schemes besides highlighting the beneficiaries of Mudra Scheme who have availed loans and succeeded in realizing self-employment besides helping others to earn.  A symbolic transaction for a small purchase was also effected on the occasion through BHIM App, which is a UPI application for electronic fund transfer.

                It has come to the notice of the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas that a large number of LPG consumers have complained about non-credit of the LPG subsidy amounts in to their bank accounts during the past few weeks.

On verification, it is found that these complaints mainly pertain to those LPG consumers who are Airtel customers and have opened account in Airtel payment bank. Airtel is a telecom service provider which has also ventured into the Payment bank services in recent months.

It is clarified that the LPG subsidy of these Airtel costumers has already been credited to their newly opened Airtel payment bank account seeded with Aadhaar.

It may be noted that as per subsidy transfer protocol, the LPG subsidy is transferred to the (latest) bank account of the beneficiary seeded with their Aadhaar .

To redress the inconvenience caused to LPG consumers, MoPNG and OMCs have already taken up the matter with the concerned authorities in Department of Financial Services (Ministry of Finance), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and Airtel.

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that it is important to develop new business models, marketing plans, technology and innovations in the sector. For the same, the oil and gas PSUs have setup venture capital funds to encourage start-ups based on innovative ideas in the energy sector.  Speaking at the launch function of Start-up programme for entrepreneurs in oil and gas sector here today, he said the initiative will change the status of the youth of our country from job seeker to that of job provider as envisaged by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Pradhan said the business partnership between the start-ups and the PSUs of Petroleum Ministry will create a new benchmark for growth and job creation as India has a huge potential for investment of over USD 300 bn in the energy sector in the next ten years.

 

He said, start-ups in the oil and gas sector are not short-term investments, but a long-term commitment. There are a wide variety of opportunities that present a wide spectrum of options for launching start-up initiatives. The Minister said the government is committed to provide clean energy to every household of the country and in the last 15 months 3 crore LPG connections have been provided under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). He said in the next 15 months, a target of providing more than 4 crore electricity connections has been set under the Saubhagya Scheme. He called upon the oil PSUs to take advantage of the emerging technologies in the oil sector with the help of the youth to match the international standards.

 

CEO, Niti Ayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, Secretary DIPP Shri Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, PNG Shri K. D Tripathi, Academicians, Chiefs of Oil and Gas PSUs and young entrepreneur were also present on the occasion.

 

Backing the spirit of innovation, 10 public sector undertakings under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, including the IOCL, ONGC, EIL, OIL, NRL, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL and MRPL, have created a corpus of Rs. 320 crore to support start-up initiatives.

 

Since the launch of the scheme by the PSUs, there has been a constant flow of applications and some extremely innovative ideas have come through. The Start- up ideas have been received from a varying age group (from a fresh engineering graduate to a 70-year-old entrepreneur) from across the country.

 

The 10 oil PSUs have together selected nearly 30 start-up projects for support in the first round of the scheme. Some of the many innovative projects that have made it after rigorous evaluation include:

 

·         Electronic leak detector for detecting body and bung leak of LPG cylinders

·         Self – sustaining low-maintenances toilets, or eco-toilets

·         Multiuse Fuel from Agricultural Waste Biomass

·         Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) for underwater inspections

·         Converting waste plastics to high value petroleum fuels

·         Solar Stove- Revolutionary Day and Night Indoor Solar Cooktop System for all lifestyles

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production



 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 

1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during September, 2017 was 1844.25 TMT which is 2.79% lower than the monthly target but 2.25% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-September, 2017 was 11301.99 TMT which is 1.43% lower than target for the period but 2.48% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:

Ø Offshore: Natural decline/increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore. Gas Lift De-optimization, Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) failure, and minimum well monitoring/ less stimulation jobs due to severe monsoon in Western Offshore.

Ø Onshore: Frequent power shut downs in Mehsana, Ahmedabad & Assam hampered lift operations, wells closed for cluster drilling/ rig movements in Assam.

 

1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during September, 2017 was 276.79 TMT which is 9.88% lower than monthly target but 5.71% higher than production in September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-September, 2017 was 1693.60 TMT which is 9.53% lower than target for the period but 5.53% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  Less than planned contribution from old wells – rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.

Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

 

1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2017 was 799.09 TMT which is 8.57% lower than the monthly target and 6.20% lower than September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2017 was 5029.15 TMT which is 5.64% lower than target for the period and 7.38% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

Ø  RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require work over jobs. Poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17.

Ø  CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.

 

Natural Gas

2.             Natural gas production during September, 2017 was 2723.24 MMSCM which is 5.58% lower than the target for the month but 4.74% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-September, 2017 was 16412.90 MMSCM which is 5.42% lower than target for the period but 4.38% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of September, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

                Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, led a delegation to Tokyo, Japan from 17-18 October 2017 to participate in LNG Producer- Consumer Conference. /

The conference organized by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) and the Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC) is a global annual dialogue which provides participants a forum for sharing the latest trends in the global LNG market and discussing opportunities and challenges with a view to developing global LNG market. /

Delivering the key note address shri Pradhan stated that the global LNG market is undergoing a major transformation driven by new supplies which has created a situation of oversupply. He urged the global LNG markets, in which producers and consumers of LNG have equal stakes, to join hands to design flexible terms such as pricing review, flexible take or pay, abolition of destination restriction clause in the LNG contracts. Shri Pradhan stressed that these reforms are essential for developing a transparent, efficient, truly global and balanced LNG market. /

Shri Pradhan held a bilateral meeting with Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan Mr Hiroshige Seko. The two sides discussed ongoing cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector between our companies in India and abroad and explored ways to further enhance the engagement. They also explored joint cooperation in the areas of LNG sourcing, swapping and optimization of LNG sources and commercial exploitation of Methane Hydrates. Minister Pradhan invited Minister Seko to attend the 16th International Energy Forum (IEF) Ministerial meeting to be held in New Delhi during April next year. /

Both Ministers signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on establishing a liquid, flexible and global LNG Market. The MoC provides a framework to cooperate in facilitating flexibility in LNG contracts, abolition of Destination Restriction Clause and also explore possibilities of cooperation in establishing reliable LNG spot price indices reflecting true LNG demand and supply. This would help in promoting bilateral relationship between India and Japan in the LNG sector. /

Shri Pradhan also met Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan Mr. Katsunobu Kato and discussed issues of bilateral importance on promoting cooperation in the skill sector. Both also signed a MoC on the ""Technical Intern Training Program (TITP). The TITP is an ambitious program to send Indian technical interns to Japan for on the job training for a period of three to five years. The MoC is expected to pave the way for bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the area of skill development. /

India and Japan are major consumers of energy in the world. In the LNG sector, Japan is the world's largest importer and India is the 4th largest importer. Under the Japan-India Energy Partnership Initiative signed in January 2016, the two sides had agreed to work together in promoting well-functioning energy markets and affirmed to promote a transparent and diversified Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market through the relaxation of Destination Restriction Clause. /

This event was organized to mark the third anniversary of the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Swachh Bharat Diwas, and the conclusion of Swachhata Hi Seva fortnight.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has been proactively involved in making India clean mainstreaming Swachhta in our regular activities. The focus of MoPNG has been not only to garner people’s involvement but also to bring about behavioural and attitudinal change through unique/special contribution to the cause of Swachh Bharat Mission, through innovative and unconventional practices/approaches. Some of the innovative activities undertaken by Oil & Gas CPSEs, under the administrative control of MoPNG, inter-alia include, launch of Project Saraswati to tap the ground water resources along the course of Paleo-channel of river Saraswati in Haryana to tide over severe water crisis in summer; construction of unique zero energy based vegetable cellars in Nang village near Leh for helping potato farmers by preventing rotting of farm produce due to extreme temperatures; construction of bio-toilets in Leh (J&K) and Mahanandpur (Bihar), making ODF localities such as Bharatnagar (Maharashtra), Gandhigaon (Assam) etc., cleaning Himalayas in collaboration with Indian Mountaineering Foundation and organizing competitions on Swachhta Apps.

Under the Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan, to reduce the drop-out rate among girl students due to non-availability of separate toilet facilities, Oil CPSEs/JVs have constructed more than 20,187 school toilets. These toilets are used by more than 5 lakh girl students. More than 95% of the toilets have been constructed in rural areas. Under waste to fuel projects, Oil & Gas CPSEs have taken initiatives for implementation of waste to fuel projects on a pilot basis across 7 States.

Tourist/religious iconic places have been earmarked for Oil and Gas CPSEs with focus on special clean up initiative focusing on maintenance and upkeep of tourist/religious places. The best iconic place award was given to Golden temple, Amritsar and Special awards were given to Mata Vaishno Devi temple, J&K and Meenakshi temple, Tamil Nadu, adopted by HPCL, IOCL and BPCL respectively.

MoPNG is fully committed to contribute its best in making Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a Jan Andolan and in building a clean, green, healthy, sustainable and inclusive “New India”.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between India and Japan on establishing a liquid, flexible and global LNG Market.

The MoC will promote bilateral relationship between India and Japan in the energy sector. It will contribute to the diversification of gas supplies for India. This will strengthen our energy security and lead to more competitive prices for consumers.

The MoC provides a framework to cooperate in facilitating flexibility in LNG contracts, abolition of Destination Restriction Clause and also explore possibilities of cooperation in establishing reliable LNG spot price indices reflecting true LNG demand and supply.

Background:

India and Japan are major consumers of energy in the world. In the LNG sector, Japan is the world's largest importer and India is the 4th largest importer. Under the Japan-India Energy Partnership Initiative signed in January 2016, the two sides had agreed to work together in promoting well-functioning energy markets and affirmed to promote a transparent and diversified Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market through the relaxation of Destination Restriction Clause.

                The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, addressedthe India Energy Forum by CERAWeeK in New Delhi today. 

Addressing the forum, Shri Pradhan said India will remain one of the fastest growing energy markets in the World in the coming two decades. Both on account of increasing access and better life styles, there will be growth in per capita energy consumption. India will be an influential buyer in the global energy market.Given India’s dependence on imports (80% oil and 50% gas) – India has to constantly track the global trends and learn from experts, he added. 

The minister said, important aspect is the understanding of geo-politics – particularly what is happening in Syria and ISIS, what is happening in Kurdistan referendum, Saudi block’s sanction situation against Qatar, political situation in Venezuela. All these are situations that would have impact on oil prices and hence on our consumers, on our fiscal deficit and on our economy, Shri Pradhan said. 

Shri Pradhan said,world is at the cross-roads of a major transition. This is with respect to the move towards Electric Vehicle (EV). There is a sense of credence about this – the only debate is probably the timing, and how things would shape up,both in terms of renewable technologies such as solar and also in terms of enabling storage. 

The minister further said the Indian Govt has taken several policy measures to completely overhaul the licensing regime in upstream segment with our HELP policy. Govt has also come out with NDR to make sure all the interested investors get full access to available geological information to take informed investment decisions. 

Shri Pradhan said,Indian professionals are in forefront in Information technology (IT), banking and in the field of medicine throughout the World. The same level of participation is also expected in the global oil and gas industry. 

He also expressed hope that during the course of next two days much deliberation will take place on the trends in the oil markets.

                I heartily welcome friends from international and Indian oil and gas industry, the broader energy industry and key consuming sectors to a brand new chapter of CERAWeek, the CERAWeek India Energy Forum. 

Thank you Dr. Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman, IHS Markit, Dr.Atul Arya, Senior Vice President, IHS Markit and your team, for bringing your flagship event out of Houston for the first time and selecting India for its first home away from home. 

India will remain one of the fastest growing energy markets in the World in the coming two decades. Both on account of increasing access and better life styles, there will be growth in per capita energy consumption. We will be an influential buyer in the global energy market. 

Given our dependence on imports (80% oil and 50% gas) – we have to constantly track the global trends and learn from experts like yourselves. 

Last month when hurricanes hit the US and refinery capacities went down, crude itself had been on its way up already. Given that our refineries and producers both get benchmark price, the retail prices went up and there was hue and cry in the street. My point is, we are an industry that is well integrated with the global industry and need to be informed about what is happening. 

During the course of these next two days I hope much deliberation will take place on the trends in the oil markets – what is happening to the OPEC cut agreements, what is happening with respect trends in production from big non OPEC producers such as Russia, Shale in the US etc. We want to know the trends in the LNG market. The trends in oil & Gas contracts etc. 

Important aspect is the understanding of geo-politics – particularly what is happening in Syria and ISIS, what is happening in Kurdistan referendum, Saudi block’s sanction situation against Qatar, political situation in Venezuela. All these are situations that would have impact on oil prices and hence on our consumers, on our fiscal deficit and on our economy. 

World is at the cross road of a major transition. This is with respect to the move towards Electric Vehicle (EV). There is a sense of credence about this – the only debate is probably the timing. We want to know your views on how things would shape up. Both in terms of renewable technologies such as solar and also in terms of enabling storage. 

I am asking you this because a lot of our planning and investment depends on this. This would decide if gas would act as an interim fuel or not. How much refining capacity to plan and when? 

We have taken several policy measures to completely overhaul the licensing regime in upstream segment with our HELP policy. We have also come out with NDR to make sure all the interested investors get full access to available geological information to take informed investment decisions. I would be interested to know how this is finding favour with investor community and what else can be done. 

Friends we have seen Indian professionals in Information technology (IT), banking and in the field of medicine throughout the World. The same level of participation is also expected in the global oil and gas industry. What can be done for skill development across the hydrocarbon value chain to make sure that the workforce is fully trained to service the Indian and the global oil and gas industries? 

In this regards we are very keen to know the format of co-operation between the industry and the academia in major energy centres such as Huston, Calgary, Aberdeen etc. 

I saw the program, there is a session on technological innovation in the oil and gas industry and if India could take lead in that. This is of huge interest to me. 

Exponential technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IOT), Block Chain etc can change the way oil and gas industry is run in future and we in India cannot afford to miss out on this front. 

I wish all the best to the experts and participants for a rich deliberation and exchange of ideas in the next two days. 

Thank you!

Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, today held a meeting with Secretary General OPEC, H.E. Mr. Sanusi Mohammad Barkindo in New Delhi. Mr Barkindo is in India to attend the first CERAWEEK India Energy Forum. The two had last met in Vienna in May 2017 for the 2nd India-OPEC Institutional Dialogue. India’s engagement with OPEC is an important as India sources about 86% of crude oil, 75% of natural gas, 95% of LPG from OPEC member countries. 

The two sides discussed the current scenario of oil and gas industry of the world and exchanged notes on the recent developments. 

During the meeting, Sh. Pradhan highlighted that in today’s oversupplied market, it was important for producers to understand the perspective of consuming countries and the changes that have taken place in these demand centers. In this context, he emphasized the need for a purposeful and improved dialogue among producer and consumer countries. Shri Pradhan reiterated that OPEC should work towards “Responsible Pricing” which is important for India for socio-economic and developmental reasons He emphasized India’s earlier view of ‘Asian Dividend rather than charging Asian Premium’ on the crude supplied to India and said that countries like India should actually be the “preferred destination”. He suggested that OPEC at its Ministerial meetings give wider consideration to India’s requests. 

Shri Pradhan said that India is putting a lot of emphasis on diversifying its crude oil supply sources and tapping new supply sources. In this context, he highlighted the arrival of two shipments of crude oil cargo of 1.6 million barrels from US. The three Indian public sector refineries have already placed a cumulative order 7.85 million barrel from the US. In addition, a private sector refiner has also placed an order of 2 million barrel from the US. 

Minister was accompanied by Senior Officials from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and also CEOs of seven public and private sector refineries who together operate all 23 refineries in India processing over 235 MMT of crude annually. 

Minister extended invitation to SG OPEC to attend the 16th Ministerial Meeting of International Energy Forum scheduled to take place in India in April 2018. SG accepted the invitation.

Addressing the august gathering, Shri Singh said that looking at the future of growing power consumption in India, it is expected that the per capita energy consumption would expand at a breakneck speed, tripling in the next 5-7 years. The Minister assured the members of Industry that the Government would extend all possible support and remove all impediments in the path of investments in the power sector. “Electricity is the future of economic growth in India. This growth cannot take place without Industry participation. I invite you to come and invest in India’s Energy sector”, Shri Singh said.

 Speaking further on his vision for revamping of Power sector in India, the Minister said that his Ministry is in the final stages of codifying laws on a number of fronts including State Governments/DISCOMs honouring of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and penalties for delinquencies; all DISCOMs to have tied up PPAs to cover 100% power requirements including peak loads before licenses are renewed; the Renewable Purchase Obligations to be made statutory; making Smart Meters mandatory and penalties to be imposed for non-payment of electricity bills, inter alia.

 Shri Singh also informed the gathering that in the near future, to keep pace with this rapid change in the Renewable Energy Sector, Industry needs to partner with the Government in investing in Green Energy Corridors, Battery Storage Technology, Grid Improvement, Electric Vehicles Programme etc. The Minister invited the Industry stalwarts to devise the future strategy to achieve the above goal, in coordination with the Government. “Our time has come to lead the World in Clean Energy, the Industry must not be left behind in this endeavour”, Shri Singh added.

Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director, International Energy Agency (IEA), called on the Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri R.K. Singh, here today. The two dignitaries discussed the role of India on the emerging Global energy stage, the steps that the country is taking to boost clean energy dependence of its economy; and the role that India can play in reducing global carbon footprint by using the IEA platform. The four main areas of focus of IEA are energy security, economic development, environmental awareness and engagement worldwide. 

During the interaction, Shri R.K. Singh noted that energy is the basic need for any economy for bringing its citizens out of poverty, generate livelihood and improve the general standards of living. India, with 1/6th of World’s population, still has very low per energy consumption and emissions intensity, when compared to the World average value. The scope of India’s Energy sector expansion is huge, Shri Singh added. 

Shri Singh said that the cost of energy generated through clean energy sources such as solar and wind have drastically come down in the last 3 years and ‘Renewable Energy (RE) is the Energy of the Future’. India is taking huge strides in the RE sector and has taken a lead on the global stage by launching the International Solar alliance. IEA should encourage all its member countries to increase the share of RE in their respective energy baskets, Shri Singh added. 

“India is moving to the centre of the Global Energy Stage”, said Dr. Birol sighting IEA’s flagship World Energy Outlook (WEO). Dr. Birol is responsible for the WEO publication, which is recognised as the most authoritative source for strategic analysis of global energy markets. He is also the founder and chair of the IEA Energy Business Council which provides a forum for cooperation between the energy industry and policymakers.

ITI Limited has emerged as the lowest bidder (L1 bidder) in this reverse auction, followed by Genus Power and KEONICS. ITI Limited quoted the lowest price of Rs. 2503, per single phase smart meter.

 

L&T had emerged as the lowest bidder in the first round of bids conducted last week, where the company had quoted Rs. 2722. Through the reverse auction, the price of the single phase smart meter has come down from Rs. 2722 to Rs. 2503 which is a reduction of 8% from the previous tender quote. The lower price discovered through reverse auction will further benefit the end consumers. Seven companies including L&T were invited for the reverse auction, as per tender terms and conditions where L&T has been outbid by ITI Limited, Genus Power and KEONICS.

 

As per government guidelines, EESL will invite Genus Power and KEONICS, who have emerged as the L2 and L3 bidders respectively, to match the L1 price.  Should the said parties match the L1 price, EESL will split the procurement of the single phase smart meter between three parties in a ratio of 50:30:20.

 

The meters will be installed over a period of 3 years in a phased manner in Uttar Pradesh UP) and Haryana.

 

The procurement conducted by EESL, a company under the administrative control of Ministry of Power, Government of India (GoI), is the world’s largest single Smart Meter procurement. 40 lakh smart meters will be deployed in UP and the remaining 10 lakh in Haryana.

 

Smart meters are a part of the overall Advanced Metering Infrastructure Solutions (AMI) aimed at better demand response designed to reduce energy consumption during peak hours. The overall AMI solution will also have a system integrator who will be responsible for meter installation, data storage on cloud, preparing dashboards, etc. The bids for the system integrator is expected to open on October 31, 2017.

 

 EESL is procuring the smart meters and services of the system integrator with 100% investment and the Utilities will make zero-investment. The repayment to EESL will be through savings resulting from enhanced billing efficiency, avoided meter reading costs, etc. It is said that the average cost of meter reading is Rs. 40 per meter, which will be completely avoided.

 

EESL is driven by the objective of facilitating faster adoption of future-ready technology solutions while balancing economic development and environmental sustainability. EESL is committed to enabling a complete transformation of the energy infrastructure in the country with unique solutions.

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri R.K. Singh reviewed power sector development in the State of Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar today. The senior functionaries from Ministry of Power, Government of India, Central Power Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and key officials of Government of Jammu & Kashmir were also present during the review meeting. 

During the review, Shri Singh reiterated the commitment of Government of India to provide uninterrupted reliable power supply to all the citizens of the country including Jammu & Kashmir and advised all concerned to ensure electrification of remaining 100 census villages by December 2017. These villages exist in remote areas with difficult hilly terrain in the districts of Kishtwar, Kupwara, Reasi, Bandipore, Leh, Kargil & Rajauri. Electrification of these villages would ensure electricity access to 100% census villages of the State and catalyse desired improvement in the quality of life of people of the State and also create new opportunities for economic activities and jobs for the youth. The CPSUs of Government of India are providing requisite support to Government of J&K for implementation of these projects. 

During the visit, Shri Singh emphasized on expeditious implementation of projects sanctioned by Government of India under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and Pradhan Mantri Development Plan (PMDP) for strengthening of transmission, sub-transmission and distribution system of the State. Apart from transmission & distribution, the status of generation and availability of power supply was also reviewed. Effective implementation of these projects would ensure availability of a robust electricity infrastructure in the State to realise the goal of ‘24x7 Power for All’ at affordable prices, Shri Singh said. 

Shri Singh also emphasized upon desired improvement in operational efficiency in distribution sector including billing & collection efficiency to ensure financial sustainability. Further, the officials of Government of J&K were also advised to initiate preparatory activities for implementation of new scheme ‘Saubhagya’, recently launched by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi for providing last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining households in the country and assured all kind of support from Government of India. 

During the day, the Minister also met the Governor, Shri N. N. Vohra and Chief Minister of the State, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti and discussed about faster implementation of power projects in the State so that the people of J&K get 24x7 Quality Power at affordable prices.

                • Lowest quote of Rs. 2722, per single phase smart meter

•         Genus Power and KEONICS emerge as second and third lowest bidders

 

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has emerged as the lowest bidder of the tender issued by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to procure 50 Lakh smart meters. The company has been selected through an international competitive bidding. The meters will be installed over a period of 3 years in a phased manner in Uttar Pradesh UP) and Haryana. L&T quoted the lowest price of Rs. 2722, per single phase smart meter.

 

The tender floated by EESL, a company under the administrative control of Ministry of Power, Government of India (GoI), is the world’s largest single Smart Meter procurement. Fourteen leading manufacturers from around the world participated in the tender. 40 lakh smart meters will be deployed in UP and the remaining 10 lakh in Haryana. The price quoted by L&T is 40-50% lower than the current market rates.

 

Smart meters are a part of the overall Advanced Metering Infrastructure Solutions (AMI) aimed at better demand response designed to reduce energy consumption during peak hours. The overall AMI solution will also have a system integrator who will be responsible for meter installation, data storage on cloud, preparing dashboards, etc. The bids for the system integrator will open on October 31, 2017.

 

The meters are being procured for implementation of smart grid projects in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since these states grapple with huge AT&C losses, with the latest figures for both states being 28.42% and 34.36% respectively[1]. The smart meters will help these states in not only significantly reducing their AT&C losses by way of increased billing efficiency, but will completely change the way in which electrical energy is presently being consumed and paid for by the consumers. Installation of these smart meters along with its associated communication and IT infrastructure will enable the DISCOMs to obtain real time energy consumption data of each consumer for subsequent analysis.

 

The Smart meters procured by EESL use GPRS technology to allow 2 –way communication between the DISCOM and consumers. Once installed, an energy supplier can read a meter via the mobile phone network. Householders can also receive a digital display which helps them to access how much power they are consuming – and its cost – in real time. Smart meters enable one to see the consumption pattern and the cost. This means one can adapt the energy use and cut down on waste to provide financial savings to consumers. They further provide an accurate and real-time information about the energy use, enabling one to take informed decisions about their energy behaviour.

 

EESL is procuring the smart meters and services of the system integrator with 100% investment and the Utilities will make zero-investment. The repayment to EESL will be through savings resulting from enhanced billing efficiency, avoided meter reading costs, etc. It is said that the average cost of meter reading is Rs. 40 per meter, which will be completely avoided.

 

EESL is driven by the objective of facilitating faster adoption of disruptive technology solutions while balancing economic development and environmental sustainability. EESL is committed to enabling a complete transformation of the energy infrastructure in the country with unique solutions.

			    Japanese Railways is one of the oldest Rail system in the world. Japan is the pioneer in the High Speed Rail ‘Shinkansen’. Japanese Railways has an impeccable record with Safety. Ministry of Railways (GoI) had requested Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) for technical cooperation in Rail Safety.

			     Responding to Ministry of Railway’s request, MLIT deputed a team of Japanese Railway experts to India to assess incidents of rail breakage and suggest measures to improve safety in train operations. The Memorandum of Cooperation on Railway safety was signed on 17.2.2017 between Ministry of Railways (GoI) and MLIT, Japan.

   Minister of State for Railways & Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge) Shri Manoj Sinha was specially present to grace the occasion. Member Traction Railway Board& Patron, IREE, Shri Ghanshyam Singh, other Railway Board Members, Additional Member Electrical, Railway Board & President, IREE Mr. V. K. Agarwal and senior officials were also present on the occasion.

 

            Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal said, ""Indian Railways is working with a renewed attitude and confidence. The mindset of Indian Railways has changed. Indian Railways is working with “will do/can do” spirit, for the Government, Development is a positive agenda. Indian Railways is working in a mission mode and coming up with solutions to the problems. Indian Railways is working with a commitment to serve in a time bound manner for the common people. For the common people, Railways is the preferred mode of transport. 1.3 million Railwaymen have dedicated themselves to serve with commitment. We are working in time bound manner, skillfully, effectively to transform Indian Railways truly to a world class, safe and modern transporter.  As India showed the world a new light in replacement of LED bulbs, similarly Indian Railways shall lead the world by achieving 100 % electrification. Indian Railways by applying economies of scale shall be able to accomplish 100% electrification at lower prices with “an incentive cum penalty” framework scheme. A holistic plan is required to carry out 100 % electrification. This conference shall ensure to find solutions to all the bottlenecks with a view to implement the electrification in mission mode. “To think is easy, to act is difficult but to act as you think is most difficult” & Indian Railways has accepted this most difficult challenge. The question is are we destined to live in the past or we are ready to change? We will have to change as per the best in the world. With New India, we have to build New Indian Railways which is modern, safe and run with better speed. We should not let down the next generation by not incorporating modern ways.

               Speaking on the occasion,  Minister of State for Railways & Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge), Shri Manoj Sinha said, ""Indian Railways have set a massive target of 100 % electrification, meeting this huge target is a challenge, this conference will provide an insight how we may achieve this target. Also, Green Initiatives and adopting viable sources of energy over Indian Railways has been our priority in past three years.""

 

            Minister of State for Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain who could not attend the event has, however, in his message sent for the souvenir said, “Indian Railways is the most energy efficient mode of transport and therefore, is considered as the most environmentally sustainable transport system. With rapid economic growth, the transport sector is also growing and increasing its energy demand. Transport sector being the biggest consumer of energy, especially railway as the single largest consumer with share of about 2% of National energy consumption.

Mission Electrification, a strategic shift for Railways is a bold initiative taken up by Indian Railway wherein it has been decided to undertake electrification of complete railway network at a rapid pace. This along with Decarbonization initiatives will propel increased use of Renewables in Railways.”

 

Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani in his message for the souvenir said, “Rail being the most energy efficient mode of transport is further working to change the energy mix towards greener sources and has taken number of steps in this direction. We need to continue to innovate so as to make railway cost effective, sustainable and a preferred carrier. In this regard, 100% Electrification now targeted will serve an ideal stepping stone, wherein technological inputs are required to accelerate electrification. This conference will lead to many such solutions to speed up electrification projects, increase speeds and use of renewable energy in the rail sector in an effective manner leading to reduced operational costs.”

 

         Speaking on the occasion, Member Traction, Railway Board, Shri Ghanshyam Singh said, “Under the able leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister and guidance of Hon’ble Minister of Railway, Indian Railway has committed itself to serve the people of this nation by improving its services and thus gradually transforming itself into an efficient and reliable public and goods transporting agency across the country. As announced by Hon’ble MR, to take the pace of Electrification to about 30 KM per day, we are going for precast foundation, mechanization of construction & are introducing various technologies and systemic changes in our bidding system also by bringing in bigger contract packages. Electrification is a powerful measure to achieve cost effectiveness. It improves mobility by use of high power energy efficient Locomotives, facilitate shift of traffic from road to rail and also to reduce carbon footprints. In addition electrification will also reduce traction energy bill substantially from present energy bill of Rs 26,500 Cr. to Rs 16,000 Cr i.e. by about 40%, thereby will improve operating ratio. IR has already reduced the electric traction bill of Rs 10,600 Cr in 2014-15 by about Rs 1200 Cr over the last two years by procuring power under Open access and the same is likely to reduce further, giving railway an annual saving of about Rs 3000 Cr by end of this financial year.”

 

         President of Indian Railways Electrical Engineers (IREE) and Additional Member (Electrical), Railway Board, Shri V.K.Aggarwal said, “IREE conference aims to discuss implementable technological solutions and financing towards speedy electrification, induction of high speed locos & solutions to fruitfully use renewable energy models to achieve target of 1200 megawatt installation by 2020 and thus achieve the broader goal of transforming Indian Railways as one of the most efficient rail network in the world.”

         The main objective of the two days international conference is to bring green power project developers and other stakeholders on a common platform for making Indian Railways (IR) an efficient and Greener mode of transport. This will open an international discussion on various Green initiatives including use of renewable energy, shift towards electric traction, development of new locomotive technology, high speed rail traction system and development in generation of Solar/Wind power as well as use of energy in efficient ways.

     This conference will work as a platform to learn & share experiences of international & national experts and industry leaders on electrification, renewable energy technologies & solutions and best practices in the Rail Sector. This will further promote and popularize ‘Make in India’ initiative a new Indian Railways through promoting a sustainable approach implementing Energy Efficiency and increasing use of Renewable Energy in Indian Railways.

     In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Footprints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.

In line with this vision, following action plan is undertaken:

a) Electrification of Railway Tracks

Currently about 33,000 rkm of tracks are electrified i.e. 40% of Railway network is electrifiedthough it carries about 55% coaching and 65% freight traffic at about only 35% of total fuel bill of Indian Railways. We are now going for 100% Railway electrification and to achieve this task, 33000 RKM of Railway network will be electrified on fast track by 2021-22. This will reduce energy bill from present level of Rs 26,500 Cr. to about Rs 16,000 Cr. i.e. savings of Rs 10,000 Cr. per annum with almost 100% operation on electric traction. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach.

b) Mission 41K & Open Access

To further bring down the energy bill on Indian Railways, Railway have started procuring power through ‘Open Access’ and in this year the electric traction bill is likely to reduce by Rs 2500 Cr. i.e. 25% on annualized basis as against the bill of 2014-15. As you may be aware that earlier Mission 41K was launched with an aim to generate a cumulative saving of about ₹41,000 cr in electric traction bill from 2015 to 2025 by procuring power from ‘Open Access’. You will be happy to know that we are doing much better than what was targeted and till Sept. 2017 we have saved about Rs. 5100 Cr, i.e. Rs. 1000 Cr, more than what was estimated in Mission 41k document.

c) Harnessing Renewable Energy on Indian Railways to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints

Indian Railways has planned to set up about 1000 MW solar and about 200 MW wind power plants by 2020-21 across Zonal Railways & Production Units. So far more than 60 MW of solar & wind power plants have already been installed covering 270 stations & 120 administrative buildings & hospitals and further orders for about 150 MW have been  placed for solar plants on roof tops of Railway Buildings. Moreover Railways are also working for setting up 400MW capacity through various other agencies to source energy in various states through land based solar plants.

Railways is effectively using its roof top for putting up solar plants under PPP, which has made it possible for Railways to purchase power at a much lesser cost. There by again saving in the energy bill without any investment. Under this model about 150 MW solar plants have been ordered till date.

d) Production of Energy Efficient High Horsepower Locomotives

Indian Railway is also on the path of development of High speed Passenger locomotive with speed potential of 200 kmph.  Works on high speed locomotive is going on full steam and is expected to be turned out by CLW in March 2018. In addition Indian Railways is planning to acquire high horse power, (9000 HP) passenger locomotive capable of hauling trains at 200 kmph on routes identified for semi high speed operation (160-200 kmph). It is planned to upgrade the existing 6000 HP freight and passenger locos to 9000 HP to improve the hauling speeds for freight trains and number of coaches for Passenger trains. It’s a ‘Make in India’ initiative already started at CLW.

e) Head On Generation (HOG)

Indian Railways have introduced HOG system wherein the lighting, air-conditioning and other electrical loads of passenger coaches would be fed directly from electric power drawn by locomotive from grid. This system will do away with the requirement of diesel power car for feeding electric supply to coaches and also enable in carrying additional passengers. On date 34 trains are already running on HOG system & are giving a saving of about Rs. 87 Cr per annum and additionally 64 trains will be taken on HOG system in the current fiscal year.

f) Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs)

All new EMUs produced will be energy efficient with three phase technology having regeneration capability. Working on multi prolonged strategies to reduce this energy consumption Railways are now inducting only 3 phase energy efficient regenerative locomotives and EMUs from 2016-17.

     During the conference Hon'ble Minister for Railways & Coal. Shri Piyush Goyal  dedicated Solar Power Plant of 5 MWp to the nation.This is the first largest Plant commissioned by Indian Railway on the roof top of Hazrat Nizamuddin, New Delhi, Anand Vihar & Delhi Railway Station.
     This project was awarded under PPP model in December 2016 at Rs. 4.14 per unit and it was the lowest tariff on Indian Railways at that time. The Plant has been commissioned in record period of 10 months. The entire cost of the project i.e., Rs.37.45 Cr. have been bought in by the Developer under Public Private Partnership model. The developer will also maintain it for 25 years and Railways will only pay energy consumed at Rs. 4.14 per unit and the facility of Net-metering is also available where the excess power supply is fed into the DISCOMs. This will save Rs. 421.4 Lac and will meet about 30% of the requirement of these installations. It will also reduce 6082 Tonnes CO2 emission per year.

The Railway Minister also released a souvenir on this occasion.

There were also following technical sessions:-

a.) Theme: Green Energy Projects-Opportunities for Partnerships.

b.) Theme: Meeting IR’s High Speed Locomotive Requirements.

c.) Theme: Energy Efficiency - Technology & Solutions.

In most of the cases, the post will increase from existing 01 post to 02 posts. In important divisions like Delhi, the number of posts of ADRMs will increase to 03 posts in place of existing 02. In case of two divisions in Mumbai, in Western & Central Railways, the number of ADRM posts will increase to 04 from the existing 02 post- one post of ADRM in each of the two Mumbai Divisions will be exclusively for handling suburban services.

			Empowerment of GMs, DRMs and field officials of Indian Railways –(A step towards steady and systematic transformation of Railways)

			●        Empowerment of frontline officials through enhanced delegation of powers:-

			In order to improve the functioning of Railways, substantial financial and administrative powers covering a wide spectrum of working have been delegated by the Indian Railways to General Managers (GM),Divisional Railway Managers (DRM) and field officials. Hon’ble Minister of Railways, Shri Piyush Goyal, while reviewing the unfortunate incident at Elphinstone Station Mumbai Suburban Railway on 29.09.2017 had directed Railway Board to empower the GMs, DRMs and field units, so as to fast track decision making, execution and the overall working of Railways. This mammoth exercise has been completed in a record time in consultation with stakeholders including GMs, DRMs and other railway officials and staff.

			●       Comprehensive delegation based on 10 Principles for Steady and Systematic Transformation:-

			Hon’ble Minister had outlined 10 principles on the basis of which, transformation in governance can be achieved. These are being applied to working of Government and have been the guiding force for the delegation of powers as well. These include Decisive Leadership, Outcome Oriented Action, Root Cause Analysis, Prioritization of Issues, Time Bound Execution, Innovative Financing, Technology Focus,Accountability and Close Monitoring, Partnership with Stakeholders, and Rule of Law and transparency. The delegation is comprehensive,and covers commercial, engineering works, track maintenance, mechanical, financial, establishment, procurement and medical matters,and will improve safety, speed and service of Railways.

			IMPACT OF ENHANCED DELEGATION AND EMPOWERMENT

			i.)                  Improved Safety

			GMs have been given full powers to sanction out of turn safety related workswithout any ceiling, within the financial limit set out by Ministry of Finance. DRMs /Chief Workshop Managers (CWMs) have been given powers to re-engage retired railway employees up to 62 years of age against vacancies. This will take care of safety and maintenance related works wherever there are vacancies. Enhanced powers for repairs of Track Machines have also been given to the field officers for faster track safety work. Further, procedures have been substantially simplified for procurement of material like spare parts for locomotives, coaches etc.

			ii.)                Faster access to work/breakdown sites

			Junior field officers and supervisor in charges have been provided multi-utility vehicles, and may hire vehicles up to Rs 5,000/- per case for rushing to breakdown sites without loss of time; this will lead to faster restoration of train services and improve punctuality/safety of trains.

			iii.)              Improve stations and passenger interfaces

			Power of DRMs to sanction amenities and works (like waiting halls, platform shelter, lifts/escalators, digital chart displays, illumination, train/coach indication board) has been increased from Rs 1 cr to Rs 2.5 cr per case.

			Powers have been given to DRMs for repair of computers, printers and other equipment for Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS)/Passenger Reservation System (PRS), up to Rs 50 lakhs per case, to reduce passenger inconvenience in case of a break down. Further, they have been fully empowered for hiring of space for opening of UTS/PRS at non-rail head terminals. This will hugely benefit passengers in remote areas for booking tickets.

			Station Directors in large Stations have been now given the powers of the Branch Officers in the divisions to enable them to take decisions for smooth operations. Instructions have also been issued to post young and dynamic officers as Station Directors at 75 important stations.

			iv.)              Ease of procurement by user departments

			Departments have been empowered for procurement through Government E-Marketplace (GeM) directly up to Rs 25,000/- per case with a ceiling of Rs 10 lakh per department in the zone.

			v.)                Innovative financing & efficient execution of projects

			DRMs have been given full powers to undertake projects on Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT) basis like setting up of laundry for linen cleaning, which will reduce set up time of essential amenities.

			vi.)              Improved upkeep of equipment

			Divisional officers have now been empowered to enter into Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) of critical equipment with OEMs to ensure uninterrupted service.

			vii.)            Swachh Bharat: Improve cleanliness and hygiene at stations and in trains

			DRMs have been empowered to enter into service contracts like cleaning of stations and trains upto Rs 100 cr from earlier Rs 20 cr. They will be able to enter into long term contracts, which would attract participation of quality vendors.To ensure important services are not discontinued in case of contract failures, they can engage a new approved vendor following a quotation process.

			Full powers have been given to DRMs to sanction environment related works like solar panels, rainwater harvesting, rainy wells, water recycling.

			viii.)          Enhanced revenue earning

			DRMs have been given full powers to enter into earning contracts like leasing of parcel space, brake van, parking, publicity etc. which, will improve earnings for Railways. They will also have land licensing powers to help in early commissioning of private sidings.

			ix.)              Improved Security

			GMs can now sanction 2 wheelers for all RPF chowki in-charges to improve their mobility and response for better safety and security.

			x.)                Move towards Digital India

			GMs have been given powers for software development up to Rs 2.5 cr per case and DRMs up to Rs 10 lakh per case.This will improve technology adoption at the operational level while enhancing efficiency.

			xi.)              Enhanced training & capacity building of staff

			Substantial powers have been given to DRMs for training of staff in new technologies which, will improve efficiency and productivity of staff. Power has been quadrupled to Rs 40,000 per trainee per course from Rs 10,000 earlier.

			xii.)            Way Forward - Model Schedule of Powers for Zonal Railways

			A model Schedule of Power (SOP) covering the best practices of all zonal railways is also under preparation and would be released shortly. The model SOP would serve as a guiding document and minimum benchmark for delegations of powers by GMs to DRMs and field units. However, this would not restrict GMs from further delegating powers and in fact, would encourage them to adapt as per local requirements.

Railway Board constitutes a high level expert committee to inquire into the reasons for delay in the tender process for new Elphinstone Road station Bridge and suggest measures to minimise such Delays. 
 

Pratyush Sinha, Former CVC, to head the expert committee.

A committee consisting of 5 Senior Administrative Grade Officers (Joint Secretary level) under the Presidentship of Chief Safety Officer, W.Rly, was formed to inquire into the incidence of stampede on north end FOB of Elphinstone Road Station on Mumbai Central - Dadar suburban section on 29/9/17. The enquiry committee issued public notice inviting members of public having knowledge relating to the incidence and any matter connected therewith and desiring to give evidence. The committee examined all the matters pertaining to the incidence including the evidence from the witnesses, the written statement of injured persons, Railway officials of Elphinstone road station and analysis of footages of all the CCTV cameras installed at the station including those located on the FOB.                                             

The Committee concluded that the incident occurred due to sudden downpour of heavy rains and accumulation of commuters on FOB and stair case at around 10.00 hrs onwards on that date.  The situation got further aggravated when one bundle of flowers of a vendor dropped followed by someone shouting that ""Majha phool padla"" and some commuters mistook the word “phool” for “pull”. This may have possibly triggered panic and led to stampede.             

The committee also recommended certain short term and long term measures for Mumbai Suburban stations. 

It is brought out that the issue of Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) for Elphinstone Road FOB took about 18 months. Railway Board has decided to constitute a high level expert committee to inquire into the reasons for delay in the whole process and suggest ways and means to ensure that such delays can be minimised in future. This committee would be headed by Shri Pratyush Sinha (Retd Chief Vigilance Commissioner) with Shri Vinayak Chatterjee, Chairman CII Economic Affairs council, and Shri Subodh Jain, (Retd Member Engineering , Railway Board)  as  Members and current Director Safety, Rly Board, Shri Pankaj Kumar  as Member Secretary.

                  Hon’ble Vice President of India, Shri Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu inaugurated an International Conference on Technological Advancements in Railway and Metro Projects (IC-TRAM 2017) and an Exhibition  on October 6 - 7, 2017 at New Delhi.. The conference  Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal also addressed the conference. The Conference has been organized by the Defence Infrastructure Planning & Management Council(DIPM), the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Urban Development and the Niti Aayog. The Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani, Member, Niti Aayog and  Chief Patron of DIPM Society,  Dr. V. K. Saraswat,  and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

     Addressing the conference, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Technology along with managerial excellence can chart a new trajectory.

     The Vice President said that with urbanization taking place at a rapid pace in India, the need for efficient and cost-effective transport is critical in ensuring faster mobility and sustainable development. He further said that new concepts such as ‘Transit Oriented Development’ should be tried out and promoted which will improve the lives of people living around the metro stations in a big way.

     The Vice President said that the Indian Railways need to plan for a massive expansion very meticulously with forward looking, efficient technologies and innovative practices currently available across the globe and adopt them to serve our country’s aspiring population. He further said that the IT revolution sweeping the world, to which India has also been a major contributor, is bound to improve the efficiencies in signaling, communications and safety and help in areas like intelligent transportation systems.

     The Vice President said that in the Indian ethos, we believe that science and technology are tools to improve the quality of life and we say “Bahujana hitaya, bahujana sukhaya” implying that we aim at the good of humanity at large and also care for the happiness of the entire population on this planet. We also believe this is possible if we are open to new ideas and concepts, either home grown or from outside, he added.

     The Vice President expressed his hope that the discussions and the deliberations in this two-day conference will provide a fast-track approach to build many state of the art railway systems that will improve the economy and the quality of life of people in India and the rest of the world.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am extremely happy to address this august gathering at the inaugural session of the International Conference on Technological Advancements in Railways and Metros.

From its origin purely as a colonial project in 1853, the Indian railways has emerged today as one of the largest rail networks in the world and an important economic engine in the growth and development narrative of India. It is estimated that in the next five years the Indian Railways will be the third largest railway system in the world accounting for 10 per cent of the global market.

With its extensive network, Indian Railways caters to lower, middle and upper middle classes for both, short and long distance travelling. It also one of the largest employers in the government and generates informal employment through forward and backward linkages.

Rail historian and journalist, Christian Wolmer, in an article succinctly summed up the transformative role played by the railways. He said: “Nowhere other than India is the railway so indelibly connected with the image of the nation. Just as there is no single country on earth that has such a broad cultural, ethnic, and racial mix as India, there is also no railway system that has played and, crucially, continues to play such a fundamental role”.

The Indian Railways connects the vast country through its extensive network of 64,000 km of track covering about 8,000 railway stations and 100,000 bridges as well as signalling and telecom network. It provides transport services to about two crore or 20 million passengers every day.  Each day, 20,000 trains criss-cross the length and breadth of India  serving, in a year,  a population of about 700 crore ( seven billion) people and transporting more than 1,000 MT (billion tons). 

With the number of passengers projected to touch thirty million in the next few years and the demand for transportation of goods also touching four million tons of freight daily in the near future, the railways are poised for a massive expansion.

I am told that investments to the tune of Rs. 8 lakh crore are planned in the next five years on various projects in the railways.

With urbanisation taking place at a rapid pace in India, the need for efficient and cost-effective transport is critical in ensuring faster mobility and sustainable development.

As part of meeting the growing transport demand in cities, several new metro rail projects are in different stages of execution, apart from those in operation at Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Kochi, Lucknow and Mumbai. Metros are under construction at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Noida, Navi Mumbai and Pune, among others. Several others are under consideration and planning. Once various metros become operational, the intra-city mobility will improve by leaps and bounds.

I also understand that new concepts such as ‘Transit Oriented Development’ being tried out will improve the lives of people living around the metro stations in a big way.

So, friends, the Indian Railways will have to plan for this massive expansion very meticulously. It will have to look for technologies and innovative practices currently available across the globe. It will have to be forward looking, efficient and adopt the state of the art technologies that serve our country’s inspirational population. Against this backdrop, this conference is very timely.

I am glad that this international conference is focusing on a host of technologies that are going to play a key role not only in improving the services but also in the safety of the commuters. 

The IT revolution sweeping the world, to which India has also been a major contributor, is bound to improve the efficiencies in signalling, communications and safety and help in areas like intelligent transportation systems.

I am glad that we have amidst us the Inventor of Maglev, also called magnetic levitation train. Maglev trains are very fast trains. Maglev trains float over a guide way using the basic principle of magnetic repulsion. This technology is apparently even ahead of High Speed Railways. Recently, we have embarked on collaboration with Japan to introduce high speed, ‘bullet trains’.

I am glad that technology is being harnessed for the welfare of the common man. In the Indian ethos, we believe that science and technology are tools to improve the quality of life and we say “Bahujana hitaya, bahujana sukhaya” implying that we aim at the good of humanity at large and also care for the happiness of the entire population on this planet. We also believe this is possible if we are open to new ideas and concepts, either home grown or from outside.

The ancient visionaries in India had given expression to this receptive approach when they said: “Aano Bhadrah Kratavo Yantu Vishwathah” (Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides). We should continue to build on this commonwealth of knowledge and wisdom.

Technology will also be a potential ally for improving the safety and security and enhance the quality of passenger experience. I hope this Conference will provide some new insights in this regard drawn from the global best practices.

The managers of our railway system must use every opportunity to update their knowledge and skills. Even the best systems in the world have to constantly keep learning and doing things differently to serve the populations better.

With about eight lakh crore planned investments, opening up of FDI in rail infrastructure and implementation of GST, I am sure the Indian railways will stand to benefit particularly in the long-distance transportation in the years ahead. Technology along with managerial excellence can chart a new trajectory.

I take this occasion to welcome all the experts gathered here today, congratulate the organizers and wish the conference a grand success.

I do hope that the discussions and the deliberations in this two-day conference will provide a fast-track approach to build many state of the art railway systems that will improve the economy and the quality of life of people in India and the rest of the world.

I wish to conclude with a fervent wish and a prayer from the 10th chapter of the Rig Veda that emphasises how we must continue this Jnana Yagna - the churning of ideas and sharing of creative thoughts- on a continuous basis with a common objective- creating for every one the happy world we all want:

BACKGROUNDER

     With the demand and volume for rail transport increasing manifold, there is a need for an efficient and state-of-the-art transportation system to meet the growing commuting requirements of the people in the urban areas and other parts of country. The Railways need to achieve their full growth potential with faster, reliable and more punctual services.

     With mobility requirements increasing several fold due to massive urbanization, the need for building Metros in our congested cities and strengthening the Railway infrastructure has become imperative and assumed critical proportions.

India is on the cusp of making a quantum leap into marking its infrastructure to be counted among the best in the world. The Railways and the Metro network are the lifeline of the nation connecting people and places. Both require huge investments, knowledge of advanced technologies and skill sets to execute projects without delays.

        A deficit in these parameters had held us back for long. Our present leadership is determined and decisive and we need to look ahead with confidence and with purpose.

      The conference will bring up new technological ideas and innovations to the fore and help Indian Railways embrace some of those ideas for moving forward in the present era. In the past two decades Indian Railways has grown manifold not just in terms of size and volume, but also in terms of usage of cutting-edge technologies. Today, Indian Railways, is entering new fields, such as High Speed Railways, Dedicated Freight Corridors, bridging new frontiers by laying tracks in inhospitable terrains of the North-East, building mountain railways and using alternative fuels to reduce dependence on fossil fuels to name a few initiatives.

In more or less the same period, (since Delhi Metro became operational in 2002), concurrently, there has been an awakening of sorts pan-India, in the direction of building more and more Metros to cater to the increased mobility requirements of the burgeoning population of the metropolitan towns. As of now some 35-40 metros are under planning or execution, aggregating a colossal investment of some $68 bn (Rs 4. 5 lakh crores) over the next five to seven years. This will soon make India one of the top Metro hubs in the world, ahead of some of the most advanced countries in the world.

           The conference deliberations should be taken forward in consultation with the clear intent of finding lasting solutions. In all, 40 speakers are scheduled to address the delegates over two days.

                The Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that highways works worth Rs 8 lakh crore will begin before the end of 2018 under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. He was speaking to media persons in New Delhi today, a day after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi approved Phase I of Bharatmala Pariyojana. Bharatmala is a new umbrella program for the highways sector that focuses on optimizing efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps.

 

Shri Gadkari said that Bharatmala will be a major driver for economic growth in the country, and help realize Prime Minister Shri Modi’s vision of a New India.   He said the programme has been designed to bridge the gaps in the existing highways infrastructure so as to make the movement of man and material more efficient. Special attention has been paid to fulfill the connectivity needs of  backward and tribal areas, areas of economic activity, places of religious and tourist interest, border areas, coastal areas and trade routes with neighbouring countries under the programme.

The Minister also said that Bharatmala will give the country 50 national corridors as opposed to the 6 we have at present. With this,  70 – 80 percent of freight will move along NH as against the 40 percent at present. The programme will help to connect 550 Districts in the country through NH linkages. Currently, only around 300 Districts have NH linkages. Bharatmala will also have a positive impact on the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) of the country. Apart from this, the Minister said the programme will also help generate a large number of direct and indirect employment in the construction activity, the development of highways amenities and also as part of the enhanced economic activity in different parts of the country that will result from better road  connectivity .

A total of around 24,800 kms are being considered in Phase I of Bharatmala. In addition, Bharatmala Pariyojana phase –I also includes 10,000 kms of balance road works under NHDP, taking the total to 34,800 kms at an estimated cost of Rs.5,35,000 crore. Bharatmala Phase I – is to be implemented over a five years period of i.e. 2017-18 to 2021-22. Components of Phase I and estimated expenditure are as follows :

Bharatmala envisages improving the efficiency of the National Corridor (Golden-Quadrilateral and NS-EW corridor) by decongesting its choke points through lane expansion, construction of ring roads, bypasses/ elevated corridors and logistics parks at identified points. Around 5,000 kms of the National Corridor will be taken up in Phase-I of Bharatmala at an estimated cost of Rs 100,000 crore.

 

The programme has identified around 26,200 km of Economic Corridors or routes that have heavy freight traffic,  of which 9,000 kms are being taken up for development in Phase-I at an estimated cost of Rs 1,20,000 crore.   It is planned to develop these corridors end to end to ensure seamless and speedy travel and uniformity in standards. Besides this, around 8,000 km of Inter-Corridors and around 7,500 km of Feeder Corridors have also been identified under Bharatmala, of which around 6000 km will be developed in Phase I at an estimated cost of Rs 80,000 crore.    Stretches of roads connecting more than 2 corridors are classified as Inter-Corridors routes, while other routes connecting to 1 or 2 corridors are termed as Feeder Corridors. These corridors will be developed so as to address the  infrastructure asymmetry that exists at many places .

 

Bharatmala also envisages building 3300 kms of Border Roads of strategic importance along international boundaries and 2000 km of International Connectivity roads to promote trade with  Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar . Out of this around 2000 km will be taken up under   Phase-I at an estimated cost of Rs 25,000 crore.

 

In addition to the above, around 2,100 km of coastal roads and 2000 km of port connectivity roads have been identified under Bharatmala of which 2,000 kms are being taken up under Phase-I at an estimated cost of Rs20,000 crore. About 1,900 km of stretches have been identified for development of green-field expressways of which around 800 kms will be taken up under Phase-I of the programme at an estimated cost of Rs.40,000 crore. The 10,000 km of balance road work under NHDP will be completed at a cost of Rs 1,50,000 crore.

 

The identification of the project stretches under the various components of Bharatmala has been done based on detailed O-D(Origin-Destination) study, freight flow projections and verification of the identified infrastructure gaps through geo mapping, using data from Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-Informatics (BISAG) as well as from other sources. This O-D study has also taken into account integration of economic corridors with the ongoing projects under NHDP and infrastructure asymmetry in major corridors.

In addition to Rs. 5,35,000 crore for Bharatmala Phase-I, there is a requirement of    Rs. 1,57,324 crore for ongoing schemes  like NH(O), SARDP-NE, EAP and LWE under implementation in the Highways Sector. Thus, the overall outlay for Bharatmala and all existing schemes put together will be Rs 6,92,324 crore over a period of 5 years.

 

Gross Budgetary Support for the Bharatmala program and existing schemes from 2017-18 to 2021--22 will be restricted to Rs. 2,37,024 crore from Central Road Fund (CRF), Rs 59,973 crore as Budgetary support, Rs. 34,000 crore from expected monetization through ToT route and Rs. 46,048 crore collected as Toll-Permanent Bridge Fee Fund (PBFF) by NHAI.

Projects under Bharatmala Phase-I are to be implemented through NHAI, NHIDCL, MoRTH and State PWDs. Provision has been made for effective delegation in appraisal /approval of individual project stretches. Effective delegation has been made in appraisal /approval of individual project stretches

a.       All PPP BOT (Toll) projects where no grant (or VGF) is given to the concessionaire and the construction and maintenance is financed by toll revenues will be appraised and approved by the Board of NHAI.

 

b.      All EPC projects implemented by NHAI will be approved by NHAI Board after proper appraisal, within the budgeted financial resources approved under this program.

 

c.        NHAI Board will be authorized to suitably delegate its powers on appraisal and approval of projects within NHAI.

 

All projects implemented under Bharatmala are to be technically, financially and economically appraised by an empowered Project Appraisal &Technical Scrutiny Committee to be setup in NHAI and MoRTH.

The Committee would comprise experts from NITI Aayog, and would be a dedicated unit which would place its recommendations on appraisal of projects to NHAI Board or Secretary, MoRTH, as the case may be,

Guidelines have been laid down for scrutiny of individual projects which are to be followed by all implementing agencies

Grand Challenge’ mechanism is to be adopted to encourage State Government participation in implementation of the program. Projects that are supported by proactive effort by the concerned State Governments shall be taken up on priority basis.

A total of around 600 projects have been identified across the components for Bharatmala. DPR preparation for 19,500 kms is underway currently.

                The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, has decided to implement a “Value Engineering Program” to promote the use of new technologies, materials, and equipment in highways projects executed either under PPP mode or public funding mode. The objective of the programme is to use innovative technology, materials and equipment to reduce the cost of projects and make them more environment friendly, while simultaneously ensuring that the roads or bridges and other assets get constructed much faster, are structurally stronger and more durable.  The Value Engineering Programme is expected to

·         increase speed of construction,

·          reduce construction cost,

·         increase asset durability and

·         improve aesthetics and safety.

The Ministry had constituted a National Panel of Experts (NPE) last year, for approving  proposals pertaining to deployment of (a) new/innovative/alternative materials, (b) new/innovative/alternative technologies and (c) new/innovative/alternative equipment in the highway sector. This panel has been reconstituted last week to include the following members :

 The NPE will examine all technical matters involving the new technologies, materials and equipment referred to it by the concerned Engineers or concessionaires/ contractors. The NPE will also resolve the technical issues which arise as a result of difference in view between engineers and concessionaires/contractors regarding implementation of the new and innovative technologies, materials and equipment. In addition, it  will also decide about the need for field trials of any new or innovative technology/materials/ equipment before its adoption, and  finalize associated design approaches, construction methodologies/sequences as well as the relevant specifications/codes/ guidelines so that the contractor may use the proposed new/alternative materials/technologies/ equipment in project highway.

                National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has so far planted about 10 lakh plants along national highways in this monsoon season. This includes about 4 lakh avenue plants and about 6 lakh plants on the highway medians. The plantation drive is part of NHAI’s activity towards ensuring and upholding the cause of Swachh Bharat Mission in providing clean, green and pollution free National Highways. The drive is taken up as a regular activity during monsoons and continues even afterwards with watering and maintenance of the plants. Plantation work has been mainstreamed as an integral part of highway development projects, thereby ensuring that our highways remain clean, green and pollution free.

The Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari, along with Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh, will lay the foundation stone for four National Highways projects worth Rs 1121 crore and several shipping projects worth Rs 200 crore in Andaman and Nicobar Islands in events at Port Blair, Diglipur and Baratang today and tomorrow.

The highways projects for which foundation stone will be laid include construction of 26 km of NH between Beodnabad- Ferrargunj at a cost of Rs 170 crore and 56 km of NH between Austin Creek and Kalra Junction at a cost of Rs 410 crore. In addition, foundation stone will be laid for construction of Middle Strait Creek Bridgeand Humphrey Strait Creek Bridge at estimated cost of Rs 262.97 crore and Rs 277.17 crore respectively.

 

In addition to the above, work is also in various stages of progress for other highways projects. National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) is handling highways work amounting to Rs 6330 Crore in A&N Islands. Much of these works pertain to rehabilitation and upgradation of NH-4 . 

 

On the Shipping side an Alternate Sea Route to Baratang Island will be launched. The project has been completed at a cost of Rs 45.16 crore and aims to improve connectivity of the island from Port Blair, reduce traffic on the route which passes through the Jarawa Tribal Reserve, thus promoting tourism without disturbing the tribal areas.  The Ministers will also lay the foundation stone for Extension of Wharf in Hope Town, Port Blair by 200 meters at an expenditure of Rs 17.49 crore. The Wharf is used by Indian Oil Corporation for discharging LPG and other petroleum products. The extension of jetty would allow berthing of bigger vessels of upto160 meter length and higher capacity. This will help in increasing availability of LPG cylinders in the area while reducing logistic costs. In addition to this, foundation stone will also be laid for construction of Additional Approach Jetty, extension of Berthing Jetty & Dredging in front of Jetty, Neil Island at a cost of Rs. 38.19 Crore and extension of existing New Dry Dock – II in Port Blair at a cost of Rs 96.24 Crore.

 

In addition to the above, shipping facilities in the inter- island sector are being augmented. New vessels are being constructed across various categories at a total cost of about Rs 1350 Crore. Total 25 ships are proposed for acquisition by the A&N Administration.

                The Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will launch the countrywide Free Eye Check-up Campaign and distribution of spectacles for truck drivers, cleaners and helpers on 2nd October, 2017 at Panjari Toll Plaza, Nagpur Bypass, Nagpur in Maharashtra. The objective of this initiative is to ensure clearer vision and safe travel for truck drivers who are the most frequent users of national highways.

Eyesight is a basic requirement for safe driving. Poor vision increases the risk of collisions due to the driver’s inability to recognise and react in time to a hazard or the behaviour of other road users.  The NHAI has decided to launch a Free Eye Check-up Campaign and distribute spectacles for truck drivers, cleaners and helpers on the 2nd October 2017, which will continue for 5 days i.e. till 6th October. Free Eye Check-up Camps for drivers is one of the many innovative programmes undertaken by NHAI to ensure safe travel along national highways. This initiative is expected to reduce the number of accidents involving trucks and encourage regional staff and NGOs to set up such camps on regular basis.

The cleaners can also avail of this facility on the condition of producing a valid driving license. 50 free eye check-up camps will be set up on identified national highways on either side. The camps will be manned by eye specialist and support staff volunteers. Facilities like toilets and beverages vending machines, adequate space for parking of approximately 50 trucks, hand wash etc. shall be made available in these camps. One more component of these camps will be distribution of free spectacles up to a certain power as prescribed by the eye specialist. Any other defect like cataract will be identified and medicines will be prescribed. Non-governmental organizations, governments, social enterprises and private businesses are being roped in for facilitating the provision of these facilities.

                The Department of Rural Development has been making concerted efforts to improve the work availability in rural areas. Besides wage employment opportunities under MGNREGS, it is also promoting skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled wage labour in a very large rural housing programme like PMAY-Gramin and in road construction sector under PMGSY. The Budget of the Department of Rural Development has more than doubled since 2012-13. Adding the State contribution, in all the programmes as also the large transfers under the 14th Finance Commission for rural infrastructure, the total fund available is over 3 times of what it was 5 years ago. 51 lakh houses under construction, nearly 1 lakh kilometers of roads in different stages of construction and large scale wage work available under MGNREGS especially for agriculture and allied activities, have ensured greater opportunities for wage employment. 

The Department is also promoting enterprises through a concerted thrust on Bank loan linkage for women Self-Help Groups under Deendayal Antyodaya National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). Currently, the linkage is of more than Rs. 47,000 crores, which is being used to promote useful enterprises like Custom Hiring Centers, Rural transport, agriculture and allied activities, animal husbandry, horticulture, handloom and handicrafts, retail business etc. The Bank linkage for women Self-Help Groups has also more than doubled over the last 3 years. The placement-based wage employment skill programmes like DDU-GKY and the self-employment programmes through RSETI are also helping households to move up the skilling ladder and in diversifying livelihoods. 

MGNREGS being a demand-based programme, over Rs.40,000 crores from Government of India has already been released to States. Adequate funds have been released for drought affected States like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. On account of drought, States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and parts of Telangana have also received higher releases in the first quarter. The labour budget of States like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry have been increased to meet additional demand for wage employment. Timely release of wages is ensured in nearly 85% cases (within 15 days) so far. Follow up with Department of Financial Services and CMDs of Banks and Department of Post has been taken up to ensure that fund released through Banks/Post Offices reach the labourers’ account immediately. The Government of India follows the General Financial Rules(GFR) strictly and therefore requires audited accounts of the previous financial year from the State Governments before approving any release after 30th September, 2017. States are complying with the financial provisions of GFR and funds are appropriately being released after due scrutiny. The Government is determined to maintain the fund flow under MGNREGS. To ensure very high timely payments to labourers, additional funds have been asked for to meet the demand.

                Union Minister of Science & Technology Dr. Harshvardhan inaugurated Women Bio-tech Incubator at Golden Jubilee Biotech Park for Women Society during IISF, 2017 in Chennai today in the presence of Prof. M. S. Swaminathan, Founder Chairman, Women Biotech Park,  and State Minister of Industry, Government of Tamilnadu – Shri M C Sampath.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan today delivered the Conclave Address during the Women Scientist and Entrepreneurs Conclave at IISF 2017. While delivering the Conclave Address Dr. Harshavardhan said that globally there has been a special focus on addressing the issues related to Women in Science and framing policies which support the same. In India we have laid special emphasis on empowerment of women. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed upon the need for special programmes which not only technically empower the women but also create employment opportunities.

In the field of Science and Technology and Entrepreneurship, Indian women have had a major presence over the last 100 years. The first women to receive a medical doctorate degree was  Anandibai Joshee in 1885, the first Indian women Doctorate in Basic Science was Janaki Ammal in 1931 and India’s first woman to get a doctorate of science from an Indian university was Asima Chatterjee in 1944. These dynamic women have laid a very strong foundation for women in science in India. In the last few years, there has been a special focus on “Women Empowerment by the Government. The DST and DBT have special schemes to attract women scientists and to provide employment opportunities to the unemployed women scientists. Women Entrepreneurship is a very important activity that has been growing rapidly in last few years. “Start up India”and “Stand up India” announced by Hon’ble Prime Minister are initiatives which offer tremendous opportunities to the women entrepreneurs.

 

Biotech Park is a good example of a Centre and State Government Partnership. The Minister expressed his confidence that with the support of the State Government it will drive many important initiatives under Start up India and Make in India. A large number of Innovation schemes of the S&T Ministry being operated by DST and DBT and initiatives taken by BIRAC have today created a vibrant innovation ecosystem.  More than 1000 Start ups and nearly 200 Women Entrepreneurs have been supported. The Atal Innovation Mission also aims to promote the innovation ecosystem.

 

The Minister was pleased to know the excellent participation in Women Scientists and Entrepreneurs Conclave. He informed that the Ministry of S& lays special emphasis on North East and has a special program and will be happy to set up a Women Bio-Incubator at North East.

 

 

 



 

He expressed his confidence that the women scientists would contribute significantly to the growth of the country and fulfill the dream of   Hon’ble Prime Minister of “Making a New India”. Women scientists and Entrepreneurs definitely are the Game Changers Driving Science for “Making a New India”.

 

Dr. Harshvardhan also released a book – Genesis of Biotech Park – on this occasion.

                India and South Africa are celebrating twenty years of strategic partnership this year. The Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan attended the celebrations of the collaboration in science and technology in Durban. The event was co-hosted by the Departments of Science and Technology of S. Africa and India. The South African Minister for S&T Ms. Naledi Pandor along with Dr. Vardhan released a booklet highlighting the two decades of fruitful cooperation in science and technology spanning across the knowledge chain which has resulted into a robust networking of the best researchers and academic institutions. Inter-governmental agreement on cooperation in the field of Science & Technology was concluded in 1995. Since then the S&T cooperation has progressively evolved as an important pillar in the India-South Africa strategic partnership based on mutual trust, warmth and friendship. 

So far, the cooperation has been focussed on chosen areas like Astronomy & Astrophysics, Agriculture Sciences, Green Chemistry, Indigenous Knowledge System and Health Sciences where both countries have complementary strengths. Since the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to S. Africa last year, the S&T cooperation has seen a significant boost with launch of 8 new projects on Astronomy which will help to augment the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope project led by South Africa. 

Earlier, Dr. Harshvardhan visited the SKA site in Karoo desert and was apprised of the progress of the mega-telescope project in which India is a member country. Indian scientists will be contributing in several design work packages of SKA, notably the Telescope Manager and the Central Signal Processing. Telescope Manager System will be the controlling nerve centre behind the functioning of the SKA observatory. The SKA project will address some of the most interesting science goals in astrophysics, ranging from the very early Universe to the search for intelligent life out there. 

A multi-institutional project on HIV Vaccine Research Collaboration has been also initiated this year. This is aimed to develop preventive HIV vaccine and will also lead to the identification of biomarkers and development of novel techniques for diagnosis and management of tuberculosis. Dr. Harshvardhan remarked that this is a unique project, where two countries will use science for adressing the health care needs of people of both countries, in the area of HIV and TB. 

Another hallmark of the vibrant collaboration was the launch of a new program on ‘Grass Root Innovation’ aimed towards sharing of open source technologies and IPR protection of traditional knowledge systems. This program is designed for co-development of products through value addition, validation through product deployment and market ready technology transfer with a focus on affordability. The Minister, added that both India and S. Africa have a rich pool of traditional knowledge which can be leveraged by providing the scientific knowledge base required for technology development for societal benefit. This cooperation on grass root innovation will provide scientific and technological solutions for addressing the unmet needs of the common man. The novel initiative has been aptly named as ‘Gandhi-Mandela Program on Grass Root Innovation’. National Innovation Foundation, Ahmedabad will implement this program on the Indian side. 

Earlier in a bilateral meeting with the S. African S&T Minister, Dr. Harshvardhan suggested the future expansion of collaboration in the area of renewable energy including solar, wind and biomass which is a potential resource for both the countries. India is a leading country in the International Solar Alliance partnership and has extended an invite to S. Africa to join this alliance. It was also agreed that another area of potential collaboration is on blue economy looking at the marine eco-system including the living and non-living resources of the ocean. Both India and S. Africa are maritime nations and are a part of the Indian Ocean Rim Association. Indian expedition to Antarctica is also launched from Cape Town. The two countries stand to gain by understanding the ocean processes which shapes the climate and coastal eco-system. 

While in Cape Town, the Minister also visited the famous Groote Schuur Hospital where the first open heart surgery was conducted by Dr. Christian Bernad in 1967. An interaction with scientists at the South African National Botanical Institute (SANBI) was also held and the ongoing cooperation with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun on bio-informatics was highlighted. Dr. Harshvardhan visited the national park and the herbarium showcasing the rich flora of the Cape region. 

In Durban, besides the bilateral meeting with the South African side, Dr. Harshvardhan also paid his floral homage to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, at the Pietermaritzburg Railway platform, where the Mayor of the city welcomed him and conducted a tour of the Gandhi exhibition at the station. At the India House in Durban Dr. Harshvardhan interacted with the Indian community and highlighted the major programs of the Government and urged them to contribute and remain connected in the various development facets of India.

                 Union Minister for Ministry of Science & Technology, Ministry of Earth Sciences and Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, is leading the Indian delegation to South Africa to participate in the celebration of twenty years of Science & Technology cooperation between India and South Africa.

Indian delegation is visiting South Africa to strengthen the strong scientific bonds between the two countries and explore further avenues of co-operation between the two nations in areas ranging from Space Research to Bio-technology. The delegation will interact with scientists in South Africa where scientists will share experiences and insights on multiple subjects with the Ministerial delegation.

 



The Minister made a visit to the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which is a large multi radio telescope project under development in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It utilizes radio astronomy and has receiving stations at a minimum distance of 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) from a concentrated central core, enabling it to provide the highest resolution images compared to other sub-disciplines of astronomy. It is being developed in the Southern Hemisphere with cores in South Africa and Australia, where there is least radio interference to observe the Milky Way Galaxy. The project will address some of the most interesting scientific questions in Astrophysics, ranging from characteristics of early Universe to search for intelligent extra-terrestrial life.



The SKA is a global project with twelve member countries. India is a member state where National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, affiliated to the Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India is the stakeholder. India is involved in several design work packages of SKA, notably the Central Signal Processing and Telescope Manager System, which will act as the nerve centre behind the functioning of the SKA observatory. Such technological developments are supported by bilateral research initiatives of Dept. of Science & Technology of both the nations.

The SKA project will provide India astronomy community direct access to one of the best experimental radio-astronomy facility in the world. This project will accelerate technological growth of antenna, low noise electronics, analogue and digital signal processing, high-speed computing, massive data storage and mining, image processing, large software systems etc in India. Such projects present great opportunities to Indian scientific community to showcase our technological and scientific capabilities on the global stage.

                The 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics has been conferred to three scientists namely Rainer Weiss, Barry C Barish & Kip S Thorne under the LIGO Project for their discovery of gravitational waves, 100 years after Einstein's General Relativity predicted it. The Nobel Prize for Physics 2017 celebrates the direct detection of Gravitational waves arriving from the merger two large Black holes in a distant galaxy a Billion of light years away. Gravitational waves carry information about their dramatic origins and about the nature of gravity that cannot otherwise be obtained. This opens a new window to Astronomy since Gravitational Waves are an entirely new way of observing the most violent events in space.

This is a proud moment for India also, since the discovery paper has 39 Indian authors/scientists from nine institutions-, CMI Chennai, ICTS-TIFR Bengaluru, IISER-Kolkata, IISER-Trivandrum, IIT Gandhinagar, IPR Gandhinagar, IUCAA Pune, RRCAT Indore and TIFR Mumbai. primarily funded through individual/ institutional grants by Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Science & Technology and Ministry of Human Resource Development AE, DST and MHRD, who are co-authors of this discovery paper.

Late Professor CV Vishveshvara of RRI, Bengaluru (DST AI) and Professor SV Dhurandhar of IUCAA, Pune and some other Indian scientists made seminal contributions to this field which contributed towards the principles behind the LIGO Detector.

The group led by Bala Iyer (currently at ICTS-TIFR) at the Raman Research Institute in collaboration with scientists in France had pioneered the mathematical calculations used to model Gravitational Wave signals from orbiting black holes and neutron stars. Theoretical work that combined black holes and gravitational waves was published by C. V. Vishveshwara in 1970. These contributions are prominently cited in the discovery paper.

An opportunity for India taking leadership in this field has opened up with the LIGO-India mega-science project that was granted ‘in principle’ approval by the Union Cabinet on Feb 17 2016. LIGO-India brings forth a real possibility of Indian scientists and technologists stepping forward, with strong international cooperation, into the frontier of an emergent area of high visibility and promise presented by the recent GW detections and the high promise of a new window of gravitational-wave astronomy to probe the universe.

The global science community is unanimous that the future of Gravitational wave astronomy and astrophysics, beyond the first discovery, lies with the planned global array of GW detectors, including the LIGO-India observatory. Inclusion of LIGO-India greatly improves the angular resolution in the location of the gravitational-wave source by the LIGO global network. For the discovery event observed by the two advanced LIGO detectors in the US, with a hypothetical LIGO-India in operation, there would have been 100 times improvement in the angular resolution.

The LIGO-India proposal is for the construction and operation of an Advanced LIGO Detector in India in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratories, USA. The objective is to set up the Indian node of the three node global Advanced LIGO detector network by 2024 and operate it for 10 years. The task for LIGO-India includes the challenge of constructing the very large vaccum infrastructure that would hold a space of volume 10 million litres that can accommodate the entire 4 km scale laser interferometer in ultra high vacuum environment at nano-torrs. Indian team is also responsible for installation and commissioning the complex instrument and attaining the ultimate design sensitivity.

The LIGO-India project is being jointly executed by lead institutions: the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune of the University Grants commission, and DAE organisations, Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), Gandhinagar, the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore and the Directorate of Construction & Estate Management (DCSEM) of DAE.

LIGO-India is being jointly funded by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST). A LIGO-India Apex committee, together with the LIGO-India Project Management Board (LI-PMB) and LIGO-India Scientific Management Board (LI-SMB), were constituted in August 2016 to oversee the project execution, and there has been rapid pace of progress since then. LIGO-India is on track for commencing operations by 2024.

                The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal, one of the container terminals directly managed by India’s leading container port-JNPT, is constantly innovating and up-scaling operations to not only meet but exceed global benchmarks with an underlying commitment to provide seamless customer service and ease of doing business. The JNPCT has upgraded its terminal operating system to SPARCS N4 platform to optimize the terminal’s operational cycle with the ultimate goal to increase JNPCT efficiencies so that customers can experience improved productivity.

The JNPCT has taken a number of initiatives for faster and economical operations along with automation that has helped in streamlining the processes and helping in reduction of cost, time and documents and thus making it easier for clients and partners to do business with them. The decision of migration to Navis N4 TOS solution is one of the step towards achieving the objective.

The N4 implementation process will be managed by Cargotec Corporation and will directly work with JNPCT, utilizing Navis’ methodology and project management tools. Cargotec will provide configuration, testing, report and field extensions, go-live support services, including training courses so that the management and mid-management teams are up and running on N4 as quickly as possible.

The JNPT is confident that this new platform will help us achieve the desired productivity and growth goals through optimized operations on a modern platform.

                The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has raised Rs. 660 crore as “GOI Fully Serviced Bonds”. The resources raised by way of bonds are in addition to the budgetary support from the Government of India. The Government had taken a decision to enable IWAI to raise Rs 660 crore through GOI Fully Serviced Bonds in 2017-18.

The IWAI had engaged arrangers, credit rating agencies, registrars and trustees prior to raising the Bonds. Both CRISIL and CARE rated the proposed instrument of IWAI as “AAA: STABLE”. The e-bidding for raising the bonds was organized on 11th October, 2017 on the BSE Portal with the issue size of Rs. 300 crore and Green Shoe option of Rs. 360 crore. The issue was oversubscribed and the entire amount of Rs.660 crore has been raised in single tranche at a coupon rate of 7.47 percent.

The proceeds from the Bonds are intended to be utilized by IWAI exclusively for capital expenditure for development of National Waterways (NWs) under National Waterway Act, 2016 during 2017-18.

The principal and interest in respect of the EBRs worth Rs.660 crore shall be financed by the Government of India by making suitable budgetary provisions in the Demand for Grants of the Ministry of Shipping to meet the bond servicing requirements as and when the need arises. The interest payment will be on semi-annual basis and the principal on maturity.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the renaming of Kandla Port as Deendayal Port.

 Ports in India are generally named after the city or town in which these are situated.  However, the Government, in special cases, after due consideration, have renamed the Ports after great leaders in the past.

By renaming Kandla Port as ""Deendayal Port, Kandla"", a grateful nation would be remembering the invaluable contributions made by one of the greatest sons of India, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay. This will inspire the People of Gujarat, particularly the Youth, who may not be fully aware of the contributions made by the great leader.

 

Background:

 

There have been public demands from various quarters in Gujarat, especially from Kachhh district, to rename 'Kandla Port' as 'Deendayal Port, Kandla'. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (25.9.1916 - 1.2.1968) was a prominent leader, who pledged his life to the service of the nation. He devoted his entire life serving the nation and worked among the masses and dedicated and sacrificed his life for the upliftment of the Poor & Working Class at the same time. Upholding the values of democracy founded on tolerance, discipline, selflessness and respect for the law of the land, all his actions were based on the principles of ‘Integral Humanism’. Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly for Indianisation of democracy, honouring the public opinion, selflessness and respect for law of the land.  Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay dedicated his entire life for public service and was the epitome of simplicity, honesty and selfless service for the poor and down-trodden.

 Since the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay was to be celebrated on 25th September, 2017, it was felt that it would be most appropriate if the decision to rename the Kandla Port as Deendayal Port was made as a part of the birth anniversary celebration of this great national leader.

                The Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways and Water Resource, River Interlinking and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will perform the Bhoomi Poojan ceremony of the Wardha dry port at Sindi (Railway) in Wardha, Maharashtra on 2nd October, 2017.  The Dry Port is being developed by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in a bid to cater effective logistics services to the industries in Vidarbha region and improve cargo throughput at the Port.



The proposed Wardha Dry Port is to be constructed over an area of 350 acres in phased development with a total estimated investment of Rs 500 Crore. The Phase-I would involve development of around 25 Ha of the total area, with an estimated cost of Rs.180 Crores (including private investment of Rs. 79 Crore).

The proposed dry port is estimated to generate traffic of almost 7,000-9,000 TEUs in next 5-7 years. The traffic is expected to ramp up gradually to around 30,000 TEUs in medium term (by 2030) considering the geographical location advantage, upcoming road and railway connectivity, increased focus on warehousing and other ancillary industries in the region. The project is expected to attract a direct employment of at least 1000 persons. The project would have the necessary facilities as one-stop shop for the EXIM based industries such as customs clearance facilities, Container Freight Station, Warehousing Space, Cold Storage, Liquid Storage, truck terminals etc.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The site is strategically located around the Industrial belt of Nagpur & Wardha and is well connected to the other industrial regions in Vidarbha. The dry port would benefit the rice exporters, textile and garments industry, steel and minerals traders, scrap trade, plastics and paper pulp, electrical machinery, automotive parts manufacturers etc. located in the region. Besides, domestic cargo movement is also expected to be routed through the dry port due to its logistical proximity to upcoming Nagpur-Mumbai super communication expressway, National Highways and railway connectivity.  The dry port shall get connected to the Central Railways network through Nagpur-Wardha line, to Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication expressway and six lane National highways connecting major cities of central, Southern and Northern India.

                To bring momentum in skilling through collaborative efforts, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh along with Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan here today inaugurated India's first Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) for Skilling in Smart Cities, in collaboration with New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). The ministers also laid the foundation for a Skill Development Centre at Moti Bagh and a Centre of Excellence at Dharam Marg, New Delhi.

Affirming synergies with the Government of India’s flagship programs, the new skill development centres underscore the commitment of the Ministry of Urban Affairs & Housing (MUHA) and the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to support skilling in smart cities. National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), an executive arm of MSDE, has collaborated with New Delhi Municipal Council Smart City Limited (NDMCSCL) to extend cooperation for setting up of PMKK Centres for Smart Cities, to provide skill training for unemployed youth through its short-term training (STT) module and contribute to the capacity building of municipal employees through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) program.

The event also had graceful presence of dignitaries such as Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, New Delhi; Shri Naresh Kumar, Chairman, NDMC; Shri Karan Singh Tanwar, Vice – Chairman, NDMC; Shri Surender Singh, MLA & Member, NDMC and other senior officials from MUHA, MSDE, NSDC and NDMC.

Inaugurating the skill development centres, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “India which has the privilege of being a young nation, would gain from this demographic dividend to become a superpower and be amongst the top three counties in the world by 2030. The key to reach this milestone is by investing in our youth and making them skilled.” Shri Rajnath Singh added, “A skilled person gets respect, recognition and honor due to his hard work. I strongly believe that these skill development centres would aspire youth to take up vocational training to make themselves self-reliant.”

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said, “Collaboration is the need of the hour to support inclusive and sustainable development in the country. Today’s event signifies integration and convergence approach towards Respected Prime Minister’s two most ambitious projects – the Skill India Mission and the Smart City Mission. Skilled workforce is required for effective development of any big or small project. We aim for recognition and respect to this workforce through skill training.”

Special Guest at the event Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, MP Lok Sabha said, “I would like to applaud the efforts of both the ministries and its nodal agencies NSDC and NDMC for pioneering steps to bring in equitable growth and development. I am confident that such centers would deliver quality by extending access to trained youth, which would catalyse the creation of smart cities in the country.”

President, NDMC Shri Naresh Kumar said, ""National Skill Mission will prove to be a milestone for the developed India. NDMC supports inclusive development by introducing best practices in skilling and is determined to leave no stone unturned to achieve the mission”.

The newly inaugurated Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra leverages NDMC infrastructure for skilling initiatives. Located at Mandir Marg, New Delhi, the NDMC-PMKK Centre for Skilling in Smart Cities is an exemplary heritage building of approx. 30,000 sq.ft., with a capacity of skilling 4,000 youth annually. Catering to healthcare and solar energy sectors, the centre will be managed by one of NSDC’s affiliated training partners - Orion Edutech, which has an impeccable record of training nearly 3 lakh candidates through its network of over 275 skill development centres across the country. On this occasion, a solar-power lab powered by Schneider Electric was also inaugurated.

                On the occasion of the visit of the Union Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan to Tokyo, India and Japan concluded the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on Technical Intern Training Programme (TITP) on 17th October 2017.

2. The MoC was signed by Shri Dharmendra Pradhan on behalf of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship of Government of India with Mr. Katsunobu Kato, Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan in a solemn ceremony at the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare in Tokyo, Japan. The MoC on TITP is expected to significantly expand the bilateral cooperation between India and Japan in the field of skill development. India is the third country with which Japan has signed the MoC as per the requirements of the Technical Intern Training Act scheduled to enter into force in November 2017.

3. In the bilateral Joint Statement issued during the visit of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to India in September 2017, the two Prime Ministers expressed confidence that synergy between Japan’s advanced technology and India’s rich human resources can transform both countries into new centres of production in the global industrial network. In this regard, they underscored the potential to further cooperate in human resources development and exchanges utilising such frameworks as Japan’s Technical Intern Training Program (TITP).

4. The MoC on TITP paves the way for sending Indian technical interns to Japan for on-the-job training for a period of three to five years. As per Government of Japan’s data for end-2016, approximately 230,000 technical intern trainees from multiple countries are on training in Japan. In 2016, about 1,08,709 technical interns entered Japan from various partner countries such as Vietnam, China and Indonesia that account for large numbers.

5. According to Ambassador of India to Japan, Sujan R. Chinoy, there is scope for India to enhance its participation in Japan’s Technical Intern Training Programme, thereby contributing to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of India as the largest provider of skilled workforce for the world. The Technical Intern Training Programme is an ideal platform through which complementary strengths of India and Japan could be leveraged for mutual benefit. The technical interns trained in Japan under the TITP would be an asset for the Skill India initiative upon their return to India.

6. During the visit of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Japan in November 2016, India and Japan had concluded an MoC on skill development under the “Manufacturing Skill Transfer Promotion Programme” through the establishment of Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing (JIM) and the Japanese Endowed Courses (JEC) in engineering colleges designated by Japanese companies in India. The Manufacturing Skill Transfer Promotion Programme aims to train 30,000 persons over next 10 years with Japanese style manufacturing skills and practices. The first four JIMs were established in the States of Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu in July-August 2017 respectively by Suzuki, Toyota, Daikin and Yamaha. The first Japanese Endowed Course (JEC) in was established in NBKR Institute of Science & Technology Andhra Pradesh by Meidensha Co. in September 2017.

The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind conferred the “Vayoshreshtha Samman” to eminent senior citizens and institutions in recognition of their services towards the cause of elderly persons at a function organized by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment here today. Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot presided over the function.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that there is a healthy tradition of respecting and taking care of elders in our country. He added according to the last census, the population of senior citizens in our country was approximately 10.5 crore, which was about 8.5% of our total population. The average life expectancy has increased in recent decades due to improvement in health services and other reasons. It is estimated that by the year 2050, the number of senior citizens will be approximately 19% of our total population.

 The President said that he was happy to note that the Government of India has taken several steps for the welfare of elderly persons. These include the National Programme for Healthcare of the Elderly wherein specialised services will be provided for their treatment. Under the National Health Insurance Scheme implemented with the help of State Governments, additional health insurance is being provided.

In his address, Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot said that the National Award ‘Vayoshreshtha Samman’ will help to motivate younger generations to understand the contribution of the elderly persons in building of the society and the nation. He called upon people to give due respect and regard to elderly persons in their families as it is the Indian tradition. He opined that the old Indian tradition of Joint Family should continue for the betterment of our society. He invited suggestions from the people for the welfare of senior citizens. He called upon more and more eligible senior citizens to apply for these awards against the advertisements issued by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment as the nodal ministry for the cause of senior citizens, has been celebrating the International day of Older Persons since 2005 by conferring Vayoshreshtha Sammans to eminent senior citizens and institutions in recognition of their services towards the cause of elderly persons, especially indigent senior citizens. In 2013, the Vayoshreshtha Sammans have been upgraded as a “National Award”.

The National Award ‘Vayoshreshtha Samman’ is given in thirteen categories. The applications had been invited from NGOs, institutions, individuals to apply for the awards in different categories. This year Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment honoured 22 awardees under 11 categories

                Steel Authority of India (SAIL) supplied 33500 metric tonnes of steel for the construction of the Agra - Lucknow expressway which facilitated the touch-and-go landing of planes of the Indian Air Force, today. SAIL had primarily supplied long products consisting of earthquake resistant TMT bars for this project. SAIL’s branded earthquake resistant EQR TMT Bars have superior qualities and come in various customized specifications.

IAF conducted the touch and go landings on a stretch of the expressway today, starting with a 35,000-kg C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. This is the first time that the C-130J transport aircraft joined the Indian Air Force's special drill to land planes on the expressway. The IAF had earlier landed its Mirage 2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets on the Yamuna Expressway and the Lucknow-Agra Expressway.

Keeping with the spirit of SAIL’s tagline, ‘There’s a little bit of SAIL in everybody’s life’, the Company is increasingly focusing to produce world-class steel products befitting the requirements of every segment and market including the specific needs of rural and urban areas to meeting the necessities of niche segments like defence sector too. SAIL steel has been integral in projects of national importance spanning from Sardar Sarovar Dam, Dhola-Sadiya bridge, Chenani-Nashri tunnel to various metro projects, power plants and upcoming Statue of Unity at Gujarat.

                The Union Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh chaired a mid-year review meeting with top management of SAIL at Udyog Bhawan yesterday. The meeting was attended by the Minister of State for Steel, Shri Vishnu Deo Sai, the Secretary Steel Dr. Aruna Sharma, senior officials from Ministry and SAIL including CEOs of SAIL Steel Plants.

While expressing displeasure over tardy progress in critical areas of strategic importance, Shri Birender Singh said, “SAIL must ramp up production from New Rail Mill in Bhilai without wasting any more time, and meet all the requirements of its major customers. Company shouldchalk-out a time bound action plan to cater to the Indian Railways’ increasing demand. SAIL must take its joint ventures at international level to logical conclusion at the earliest. Company must leverage its position in the industry, instead of not being able to fulfill its commitments and agreements.” The Minister directed to the company management to submit quarterly plans and targets, which will be reviewed after every three months. Steel Minister will also be meeting CEOs and EDs of Steel plants next month, to get direct feedback about constraints, bottlenecks and issues of concern.

The CEOs have to understand their direct accountability and responsbility for performance of the Unit under their charge, the Minister added. Shri Singh emphasised that accidents in the Plants must be curtailed and highest safety standards must be adhered to in all Units. Safety should be a prime focus of all the plant heads and stress should be given on repair and regular maintenance to avoid unforeseen breakdowns, downtime and resulting loss of production. SAIL should focus on ensuring raw material security to avoid the vagaries of coal supplies currently afflicting the company, he added.

Shri Birendra Singh said that SAIL should explore possibilities for developing new markets by adopting new technology and adding value added products to its basket, like non corrosive steel products for construction in coastal areas. SAIL should also focus on product differentiation to create value for the shareholders, thereby creating an exclusive space for the company. Efficiency improvement and product quality improvement at individual plant level should be focused upon to meet the customer requirements and to improve the financial performance of the company.

In the meeting, SAIL’s overall performance as well as that of individual Integrated Steel Plants (ISPs) on critical techno-commercial parameters were reviewed. The Chairman, SAIL Shri P. K. Singh made a presentation on action taken on the recommendations by Group of Experts appointed by Ministry of Steel.

                The Brainstorming Session with key stakeholders in the Steel industry, chaired by Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh, Union Steel Minister in Chandigarh today witnessed free flow of ideas and exchange of views.

Birender Singh directed the CMDs of PSUs under Ministry of Steel to finalize and implement all SPVs and joint ventures in a time-bound manner. The ramping up of modernized units also, has to be completed with all seriousness and commitment within stipulated timelines, he added. The Minister remarked that there are pockets of excellence in each Plant & Unit, which need to be replicated and the whole Steel Plant should become a hallmark of excellence. That is possible only when the Plant aims to achieve international benchmarks of excellence in production and quality. To encourage a healthy competition amongst the PSU Steel Plants, Ministry will assess and declare a ‘Plant of Excellence’ based on overall performance vis-à-vis international standards, he added. The Minister stated that he would himself review the performance at Plant and Unit level, and production performance will be closely monitored by the Ministry. Responsibility for time and cost overruns will be fixed as a norm from now on, he emphasized. Any genuine difficulties and constraints could be highlighted in such review meetings so that quick remedial action could be taken. Shri Birender Singh underscored the critical significance of synergy and teamwork at Board level in each company. Lack of coordination, one-upmanship, groupism, egocentricity, micro-vision at Board level not only impact the company adversely in short term but also lead to long term harmful consequences, he added. Accountability and responsibility has to begin from the top, and mechanism for rewarding good performance and disincentives for poor performance should be applicable at all levels, he stated.

The meeting was attended by the Minister of State for Steel, Shri Vishnu Deo Sai, Secretary Steel, Dr. Aruna Sharma, senior officials from the Ministry, CMDs and other officials from the PSUs under Ministry of Steel.

                Steel sector in India has emerged as a vivid example of sector turnaround in a short span of three years. The industry efforts were supported in equal measure by the Government of India, to provide a level playing field and enabling growth environment. 

The Steel Minister, Shri Birender Singh has galvanized the steel industry with his call for ‘Make in Steel for Make in India’. All the major stakeholders in the steel industry are keen to contribute to nation-building. To channelize this energy, the Steel Minister with senior officials from Ministry of Steel has been meeting with key stakeholders of the steel industry in formal and informal settings. Continuing in this spirit, 2nd in the series of brainstorming sessions with industry stakeholders including PSUs under Ministry of Steel is being organized in Chandigarh on 16th October, 2017. 

Steel companies, both PSUs and private sector, have been playing an important role in the development of core sectors of the economy. At the same time, due to rapid technological changes, changing economic scenario and increased competition, they are facing many challenges. Acknowledging the challenges and recognizing the need for rapid socio economic transformation of the country in keeping with the vision of ‘New India-2022’, there is need to re-align their working style and priorities through various initiatives and policy changes. 

A similar day long brainstorming session was earlier organized in Surajkund and the next session is being organized at Chandigarh within a span of 2 months. 

A multi-pronged agenda has been set for the brainstorming session in Chandigarh for generating some out of box ideas to revive and improve the performance of these companies on different aspects and develop the future strategy to enable their sustainable turnaround. 

It is noteworthy that other forum’s like Steel Consumer Council, Regional Conferences for enhancing steel consumption in India, National Conference of Secondary Steel producers, customer-dealer meets are few other avenues which are being utilized by Ministry of Steel, for increasing awareness about steel usage in the country.

                MOIL must make significant contribution to Make in India by developing technology to meet Manganese requirement of batteries to be used in Electric Vehicles etc., said Steel Minister Shri Birender Singh while chairing mid-year review meeting of MOIL, a PSU under Ministry of Steel. The Minister asked the PSU to plan for building capacities in tungsten mining and production for strengthening manufacturing capabilities for defense production in India. The meeting was attended by Secretary, Steel Dr. Aruna Sharma, senior officials from Ministry of Steel and top management of MOIL. 

Shri Singh further said, “MOIL should strategically plan for forward integration to leverage its leadership position of Manganese Ore production in India. The company can think of acquiring or taking majority stake in ferro-alloy production facilities, in addition to expansion efforts. There is huge potential for e-rickshaws, e-tempos and e-cars in India, which MOIL must be prepared for harnessing. In fact, the company should innovate to find new uses of Manganese Ore, apart from steel making, dry cell batteries and paints. R&D efforts should aim for development of new technologies rather than updating or buying technologies from others. The company need to work on utilizing every grade of ore gainfully including the lowest quality ore. Steel Ministry will support every R&D initiative aimed at self-sufficiency and indigenisation. Mineral exploration activities need to be speeded up for strengthening the resource base in India.Shri Birender Singh added that MOIL can also examine the feasibility of using alternate modes of ore transportation, which could be environment friendly and cost effective. For closure of mines, sand requirement can be met by innovative means like collaboration with local farmers. MOIL should aim to become the industry leader in innovation and technology development to such a level that other companies from abroad look upto MOIL for technology support. 

In view of increase in requirement for manganese for steel production capacities upto 300 million tonnes and insufficient availability of the ore in India, MOIL must also explore the possibility of acquiring or taking stake in manganese ore assets abroad the Minister said.

                Union Steel Minister Shri. Birender Singh chaired a mid-year review meeting with top management of MECON, a PSU under Ministry of Steel. The meeting was held in the presence of attended by Secretary, Steel Dr. Aruna Sharma. and senior officials from Ministry and MECON. 

In his opening remarks, Shri Birender Singh said,""MECON must utilize its rich experience and expertise in the metallurgical engineering to enhance capacity utilization and product improvement by Steel PSUs. MECON can surely play a significant role in enhancing steel consumption in India by working on steel-intensive structures and exhibiting the advantages of using steel in buildings and other structures. With envisaged 300 Million tonne capacity of steel production by 2030, increasing steel exports is very crucial and the company must contribute to this end by application engineering and market development. In India, new aveneues for steel use like crash barriers, railway sleepers, food grain silos, electric poles, underpass structures etc. must be explored without losing time. Setting up of coa l washeries, pellet plants are some other areas where MECON can play a leading role in steering the development .” 

The Steel Minister added that the company must be in constant state of improvement and its physical and financial targets must be dynamic and in tune with the times. As a pioneering engineering consultancy firm of the country, MECON must think big to accomplish in short and long term. Diversification for topline improvement can be done but MECON must give due attention to its primary mandate of enabling growth of manufacturing, innovation and technology in India. MECON can play a big role in “Make in India” initiative in collaboration with capital goods and machinery manufacturers and steel producers, specia lly in the secondary sector. As the Key Project Consultant for NMDC’s Nagarnar Steel Plant, MECON must put in all efforts to commission the steel plant at the earliest. The company must develop and market new and latest technologies and market them in a professional manner. 

The company must keep itself update with latest technologies and developments. The company must play a proactive role in solving technological challenges specific to the country and facilitate optimal use of raw materials and import substitution, Shri Birender Singh further added.

                The Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address mentioned that “There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand & adapt. This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India. In more than four hundred & fifty districts, I had a night stay too. And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful. That helps me a lot in understanding things. I request you too, to feel the “Unity in Diversity” which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy. The dream of “Ek Bharat – Shreshtha Bharat” is inherent in this. How many varieties of cuisines there are ! If we eat a new dish every day, we won’t have to repeat any variety throughout our life. This is the power of our tourism. I would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand –& gain something. Internalize India within yourselves. Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you. These experiences will enrich your lives. Your vision will expand. And, who can be a better teacher than experience!”.

 

The country is blessed with numerous tourists sites, its cuisine, dance, music, attire, customs etc. and under the umbrella of Paryatan Parv one can get glimpses of all this and more. The power of tourism can be seen when one looks at the wide spread participation in the event by  State Governments,  Central Ministries, Travel Associations, Organisations, School and College students and the general public.

                Tourism sector is one of the largest employment generators in India and encourages inclusive growth of the less-advantaged sections of the society. One of the objective of the Paryatan Parv is to spread the awareness about tourism as a major engine of economic growth and harness its direct and multiplier effect on employment and poverty eradication in a sustainable manner by active participation of all segments of the society. The core theme of Paryatan Parv is ‘Tourism for All’ as it is the endeavour to associate every section of the society and all stakeholders both in organised and unorganised sector for developing and promoting tourism in the Country.

 

During the Paryatan Parv, sensitization programmes, skill development programmes and training programmes are being organised to inculcate appropriate tourism traits and knowledge amongst the service providers to enable them to act / work as Tourist Facilitators. Young men and women are being trained acts as catalyst/ resource persons in turn for similar effort. To gradually work towards a tourism-sensitive citizenry for college going students including those enrolled with youth associations and organisations. By creating awareness among the local communities about the importance of tourism for them in terms of increase in source of income, improved living standards and overall development of the area, promote local arts, cultural, handicrafts, cuisine etc. to generate livelihoods.

 

Since the hospitality industry is facing a challenge of supply of trained manpower, the Paryatan Parv offers an opportunity to the people who are directly or indirectly associated with business of tourism to upgrade themselves and be part pf the industry in some way. To ensure that the efforts put up during the Paryatan Parv should not get diluted, the mission of the Ministry of Tourism, therefore, is not only to supply skilled hands as required by the Sector but to also upgrade / certify the skills of the existing service providers to reduce the skill gap. The Ministry of Tourism has put in place a strategy to reduce the skill gap in the Sector, including sanction of institutional infrastructure and launch of short duration training programmes for creating employable skills.

 

Two flagship schemes of the Ministry of Tourism, Swadesh Darshan and Prasad although focuses on Infrastructure development of the circuits and sites, the salient feature of these schemes is comprehensive development of tourism which includes creating employment opportunities through active participation of local communities in a sustainable and inclusive manner through development of a “Responsible Tourism” initiative.

                Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari took a review meeting in New Delhi yesterday of Sewerage Infrastructure Projects under Namami Gange Programme in the six States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Delhi. 

Addressing the meeting Shri Gadkari reiterated that all the pending projects should take off by December, 2018. Expressing his displeasure over the slow progress of some of the projects the Minister said delay in file work and tendering process will not be tolerated. He said there is a general perception that nothing is being done in Namami Gange. The Minister asked the officials to change this perception by transparent, corruption free, time bound and quality work. 

Shri Gadkari said that he believes in giving full freedom to the officials in the execution of projects but at the same time he wants results from them. Loopholes and reasons for delay in the entire process of preparing DPRs, payments to contractors and finalisation of tenders were widely discussed and remedies were suggested in the meeting. The Minister was of the opinion that innovative methods and latest technology should be used for cleaning not only Ganga but its tributaries like Alaknanda, Bhagirathi, Ramganga, Kali, Hindon also. “Unless and until these rivers are also cleaned, we cannot fulfil the dream of ‘Nirmal & Aviral Ganga”. the Minister added. 

Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh, Secretary of the Ministry Dr. Amarjit Singh, senior officials of National Mission for Clean Ganga and all the six States/UT were present in the meeting. 

A total of 97 towns (Class I to Class VI) are situated along main stem of River Ganga. Necessary sewerage management interventions have been taken up in 55 towns requiring no further interventions. Out of these, 10 towns with a total sewage generation of 1622 Mld contribute almost 63% of total sewage (2593 Mld) discharge from these 97 towns to river Ganga. With all the projects undertaken till date, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand have been covered with respect to sewage from all its towns. Three towns namely Mugal Sarai (UP), Chapra (Bihar) and Danapur (Bihar) remain where sewerage interventions are yet to be taken, current sewage generation is 15, 21 and 27 Mld. respectively. Projects for two towns namely Behrampur and Nabadwip in West Bengal are under pipeline and expected to be taken for approval shortly. Proposed STP capacity for these towns is 15 and 13 Mld respectively. 11 towns (UK-1, UP-3, BH-3, WB-4) are low priority towns as flow being small (<5 mld.) In addition to this, another 19 towns in West Bengal are low priority towns owing to low BOD of the sewage from these towns.

                The Central Grounder Water Authority (CGWA) has sent Draft guidelines for “issuance of NOC” for ground water withdrawal and draft “Public Notice” to the Chief Secretaries of all the State and Administrators of Union Territories for their comments within 60 days.

Due to the increasing number of litigations in the National Green Tribunal, various branches of Tribunal are directing CGWA to ensure that the ground water withdrawal in the country should be in accordance with law. These guidelines will ensure an uniform regulatory framework across the country so that the discriminatory practices in regulation are either mitigated or minimized.

The major revisions in the guidelines are pan India  coverage, decentralization of the No Objection Certificate (NOC) issuing authorities, based on the quantum of ground water extraction viz. revenue heads of the district, State Nodal Agency / State Ground Water Authority and CGWA, dispensing with the provisions relating to submission of artificial recharge proposals and construction of artificial recharge structures by project proponents, introduction of a water conservation fee in lieu of recharge mechanism; funds raised through the water conservation fee to be used by States for effective ground water management etc.

The CGWA constituted by Government of India under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 has been regulating ground water development and management in the country. The authority has been granting NOC for withdrawal of ground water by industries/infrastructure/mining projects.

The entire draft guidelines are available on the website of CGWB and in the NOCAP (www.cgwb.gov.in, www.cgwa-noc.gov.in) for the information of the public/stakeholders state governments.

                All who have been enjoying cleaner ghats at Varanasi would also soon bask in the pollution-free waters of the Ganges flowing by the spiritual city. Under Namami Gange programme, an all-encompassing approach has been employed to arrest pollution flowing into the river and ensure clean ghats. From sewage treatment plants to ghat improvement to river surface cleaning, several steps in a time-bound manner are being taken in Varanasi by National Mission for Clean Ganga to rid the city of river pollution.

On the sewage management front, Varanasi town currently generates an estimated 300 MLD of sewage, which is expected to increase to 390 MLD by 2030. From the current capacity of three existing sewage treatment plants – Dinapur, Bhagwanpur and DLW, only 102 MLD of sewage is being treated while the remaining flows directly into river Ganga through Varuna and Assi rivers. To bridge this gap, a 140 MLD STP at Dinapur and a 120 MLD STP at Goitha are being constructed under Japan International co-operation Agency (JICA) assisted project and JNNURM scheme respectively. These projects are at advanced stage of construction and will be commissioned before March 2018. Apart from this, a 50 MLD STP at Ramana has also been awarded under Hybrid Annuity based PPP model to exclusively address the sewage treatment requirements of Assi BHU area. Concession agreement for this project has already been signed. Together, these STPs will create sewage treatment capacity of 412 MLD, adequate to meet the sewage treatment demands of the town till 2035.

In addition, the works on interceptor sewers for rivers Varuna and Assi, development of three pumping stations at Chauka ghat, Phulwaria and Saraiya, rehabilitation of old trunk sewers and rehabilitation of ghat pumping stations and existing STPs are also underway to improve the entire sewage management infrastructure in Varanasi. Evidently, no stone is being left unturned.

To address the concerns of floating waste on the river, a trash skimmer is operational in Varanasi since April 2017 under river surface cleaning component.

A cleaner Ganga would be incomplete without equally cleaner surroundings. Acknowledging this, the Government of India last year initiated cleaning works at 84 iconic and heritage ghats of Varanasi under Namami Gange programme which has shown positive results.

Besides, works for construction of 153 community toilet complexes at an estimated cost of Rs 20.07 crore have been awarded out of which the works for 109 toilets have already been completed and they are being used by 15,000 to 20,000 people every day. Also, ghat improvement works at 26 locations have been taken up in addition to repairing works at as many identified locations. In a bid to arrest the pollution from cloth washing activities on ghats, four dhobi ghats – Pandeypur, Nadesar, Bhavania Pokhran and Konia - have already been renovated while construction of three other at Bazardiha, Machodari Slaughter House and Bhawania Pokhri (extension) is underway. Whereas several users of the dhobi community have shifted to the new ghats, many more are being pursued for the same.

In a nutshell, a focused and output-driven approach to make river Ganga pure in Varanasi has yielded results. The objective of Nirmal Ganga will now not remain just a dream for Varanasi city.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for four sewerage projects costing Rs. 738.04 crore and four National Highways projects of 195 km. worth Rs. 3031 crore in Bihar tomorrow. The ceremony will take place at Mokama. Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport & Highways and Shipping will also accompany Prime Minister for the foundation stone laying ceremony. 

These four sewerage projects include Sewage Treatment Plant at Beur, Sewerage System with Sewer Network at Beur, Sewage Treatment Plant at Karmalichak and STP and Sewer Network at Saidpur. These projects together will create new STP capacity of 120 MLD and upgrade the existing 20 MLD for Beur. This also includes sewer network of 234.84 km in Beur and Saidpur zones. 

In Patna, seven other sewerage projects are at various stages of implementation, out of which two – Digha and Kankarbagh sewerage zones – worth Rs. 1402.89 crore are sanctioned under Hybrid Annuity-based PPP mode. The existing population in the city is 16,83,000 and the existing sewage generated in the city is 220 MLD and sewage load is expected to be 320 MLD by the year 2035. Compared to the existing sewage generation, the existing sewage treatment capacity is only 109 MLD. Also the existing STPs are outlived and are treating at a much lower capacity. The city also has 11 main drains which are discharging directly to river Ganga. 

The areas like Digha and Kankarbagh has no treatment facility. Thus the present treatment capacity and sewer system need immediate reorganization and extension to uncovered areas, besides proper operation and maintenance. Considering the existing treatment capacity of the city and existing waste generation and future waste generation till 2035, a total of 11 projects under World Bank funding are sanctioned for six zones which will create a total of 350 MLD of STP capacity and will lay down 1140.26 km of sewerage network at a cost of Rs. 3582.41crore. 

After completion of these 11 projects, Patna will become a town having 100% sewerage infrastructure and no sewage water will drain into River Ganga. 

Six projects regarding River Front Development/Ghat and Crematoria (including Patna RFD) are under implementation at a cost of Rs 377.58 crore. One River Surface Cleaning project worth Rs 3.96 crore and two Afforestation projects worth Rs 24.92 crore are also under implementation. Under the River Surface Cleaning project, a trash skimmer has been deployed in Patna. A total of 29 projects worth Rs.4929.17 crore are under various stages of implementation in Bihar under Namami Gange Programme. No effort is being spared by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) to clean River Ganga of pollution. 

The four National Highways projects for which foundation stone will be laid include 4-laning of Aunta –Simariya section of NH-31 and construction of 6-lane Ganga Setu at the cost of Rs. 1161 crore, 4 laning of Bakhtiyapur-Mokama section of NH-31 at the cost of Rs. 837 crore, 2-lane construction of Maheshkhunt- Saharsa-Purnea section of NH 107 at the cost of Rs. 736 crore, and 2-lane construction of Biharsharif – Barbigha- Mokama section of NH-82 at the cost of Rs. 297 crore.

            A large group of international and national persons of eminence are being invited for sharing their experiences in the field of Water and Power Management, Technical and Sociological interventions for achieving water and energy security in their individual areas and manage the assets created on a participatory basis.  In addition, there will be special sessions involving dignitaries, delegates, politicians, experts from the fields related to the event.  Expert professional bodies and think tanks are invited to put up Side Events addressing specific issues under the theme.

State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh have confirmed their participation as sponsor. Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Department of Science and Technology, Damodar Valley Corporation from Central Government Ministries/Organisations/Departments have also confirmed their participation as sponsor.

The Business to Business Exhibition “India Water Expo 2017” co-located with the conference will also be organized from 11 to 14 October, 2017 to focus on the latest technologies providing solutions to the water management issues.

  Water Resources are the prime input to the growth and prosperity of the nation.  Keeping in view the vital role of water in all aspects of life and also in assuring the development of economy, the Ministry of Water Resources has been observing “World Water Day” on the national level. During the year 2011, Ministry of Water Resources decided that the national level of celebrations be transformed to international level on the lines of the events taking place at Singapore and Stockholm.

  Water and energy are essential needs  in day to day life. At the same time, these are most important inputs for any efforts for social upliftment and economic growth of the country.  With the increasing demand by the growing population and improvement in economic status, the demands on the available resources are increasing and we have to constantly strive towards stretching the same water to satisfy larger needs. As a result, there is an urgency to conserve and utilize the limited availability of water resources in an optimum and efficient manner.  As a community resources, water needs to be managed and deployed in an equitable manner. The effective and efficient water management is possible through better understanding of issues, mutual cooperation among all stakeholders and adoption of comprehensive and integrated approach.

 In order to establish an international event focused on water resources of India, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India has been organising India Water Week since 2012 as an annual international event. Four editions of India Water Week have been organised so far in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. 

 The recommendations/action points emerged during earlier events of India Water Week have been sent to all concerned Ministries of Central Government as well as to all State Governments for their appropriate implementation.

 It is planned to make the IWW-2017 event more participatory by involving farmers and Water User Association (WUA), NGOs, Experts and other stakeholders. The Inaugural function will be followed by Plenary Session.  It is proposed to have a presentation of theme paper, presentation by Foreign Partner European Union, Platinum Sponsor Netherlands and presentations by invited speakers.  Also World Water Forum will make small presentation on forthcoming 8th World Water Forum to be held in Brazil in March, 2018.

In order to protect the rich aquatic biodiversity of river Ganga from escalating anthropogenic pressures, development of a Turtle sanctuary in Allahabad along with a River Biodiversity Park at Sangam have been approved under Namami Gange programme. 

The project at an estimated cost of Rs 1.34 crore would include development of River Biodiversity Park at Sangam (confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Sarasvati), establishment of a Turtle Rearing Centre (Permanent nursery at Triveni Pushp and makeshift annual hatcheries) and awareness about the importance of river Ganga and imperativeness of its conservation has been approved. 

This project will provide much needed platform to make the visitors aware of their place in the ecosystem, their roles and responsibilities, improve their understanding of the complexity of co-existence with the environment and help generate awareness for reducing the impact of human activities on critical natural resources. The task of dissipating knowledge about river Ganga will be taken up ardently in this project, which is 100% centrally funded. 

The sustenance of more than 2000 aquatic species including threatened gharials, dolphins and turtles in river Ganga exemplifies the rich biodiversity of this lifeline to over 40 per cent of the country’s population. Rivers Ganga and Yamuna at Allahabad are home to some of the most endangered fauna like turtles (Batagur kachuga, Batagur dhongoka, Nilssonia gangetica, Chitra indica, Hardella thurjii etc.), the National Aquatic Animal - Gangetic dolphin (Platanista gangetica), the Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and numerous migratory and resident birds.

                Central Water Commission (CWC) has signed MoUs with IIT Roorkee and MNNIT Allahabad to support dam rehabilitation efforts of various implementing agencies and CWC.

Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has taken on board selected premier academic and research institutes, for capacity building in the areas of dam safety through World Bank assisted Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).The scope includes strengthening the testing laboratories, enhancing analytical capabilities, exposure visits to best global institutions and on ground exposure to dam safety concerns to the faculty of these institutions.

CWC has already signed MoUs with IIT Madras, IISc Bangaluru, NIT Calicut and NIT Raurkela for supporting these institutes for the procurement of specified equipment and software for enhancing their testing and modeling capabilities. Last month, CWC facilitated the signing of MoUs by Madhya Pradesh Water Resources Department (MPWRD) and UJVN Limited (UJVNL), Uttarakhand with the Earthquake Engineering Department of IIT Roorkee for assisting MPWRD and UJVNL in the activities related to establishment of seismic instruments, certification of these installations, generation of post seismic event report having an intensity greater than 4.0 on Richter Scale and sharing of these reports with State and Central Agencies, data collection, processing, monitoring, analysis, interpretation, integration of the State Dam Seismological Network (SDSN) with Indian Dam Seismological Network (IDSN) being maintained by National Agencies to exchange the information and help to strengthen the existing seismological network for a strong national perspective plan, and conducting training programmes for the dam owning personnel.

DRIP is assisting rehabilitation of 225 dams in seven States which are experiencing different levels of distress. Owners of these dams require technical support for the investigation of dam conditions and supporting rehabilitation efforts. The Government of India has decided to enhance the capability of selected premier academic institutes in dam safety areas so that they, in turn, carry out field investigations and material testing, and provide training and consulting services to the dam owners in their dam rehabilitation efforts. In addition to rehabilitation of dams, Project also has component of institutional strengthening wherein capacity building of all partners agencies as well as few selected premier academic institutions of country are being strengthened in dam safety areas by imparting trainings to operational efficiencies of these owner agencies, exposure visits to best global institutions and on ground exposure to the dam safety concerns to the faculty of these institutions. It is a holistic effort of the Government of India to equip our national institutions to develop capability and expertise at par with global institutions in the coming times to ensure self-reliance.

                In an attempt to end Gender bias in women against women, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is undertaking an online campaign #IamThatWoman.

Through the campaign, the Ministry seeks to highlight the various aspects of women standing 'by' and 'for' women. Ministry of WCD has urged people to shun stereotypes associated with women harming other women. Twitter and Facebook users have been encouraged to tag and share stories of women helping women with a photograph and post online with the hashtag #IamThatWoman.

 Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said, ""When a woman has the support of her womanhood, she can be unstoppable. Through this campaign, we aim to shed light on the enormous contributions made by women for women. A mother-in-law can be her daughter-in-law's best companion. It is time we did away with the 'in-law' in 'daughter-in-law'. A woman manager can easily empathise with her female juniors and help her climb the ladder of success. Likewise, a landlady's affection towards a female tenant makes a world of difference in making the young girl feel at home, away from home. Join the '#IamThatWoman' campaign and spread the message that a woman can move mountains for another woman.""

The Women of India Orgnaic Festival organized by the Ministry of Women & Child Development came to a successful close on 15th October, 2017. The festival was organized at Dilli Haaat, INA, New Delhi as the largest festival of organic products by women farmers and producers. The Women of India Organic Festival has now become an annual event and exhibits/offers for sale most varied range of organic products including food, kitchen products, spiceies, pure fabric to wellness, personal care among others.

 The total sales by the women farmers and entrepreneurs who came from 25 States was Rs.1.84 Crores in this year’s women of India Organic Festival. Women participated from as far as Ladakh, Manipur, Sikkim and Pudduchery alongwith other states of the country. The festival saw footfall of around 2.35 lakhs visitors.

 The Women of India Organic Festival 2017 was inaugurated at Dilli Haat, INA by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi and Minister of State, Dr. Virender Kumar on 1stOctober, 2017.

  While emphasizing on the importance of going the organic way, Smt. Maneka Gandhi said, “Organic food has been proven to contain far more vitamins, minerals and nutrients than similar foods produced with chemical fertilizers, pesticides and preservatives. Economically too, organic farming is preferable since  it ultimately reduces cost of cultivation by 20-40% and increases the incomes of farmers by improving quality of production as well as the quality of soil. Above all, children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticide exposure. Now with the affordability factor coming into organic produce,  we should make a concerted effort to promote this sustainable alternative, thereby boosting the financial well-being of farmers as well as the health and longevity of consumers especially children.” 

 The main aim of the Festival was to support and encourage women and women-led groups that promote organic farming, thus supporting their local community’s economy, creating jobs and keeping farmers thriving, in addition to spreading proper awareness about the benefits of organic products.

 According to Ms. Damyanti Devi, a farmer from Uttarakhand, “We are so happy that the Ministry has given us the opportunity to sell our merchandise in Delhi. We had to procure merchandise twice over as we sold our initial goods in less than a week. This monetary benefit would certainly help in my daughter’s further education.” According to Ms. Thokcham Sonalika Devi, a farmer from Manipur, “We would like to thank the Ministry of Women and Child Development for organizing the Women of India Organic Festival and also giving us the chance to display our Chakhao black rice of Manipur, which was a total novelty for the people of Delhi. We also got many bulk orders for our products and hope to participate in many such festivals organized by the Ministry in the future too.”

 The participants of Women of India Organic Festival 2017 also enrolled themselves in Mahila E-Haat, another initiative of the Ministry of Women & Child Development to meet the aspirations and needs of women entrepreneurs. This unique e-platform exponentially strengthens the socio-economic empowerment of women beyond the Festival.

                On the occasion of the International Day of the Girl Child, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and UNICEF together organized a panel discussion on The Role of Sports in the Empowerment of Girls in New Delhi today. A power-packed sports team comprising of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Sachin Tendulkar, Indian Women’s cricket team captain Mitali Raj, former captain Indian women’s National Basketball Team, Raspreet Sidhu, Special Olympics athlete, Ragini Sharma, Karate champion, Mana Mandlekar  and International para swimmer and BBBP Champion from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, Rajni Jha participated in the panel discussion.

 

The panel discussion was initiated by the Minister of Women and Child Development Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi. UNICEF India representative Dr. Yasmin Ali Haque and Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava were present on the occasion.

 

Opening the session, WCD Minister said that the Government is working hard for the empowerment of girls and women. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao program, which was conceived and launched by the Prime Minister as a national flagship program, is committed to increasing the value of girls and creating an enabling environment for them to enjoy their rights, the Minister explained. The results of this program are highly encouraging in the 161 districts in which it has been launched, the Minister disclosed. She said that between the period 2015-16 and 2016-17 an improving trend is seen is Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) in 104 districts; 119 districts have reported progress in the first trimester registration against the reported ANC registrations and status of institutional deliveries has improved in 146 districts.

 

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that Sports is another dimension to this program that can play a vital role in transforming and empowering lives of women and girls. Today we are recognizing better the role of sports as a platform for girls to demonstrate their skills and achieve their aspirations."" It is for this reason that the Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs have decided to work together to promote greater participation of women in sports, the Minister said. A campaign will be launched to motivate girls and women to take up sports, more importantly, sports infrastructure for girls is proposed to be developed for which the Ministry of WCD is willing to contribute funds, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi explained.


Dr. Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF Representative in India said, “The International Day of the Girl Child is a long term commitment of multi-sectoral partners to continue to draw attention to all girls’ needs and opportunities. Three priorities that can change the paradigm completely are girls’ education, preventing their early marriage and enabling their safe mobility.”

 

Sachin Tendulkar, UNICEF Goodwill ambassador shared “My achievement in life is inspired by my parents and family who appreciated my talent as well as supported me as a young child. Parents and communities must see their daughters as assets – as individuals capable of standing on their feet and contributing to society, and not as burdens to be married in haste. This requires us to invest in daughters, as the Government of India is doing. We have to ease the financial burden on parents so that girls complete their education and take steps to fulfill their potential in their society and achieve their aspirations. We must address the concerns of parents, engage with them in making change possible. Child marriage and other social pressures hampers a child’s growth. I stand to SAY NO to Child Marriage and make a better world for our girls”.

 

“Irrespective of their gender, a sportsperson can overcome social, physical, and societal obstacles. I applaud the Government’s ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ program, which is bringing about a mindset change across India in how we can collectively ensure that the girl child survives and is given equal opportunity to flourish in every sphere of life,” said Ragini Sharma, Olympian para-athlete.

 

“As a sportsperson, I believe gender doesn't matter,” Mithali Raj said. “Each and every child should participate in sports, as it encourages teamwork, builds mental strength, keeps children healthy, and makes them confident to deal with life challenges.”

 

Rashmi Jha, International para-swimmer lauded the BBBP programme of the Government and said that “Achieving equality for girls and boys, women and men, starts from our own homes and lives. An enabling and supportive environment at home, school, college can go a long way in dismantling barriers for girls and encourage more girls to take up sports and move towards gender equality"".

 

The Valedictory Address was delivered by Sh. Rakesh Srivastava Secretary, WCD who reiterated Ministry of WCD’s commitment to achieving gender equality and solicited support of media in highlighting positive stories of women achievers to influence national and mainstream discourse in favor of girls and women and to bring visibility to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.

 

The Panel discussion was held on the occasion of International Girl Child Day as part of the celebration of “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Week- The Daughters of New India” from 9th October-14th October, 2017 to create Value of Girl Child in the backdrop of the Government of India’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) with its critical focus on survival, protection, education and development of the girl child. The panelists discussed long-term solutions which can be designed with and for girls to use sports as a catalyst to increase the value of the girl child, strengthen their resilience and provide transformational and lifelong opportunities and aspirations. The catalyzing role of sports in enhancing the value and empowerment of girls with education and life skills was also discussed.

 

The Government of India’s existing multi-sectoral programmes such as the BBBP have empowered millions of girls and families across the country by   providing opportunities and building futures for the girl child.  As womens’ sports grow more prominent, it is enabling girls, even from the most marginalized communities, to make informed choices, especially those who are at risk of child marriage or are already married and participate and achieve their dreams.  BBBP acknowledges the potential of adolescent girls to become the change makers and champions, breaking the mould, to claim their rights and dignity and inspiring others to do the same.

The first ever conference of Partner NGOs of WCD Ministry was held in New Delhi today. The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi inaugurated the conference titled “Implementation of Policies, Schemes and Programmes for Women and Children: Challenges and Way Forward”. More than 130 participants from various NGOs across the country attended today’s conference aimed at sensitizing them about the various schemes of WCD Ministry and to give them an opportunity to share their experiences and insights.

Addressing the participants, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that NGOs play a very vital role since a large numbers of schemes, programmes and policies of the government, which are being implemented at the ground level with the help of NGOs. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has taken up several new initiatives like One Stop Centres, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Women Helpline, National Policy for Women, Bill against Trafficking, National Alliance against Child Abuse amongst many such others, the Minister explained. She urged the NGOs to play an active role in the implementation of these initiatives as well as to give their suggestions for better delivery.

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that the flagship scheme launched by the Prime Minister, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has shown a tremendous success since 104 out of 161 BBBP districts have shown an increasing trend in Sex Ratio at Birth.

The WCD Minister held half an hour interaction with the participants in which they highlighted the various issues and problem being faced by them at the grass root level. Smt Maneka Gandhi said that Ministry is already training sarpanches and anganwadi workers and as suggested by the participants, it can also organize training programs for NGOs working in the field of women and children. The Minister also assured that an online facility will soon be created for the NGOs in the field of women and children to enable them to lodge their complaints or highlight their issues.

MoS WCD, Dr. Virendra Kumar lauded the role played by the NGOs in different areas. He said that the NGOs have been playing an important role in rehabilitation of trafficked women. Dr. Virendra Kumar said that issues related to security of women and children have become a matter of concern and the NGOs must come forward to work with the government in this area. Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava, while commending the important role of NGOs, hoped that the partnership between the government and the NGOs will grow and help in implementing the schemes and programmes successfully.

The today’s conference was based on the following broad themes:

Briefing the media in New Delhi today, Secretary WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava said that the International Girl Child Day is celebrated every year to promote empowerment of girls and reinforce gender equality. It also provides a platform to raise issues, concerns and challenges faced by girls. In order to influence national and mainstream discourse in favour of girls and women and visibility to BBBP, which is one of the flagship programmes of Government of India, Ministry of WCD will be celebrating the BBBP Week, he explained.

BBBP Scheme (Celebrate Girl Child, Enable her Education) was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister on 22nd January, 2015 at Panipat, Haryana as a comprehensive programme to address the declining CSR and related issues of disempowerment of women over a life-cycle continuum. The Scheme is being implemented in 161 districts of the Country and has completed two and half years of its implementation on ground. During this period, the States/UTs/Districts have undertaken several innovative initiatives to address the issue of declining child sex ratio and promote value of girl child.

The collective and coordinated efforts undertaken at national, state and districts level has been successful in establishing a substantial improvement in the number of girls being born in the target districts. As per the HIMS data for the 161 districts of BBBP, an increasing trend in Sex Ratio at Birth is visible in 104 BBBP Districts during 2016-17 as compared to the period 2015-16. Similarly, 119 districts have reported progress in registration of pregnancies in the first trimester during 2016-17 as compared to 2015-16. During the same period, Institutional deliveries against the total reported deliveries have improved in 146 districts in comparison to the previous year.

In this background, the BBBP districts have been requested to organize activities in a campaign mode to observe the Week starting from 9th October – 14th October 2017 to create awareness and sensitize community in their respective districts. The week-long celebration will witness various awareness generation activities and community engagement programmes such as Oath ceremonies, prabhat pherries, rallies, nukkad natraks, street plays, joint door to door campaigns by AWWs and ASHAs, Posters/Slogan-writing/ Drawing/Painting competition among school children, tree plantation in the name of girl child, distribution of birth certificates, opening of Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts, sensitization/orientation/counseling sessions and talk shows on gender, health and nutrition, legal rights and Acts.

At the National level, the occasion will also be marked by a Panel Discussion to be held on 11th October, 2017 coinciding with the theme for this year’s International Day of the Girl –“Girls Progress=Goals Progress: What Counts for Girls” to engage key sport influencers and women and girls role models from the field, to generate support through their voice and reach. Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Minister of WCD will be addressing the audience at the Panel Discussion, in whichsome of India’s leading women Sports Icons and local BBBP Champions will take part. Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Dr. Virendra Kumar will kickstart the BBBP week celebrations in New Delhi on 09th October, 2017.

                The Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi inaugurated the 3rd annual ‘Women of India Organic Festival’ at Dilli Haat (INA), today, in the presence of Minister of State, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Shri Virendra Kumar. The festival, which will be held till October 15, has on display India's most varied offerings of organic products ranging from food, wellness, personal care, home improvement, kitchen composters and solar products by nearly 530 participants. For most women, this is the first time that they are travelling to Delhi from remotest parts of the country to showcase their unique merchandise to the people of Delhi and surrounding areas.



            While emphasizing on the importance of going the organic way, Smt. Maneka Gandhi said, “Organic food has been proven to contain far more vitamins, minerals and nutrients than similar foods produced with chemical fertilizers, pesticides and preservatives. Economically too, organic farming is preferable since  it ultimately reduces cost of cultivation by 20-40% and increases the incomes of farmers by improving quality of production as well as the quality of soil. Above all, children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticide exposure. Now with the affordability factor coming into organic produce,  we should make a concerted effort to promote this sustainable alternative, thereby boosting the financial well-being of farmers as well as the health and longevity of consumers especially children.” 

            With the theme ‘Good for Women; Good for India; Good for you’, the Ministry intends to highlight the health and environmental advantages of organic goods, provide a platform for women engaged in it and boost the development of sustainable and easily accessible sales outlets for women producers from the remotest corners of India.

            Apart from rural women who will sell organic food produce, women participants with prominent brands such as Pro Nature Organics, Him Fresh Organics, Aura Herbal Textiles, Sonal WhiteCub, Sutra Pure Ayurveda, Real Life Organic, Guna Organics, Bhandora Organics, Quinta Essentia Organic, Nourish Organics, are some of the participants who will add further value with their vast lifestyle and personal care range.

            During the last edition of the festival, over 500 women entrepreneurs from Leh to Kanyakumari and from Kohima to Kutch came together with their organic products such as cereals, rice, pulses, spices, cosmetics, household products, pickles, organic ice cream, oils, honey, tea, hair care, bath care, beauty care, aromatherapy products, solar products, kitchen composters, organic cotton fabric, linen, organic seeds and other bio products. Seeing the success of last year’s Festival in Delhi, the Ministry extended the duration of the Festival from 10 days to 15 days for this year's edition.

                A Meeting was held on 25.10.2017 in NITI Aayog, under the Chairmanship of Shri Ratan P. Watal, Principal Adviser (Social Sector) to discuss about the New Arrangement for earmarking of funds for SCs and STs.

Principal Adviser emphasized in the meeting that the practice of notional earmarking of funds for SCs and STs has to discontinue. Ministries/Departments which do not have any schemes under which funds can be earmarked for SCs and STs may consider designing schemes that directly benefit SCs and STs. Monitoring of expenditure, output and outcome should be against actual earmarking.

Many valuable suggestions were made by the participants in the meeting. Others having issues regarding earmarking were requested to furnish their suggestions/comments separately so that the same could be considered while finalizing recommendations for earmarking of funds for SCs and STs.

The need for a new arrangement for earmarking of funds for SCs and STs has arisen in view of discontinuation of the system of planning and merger of plan and non-plan expenditure w.e.f. 2017-18.

So far funds are earmarked for SCs and STs under the Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) as per the guidelines of the Task Force constituted by the erstwhile Planning Commission. The Task Force had recommended for differential earmarking of funds i.e. different rates for identified Ministries / Departments for the Sub-Plans under Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and Central Sector (CS) Schemes implemented by each.

Promoting socio-economic interest of SCs and STs is a constitutional mandate. Therefore in view of change in system of budgeting, NITI Aayog had to look for a new arrangement for allocation, so that funds are provided adequately for inclusive development of these vulnerable communities.

With the objective of improving and upgrading the guidelines the matter was discussed widely with all stakeholders including Samavesh Forum of NITI Aayog. The meeting held today under the Chairmanship of Shri Ratan P. Watal with the Central Ministries/Departments, State Governments and National Commissions for SCs and STs was to carry forward the process of consultation.

A high-level delegation from the Government of India and the United States met today, at NITI Aayog to plan the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which will be held November 28-30 at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre in Hyderabad, India.

The Summit will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, who leads the U.S. delegation. 

The GES is the preeminent annual gathering of emerging entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders from around the world.  Through networking, mentoring, and workshops, the GES empowers entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas, build partnerships, secure funding, and create innovative goods and services that will transform societies.  This year, the focus will be on women entrepreneurs and the tremendous potential women bring to entrepreneurship.

GES 2017 will create an environment that empowers innovators, particularly women, to take their ideas to the next level. Women represent tremendous promise for economic growth and prosperity -- but in both developing and developed countries, also face tremendous barriers to building businesses. This year’s theme is “Women First, Prosperity for All” to celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit in all its strengths and diversity. 

GES 2017 will be attended by over 1600 delegates, including entrepreneurs and investors, CEOs of major knowledge-based industries, representing the full measure of entrepreneurial talent from diverse backgrounds across the world. The participants will be truly global, representing 160 countries, with representation from every region of the world. Entrepreneurs will represent a diverse range of geographies, industries, business size and scalability. Investors and representatives from organizations that support entrepreneurs will be hand-picked to catalyze investment, networking and mentoring. There will be special emphasis on empowering young and women entrepreneurs and the role they play in making communities more prosperous and secure through enterprise. 

NITI Aayog is taking the lead in organising this Summit for the Government of India. Amitabh Kant, CEO NITI Aayog stated that this is a unique opportunity for Indian Startups and Innovators to interact and network with the finest entrepreneurs of the world. He acknowledged the support of Government of Telangana in hosting the Summit at Hyderabad, and said “India, the oldest civilization, welcomes civilizations from across the world to GES 2017. We need to harness technology to solve some of the most pressing problems in healthcare delivery, education, energy, safe drinking water and agriculture, among others for the benefit of communities at large. Innovation and entrepreneurship will play a decisive role towards this end. I am sure this will be a unique opportunity for entrepreneurs to interact with the best.”

Jennifer Arangio, Senior Director at the National Security Council, The White House, said ""The United States is proud to partner with India for this year’s GES. Uniting under the theme Women First, Prosperity for All, the Summit will highlight the Trump Administration’s commitment to the principle that when women are economically empowered, communities and countries thrive. Hosting GES in India is a signature of the broad and enduring partnership between our two countries. We thank our co-host, the Government of India, for their support, energy and hospitality, and look forward to a high-impact Summit that brings together ground-breaking U.S. entrepreneurs and investors with their counterparts from around the world.” 

Innovations developed by entrepreneurs have transformed the world’s economies by creating jobs, increasing productivity, and improving the quality of life for people everywhere. The summit will primarily focus on four thematic sectors: Energy & Infrastructure, Healthcare & Life Sciences, Financial Technology & Digital Economy, and Media & Entertainment sectors.

The GES 2017 agenda consists of breakout sessions, master classes, and workshops.  Three networking sessions are planned in the schedule to enhance opportunities to interact with other GES 2017 participants. The summit will have Breakout Sessions where panelists will discuss key themes, innovative industries, and other aspects of entrepreneurship that are being highlighted in GES 2017.  Master Classes are immersive, and typically focus in depth on a certain topic.  Workshops invite more hands-on, interactive conversations on a chosen topic between the panelists and the audience.  

NITI Aayog and the U.S. Embassy are planning a series of ‘Road to GES’ events in collaboration with different agencies to generate enthusiasm and attract the attention of different stakeholders. 

As part of the summit, there will be a virtual exhibition of India’s innovative prowess in collaboration with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. It is also proposed to showcase India’s heritage, social entrepreneurship and craftsmanship in collaboration with the Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Culture.

                The First Meeting of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister chaired by Dr. Bibek Debroy, Member NITI Aayog, today identified major priorities for accelerating economic growth and employment over the next six months, with greater last mile connectivity. Attended by members including leading economists Dr. Surjit Bhalla, Dr. Rathin Roy, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Member Secretary Mr Ratan P Watal, also former Finance Secretary and Principal Adviser NITI Aayog, the deliberations of the Council took stock of the current economic, fiscal and monetary policy environment and identified key issues that it would focus on.

In his presentation, Chief Economic Advisor Dr. Arvind Subramanian focused attention on accelerating economic growth, including investments and exports-using a combination of different policy levers.

The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister today identified ten themes around which the Council Report would be structured in the coming months and developed by Theme Groups, led by its members, through consultative processes involving sectoral Ministries, States, experts, institutions, private sector and other key stakeholders. The ten themes identified are Economic Growth; Employment and job creation; informal sector and integration; fiscal framework; monetary policy; public expenditure; institutions of Economic Governance; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry; Patterns of Consumption & Production and Social Sector.

Another key issue recognized was the need for effective tracking of key economic parameters, through possible mechanisms for instituting an Economy Track Monitor, using lead indicators and triggers for action, based on informed assessment and analysis. It was also agreed that specific issue papers will also be brought out by members to address key concerns and linkages will be established with key national institutions.

The deliberations of the new Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister also reflect its value addition as an independent institutional mechanism, to provide informed advice to the Prime Minister on addressing issues of macroeconomic importance and related aspects. It is clear that this Council is focused on critical interventions related to accelerating economic growth and employment over the next few months, with greater social and financial inclusion, based on rigorous economic analysis. The Council views its role as also being a catalyst for action, by both developing and enabling action recommendations through different stakeholders.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found All India Film Employees Confederation (AIFEC), Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) & its affiliates and three producer associations i.e. Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA), Film and Television Producers Guild of India (FTPGI) and Indian Film and Television Producers Council (IFTPC) to be in contravention of provisions of Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) which prohibits anti-competitive agreements.

The ​F​inal O​rder was passed on an information filed by Shri Vipul Shah who alleged that specific provisions of the MoU dated 01.10.2010 (MoU) signed between FWICE and producer associations i.e. IMPPA, FTPGI, and IFTPC relating to member-to-member working, fixation of wages, charging for extra-shift, etc. to be anti-competitive. The conduct of FWICE and its affiliated craft associations in enforcing these provisions was also alleged to be anti-competitive. 

CCI found Clause 6, which mandated that the producer can only engage with the members of FWICE and its affiliates, and Clause 18, which provided for the constitution of vigilance committee to enforce Clause 6, of the MoU as violative of Section 3(3)(b) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. Further, the directive to engage dancers/fighters in the ratio of 70:30 was also found to be in contravention of Section 3(3)(c) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. Clauses relating to fixation of wages, payment for extra shift, etc. were not found to be anti-competitive.

CCI also noted in its order that trade unions enjoy no immunity or exemption for their conduct which contravenes the provisions of the Act and accordingly, the plea of the trade unions being governed only by the provisions of Trade Union Act, 1926 was rejected.

CCI has issued a cease and desist order against the associations in respect of the conduct found to be in contravention of the Act. However, no monetary penalty was imposed on any of the associations.

A copy of the order passed in Case No. 19 of 2014 under Section 27 of the Act has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found Grasim Industries Limited (GIL), Aditya Birla Chemicals (India) Ltd. (ABCIL) and Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd. (GACL)to be in contravention  of the provisions of Section 3(1) read with Section 3(3)(d) of the Competition Act, 2002 for rigging Delhi Jal Board tenders which were floated for procurement of Poly Aluminium Chloride  (PAC) which is used for purification of water.  

 The final order has been passed today on a reference filed by Delhi Jal Board (DJB).

 While rejecting the plea of being single economic entity taken by GIL and ABCIL, CCI noted in the order that these two companies are not only separate legal entities but also have participated in these tenders individually and separately. Further, CCI noted that the concept of single economic entity has no application in the context of the proceedings initiated under Section 3(3) of the Act, especially in a case of bid rigging/collusive bidding.

 Apart from issuing a cease and desist order against the above companies, CCI has imposed a penalty of Rs. 2.30 crore, Rs. 2.09 crore and Rs. 1.88 crore upon GIL, ABCIL  and GACL   for the anti-competitive conduct. The penalty has been levied @ 8 % of the average relevant turnover of GIL and ABCIL of preceding three years. In case of GACL, penalty has been levied @ 6 % of the average relevant turnover of preceding three years. The conduct of GIL and ABCIL was noted by the Commission as egregious as these companies while apparently submitting separate bids, prepared and finalised the same through common channels creating a façade of competitive landscape.

Vide separate order passed in another reference filed by DJB in respect of alleged bid rigging in the tenders floated for Liquid Chlorine- another chemical used for purification of water, CCI found no contravention as no analysis was done by the Director General with respect to basic price, transportation cost, taxes and policy of profit margin of the parties as was done in the previous reference.

 A copy of the CCI’s order passed in Ref. Case Nos. 03 & 04 of 2013 has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.
