                The Tezpur University community should provide innovative solutions to local and national problems, said the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind. He was addressing the 19th Convocation of the Tezpur University at Tezpur, Assam today (February 26, 2022). He said that the students and faculty of Tezpur University should try to make it a major centre of innovation. He urged them to encourage community participation and use local resources for finding solutions to local and national problems. He was happy to note about innovative solutions provided by Tezpur University for making safe drinking water reach many villages in Assam. He said that the scope of the university’s engagement with villages should be further expanded. It can adopt some villages for helping in their overall development under Universities’ Social Responsibility.

 

The President said that Assam is gifted with extraordinary beauty of nature and rich bio-diversity. This has to be preserved. Every resident of Assam, especially the youth has to be very active on the fronts of conservation and sustainable development. He was happy to note about the renewable energy initiatives of the Tezpur University, especially in the villages. He said that the young population has greater stakes in keeping the planet green and they have to demonstrate greater awareness through their action. 

 

The President said that Assam has done a commendable job in conserving bio-diversity. Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, as also the Elephant Reserve are impressive examples of conservation. He said that conservation must be the watch word for every citizen, especially the student community.

 

Noting that the North-Eastern states give high priority to organic farming, the President said that the Tezpur University can play a major role in branding and marketing of agricultural produce of this region. He was happy to note that the university has received approval under the ‘Prime Minister-Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme’ for setting up an incubation centre to process jackfruit and ready to eat cereals-based products. And the Food Engineering & Technology Department has been recognised as State Level Technical Institute for implementation of the Scheme. Referring the unique Joha rice of Assam which is known for its excellent taste and aroma, he said that universities of Assam can help the farmers by branding, popularising and marketing this unique variety of rice. There are many such agricultural products that can be promoted, he added. 

 

Pointing to the fact that academic activities have been affected by the Covid pandemic, the President said that the pandemic has had serious impact on the education of the relatively vulnerable sections of our people. He said that the National Education Policy 2020 which was released during the pandemic contains specific focus on digital education with the help of technology. With a view to making higher education more accessible, the central government has decided to establish a Digital University to provide access to students across the country for world-class quality universal education with personalized learning experience at the doorsteps of students. The Digital University will provide education in different Indian languages and ICT formats. He said that Tezpur University can become an active stakeholder in this initiative, specially by providing high quality digital content in Assamese and other languages of the North-East.

 

The President urged the entire team of Tezpur University to keep past, present and future students bound by the spirit of oneness and move rapidly towards the goals set by the university – xopaan bogaam teebro gotire. He said that by moving fast to achieve ambitious targets, the university would be able to contribute meaningfully to India’s emergence as a much more prosperous and strong nation by the year 2047 when the students of today will be among the decision makers. He said that the real spirit behind celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, marking 75 years since our independence, is to build upon our learning so far and aim for higher goals. He urged Tezpur University to strive to be among the top 10 universities in the NIRF ranking in the near future.

The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated an international conference on ‘Bharat Bodh’ (Idea of Bharat) organized by the Indira Gandhi National Open University and Bhartiya Shikshan Mandal today (February 23, 2017) in New Delhi. 
Speaking on the occasion, the President complimented the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and the Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal for organizing this conference bringing together intellectuals, academicians and researchers to unravel various aspects of the “Bharat Bodh” (Idea of Bharat).  He expressed happiness that these two collaborators have brought their respective areas of expertise and scholarship to this important three day conference. He stated that the synergy and dynamism of these institutions should channelize the exploration of thousands of years of our journey as a civilization and people. He also hoped that deep insights would be gained into the idea of statecraft, governance, individual-society relations, structures, purposes and methodology of education, organic relationships with nature, and correlation between spiritual and material life.
The President said that Bharat has always been recognized as the storehouse of knowledge and discovery - knowledge which liberates, and discovery which fathoms the deepest thoughts of humanity and co-existence. As the origin and repository of philosophical and spiritual values, rivers of wisdom flow through the collective consciousness of our great people. He quoted American author Mark Twain and said “India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only”. The President said that this was indeed true. India is a land of great traditions, history and discoveries. Its people have lived in this great civilization giving rise to a unique trait of oneness overcoming the apparent contradictions, thriving on a composite culture and yet alive to the identities of its sub-parts. The President said that India is a land of huge diversity. Yet all its people are living under one system, one flag and one Constitution. All of us are proud to be Indiansand we celebrate this diversity.  He hoped that the deliberations at the Conference would enrich our perceptions regarding our country.   
The President said that the idea of Bharat flows from the eternal wisdom of our rich intellectual traditions. Constant churning and refinement has been the secret of the continuity of the Bharatiya thought through times and turbulences. Our core civilizational values which are equally relevant today and which speak  of love for the motherland, performance of duty, compassion for all, tolerance for pluralism, respect for women, honesty in life, self-restraint in conduct, responsibility in action, and discipline – form the Bharatiya world view. The Bharatiya conceptualization of the world encompasses philosophy, knowledge systems, principles of statecraft and legality, literature, architecture, art and music and all other important spheres of life. The diverse strands of the Bharatiya thought find unity in their objectives similar to the diversity and oneness of the universe. They remain instilled with the same essential spirit residing in every being and non-being. This is manifested in the unique ways of celebrating our diversity and confluence, and change with continuity.

Shri Kabir was a brilliant judge and I have many fond memories of my  association with him during his tenure as Chief Justice of India.

The  second batch of volunteers from villages adopted by RashtrapatiBhavan   under the ‘Smart Gram’ Initiative were presented certificates on  completion of their training under Skill development and Internship  training programme at a function held in RashtrapatiBhavan today  (February 14, 2017).

After presenting the certificates, Secretary to the President, Smt.  Omita Paul said that the experiment of training in traditional systems  of medicine at RashtrapatiBhavan has resulted in a kind of movement  focusing on AYUSH which is spreading. Already five batches of trainees  have successfully completed their training at the AYUSH Wellness Clinic  in RashtrapatiBhavan.  With the aim of giving relief to patients,  efforts have also been made to connect traditional systems of medicines  with the allopathic system.  She urged the   trainees to always have an  open mind and remember that learning is a lifelong process.  She also  hoped that the training would not only benefit the volunteers but also  the people of the villages where they came from.

Volunteers from villages of Dhaula, Alipur, Harchandpur and RojkaMeo  were imparted training for sixty days in traditional systems of  medicine.  Red Cross Society also provided First Aid training and the  National Skill Development Corporation collaborated with  RashtrapatiBhavan with regard to Recognition of Prior Learning.  A total  of five batches have been successfully trained at AYUSH Wellness Clinic  of RashtrapatiBhavan so far, of which those who received certificates  today were the second batch of trained volunteers from villages adopted  by RashtrapatiBhavan.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the first  phase of a Solarization Project in the President’s Estate today  (February 10, 2017) under which 670 KW of solar power will be generated  through rooftop solar panels installed on seven buildings in the  President’s Estate.
Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Rashtrapati  Bhavan is not just the residence and office of the President of India  but the President’s Estate is a small township which has grown and its  requirement of energy has also been increasing.  Depletion of energy  resources poses a serious challenge particularly for future generations.   He stated that India has signed the Paris Climate Change Agreement and  has committed that by 2030, at least 40% of its electricity will be  generated from non-fossil sources.  He said that harnessing solar energy  is crucial in this context. India has a target of reaching upto 100 GW  of solar power generation by the year 2022. Thus, enhancing the capacity  of solar power generation in the country becomes even more important to  fulfill this commitment.  He was happy that the President’s Secretariat  has taken efforts in this direction.
The President also appreciated the innovative ideas displayed in the  Green Energy Exhibition held as part of the event.  He wished the young  students who presented a NukkadNatak and participated in modeling and  painting competitions all success in their future endeavours. Skill  development and carrier counseling classes for girl students of classes  11 and 12 of Dr. Rajendra Prasad SarvodayaVidyalaya were also  inaugurated on the occasion by the Secretary to the President, Smt.  Omita Paul.
The savings in electricity bills resulting from the Solar Project are  expected to be more than approximately Rs 80 lakh per year.  The  generation of solar power will result in significant reduction in carbon  footprint and make the Estate more energy efficient. The Project is  being implemented in President’s Estate in collaboration with Rural  Electrification Corporation (REC).

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee will inaugurate the first  phase of a Solarization Project in the President’s Estate tomorrow  (February 10, 2017) under which 670 KW of solar power will be generated  through rooftop solar panels installed on seven buildings in the  President’s Estate.    

The savings in electricity bills resulting from this project is expected  to be more than approximately Rs 80 lakh per year.  The generation of  solar power will result in significant reduction in carbon footprint and  make the Estate more energy efficient.  

As part of the inaugural event, a day long exhibition showcasing various  aspects of energy conservation and green energy is also being held with  the support of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL), Rural  Electrification Corporation, Green Jobs Sector Skill Council, Bureau of  Energy Efficiency, Central Electronics Limited and Energy Efficiency  Services Limited. 

Painting and science model competitions as well as a Nukkad Natak on the  theme of energy efficiency/solar power will be organized on the  occasion.  Quizzes and games on green energy will be conducted for  students. A life-skill training course for girls of classes 11 and 12 of  Dr. Rajendra Prasad Sarvodaya Vidyalaya by TPDDL will be also launched.

                The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee will open the annual ‘Udyanotsav’ of the Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow (February 04, 2017).
 
       The highlights of this year’s ‘Udyanotsav’ include two new varieties of roses named after the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee and his late wife Smt. Suvra Mukherjee; Vertical Gardens and Air Purifying Plants which absorb toxins from polluted air.
 
The two varieties of roses named ‘President Pranab’ and ‘Suvra Mukherjee’ were developed by Shri Pranabir Kumar Maity and Shri Ashok Kumar Maity of Pushpanjali Rose Nursery at Jakpur, West Bengal in honour of the President. The Indian Rose Federation recognized the same and issued a certificate after trials in January 2017.  The roses were subsequently planted in the Mughal Gardens and are expected to blossom soon. 
 
About 14,000 Tulip bulbs in seven different colors such as red, orange, yellow mixed with red, pink, and purple have been planted in Mughal Gardens.
 
Several beds of roses, including both new and heritage varieties are the main attraction of the Long garden. Flower Carpets in magnificent designs will be on display in the Central Lawns revealing the skill and craft of the gardeners of Rashtrapati Bhavan.
 
The dominant color scheme of this year’s ornamental flowers is various shades of yellow, red and orange. A small cactus corner, as in previous years, forms part of the display.  Exhibition Stalls will be set up near the Spiritual Garden displaying produce of fresh vegetables and fruits grown in the President’s Estate Organic Farm. Visitors and plant lovers will also be able to see a Lotus pond with a cascading waterfall in the Spiritual Garden.
 
The Mughal Gardens will remain open for general public from February 05 to March 12, 2017 (except on Mondays which are maintenance days) between 0930 hrs to 1600 hrs.  Members of the public will also be able to visit the Spiritual Garden, Herbal Garden, Bonsai Garden and Musical Garden. 
 
Entry and exit for the general public will be from Gate No. 35 of the President’s Estate, close to where North Avenue meets Rashtrapati Bhavan. Visitors are requested not to bring any water bottles, briefcases, handbags/ladies purses, cameras, radios/transistors, boxes, umbrellas, eatables etc. Such articles, if any, will have to be deposited at the entry point. However, arrangements of drinking water, toilets, first aid / medical facility; rest rooms for senior citizens, women and children are provided at various places in the route for public.
 
The Mughal Gardens will be open exclusively on March 10, 2017 to special category of visitors viz farmers, differently abled persons, defence/para-military forces and Delhi Police personnel from 0930 hrs. to 1600 hrs.  This entry and exit will be through Gate No. 35.  
 
The Tactile Garden will also be open for visually impaired people on March 10, 2017 from 1100 hrs. to 1600 hrs.  Entry and exit will be from Gate No. 12, situated on Church Road (next to the North Avenue).

                 The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that we need to move towards implementing a framework of sustainability that synthesizes both the human and the environmental elements of security for sustainable human development. He was delivering the 6th Prof. Moonis Raza Memorial Lecture, here today, organised by the Prof. Moonis Raza Memorial Trust.
 
Speaking about Prof. Moonis Raza, the Vice President said that his work blurred the boundary between traditional human geography and environmental science, synthesizing both natural and socio-economic elements of geography, and its impact on the human landscape. A Muslim by birth, a Marxist by orientation and an agnostic in matters metaphysical, Moonis sahib was acutely aware of the sociological imperatives of the Indian scene, he added.
 
The Vice President said that sustainable development cannot be achieved by technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone. We need to change the way we think and act, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the human security approach is tied intrinsically to the idea of sustainable human development, which envisions not only generating economic growth but distributing its benefits equitably, regenerating the environment rather than destroying it, and empowering people rather than marginalizing them. It is increasingly apparent that approaches to development, based merely on economic values are insufficient, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the articulation of views by some members of the new Administration in the United States has raised questions on the future of sustained global action on climate change and may put at risk the immediate goals and commitments to mitigating climate change impact and promoting sustainability. He further said that the developing shift in the global system, from an outward-looking to a more inward-looking stance, would also create challenges for strengthening global cooperation. It is sad to conclude that the travellers of spaceship earth continue to be mired in conflicts of narrow self-interest and are yet to reach a consensus on how to change the disastrous trajectory we are on, he added.
 
Following is the Text of Vice President’s Lecture:
 
“It is an honour to be invited to deliver the 6th Moonis Raza memorial lecture.
 
Professor Moonis Raza, Moonis bhai to his friends and acquaintances of my generation, was more than an academic. He was a leading light of the progressives group in the Aligarh Muslim University of the early and mid fifty’s of the last century and, in a period when ideological predilections were candidly proclaimed, he espoused them with rare vigour and commitment.
 
Contemporaries like Athar Parvez saheb have recorded for posterity his informal mannerism on visits to Aligarh years after he left the campus. This trait of his personality has been recalled by many others in later years in Delhi.
 
Moonis saheb's tenure as Vice Chancellor of Delhi University is remembered as productive in terms of overall growth and educational activities. He was a co-founder of the Jawaharlal Nehru University and left his imprint both on its physical surroundings as on its liberal ethos that now seems to have become a matter of concern to some people whom Alexander Pope would have described as narrow souls.
 
His academic calling was that of a geographer with a focus on human geography. His work blurred the boundary between traditional human geography and environmental science, synthesizing both natural and socio-economic elements of geography, and its impact on the human landscape. He taught that culture, society, economics and politics all contribute to our changing natural environment and that it is only by appreciating these factors that we can make sense of the complex relationships between people and places and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.
 
Some in this audience would recall that ten years after the Stockholm Conference of 1972 on Human Environment, a reinforced awareness of the deterioration of environment and natural resources took shape in the UN General Assembly in 1983 through its decision to establish the Brundtland Commission whose report in 1987 coined the term ‘Sustainable Development’ and defined it as development that meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own demands.
 
The Report focused on three dimensions of sustainable development: environment, the economy and community. Inspired by this, an attempt was made to promote sustainability in higher education through the Talloires Declaration of 1990. Moonis Raza was one of the movers behind this Declaration and its ten point action plan mooted by the Association of University Leaders; the latter included a commitment to increasing awareness of environmentally sustainable development for a sustainable future.
 
At a time when globalisation, rapid population growth and human migration are placing increased pressure on our natural resources, there is a need to understand better what Moonis Raza called ‘the world around us and our place within it’.
 
We live in a dynamic, human-dominated ecosystem in which non-linear, abrupt and irreversible environmental changes are becoming frequent. Governance for sustainability in this epoch of human activities that impact on the Earth’s ecosystem requires a re-definition and re-evaluation of the objectives, underlying values and norms of our actions, as also of knowledge systems, power structures and concept of security.
 
Recent years have seen a paradigm shift in how we perceive and define security. By placing people, rather than territories, at the centre of the security rubric, we developed the concept of ‘human security’. This goes beyond traditional notions of national and military security and includes issues such as development and respect for human rights. It provides an integrated comprehensive framework for designing, developing and evaluating humanitarian affairs and capacity building initiatives in emergency, transitional and development contexts. It recognizes that today’s globalizing societies continue to be affected by old threats such as inter-state wars and internal conflicts as also newer and recurring challenges that undermine both people and their institutions. This has entailed an expansion of the meaning of security, shifting the focus from only the survival of States to both survival and dignity of human beings.
 
In large measure, human security is dependent on peoples’ access to natural resources and vulnerabilities to environmental change — and a substantial part of environmental change is directly and indirectly affected by human activities and conflicts. The environment thus impacts human survival, well-being and dignity —all aspects of human security.
 
Consequently, the human security approach is tied intrinsically to the idea of sustainable human development, which envisions not only generating economic growth but distributing its benefits equitably, regenerating the environment rather than destroying it, and empowering people rather than marginalizing them.
 
It is increasingly apparent that approaches to development, based merely on economic values are insufficient. There is a need for a broader emphasis on sustainable development. This understanding has led to the identification of a more focused field- environmental security- which examines how the environment is connected to security. In such examinations, human beings and social relationships become the objects, or preferably subjects, that are to be secured from environmental threats — not States.
 
Environmental change can have direct and immediate effects on well-being and livelihoods. Thus water scarcity, besides being an immediate or remote cause of war may still engender insecurity by contributing to dehydration-related death, reducing food production, and undermining livelihood opportunities. It can also have a variety of impacts ranging from health to economic productivity to political instability and can impact individuals, families, communities, social organizations, and particularly affects marginalized and vulnerable groups. While some environmental problems are localized, others are widespread and can have an impact on future generations.
 
The links between people, nature and economies are inescapable when looking at environmental security and development as they relate to human security. Aspirations for security and development tend to go beyond efforts to protect individuals from environmental threats or protect the environment from human actions. They are being increasingly based on practical steps to seize upon the opportunities presented by the environment, in recognition of its inherent value, and its deep connections to human beings, societies and economies- to bring about development that is sustainable.
 
The idea of sustainable development developed steadily to the Rio de Janeiro Conference of 1992. It was nurtured over the subsequent decade by ‘Local Agenda 21’ activities and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. Climate change and sustainability were again the focus of the UN’s COP21 climate change conference at Paris in December 2015, which saw the adoption of the ‘universal climate agreement’ for global action.
 
The fundamental insights that launched the idea of sustainability are firmly established today. There is growing realization that efforts to protect nature will fail unless they simultaneously advance the cause of human betterment much as efforts to better the lives of people will fail if they fail to conserve, if not enhance, essential resources and the environment.
 
The challenge is to make this understanding work for all people everywhere, including poor and marginalised.
 
The jubilation of reaching a consensus at Paris COP has been tempered with caution and criticism. Far from being a Marshall plan for planet Earth, the climate Agreement is being seen as a ‘mixed bag’, with one activist group arguing that governments failed to put humanity’s interests above ‘narrowly defined and short-term interests’, adding that the deal only offers a ‘frayed life-line to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people’.
 
Other critics of the Agreement have said that only the vague promise of a new future climate funding target has been made, while the deal does not force countries to cut emissions fast enough to forestall a climate change catastrophe, which will only ramp up adaptation costs further in the future. 
 
Implementing of global measures would, in any case, be meaningless without a united front of seemingly disparate interests, be they anti-austerity groupings on the one hand, or climate change activists on the other. Environment, economy and politics are vast, but related peas in a complex pod.
 
The articulation of views by some members of the new Administration in the United States has raised questions on the future of sustained global action on climate change. This may put at risk the immediate goals and commitments to mitigating climate change impact and promoting sustainability. The developing shift in the global system, from an outward-looking to a more inward-looking stance, would also create challenges for strengthening global cooperation.
 
Today, more than ever, we need to move towards implementing a framework of sustainability that synthesizes both the human and the environmental elements of security for sustainable human development. This is needed for ensuring the survival, livelihood and dignity of people, and to provide systemic solutions to our myriad problems - human migration, climate related disasters, recurring famines, chronic poverty, pandemic diseases and extreme inequalities among others, while underscoring the persistence, interdependence and universality of a set of freedoms which are fundamental to human life.
 
Sustainable development cannot be achieved by technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone. We need to change the way we think and act. This requires education and learning for sustainable development, at all levels and in all social contexts, to enable us to, constructively and creatively, address present and future global challenges and create more sustainable and resilient societies.
 
Nor can individual initiatives be underplayed since environmental pollution or degradation is as much an individual act as a community one. Practiced consistently, small steps facilitate both gradual evolution and rapid revolution for lasting positive change.
 
A former Indian Prime Minister, addressing a global conference on environment had pointed out,
“It is clear that the environmental crisis which is confronting the world will profoundly alter the future destiny or our planet. No one among us, whatever our status, strength or circumstance can remain unaffected. The process of change challenges present international policies. Will the growing awareness of ""one earth"" and ""one environment' guide us to the concept of ""one humanity""? Will there be a more equitable sharing of environmental costs and greater international interest in the accelerated progress of the less developed world? Or, will it remain confined to a narrow concern, based on exclusive self-sufficiency?”
 
This was said in 1972. It is sad to conclude that the travellers of spaceship earth continue to be mired in conflicts of narrow self-interest and are yet to reach a consensus on how to change the disastrous trajectory we are on. We do, nevertheless, need to thank those early pioneers – including human geographers like Professor Moonis Raza - who drew attention to the criticality of the problem.
 
One last word about the social awareness of the personality we have gathered here to honour. A Muslim by birth, a Marxist by orientation and an agnostic in matters metaphysical, Moonis sahib was acutely aware of the sociological imperatives of the Indian scene. In a paper in September 1994 he dwelt upon the communal situation and in that context analysed the socio-economic situation of the Muslim community, whose ‘Indianness and Muslimness’, he said, are defining characteristics that can neither be ignored nor underplayed.
 
Drawing upon the then available data, he emphasised both the socio-economic plight and regional specificities of the community and concluded that ‘since development is indivisible ‘the destiny of the Indian Muslims is an integral component of the destiny of India, and the destiny of India is irrevocably linked with the destiny of Indian Muslims. The two are inseparably intertwined, contingent upon and flowing from each other. The agenda of our times, therefore, calls for the progress of India along with the advancement of its Muslim citizens, and simultaneously for the advancement of its Muslim citizens along with the advancement of India.’
 
That was 12 years before the Sachar Committee Report of 2006 and its correctives, and 20 years before ‘sub ka saath, sub ka vikas’ of May 2014. A couplet of Mirza Ghalib comes to mind; an optimist would say that both remain work in progress.
 
Jai Hind.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that we need to move towards implementing a framework of sustainability that synthesizes both the human and the environmental elements of security for sustainable human development. He was delivering the 6th Prof. Moonis Raza Memorial Lecture, here today, organised by the Prof. Moonis Raza Memorial Trust.
 
Speaking about Prof. Moonis Raza, the Vice President said that his work blurred the boundary between traditional human geography and environmental science, synthesizing both natural and socio-economic elements of geography, and its impact on the human landscape. A Muslim by birth, a Marxist by orientation and an agnostic in matters metaphysical, Moonis sahib was acutely aware of the sociological imperatives of the Indian scene, he added.
 
The Vice President said that sustainable development cannot be achieved by technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone. We need to change the way we think and act, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the human security approach is tied intrinsically to the idea of sustainable human development, which envisions not only generating economic growth but distributing its benefits equitably, regenerating the environment rather than destroying it, and empowering people rather than marginalizing them. It is increasingly apparent that approaches to development, based merely on economic values are insufficient, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the articulation of views by some members of the new Administration in the United States has raised questions on the future of sustained global action on climate change and may put at risk the immediate goals and commitments to mitigating climate change impact and promoting sustainability. He further said that the developing shift in the global system, from an outward-looking to a more inward-looking stance, would also create challenges for strengthening global cooperation. It is sad to conclude that the travellers of spaceship earth continue to be mired in conflicts of narrow self-interest and are yet to reach a consensus on how to change the disastrous trajectory we are on, he added.
 
Following is the Text of Vice President’s Lecture:
 
“It is an honour to be invited to deliver the 6th Moonis Raza memorial lecture.
 
Professor Moonis Raza, Moonis bhai to his friends and acquaintances of my generation, was more than an academic. He was a leading light of the progressives group in the Aligarh Muslim University of the early and mid fifty’s of the last century and, in a period when ideological predilections were candidly proclaimed, he espoused them with rare vigour and commitment.
 
Contemporaries like Athar Parvez saheb have recorded for posterity his informal mannerism on visits to Aligarh years after he left the campus. This trait of his personality has been recalled by many others in later years in Delhi.
 
Moonis saheb's tenure as Vice Chancellor of Delhi University is remembered as productive in terms of overall growth and educational activities. He was a co-founder of the Jawaharlal Nehru University and left his imprint both on its physical surroundings as on its liberal ethos that now seems to have become a matter of concern to some people whom Alexander Pope would have described as narrow souls.
 
His academic calling was that of a geographer with a focus on human geography. His work blurred the boundary between traditional human geography and environmental science, synthesizing both natural and socio-economic elements of geography, and its impact on the human landscape. He taught that culture, society, economics and politics all contribute to our changing natural environment and that it is only by appreciating these factors that we can make sense of the complex relationships between people and places and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.
 
Some in this audience would recall that ten years after the Stockholm Conference of 1972 on Human Environment, a reinforced awareness of the deterioration of environment and natural resources took shape in the UN General Assembly in 1983 through its decision to establish the Brundtland Commission whose report in 1987 coined the term ‘Sustainable Development’ and defined it as development that meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own demands.
 
The Report focused on three dimensions of sustainable development: environment, the economy and community. Inspired by this, an attempt was made to promote sustainability in higher education through the Talloires Declaration of 1990. Moonis Raza was one of the movers behind this Declaration and its ten point action plan mooted by the Association of University Leaders; the latter included a commitment to increasing awareness of environmentally sustainable development for a sustainable future.
 
At a time when globalisation, rapid population growth and human migration are placing increased pressure on our natural resources, there is a need to understand better what Moonis Raza called ‘the world around us and our place within it’.
 
We live in a dynamic, human-dominated ecosystem in which non-linear, abrupt and irreversible environmental changes are becoming frequent. Governance for sustainability in this epoch of human activities that impact on the Earth’s ecosystem requires a re-definition and re-evaluation of the objectives, underlying values and norms of our actions, as also of knowledge systems, power structures and concept of security.
 
Recent years have seen a paradigm shift in how we perceive and define security. By placing people, rather than territories, at the centre of the security rubric, we developed the concept of ‘human security’. This goes beyond traditional notions of national and military security and includes issues such as development and respect for human rights. It provides an integrated comprehensive framework for designing, developing and evaluating humanitarian affairs and capacity building initiatives in emergency, transitional and development contexts. It recognizes that today’s globalizing societies continue to be affected by old threats such as inter-state wars and internal conflicts as also newer and recurring challenges that undermine both people and their institutions. This has entailed an expansion of the meaning of security, shifting the focus from only the survival of States to both survival and dignity of human beings.
 
In large measure, human security is dependent on peoples’ access to natural resources and vulnerabilities to environmental change — and a substantial part of environmental change is directly and indirectly affected by human activities and conflicts. The environment thus impacts human survival, well-being and dignity —all aspects of human security.
 
Consequently, the human security approach is tied intrinsically to the idea of sustainable human development, which envisions not only generating economic growth but distributing its benefits equitably, regenerating the environment rather than destroying it, and empowering people rather than marginalizing them.
 
It is increasingly apparent that approaches to development, based merely on economic values are insufficient. There is a need for a broader emphasis on sustainable development. This understanding has led to the identification of a more focused field- environmental security- which examines how the environment is connected to security. In such examinations, human beings and social relationships become the objects, or preferably subjects, that are to be secured from environmental threats — not States.
 
Environmental change can have direct and immediate effects on well-being and livelihoods. Thus water scarcity, besides being an immediate or remote cause of war may still engender insecurity by contributing to dehydration-related death, reducing food production, and undermining livelihood opportunities. It can also have a variety of impacts ranging from health to economic productivity to political instability and can impact individuals, families, communities, social organizations, and particularly affects marginalized and vulnerable groups. While some environmental problems are localized, others are widespread and can have an impact on future generations.
 
The links between people, nature and economies are inescapable when looking at environmental security and development as they relate to human security. Aspirations for security and development tend to go beyond efforts to protect individuals from environmental threats or protect the environment from human actions. They are being increasingly based on practical steps to seize upon the opportunities presented by the environment, in recognition of its inherent value, and its deep connections to human beings, societies and economies- to bring about development that is sustainable.
 
The idea of sustainable development developed steadily to the Rio de Janeiro Conference of 1992. It was nurtured over the subsequent decade by ‘Local Agenda 21’ activities and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. Climate change and sustainability were again the focus of the UN’s COP21 climate change conference at Paris in December 2015, which saw the adoption of the ‘universal climate agreement’ for global action.
 
The fundamental insights that launched the idea of sustainability are firmly established today. There is growing realization that efforts to protect nature will fail unless they simultaneously advance the cause of human betterment much as efforts to better the lives of people will fail if they fail to conserve, if not enhance, essential resources and the environment.
 
The challenge is to make this understanding work for all people everywhere, including poor and marginalised.
 
The jubilation of reaching a consensus at Paris COP has been tempered with caution and criticism. Far from being a Marshall plan for planet Earth, the climate Agreement is being seen as a ‘mixed bag’, with one activist group arguing that governments failed to put humanity’s interests above ‘narrowly defined and short-term interests’, adding that the deal only offers a ‘frayed life-line to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people’.
 
Other critics of the Agreement have said that only the vague promise of a new future climate funding target has been made, while the deal does not force countries to cut emissions fast enough to forestall a climate change catastrophe, which will only ramp up adaptation costs further in the future. 
 
Implementing of global measures would, in any case, be meaningless without a united front of seemingly disparate interests, be they anti-austerity groupings on the one hand, or climate change activists on the other. Environment, economy and politics are vast, but related peas in a complex pod.

Addresses the Media onboard 
 


The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the East African Community is taking shape as an Economical and Political Community and many of our programmes and initiatives in the region will no longer be purely bilateral but will have to be adapted to work for the entire community. He was addressing the Media Onboard Air India One aircraft while returning back from a 5-day visit to Rwanda and Uganda, today. The Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, Shri Vijay Sampla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
 
The Vice President said that there had been a gap in high level visits to both of these countries and this visit filled that gap. He further said that the level of discussions in both the countries were extremely warm and cordial, adding that his meetings went beyond pro-forma. The meeting with the President of Uganda was substantive and productive and reinforced our long standing ties, he said.
 
The Vice President said that India's approach, as long standing friends, has been to give our African partners assistance in their developmental programmes in those areas where they want and it is them to convert that into specific requests. He further said that the broader issues of India's approach to cooperation with African Countries are well known and well appreciated. One issue of concern to both India and Africa is scourge of terrorism and there was a total meeting of minds in condemning terrorism in all shapes and forms, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the visit to Kigali Genocide Memorial was a tribute to the determination of the people of Rwanda and that he was glad that they were able to overcome that heart-rending disaster and re-build their country.
 
Reacting to a question on trade imbalance, the Vice President said that there was trade imbalance with Uganda as India exports a lot of things to them and their export basket to India was presently limited. He further said that there are two ways to address this; one by increasing the products in their export basket and two; instead of exporting finished goods from India to Uganda, some Indian manufacturers could set up their manufacturing units in Uganda.
 
Responding to a question on Parliamentary cooperation with both countries, the Vice President said that there is a need for having more Parliamentary interactions. He further said that a Parliamentary visit from Rwanda and Uganda will expose them to what is happening in India and witness our developmental programmes.
 
Reacting to a question on India sustaining engagements with Africa, the Vice President said that it was a part of Government's policy and that the India-Africa summit and various other initiatives make this evident. He further said that the sheer size of Africa with 54 countries and one billion people, create enormous chances of cooperation and of sharing our experience and skills which are useful to them. Africa also has enormous resources which can be useful as India's development requirements come up, he added.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that our commercial and business ties with Uganda are dynamic and form a key pillar of our bilateral relations. He was addressing the India-Uganda Business Meeting in Kampala, Uganda, today. The Vice President of Uganda, Kiwanuka Edward Ssekandi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Uganda’s expanding economy offers opportunities in a variety of sectors. He further said that the Indian education institutions provide opportunities for quality education at a fraction of the cost of western institutions to an ever increasing number of students from Africa, including from Uganda. India has been a source of affordable pharmaceuticals and specialized healthcare for people of Africa, he added. 

The Vice President said that the Indian community in Uganda is vibrant and holds an important position in Ugandan economy in manufacturing, trade and service sectors. Indian businesses employ thousands of Ugandans and are among the largest contributors to tax revenue in Uganda, he added. 

The Vice President said that India has emerged as one of the largest investors and trading partners of Uganda. The Vice President thanked the Government of Uganda for welcoming Indian entrepreneurs who have sought business opportunities in Uganda. 

Following is the Text of Vice President’s address: 

""I thank Hon’ble Vice President of Uganda for his gracious presence here today. I also thank the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), the Private Sector Foundation Uganda and Indian Business Forum (IBF), Uganda for organizing this business event. 

Our commercial and business ties with Uganda are dynamic and form a key pillar of our bilateral relations. I am told that every month, more than 70 Ugandan businessmen travel to India to explore business opportunities with India. It is a matter of satisfaction that India is one of the largest trade partners of Uganda but at US$ 615 million, our bilateral trade is yet to reach its true potential. 

Uganda’s expanding economy offers opportunities in a variety of sectors. Uganda is blessed with natural resources, including fertile soil and a strong agrarian base, deposits of minerals, and now even, petroleum that has been discovered. Recent economic reforms have ushered in rapid growth. We encourage our companies to remain engaged and invested in the opportunities that the Ugandan economy presents. 

Both Uganda and India have a youthful population. Our young people are our greatest resource. But to realise their potential, we need to educate them and give them the skills needed to become productive in our increasingly complex world. 

Indian education institutions provide opportunities for quality education at a fraction of the cost of western institutions to an ever increasing number of students from Africa, including from Uganda. The Government of India also offers several scholarships and fellowships to Ugandan students to enable them pursue a variety of scholastic and vocational programmes and research courses in India. These students will eventually become the bridgeheads for enhancing our commercial and people to people relations in the future. 

India and Uganda have similar demographic profiles and disease burden and face similar challenges related to health and well-being of our populations. India has been a source of affordable pharmaceuticals and specialized healthcare for people of Africa. Several Indian hospitals have developed facilities to serve medical cases referred to them from Africa, including from Uganda. Many of them have also shown interest in setting up integrated healthcare facilities in Uganda, providing high quality medical and nursing services across a wide range of specialties. 

The Indian community in Uganda is vibrant and holds an important position in Ugandan economy in manufacturing, trade and service sectors. Indian businesses employ thousands of Ugandans and are among the largest contributors to tax revenue in Uganda. 

Over the past few years, India has emerged as one of the largest investors and trading partners of Uganda. This has been possible due to the continued and positive support of the Ugandan Government. I thank the Government of Uganda for welcoming Indian entrepreneurs who have sought business opportunities in Uganda and I request that the Ugandan government continues with such support and encouragement for our companies seeking business in Uganda. 

Allow me to share with you, what transpired when I called on His Excellency the President of Uganda earlier today. I came away from that meeting with a reinforced confidence in the desire of the two governments to continue to engage with each other and a send a powerful message to the business Communities in both of our countries that here are the business opportunities which have to be availed of. His Excellency, the President was particularly emphatic in pointing out that the Indian manufacturers, in a wide range of areas, can benefit very considerably, by factoring in the thought that they are not looking at the market in Uganda only, but at much wider market of the Eastern African community and surrounding areas. 

So, as the Hon'ble Minster has said, you are looking at the market of 350 million people in East Africa and not simply a market of 28 or 30 million people. And this thought has to sink-in because many of the things which are manufactured and transported here, can just as well they manufactured here with Indian knowledge and expertise for a much wider market in this region. This is the message my delegation and I are taking back to the Government and the business in India and this is something on which we are going to work together, jointly, for mutual benefit. 

I wish the Business Meet success in its deliberations today, I am confident that bilateral relations between the two countries will keep growing and scaling new heights in future. 

Thank You.""

                The Vice  President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the imperatives  of our shared history and cultural links; our complementary strengths  and capacities that make us natural economic and commercial partners;  our common approach in meeting development challenges towards building a  sustainable future; our cooperation from a shared perspective on  addressing peace and security related issues; and a convergence of views  on matters global drive African-Indian engagement which based on our  shared challenges, common interests, and perceptions of mutual benefit.  He was delivering lecture at the University of Rwanda on 'Rwanda, India  and Africa: Imperatives for Cooperation', in Kigali, Rwanda, today. The  Minister of Education, Rwanda, Dr. Musafiri Papias Malimba and the  Chancellor of the University of Rwanda, Dr Mike O’Neal were present on  the occasion. 
 
 
The Vice  President said that the youth today would have the wisdom to avoid the  follies and limitations of the past and look forward instead to a future  for our world in which the operative principle would be cooperation  rather than contention and the objective would be mutual benefit rather  than selfish greed. He complimented the people of Rwanda on the  impressive signs of development and progress evident everywhere and  added that this has been possible due to the foresight and sagacious  vision of the leadership and the hard work of the people. He further  said that India sees itself as a strong development partner to Rwanda.
 
Quoting the  Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Vice President said that India  and Africa had ‘a strong emotional link’ defined by our shared history  of struggle against colonialism and our aspiration to bring prosperity  to our people. Our approach has not been one of demanding privileges or  rights to projects, but rather a desire to contribute to the achievement  of Africa’s development objectives as they are established by Africans  themselves, he added.
 
The Vice  President said that India has also sought to develop innovative  mechanisms such as our concessional Lines of Credit tailored to the  requirements and capacities of our partners in Africa, so that they do  not become another channel leading them into a debt trap. He further  said that in a time when the global political and economic situation is  marked by uncertainty and upheavals the need for developing economies to  cooperate and consult in a new spirit of solidarity assumes renewed  significance. The great potential in this relationship provides both  India and our African partners an opportunity to benefit significantly  from its enlargement, he added.
 
Following is the Text of Vice President's Lecture:
 
"" I am happy to be here in  this beautiful land and to have the opportunity to share some thought  with the young people, who would shape the world of the future in their  own chosen ways.
I say this in the  confidence that your generation would have the wisdom to avoid the  follies and limitations of the past and look forward instead to a future  for our world in which the operative principle would be cooperation rather than contention and the objective would be mutual benefit rather than selfish greed.
My delegation and I bring  to you the greetings and good wishes of the 1.3 billion people of India  and particularly of the world’s largest number of youth, 328 million,  who constitute 28 percent of our population and who, like young people  everywhere, are anxious to build a better world.     
Last month, we in India,  had the privilege to welcome His Excellency President Paul Kagame as a  special guest at the Vibrant Gujarat event. This gesture was  instrumental in consolidating further our bilateral relationship.
I must compliment you on  the impressive signs of development and progress that are evident  everywhere. This, I understand, has been possible due to the foresight  and sagacious vision of the leadership and the hard work of the people. 
We in India see ourselves  as a strong development partner to Rwanda. We are already cooperating in  sectors such as solar electrification, food processing, skill  development and hydropower projects. 
During President Kagame’s  recent visit an understanding has been reached for a new line of credit  worth $ 80 million for a road project. We are also committed to  continuing and enhancing the provision of scholarships for training of  Rwandan civilians and defence personnel under various technical  cooperation and cultural cooperation programmes.
Our bilateral trade has  doubled over the last five years, but at US $ 106 million, remains  modest and much below its potential. Rwanda has a dynamic economy and  ranks highly in the ease of doing business, providing many incentives  for investors. We share with Rwanda, this strong desire to provide  stable democratic governance and opportunities for growth and prosperity  of our people. 
Yesterday, I had the  pleasure of inaugurating, jointly with Prime Minister Murekezi, the  Rwanda-India Business Forum that will bring together business partners  from our two countries. We also inaugurated an exhibition that showcases  some of the more useful and cost-effective innovations from Indian  industry that can be adapted for use here. 
On our part, we continue  to encourage Indian companies to be bolder and more imaginative in  seizing the opportunities that Rwanda presents.
The upsurge in  India-Africa relations comes at a time when the world has acknowledged  India’s growth story. The rapid growth of our economy over the last 25  years has provided India with additional resources, not only to augment  its own developmental efforts, but also to collaborate with our partners  in their developmental efforts across the world, and particularly in  Africa. 
It takes place at a time  when Africa has cast-off its image of deprivation and hopelessness and  has taken control of its own resources and destiny, as winds of  progress, peace and participation sweep across this great continent.  This new-found confidence and developmental zeal is best demonstrated by  your own country whose economic performance has been termed  ‘remarkable’ by the International Monetary Fund.
India’s engagement with Africa has its own unique script, based on what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called, ‘a strong emotional link’ defined by our shared history of struggle against colonialism and our aspiration to bring prosperity to our people. 
The imperatives that drive  African-Indian engagement are based on our shared challenges, common  interests, and perceptions of mutual benefit.
The first imperative comes from our shared  history and cultural links. India owes an unforgettable debt of  gratitude to Africa’s role in inspiring our struggle for national  liberation. It was on this continent that Mahatma Gandhi developed and  first practised the concepts of non-violence and peaceful resistance  that won India its freedom. 
Our present choices are  informed by our shared experience of anti-colonial struggle against  exploitation and racial discrimination. India, despite the constraints  of its growing economy, was a forerunner in championing the interests of  developing countries, including those from Africa, through initiatives  such as the Bandung declaration of 1955, the Group of 77 and the  Non-Aligned Movement. 
In addition, a large  number of people of Indian origin call Africa their home, a number of  them being based in the Eastern and Southern parts of Africa. They  contribute to the growth of local economy and provide a link between  their adopted homes and their country of origin. 
The second imperative  comes from our complementary strengths and capacities that make us  natural economic and commercial partners. India provides a long-term,  stable and profitable market to the goods and services that Africa  generates. For India, Africa has the potential to become a major  contributor to our energy security and food security requirements. This  is a ‘win-win’ situation. 
India is increasingly an  important source of investment for projects in Africa, which span  diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, information technology and  telecommunications, engineering, education, health and agriculture.  Indian private sector has been a pioneer in making investments in  Africa, contributing to generation of employment and growth in the  countries receiving such investments. 
The quantum of Indian  investments in Africa has increased in recent years and is presently  estimated to be about $ 35 billion, with a large part of it concentrated  in Southern and Eastern Africa.
Agro business initiatives  have been a crucial component in our commercial exchange. Indian  successes in agriculture have taken place in the context of low capital  intensive farming and varied climatic conditions, which can be of  relevance to Africa. Furthermore, the growing middle-class in urban  India can become a dependable consumer for African food processing  industry. 
In order to address the  trade imbalance and diversify the trade basket, India has already  offered duty-free access to Indian markets, with very few exceptions,  for all the Least Developed Countries of Africa.
The third imperative comes from our common approach in meeting  development challenges towards building a sustainable future for our  people. The African leadership is aware of India’s domestic experience  and success in developing a vibrant manufacturing and services sector,  while encouraging inclusiveness at societal level. 
While each country has its  own unique development story, the answer to many issues confronting us  in health and well-being, food security and nutrition, energy, climate  change, water and sanitation lie perhaps in the mirror image that India  and Africa present in terms of demography, disease burden and resource  constraints; and how we have met these challenges through innovative  solutions. 
Africa and India can thus learn much from each other in terms of capacity building, program implementation and innovation.
Our development  cooperation engagement with Africa is unique, based on mutual benefits  while contributing to Africa’s development objectives through a  consultative process. Our approach has not been one of demanding  privileges or rights to projects, but rather a desire to contribute to  the achievement of Africa’s development objectives as they are  established by Africans themselves. 
A wide range of areas have  been covered including agriculture, small and medium enterprises,  science and technology, health, education, culture, infrastructure,  energy, communications, civil society and governance. Our partnership  model is premised on human resource development and institution building  in partner countries. This in turn, creates skills and capacities in  Africa – particularly in sectors such as agriculture, food processing,  textile and small industries-- and benefits expansion of their export to  India and other countries.
India has also sought to  develop innovative mechanisms for implementing these initiatives, such  as our concessional Lines of Credit, which are tailored to the  requirements and capacities of our partners in Africa, to ensure that  they do not become another channel leading them into a debt trap.
To support our development  cooperation in Africa, the Government of India has announced  concessional credit of over $ 10 billion, over a period of next five  years, in addition to the ongoing credit lines. A grant assistance of $  600 million has also been announced, including $ 100 million for the  India Africa Development Fund and $ 10 million for the India Africa  Health Fund. 
The grant assistance will also cover more than 50,000 scholarships for African students in India over the next five years.
The fourth imperative  for our cooperation comes from a shared perspective on addressing peace  and security related issues and a convergence of views on matters  global. We share similar views and positions on a variety of global  concerns, ranging from combating terrorism and piracy to coordinating  our positions in global forums over issues such as reforms at the United  Nations, world trade and climate change. The reform of political,  security and economic institutions of global governance has been a key  area of such cooperation, with both Africa and India underlining the  urgency of undertaking such reforms, including a meaningful expansion of  the United Nations Security Council.
The threat of terrorism  has emerged as a major impediment in our quest for peace and prosperity  for our people. The spreading tide of terrorism and extremism is a  threat that all civilised societies face today. In India we face the  threat from across our borders. Terrorist action and violence cannot be  justified on any grounds. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and  manifestations and call for strong and concerted international efforts  to deal with this menace in a comprehensive manner.
India also remains  committed to ensuring stability and peace in Africa under a genuine  multilateral effort led by United Nations. In pursuance of this  commitment, India has over 6000 personnel committed to UN peacekeeping  duties in Africa. In addition, we have worked bilaterally with our  African partners to enhance defence training and capacity building in  security domains.
In a time when the global  political and economic situation is marked by uncertainty and upheavals  threaten the stability of the global order, the need for developing  economies, which seek stability, peace and prosperity for their people,  to cooperate and consult each other in a new spirit of solidarity  assumes renewed significance.
India’s commitment to  developing a strong partnership with Africa is reflected in our recent  initiatives, particularly under the rubric of the India Africa Forum  Summit, whose third edition was held in New Delhi in 2015 with  participation from 54 African countries. 
The Forum provided an  opportunity for the African leaders to explore what India offered to  them. The outcome document of the summit –“Delhi Declaration” and  “Framework for Strategic Partnership”- reflected the common positions of  India and Africa on a wide array of political and economic issues as  well as an articulation of our joint commitment to deepening our mutual  cooperation. 
The meeting provided a new  direction to Africa- India relations based on equality, mutual respect  and shared gains in addition to identifying broad areas of cooperation  in political, economic and social development.
These developments are but  a start. Our relations are a long way from reaching the peak. The great  potential, therefore, in this relationship provides both India and our  African partners, an opportunity to benefit significantly from its  enlargement. 
Long Live India-Africa Amity
Long Live India-Rwanda Friendship
Thank You.""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that India-Rwanda Innovation Growth Program is being launched to expand ties in Science, Technology and Innovation, and the program aims at creating an ecosystem wherein Indian innovations and technology enterprises will thrive and encourage business ventures from both sides. He was addressing the India-Rwanda Business Forum organized jointly by the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Rwanda Development Board  in Kigali, Rwanda, today. The Prime Minister of Rwanda, Mr. Anastase Murekezi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 
 
The Vice President said that Rwanda has put behind it the unfortunate genocide of 1994 and the efficient and clean city of Kigali captures the great strides that this country is taking on its path of growth and prosperity.  He further said that Rwanda today offers a range of prospects to investors, including in renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture, mining, tourism, and Information and Communications Technology. Trade between India and Rwanda has been gradually increasing over the last few years, he added.
 
The Vice President said that several Rwandans have travelled to India for medical treatment and have come back satisfied. India is also increasingly becoming a preferred destination for quality and affordable education for Rwandan students, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the translation of ideas and innovations into practical applications will require the 3 Ds of Discovery, Development and Delivery. We are now ready to work with our partners in Rwanda and other partners of Africa in transferring our experience in building an innovation driven economy, he added.
 
Following is the Text of Vice President's address:
 
"" I convey my deep appreciation to the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Rwanda for his gracious presence here today. I also thank the Rwanda Development Board and the Private Sector Federation of Rwanda and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) for organizing this business event and for inviting me here. 
It is an exciting prospect to see the captains of trade and industry from Rwanda stand alongside members of Indian business Community and innovators from various parts of India. This portends well for the future of Rwanda-India commercial and economic relations.
The efficient and clean city of Kigali, captures the great strides that this country is taking on its path of growth and prosperity. Rwanda has put behind it the unfortunate genocide of 1994 and has embarked on the path of economic development. Its economy has since made steady and considerable progress.
Rwanda today offers a range of prospects to foreign investors, including in renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture, mining, tourism, and Information and Communications Technology.  The spectacular growth story of Rwanda, a result of the prudence and vision of Rwandan leadership, represents the dynamism and opportunities of African continent. Rwanda offers a wonderful platform to Indian partners to enhance their presence and capacities in other parts of Africa.
Our bilateral  relations  are  marked  by  cordiality,  convergence  of  views and  cooperation  on  major  international  issues. Bilateral trade and investments have shown a healthy rise. Trade   between   India   and   Rwanda   has   been   gradually increasing over the last few years.  Rwanda is also a beneficiary of the Duty Free Tariff Preference Scheme of the Government of India extended to Least Developed Countries. Rwanda can avail of this facility to increase their exports to India. In fact, one of the key elements of the joint declaration issued during the official visit of President Kagame to India last month was to double trade in the next five years. 
India  is also a  preferred  destination  for  affordable  and  quality  health  care  for Rwandans. Several Rwandans have travelled to India for medical treatment and have come back satisfied. India is increasingly becoming a preferred destination for quality and affordable education for Rwandan students. Every year more than 500 student visas are issued to Rwandan nationals. 
The Government of India also offers scholarships and fellowships to Rwandan students to enable them to pursue undergraduate, masters, post-graduate, and research courses in India under ITEC, ICCR, CV Raman Fellowship and Special Agricultural Scholarships. In addition to these, several short-term,  fully-funded,  training  courses  will  be  offerred  to  Rwandese nationals as part of the initiatives under the  India –Africa Forum Summit.  
India-Rwanda Innovation Growth Program is being launched to expand ties in Science, Technology and Innovation. After this Pilot project, the programme is proposed to be implemented in the East African Community in seven countries and will then be scaled to seven other economic zones across Africa. Under the Programme, 20 demonstrated and validated Indian technologies and innovations are expected to be adopted over a period of two years. The joint ventures created with Rwandan partners can deliver many sustainable social enterprises that will stimulate economic development in Rwanda. The program aims at creating an ecosystem wherein Indian innovations and technology enterprises will thrive and encourage business ventures from both sides.
The translation of ideas and innovations into practical applications will require the 3 Ds of Discovery, Development and Delivery. India has, over the years, developed certain expertise and skills in domains of low-capital intensive innovations. We are now ready to work with our partners in Rwanda and other partners of Africa in transferring our experience in building an innovation driven economy in Africa.  
I wish the Business Meet and Innovation Exhibition a great success. I am confident that bilateral relations between the two countries will grow further with more frequent exchanges between businesspersons for mutual benefits.
Thank You.

Delivers 5th K. Subarhmanyam Memorial Lecture - ‘Some Thoughts on the Domestic Dimensions of Security’
 
 
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the domestic threats to security can be conventional or non-conventional. He was delivering the 5th K. Subarhmanyam Memorial Lecture titled ‘Some Thoughts on the Domestic Dimensions of Security’ organised by the Global India Foundation, here today.
 
The Vice President said that safeguarding the political and cultural identity of a state necessitates identification of threats, potential and actual, that emanate from within a state. 
 
Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:
 
“It is a privilege to be invited to talk about a legendary personality of our times who, it has been rightly said, dominated debates on national security inside and outside the government for over four decades and helped raise public awareness of it. 
 
KS, as he was universally known, was a passionate advocate of national interest in the classic sense, and helped shape institutional pursuit of it through his writings and his work of many years as Director of the IDSA and later as the Chairman of the Kargil Review Committee and in the National Security Advisory Board.
 
Subrahmanyam’s primary concern was national security and he would not have objected to being described as a ‘realist.’ He spelt out his understanding of national security in an essay in August 1997 wherein he lamented ‘the lack of cerebration and anticipation of likely developments’ in relation to external and domestic threats and advocated ‘proactive policies for damage avoidance or limitation.’ He amplified this in a long paper IDSA in Retrospect wherein he lamented the inadequacy in India of ‘the culture of think-tank consultations’, noted with approval the change in India’s policy on the nuclear question, and identified ‘terrorism and the emerging international balance of power and India’s role in it’ as matters requiring intense domestic debate and awareness among policy makers.
 
Subrahmanyam’s concern about the inadequacy of strategic policy formulation was endorsed by informed American opinion on the subject.    
 
The concept of national security is unavoidably linked to what is perceived to be the national interest of a country. The latter has evolved over time and most analysts today would endorse Hans Morgenthau’s description of it as ‘protection of physical, political and cultural identity against encroachment by other nation-states.’ Another definition, along the same lines, is that of Barry Buzan: ‘Security is taken to be about the pursuit of freedom from threat and the ability of states and societies to maintain their independent identity and their functional integrity against forces of change, which they see as hostile. The bottom line of security is survival, but it also reasonably includes a substantial range of concerns about the conditions of existence.’ 
 
Of Morgenthau’s three ingredients, the physical is perhaps the simplest in terms of definition. It implies protection of the state from external aggression or subversion. This responsibility has been shouldered by state entities throughout history and the instrumentalities for discharging it effectively have been honed accordingly, in terms of available economic and technological capabilities, to deter transgressors and to inflict appropriate costs on them.
 
Protection of India and Indian interests also implies being an active participant in the global community of states. This necessitates shaping and reinforcing the rules, norms and institutions that would be the foundation of peace, security and prosperity in the coming decades. Foremost among these would be conventional and non-conventional threats to security.
 
The Annual Report of the Ministry of Defence for 2014-15 sums up our security environment and challenges to it. Defining it as a complex interplay of regional and global imperatives and challenges, the thrust of strategy and policies is aimed at providing a secure, stable, peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood. The operative principle for this is building strength through strategic autonomy and self reliance. 
 
The Report depicts terrorism, insurgency and sectarian conflict from our West and North as threats to stability along with challenge posed by non-traditional threats such as WMD proliferation, drugs, human trafficking, etc. New challenges have also emerged in the domains of Cyber and Space, with the demonstration of offensive and capabilities by certain countries. 
 
In addition, we face multifaceted internal security challenges which include left wing extremism, an ongoing proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, insurgencies in some states in the North East and organised crime.   
 
The other two elements, political and cultural identity, relate to the very nature of the society in question, its state structure, and its self-identification. The existential reality of modern India is a plural society of immense diversity devoted to the realisation of the objectives and ideals enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution. It is premised on the individual as the basic unit of citizenship on terms of equality with every other citizen. It therefore aspires towards a form of citizenship that is marked neither by a universalism generated by complete homogenisation, nor by particularism of self-identical and closed communities’ The operative principle for this is ‘national-civic’ rather than ‘national-ethnic’ though a segment of opinion today would want to modulate or amend it and espouse instead an Indian version of ‘cultural nationalism’ premised on ‘religious majoritarianism’. This would be in contrast to the hitherto accepted philosophy of liberal nationalism that ‘celebrates the particularity of culture together with the universality of human rights, the social and cultural embeddedness of individuals together with their personal autonomy.’ 
 
The challenges posed by this approach were summed up by a political scientist some years back: 
 
‘In the semantics of functional politics the term national integration means, and ought to mean, cohesion and not fusion, unity and not uniformity, reconciliation and not merger, accommodation and not annihilation, synthesis and not dissolution, solidarity and not  regimentation of the several discrete segments of the people constituting the larger political community… Obviously, then, Integration is not a process of conversion of diversities into a uniformity but a congruence of diversities leading to a unity in which both the varieties and similarities are maintained’.
 
The conventional domestic threats to national security have been categorised by the Ministry of Home Affairs in four groups: (i) terrorism in the hinterland of the country, (ii) cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir, (iii) militancy in the North Eastern States; and (iv) left-wing extremism in certain states. It assessed that in 2014 ‘the internal security situation of the country, with special reference to terrorism, militancy and insurgency, showed significant improvement.’ Left-wing extremism, it added, remains a matter of concern; it ‘has to be seen from a long-term perspective since short-term fluctuations in violence profile is a recurring phenomenon.’
 
Apart from civil society studies, Left Wing Extremism that affects 10 states of the country was the subject of two comprehensive official reports in 2008, one by the Administrative Reforms Commission and the other by the Planning Commission. The former described the left extremist movement as ‘the greatest challenge to internal security,’ as largely agrarian and one that ‘has gained people’s confidence, grown in strength particularly in forest and tribal areas, by mobilising dispossessed and marginalised sections. The latter concluded that the development paradigm that has been imposed on marginalised sections of society, has been disproportionately cornered by the dominant sections at the expense of the poor and, in the case of tribes in particular has ended up in destroying their social organisation, cultural identity, and resource base and generated multiple conflicts, undermining their communal solidarity which cumulatively makes them increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. 
 
Pointing to the diversity of these movements of protest, the Planning Commission opined that ‘calling and treating them generally as unrest, a disruption of law and order, is little more than a rationale for suppressing them by force. It is necessary, it added, ‘to contextualise the tensions in terms of social, economic and cultural background and bring back on the agenda the issues of the people – the right to livelihood, the right to life and a dignified and honourable existence. The State itself should feel committed to the democratic and human rights and humane objectives that are inscribed in the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of the Constitution. The State has to adhere to the Rule of Law. Indeed, the State has no other authority to rule.’
 
The Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its report on the Demands for Grants for 2013-2014, had described Left Wing Extremism as ‘the single biggest threat to India’s internal security’ and as a challenge to the democratic fabric of the country. It had recommended that the Central and State Governments should ensure that the fruits of development should reach the LWE infested areas and more employment offered to the youth there.
 
In answer to an Unstarred Question in Rajya Sabha on December 9, 2015, the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that ‘LWE violence has declined since 2011, adding that ‘the Central Government has been pursuing a four pronged strategy to tackle LWE insurgency – security related measures; development related interventions; ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities and public perception management.’
 
Despite this improving trend in official assessments, and the impression that  the Maoist movement is reaching a plateau, States like Orissa still consider LWE ‘a major cause for concern’ and knowledgeable scholars express caution about the possibility of early success in overcoming the challenge posed by LWE: ‘Possibly, the Maoist challenge could be defeated in approximately seven to ten years.’
 
Another aspect of internal security, not highlighted in the Report of the Ministry of Home Affairs but very much in the public mind, relates to social cohesion. Threats to it emanate from sporadic instances of caste, communal or other sectional instances of social disharmony. The underlying cause of these is a failure at individual or group levels to give shape to the requirement of fraternity enjoined in the Preamble of the Constitution and the duty imposed on every citizen by article 51A(e). It is only through fraternity that the discussion, and practice, moves beyond tolerance to acceptance. 
 
It needs to be said that many if not all of these instances of social strife also portray a failure of the state agencies to undertake timely preventive or corrective action. Making an assessment for 2016, the South Asia Terrorism Portal has observed that ‘while the immediate challenge of terrorism and insurgency has receded cross the country and across the ideological spectrum, the conflict potential in India remains high and is often exacerbated by state policy and partisan politics.’     
 
Some years back the sociologist T.K. Oommen had sought to shift the debate from one-dimensional, realist, state-centric security to a comprehensive approach in which ‘security becomes the conjoint concern of three pillars - state, market and civil society.’ He argued that instead of dichotomous constructions, the focus should be on the notion of ‘conceptual optimality,’ of continuum, and that since “insecurity manifests itself in genocide, culturocide and ecocide,” a society free from them may be conceptualised as a secure society. 
 
Safeguarding the political and cultural identity of a state necessitates identification of threats, potential and actual, that emanate from within a state. These domestic threats to security can be conventional or non-conventional. The ambit of both has widened in our times and the conceptual framework today refers to Human Security. The latter, as defined in UN General Assembly Resolution 66/290 of September 10, 2012, ‘does not replace state security’ but asserts the right of people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair.
 
Why has a wider paradigm of analysis become necessary?
 
When ‘We the People of India’ gave to themselves a Constitution on November 26, 1949 they spelt out, in the Preamble and in the sections on Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties, the objectives sought to be achieved. These go beyond the framework of traditional security even though the latter is an indispensable pre-requisite for the creation of conditions in which the citizens can endeavour to bring forth the desired fruits of their labour. 
 
Seven decades after independence there is widespread unrest, discontent and conflicts among sections of population. There are threats emanating from regional and social imbalances, which have given rise to and fuel insurgencies, terrorism, sub nationalism and communalism. Economic disparities have created social tensions, urban unrest, rural upsurge and youth disenchantment. Problems of deprivation, unemployment, poverty, hunger and food shortage, lack of housing, over-crowding, and degradation of basic amenities have given rise to anger and crime. The problem is aggravated by increasing numbers. 201 of 535 districts in India are affected with one form of violence or the other. As a result, many in the public are losing faith in the system, in the ability of the law enforcement agencies to maintain order and enforce the rule of law, and in the ability of the judicial system to provide justice.
 
It is evident from Planning Commission and Niti Ayog studies, India Social Development Reports, UNDP’s Human Development Reports and other credible studies that human security at individual and community levels leaves much to be desired even when traditional security concerns have been addressed. 
 
In the disturbed and insurgency infested areas people feel insecure both from the insurgents and the state. The state’s response has been to seek more security forces and greater militarization of the environment. Centrifugal tendencies and alienation both at the community and group level are increasing. Public feels that the state is absent in areas of their interest and that its interest is detached from them. In critically disturbed areas, the state’s functional presence is diminishing. The paradox is that both the state and society are insecure. 
 
Furthermore education, health, public distribution system and civic services are on the verge of breakdown. The quality of life in rural and urban areas except for the affluent has deteriorated and the gap between the haves and have-nots have widened.
 
The focus of internal security is, and should be, the society. Issues of individual liberty and Society’s security often appear at odds with each other. The key to dealing with internal security is to keep the focus on both the people and society, and on the Rule of Law that, regrettably, ‘has been undermined by the rule of politics’. Some years back a constitutional authority had depicted the Rule of Law as being under siege on account of ‘cancerous developments eating into the fabric’ of the three organs of the State – the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. 
 
These negative trends in internal security, therefore, require to be reversed through well directed actions in the political, socio-economic and security fields. The focus has to be on the Rule of Law, accountability of state action, and the principles to which the Indian state subscribes. This would require an adjustment in our approach to security management. 
 
Jai Hind.”

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Hamid Ansari has said that the inequality is the number one risk because it is associated with a rise in populism and threatens the cohesiveness of countries. He was delivering the inaugural address at the First Edition of the Huddle, A Three-day Conclave organised by The Hindu newspaper, here today. The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Vala and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 
 
The Vice President said that to enjoy the ‘freedom of,’ there is a requirement first for certain ‘freedom from’. To survive with dignity, humans require both ‘freedom from want’ and ‘freedom from fear’, he added.
 
The Vice President said that the improving living standards, in segments, have perhaps masked a dramatic concentration of income and wealth over the last 30 years. He further said that the richest 1% in India owned nearly 60% of the country’s total wealth, with the top 20% commanding 80%. The bottom half of Indians by contrast, collectively own only 2% of the national wealth, he added.
 
The Vice President said that rising inequality can lead to conflict, both at social and at national level and the growing threat of left extremism, which has been repeatedly acknowledged as the gravest security threat to Indian state, has its roots in economic deprivation and inequality in access to resources. He further said that the time has come to move the development discourse of inequality beyond the current discussion of outcomes and opportunities. The concepts of justice and fairness are tied to the idea of equity in development, he added.
 
The Vice President said that to view rising inequity as merely an inconvenient truth in the saga of India’s shining future would therefore be a folly and without equality, there is unlikely to be much of a future, let alone a shining one. In conclusion, the Vice President raised some uncomfortable questions about inequity, failure of trickle-down growth, environmental damage, conflicts, intolerance and improving investments in public goods. 
 
Following is the text of Vice President’s address:
 
“When I was first told about this conclave, an odd thought came to my mind. I wondered if the theme was a verb or a noun; the definite article however settled that.
I recall the tablet that was affixed to the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in the early years of the last century, and that reads:
Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuge of your teeming shore,
Send these, the homeless, tempest- tossed, to me:
I lift my lamp besides the golden door.
I do not propose to dilate on the context of these lines. I do nevertheless wish to draw the attention of this gathering to the second line: the quest for freedom by humankind, and to the response patterns we have witnessed in our times.
Freedom, in the dictionary meaning of the term, signifies ‘the power to act, speak and think freely’. It implies unhampered liberty to think freely, to question anything, to be able to speak frankly, to be free to explore boundaries. 
Yet freedom or liberty in itself would be quite meaningless. To enjoy these ‘freedom of,’ there is a requirement first for certain ‘freedom from’.
To survive with dignity, humans require both ‘freedom from want’ and ‘freedom from fear’. Human development is understood as the continuing expansion of human freedom and humans flourishing beyond these freedoms.
In our case, the Preamble of the Constitution specifies what ‘We the People of India’ set out to attain: Justice (social, economic and political); Liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship); and the Equality (of status and of opportunity), and Fraternity (to assure dignity of individual and unity of the nation).
Thus liberty or freedom is anchored between justice and equality; also Inter-spersed is a Hegelian construct on appreciation of necessity that circumscribes this freedom. Furthermore, while equality is the premise of citizenship, the latter by itself does not guarantee substantive equality.   
In advance of the world’s financial and economic elite going to Davos for their annual meeting, the World Economic Forum publishes its Global Risks Report. The 2017 edition highlights some risks facing the global system and places the issue of income inequality as the number one risk because it is associated with a rise in populism and threatens the cohesiveness of countries. It describes the present as ‘a febrile time for the world.’
Four earlier annual editions of the Report had similarly identified rising inequality among the top four global risks. It is therefore not surprising that reducing inequality is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
And still - in this age of ‘post-truths’ and ‘alternate facts’ - deceptive appearances can be made to prevail. 
The improving living standards, in segments, have perhaps masked a dramatic concentration of income and wealth over the last 30 years. A number of studies have come to the distressing conclusion that despite the increase in the number of people coming out of abject poverty, the majority of people on the planet today live in countries where economic disparities are bigger than they were a generation ago. Please consider the following:

    Including      capital gains, the share of national income going to the richest 1% has      doubled since 1980. Within it, the largest share going to the top 0.01% –      some 16,000 families- who now control almost 5% of the global wealth.
    If      we divide the whole income of the world into two halves, we find that the      richest 8% get half, while the other half would be distributed in the      remaining 92% of the population.
    In      almost all countries, the mean wealth of the wealthiest 10% is more than      10 times the median wealth. For the wealthiest 1%, mean wealth exceeds 100      times the median wealth in many countries and can approach 1000 times the      median in the most unequal nations.

In developing economies like India and China, despite the fact that incomes have risen for many, inequality, in both wealth and income have also risen significantly.  
The richest 1% in India owned nearly 60% of the country’s total wealth, with the top 20% commanding 80%. The bottom half of Indians by contrast, collectively own only 2% of the national wealth.
Nor is a reversal in sight. Rates may vary, but since the financial crisis of 2007, inequality has shown more increases than decreases in the world’s nations. Twentieth century history shows that this can be ominous. 
While the economists may continue to debate the extent and causes of inequality, there can be little doubt about its implications for the political, social and economic fabric of society. 
Some years earlier, Joseph Stiglitz had written about the price of inequality in the context of the United States. More recently, Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson have describe the “pernicious effects that inequality has on societies and provide evidence for a strong correlation between higher levels of national inequality and a wide range of health and social problems.  
More worryingly, rising inequality is seen as a contributing cause for the rise of authoritarian leaders, often with a divisive agenda fuelled by sectarianism, xenophobia and nationalism. 
Rising inequality can lead to conflict, both at social and at national level.  Research has shown that in contrast to oligarchic regimes; democracies avoid serious political turbulence only so long as they ensure that the relative level of inequality between the rich and the poor does not become excessively large. 
Other studies, similarly, indicate that social conflicts are indeed likely to break out in situations where there are large inequalities between different groups. Some studies have concluded that ethnic groups with incomes much lower than a country’s average per capita income are more likely to engage in civil war. 
New protest movements have broken out around the world, many arguably rooted in the burgeoning inequality. The Occupy Movement and the Arab Spring were both fuelled by growing public despair at the sharp inequalities and growing unemployment and the perceived inability of the existing governance structures to redress the situation. 
In India, the growing threat of left extremism, which has been repeatedly acknowledged as the gravest security threat to Indian state, has its roots in economic deprivation and inequality in access to resources. 
It has also been recognised that growing social inequality corrodes social cohesion and can destabilise states. Some recent research has found that the likelihood of a country remaining mired in poverty or achieving sustainable growth has a strong relation to the average life expectancy of the citizenry. There, it is argued, that a shorter average lifespan leaves less time to reap the returns on investment in human capital.
Inequality also breeds economic inefficiencies and limits productivity. Research by IMF has shown that income inequality slows growth, causes financial crisis and weakens demand. In a recent report, the Asian Development Bank has similarly argued that if emerging Asia’s income distribution had not worsened over the past 20 years, the region’s rapid growth would have lifted an additional 140 million people out of extreme poverty.
Perhaps the time has come to move the development discourse of inequality beyond the current discussion of outcomes and opportunities. A conceptual framework is provided by Amartya Sen and some others who see human capabilities as the capacity and freedom to choose and to act; and calls for the opportunities that give individuals the freedom to pursue a life of their own choosing to be equalised.
The concepts of justice and fairness are tied to the idea of equity in development.  Equity has an intrinsic value since some groups face consistently inferior opportunities – economic, social and political – than their fellow citizens. Specifically, it translates into the need for equal opportunity and avoidance extreme deprivation in outcomes. 
To view rising inequity as merely an inconvenient truth in the saga of India’s shining future would therefore be a folly. Without equality, there is unlikely to be much of a future, let alone a shining one. 
There is a need to revisit our commitment to investing in social goods. We have to move beyond seeing corporate social activity and government welfare schemes as merely minimum relief for the misery of the masses aimed mostly at neutralising the more aggressive antagonism of those who have lost income and wealth or those whose upward mobility seems permanently blocked. 
We need to ask ourselves some uncomfortable questions:

    Can      we ignore the great inequity as merely a by-product of progress? 
    Has      the trickle-down model of growth failed us? 
    Have      we paid too high a cost in terms of environmental damage for our material      progress? 
    Are      conflicts and human suffering the new normal? To what extent are they      induced by failed ventures in quest for unrealizable utopias?  
    Can      we just accept the growing insularity, intolerance and discrimination? 
    Have      we made sufficient investments in improving our human capital and public      goods, like education and health-care? 

Faced with growing global violence, poverty, and injustice, it may be difficult to retain hope for an equitable future. Yet, if the reality of global inequality inspires what Antonio Gramsci called “pessimism of the intellect,” work must nevertheless begin with what he termed “optimism of the will”—the undaunted commitment that drives radical change. 
I have raised questions. I hope this Huddle will bring forth some answers. 
Jai Hind.”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met a group of over 100 youth and children from Jammu and Kashmir. They are currently touring different parts of India as part of the initiative “Watan Ko Jaano.” 

The youth and children asked a number of questions to the Prime Minister on themes such as infrastructure development in Jammu and Kashmir, sports facilities in the State, education and employment opportunities, and the Prime Minister’s work routine. 

Interacting with them, the Prime Minister spoke of the efforts being made by the Union Government to improve connectivity and infrastructure in the State. He emphasized the importance of sports, and sportsman spirit among people. The Prime Minister said that working hard is never a cause for exhaustion, and completion of a task brings satisfaction, that is greater than any sense of exhaustion. 

The Minister of State in the PMO, Dr. Jitendra Singh, was present on the occasion.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Winter is on its way out. Vasant, the season of spring has just started to step into our lives. After the departure of PATJHAD, when old and withered leaves fall, new leaves begin to sprout on the trees. Flowers bloom. Gardens and orchards sport a verdant green. The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts. Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches. The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself. At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers. Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi. Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner. Amir Khusro has written: 
 

Phool rahi sarson sakal ban 
Ambwa phoote, Tesu phoole 
Koyal bole, daar daar,



that is, 

Behold the mustard blooming everywhere, all around Here the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossoms 
The nightingale can’t help but sing merrily on the branches. 

When nature is at her joyous best, when the season is enchanting, we human beings too enjoy this to the fullest. The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a person’s life. In an ambience of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to bid adieu to the last month of Phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of Chaitra. The Ritu of Vasant, that is, the season of spring is indeed the confluence of these two months. 

At the outset, I express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when I ask for them before ‘Mann Ki Baat’. On the NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post - I thank all of you for that. 

Shobha Jalan has written to me on the NarendraModiApp that many in the public are not aware of the achievements of ISRO. And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile. Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of India’s pride. Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves. 15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India. Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world. And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours. After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space. In a mega mission, ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites simultaneously into space. These satellites belonged to various countries such as America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and, of course, India. India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go. And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLV’s 38th successive successful launch. This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India. This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world; the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly. 

Brother & sisters, one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important. It is Cartosat 2D, which is India’s satellite and the pictures clicked through it will be of great help in mapping of resources and infrastructure, evaluating development and planning for urban development. Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard. Almost immediately after its launch, our satellite has sent back some pictures. It has commenced functioning. It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists. This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISRO’s success. On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO. Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another. One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team. 

Shobha Ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of India. It is about India having acquired a great capability. This important matter has not been discussed much, but it has drawn Shobha Ji’s attention. In the field of defence also, India has successfully test fired the Ballistic Interceptor Missile. During its trial, this missile, based on interceptor technology, destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success. This is a significant, cutting edge competency in the arena of security. And you will be happy to know that hardly four or five countries in the world possess this capability. India’s scientists have demonstrated this prowess. Its core strength lies in the fact that if, even from a distance of 2000 km, a missile is launched to attack India, our missile can pre-emptively destroy it in the space itself. 

When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy. Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development. And those gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that; they begin further questioning it, look around for newer queries, and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry. This incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions. They do not rest till they obtain an answer. If we try to take a bird’s eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination. A full-stop is impossible. Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process. This is what begets new Science, new technology. And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era. 

My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase. The country needs more and more scientists. Today’s scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations. 

Mahatma Gandhi used to say, “No Science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form. All Sciences develop and are built up through experience”. 

Revered Bapu had also remarked, “I have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth”. 

When Science is harnessed keeping in minds the needs of common folk, when ways and means to naturally use those principles for people’s requirements are devised, when appropriate mediums and technologies are deliberated upon, it paves the way for it to be considered the most valuable contribution for general humanity. Recently, during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, Niti Aayog and India’s Foreign Ministry had organized a unique competition. Socially useful innovations had been invited. These innovations were identified and showcased, and people were being informed about them, along with touching upon such issues as harnessing them for the use by the common people and their mass production and commercial utilization. I saw the volume of remarkable work done in that area. To give you an example, I came across an innovation for our poor fishermen brethren. It is a simple mobile App. But it is so powerful that when a fisherman goes to sea for fishing, this App is able to provide guidance for direction to locate the most productive fishing zones and also provide multifarious types of information such as the direction and speed of the wind, the height of waves and so on. This whole array of information is available on this mobile App which can be utilised by our fishermen brethren for moving to those areas with maximum fish presence in a very short time and thus earning their livelihood. 

There are times when a problem portrays the importance of Science for finding its solution. In 2005, there was a very heavy downpour in Mumbai, which resulted in flooding, and even high tides in the sea, leading to terrible hardships. Whenever a natural calamity strikes, it is the underprivileged, who are the first in bearing its brunt. In that situation, two persons worked in right earnest and developed a dwelling structure that saves the house and its occupants, mitigates the water-logging and can prevent water borne diseases also. There were a large number of such innovations. 

What I’m trying to infer is that in society, in the country, there are many who take on such roles. And our society is also increasingly turning out to be technology driven. Systems are getting technology driven. In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives. In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan. Gradually, people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency. Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge. The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets. I believe this to be a good portent. In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support. For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each. And through these two schemes, the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated; it has received a rousing welcome in the entire country. It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred & fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign. Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each. There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each. Be they farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives, students – all are enthusiastically participating and also getting benefits from it. When I wanted to know the analysis, as to whether it’s only the young people who come forward or there are elders persons too, I was heartened to learn that among the recipients, there were 15 year old young persons, as well as elderly people aged 65-70. 

Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees. But I feel I must share with you what he has written most prominently. He says that when he received this reward, it struck him that a poor old woman had lost all her belongings because of a fire that broke out in her house. He felt she had more a rightful claim on the reward he had got and gave away the thousand rupees to her. And he derived a lot of Santosh, that is, satisfaction through his deed. Santosh Ji, your name and your deed – both are sources of SANTOSH, satisfaction for all of us. You have done something that is exemplary and inspiring. 

A 22-year old cab driver brother Sabir from Delhi adopted the digital mode in his transactions after demonetisation and went on to win a prize of one lakh rupees under the ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ of the Government. Though he continues to be a driver, in a way, he has now become an ambassador for this scheme. He keeps imparting knowledge about digital usage to his passengers all the time. He is extremely enthusiastic and motivates others also to go digital. 

One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her. She has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold. 

I urge my countrymen, especially the youth of our country and those who have won prizes under ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ or ‘Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana’ to become ambassadors of these schemes on their own. Lead this movement. Take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money. To me, each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti-corruption cadre in the country. In a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity. You know that this scheme will complete its 100 days on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, a truly memorable day. There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April. There are still about 40-45 days left for that. Can you do one thing in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar? We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App. Also teach them about the procedure of making transactions through this App; teach this specially to small traders in your neighbourhood. Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App. For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb. We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands. Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities. 

My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our country’s economy. Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nation’s economic progress. I wish to share a very happy news with you today. Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries. The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains. All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records. There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi. More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year. This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers. Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself. I want to specially thank the farmers of the country. I also want to thank our farmers for keeping the poor in mind and adopting cultivation of various pulse crops also besides the traditional crops because pulses are the biggest source of protein for poor people. I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land. This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country. My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses. 

My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness. In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner. The government is continuously making efforts in this regard. Recently, an event was organised in Telengana under the leadership of the Secretary of our Ministry of Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated. And, this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar, but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at Warangal in Telangana. Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February. Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used. They also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all. And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning. And, this exercise showed results, media in the country gave it wide publicity and highlighted its importance. And it is quite natural also because when people see an IAS officer cleaning a toilet pit himself, the fact is naturally noticed by the country. And we consider the waste taken out from a toilet pit as sheer useless garbage but if considered from the angle of its use as a fertiliser, this, in a way, is black gold. We can clearly see the conversion of waste to wealth. This has been proved too. For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years. After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit. This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time. This decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as ‘NPK’ which is a very useful fertilizer. Our farmers know ‘NPK’ very well. It contains nutritious elements Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium in abundance and is considered a fertiliser of very good quality in the agriculture sector. 

Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government. Now Doordarshan is broadcasting a special programme of ‘Swachchhta Samachar’, that is ‘Cleanliness News’. Highlighting such things in this programme will be very beneficial. Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight. During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign. And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March. 

We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost. We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics. India defeated Pakistan in the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held earlier this month to become World Champions for the second consecutive time and thus raised our national prestige to a new height. I once again congratulate all players of our team. The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement. I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve. We get to learn something each moment from them. 

Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none. They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements. Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently. My heartiest congratulations to all these players. 

The whole world celebrates 8th March as Women’s Day. In India also more importance needs to be given to our daughters along with increased awareness and sensitivity towards them. ‘Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao’ movement is moving forward with rapid strides. This is no longer just a government programme. It has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education. During the last two years this programme involved the common man; it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue; and brought about a change in people’s thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years. It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter. In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance. I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign. About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far. The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under ‘Sukanya Samridhi Yojana’. In Kathua district in Jammu & Kashmir, all departments have been connected with ‘Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao Yojana’ under the Convergence Model and in addition to the convening of Gram-Sabhas, all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education. In Madhya Pradesh, under the “Har Ghar Dastak” programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters. In Rajasthan ‘Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya’ campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again. I mean to say that ‘Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao’ movement has also developed in many shapes and forms. This entire movement has become a people’s movement. New imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it. This movement has been moulded as per local requirements. This, I believe, is a healthy sign. As we get ready to celebrate ‘Women’s Day’ this 8th March, there is only one sentiment: - 
 

With Strength, with Vitality, the Indian woman comes to the fore 
Rightfully deserves equality - neither less, nor more.



My dear countrymen, all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in ‘Mann Ki Baat’. You also connect actively with this programme. I get to know so many things from you. I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor. I am very grateful to you for your contribution. Thank you very much.

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार। सर्दी का मौसम अब जाने को है, वसन्त के मौसम ने हम सबके जीवन में दस्तक दे दी है; पतझड़ के बाद पेड़ों में नये पत्ते आने लगते हैं; फूल खिलते हैं; बाग़-बगीचे हरे-भरे हो जाते हैं पक्षियों का कलरव मन को भाने लगता है; फूल ही नहीं, फल भी पेड़ की शाखाओं पर खिली धूप में चमकते नज़र आते हैं। ग्रीष्म ऋतु के फल आम के मंजर वसन्त में ही दिखने लग जाते हैं, वहीं खेतों में सरसों के पीले फूल किसानों को उम्मीदें बंधाते हैं। टेसू या पलाश के सुर्ख फूल होली के आने का संकेत करते हैं। अमीर ख़ुसरो ने मौसम के इस बदलाव के पलों का बड़ा मज़ेदार वर्णन किया है, अमीर ख़ुसरो ने लिखा है:- 
 

“फूल रही सरसों सकल बन, 
अम्बवा फूटे, टेसू फूले, 
कोयल बोले, डार-डार”



जब प्रकृति ख़ुशनुमा होती है, मौसम सुहावना होता है; तो इंसान भी इस मौसम का पूरा लुत्फ़ उठाता है। वसन्त पंचमी, महाशिवरात्रि और होली का त्योहार इंसान के जीवन में ख़ुशियों के रंग डालता है। प्रेम, भाईचारा, मानवता से ओत-प्रोत वातावरण में हम आख़िरी महीने फाल्गुन को विदा करने वाले हैं और नये मास चैत्र का स्वागत करने को तैयार बैठे हैं, वसन्त ऋतु इन्हीं दो महीनों का तो संयोग है। 

मैं सबसे पहले तो देश के लाखों नागरिकों का इस बात से आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ कि ‘मन की बात’ के पहले, जब मैं सुझाव माँगता हूँ, ढ़ेर सारे सुझाव आते हैं। NarendraModiApp पर, Twitter पर, Facebook पर, डाक से, मैं इसके लिये सबका आभारी हूँ। 

मुझे शोभा जालान, उन्होंने NarendraModiApp पर लिखा है कि बहुत सारी Public ISRO की उपलब्धियों के बारे में aware नहीं है। और इसलिये उन्होंने कहा है कि मैं 104 Satellites के launch और interceptor missile के बारे में कुछ जानकारी दूँ! शोभा जी, आपका बहुत-बहुत आभार कि भारत के गर्व की मिसाल को आपने याद किया। चाहे ग़रीबी से निपटना हो, बीमारियों से बचना हो, दुनिया से जुड़ना हो, ज्ञान, जानकारियाँ पहुँचाना हो - technology ने, विज्ञान ने, अपनी जगह दर्ज़ करा दी है। 15 फ़रवरी, 2017 भारत के जीवन में गौरवपूर्ण दिवस है। हमारे वैज्ञानिकों ने विश्व के सामने भारत का सर गर्व से ऊँचा किया है। और हम सब जानते हैं कि ISRO ने कुछ वर्षों में कई अभूतपूर्व mission सफलतापूर्वक पूर्ण किए हैं। मंगल ग्रह पर ‘Mars Mission’ ‘मंगलयान’ भेजने की कामयाबी के बाद, अभी पिछले दिनों ISRO ने अन्तरिक्ष के क्षेत्र में, एक विश्व रिकॉर्ड बनाया। ISRO ने mega mission के ज़रिये एक साथ विभिन्न देशों, जिसमें अमेरिका, इज़राइल, कज़ाकस्तान, नीदरलैंड, स्विट्ज़रलैंड, यू.ए.ई. और भारत भी, 104 satellites अन्तरिक्ष में सफलतापूर्वक launch किए हैं। एक-साथ 104 satellites को अन्तरिक्ष में भेजकर इतिहास रचने वाला भारत दुनिया का पहला देश बन गया। और ये भी खुशी की बात है कि यह लगातार 38वाँ PSLV का सफल launch है। यह न केवल ISRO के लिये, बल्कि पूरे भारत के लिये एक ऐतिहासिक उपलब्धि है। ISRO का यह cost effective efficient space programme सारी दुनिया के लिये एक अजूबा बन गया है और विश्व ने खुले मन से भारत के वैज्ञानिकों की सफलता को सराहा है। 

भाइयो-बहनो, इन 104 Satellite में एक बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण है - Cartosat 2D - ये भारत का Satellite है और इसके माध्यम से खींची हुई तस्वीरों, संसाधनों की mapping, infrastructure, विकास का आकलन, urban development के planning के लिये उसकी बहुत मदद मिलेगी। ख़ास करके मेरे किसान भाई-बहनों को देश में जो सभी जल स्रोत है, वो कितना है, उसका उपयोग कैसे हो सकता है, क्या-क्या ध्यान रखना चाहिए, इन सारे विषयों पर ये हमारा नया satellite Cartosat 2D बहुत मदद करेगा। हमारे Satellite ने जाते ही कुछ तस्वीरें भेजी हैं। उसने अपना काम शुरू कर दिया है। हमारे लिये ये भी ख़ुशी की बात है कि इस सारे अभियान का नेतृत्व, हमारे युवा वैज्ञानिक, हमारी महिला वैज्ञानिक, उन्होंने किया है। युवाओं और महिलाओं की इतनी ज़बरदस्त भागीदारी ISRO की सफलता में एक बड़ा गौरवपूर्ण पहलू है। मैं देशवासियों की तरफ़ से ISRO के वैज्ञानिकों को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ। आम जनता के लिये, राष्ट्र की सेवा के लिये, अन्तरिक्ष विज्ञान को लाने के अपने objective को, वे सदैव बनाये रखा है और नित नये-नये कीर्तिमान भी वो रचते जा रहे हैं। हमारे इन वैज्ञानिकों को, उनकी पूरी टीम को, हम जितनी बधाइयाँ दें उतनी कम हैं। 

शोभा जी ने एक और भी सवाल पूछा है और वो है भारत की सुरक्षा के संबंध में। भारत ने एक बहुत बड़ी सिद्धि प्राप्त की है, उसके विषय में। इस बात की ज़्यादा अभी चर्चा नहीं हुई है, लेकिन शोभा जी का ध्यान गया है इस महत्वपूर्ण बात पर। भारत ने रक्षा के क्षेत्र में भी Ballistic Interceptor Missile का सफल परीक्षण किया है। Interception technology वाले इस missile ने अपने trial के दौरान ज़मीन से क़रीब-क़रीब 100 किलोमीटर की ऊँचाई पर दुश्मन की missile को ढेर करके सफलता अंकित कर दी। सुरक्षा के क्षेत्र में ये बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण सिद्धि है; और आपको जान करके ख़ुशी होगी, दुनिया के मुश्किल से चार या पाँच ही देश हैं कि जिन्हें ये महारत हासिल है। भारत के वैज्ञानिकों ने ये करके दिखाया, और इसकी ताक़त ये है कि अगर 2000 किलोमीटर दूर से भी, भारत पर आक्रमण के लिये कोई missile आती है, तो ये missile अन्तरिक्ष में ही उसको नष्ट कर देती है। 

जब नई technology देखते हैं, कोई नई वैज्ञानिक सिद्धि होती है, तो हम लोगों को आनंद होता है। और मानव जीवन की विकास यात्रा में जिज्ञासा ने बहुत अहम भूमिका निभाई है, और जो विशिष्ट बुद्धि प्रतिभा रखते हैं, वो जिज्ञासा को जिज्ञासा के रूप में ही रहने नहीं देते; वे उसके भीतर भी सवाल खड़े करते हैं; नई जिज्ञासायें खोजते हैं, नई जिज्ञासायें पैदा करते हैं और वही जिज्ञासा, नई खोज का कारण बन जाती है। वे तब तक चैन से बैठते नहीं, जब तक उसका उत्तर न मिले। और हज़ारों साल की मानव जीवन की विकास यात्रा का अगर हम अवलोकन करें, तो हम कह सकते हैं कि मानव जीवन की इस विकास यात्रा का कहीं पूर्ण-विराम नहीं है। पूर्ण-विराम असंभव है, ब्रह्मांड को, सृष्टि के नियमों को, मानव के मन को जानने का प्रयास निरंतर चलता रहता है। नया विज्ञान, नयी technology उसी में से पैदा होती है और हर technology, हर नया विज्ञान का रूप, एक नये युग को जन्म देता है। 

मेरे प्यारे नौजवानो, जब हम विज्ञान और वैज्ञानिकों के कठिन परिश्रम की बात करते हैं, तो कई बार मैंने ‘मन की बात’ में इस बात को कहा है कि हमारी युवा-पीढ़ी का विज्ञान के प्रति आकर्षण बढ़ना चाहिए। देश को बहुत सारे वैज्ञानिकों की ज़रूरत है। आज का वैज्ञानिक आने वाले युगों में आने वाली पीढ़ियों के जीवन में एक स्थायी बदलाव का कारण बनता है। 

महात्मा गाँधी कहा करते थे – “No science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form. All sciences develop and are built up through experience.” 

पूज्य बापू ने ये भी कहा था – “I have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth.” 

विज्ञान जब जन-सामान्य की आवश्यकताओं को ध्यान में रख करके उन सिद्धांतों का सहज उपयोग कैसे हो; उसके लिए माध्यम क्या हो; technology कौन सी हो; क्योंकि सामान्य मानव के लिये तो वही सबसे बड़ा महत्वपूर्ण योगदान माना जाता है। पिछले दिनों, नीति आयोग एवं भारत के विदेश मंत्रालय ने 14वें प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस के समय एक बड़ी unique प्रकार की competition की योजना की थी। समाज उपयोगी innovation को invite किया गया। ऐसे innovations को identify करना, showcase करना, लोगों को जानकारी देना और ऐसे innovation जन-सामान्य के लिये कैसे काम आएं, mass production कैसे हो, उसकी commercial utilization कैसे हो, और मैंने जब उसे देखा, तो मैंने देखा कि कितने बड़े महत्वपूर्ण काम किए हैं। जैसे अभी एक innovation मैंने देखा, जो हमारे ग़रीब मछुआरे भाइयों के लिये बनाया गया है। एक सामान्य Mobile App बनाई है, लेकिन उसकी ताक़त इतनी है कि मछुआरा fishing के लिये जब जाता है, तो कहाँ जाना; सबसे ज्यादा fish zone अच्छा कहाँ पर है; हवा की दिशा क्या है; speed क्या है; लहरों की ऊँचाई कितनी है - यानि एक Mobile App पर सारी जानकारियाँ उपलब्ध और इससे हमारे मछुआरे भाई बहुत ही कम समय में जहाँ अधिक मछलियाँ हैं, वहाँ पहुँच करके अपना अर्थ-उपार्जन कर सकते हैं। 

कभी-कभी समस्या भी समाधान के लिये विज्ञान की महत्ता को प्रदर्शित करती है मुंबई के अन्दर 2005 में बहुत बारिश हुई, flood आया, समंदर में भी भरती आ गई और बहुत परेशानियाँ हुईं। और जब कोई भी प्राकृतिक संकट आता है, तो सबसे पहले संकट ग़रीब को आता है। दो लोगों ने बड़े मन से इसमें काम किया और उन्होंने एक ऐसे मकान की रचना को विकसित किया, जो ऐसे संकट से घर को बचाता है, घर में रहने वालों को बचाता है, जल भराव से भी बचाता है, water borne disease से भी बचा सकता है। ख़ैर, बहुत सारे innovations थे। 

कहने का तात्पर्य ये है कि समाज में, देश में इस प्रकार की भूमिका के लोग बहुत होते हैं। और हमारा समाज भी तो technology driven होता जा रहा है; व्यवस्थायें technology driven होती जा रही हैं। एक प्रकार से technology हमारे जीवन का अभिन्न अंग बन रही है। पिछले दिनों ‘डिजि-धन’ पर बड़ा बल दिखाई दे रहा है। धीरे-धीरे लोग नकद से निकल करके digital currency की तरफ़ आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। भारत में भी digital transaction बहुत तेज़ी से बढ़ रहा है। ख़ास कर के युवा पीढ़ी अपने mobile phone से ही digital payment की आदी बनती जा रही है, ये शुभ संकेत मानता हूँ मैं। 

हमारे देश में पिछले दिनों ‘लकी ग्राहक योजना’, ‘डिजि-धन व्यापारी योजना’ उसको भारी समर्थन मिला है। क़रीब-क़रीब दो महीने हो गये हैं, प्रतिदिन 15 हज़ार लोगों को एक हज़ार रुपये का इनाम मिलता है। और इन दोनों स्कीमों के ज़रिये भारत में digital भुगतान को एक जन-आन्दोलन बनाने की एक पहल - पूरे देश में इसका स्वागत हुआ है। और ये ख़ुशी की बात है कि अब तक ‘डिजि-धन योजना’ के तहत दस लाख लोगों को तो इनाम मिल चुका है, पचास हज़ार से ज़्यादा व्यापारियों को इनाम मिल चुका है और क़रीब-क़रीब डेढ़ सौ करोड़ से भी ज्यादा रकम इस इनाम में, इस महान अभियान को आगे बढ़ाने वाले लोगों को मिली हैI इस योजना के तहत सौ से ज़्यादा ग्राहक ये हैं, जिनको एक-एक लाख रुपये का इनाम मिला है; चार हज़ार से ज़्यादा व्यापारी वो हैं, जिनको पचास-पचास हज़ार रुपये के इनाम मिले हैंI किसान हों, व्यापारी हों, छोटे उद्यमी हों, पेशेवर हों, घरेलू महिलायें हों, विद्यार्थी हों, हर कोई इसमें बढ़-चढ़ करके हिस्सा ले रहा है; उनको लाभ भी मिल रहा हैI जब मैंने उसका analysis पूछा कि भई, देखिये सिर्फ नौजवान ही आते हैं कि बड़ी आयु के लोग भी आते हैं, तो मुझे ख़ुशी हुई कि इनाम प्राप्त करने वालों में 15 साल के युवा भी हैं, तो पैंसठ-सत्तर साल के बुज़ुर्ग भी हैंI 

मैसूर से श्रीमान संतोष जी ने हर्ष जताते हुए NarendraModiApp पर लिखा है कि उन्हें ‘लकी ग्राहक योजना’ के तहत एक हज़ार रुपये का reward मिलाI लेकिन सबसे बड़ी बात जो उन्होंने लिखी है, जो मुझे लगता है कि मुझे share करना चाहिए; उन्होंने कहा कि मुझे एक हज़ार रुपये का ये reward मिला और उसी समय मेरे ध्यान में आया कि एक ग़रीब वृद्ध महिला के घर में आग लग गई थी, सामान जल गया था; तो मुझे लगा कि जो मुझे इनाम मिला है, शायद इसका हक़ इस ग़रीब वृद्ध माँ का है; तो मैंने हज़ार रुपये उसी को दे दिएI मुझे इतना संतोष मिलाI संतोष जी, आपका नाम और आपका काम हम सबको संतोष दे रहा हैI आपने एक बहुत बड़ा प्रेरक काम कियाI 

दिल्ली के 22 वर्षीय कार चालक भाई सबीर, अब वो अपने कामकाज में नोटबंदी के बाद digital कारोबार से जुड़ गए और सरकार की जो ‘लकी ग्राहक योजना’ थी, उसमें वो एक लाख रुपये का इनाम मिल गया। अब आज वो कार चलाते हैं, लेकिन एक प्रकार से इस योजना के ambassador बन गये हैं। सभी पैसेंजरों को पूरा समय ये digital का ज्ञान देते रहते हैं। इतने उत्साह से बातों को बताते रहते हैं, औरों को भी प्रोत्साहित करते हैं। 

महाराष्ट्र से एक युवा साथी पूजा नेमाड़े, जो P.G. की छात्रा हैं, उन्होंने भी RuPay Card, e-wallet का उपयोग अपने परिवार में कैसे हो रहा है और इसको करने में कितना आनंद आ रहा है, इसका अपना अनुभव अपने साथियों को share करती रहती हैं। और एक लाख रुपये का इनाम उसके लिये कितना मायने रखता है, लेकिन उसने इसे एक अपने mission mode में ले लिया है और वो भी औरों को इस काम के लिये लगा रही हैं। मैं देशवासियों से, देश के युवकों से ख़ासकर करके और इस ‘लकी ग्राहक योजना’ या तो ‘डिजि-धन व्यापार योजना’ - उन्हें जो इनाम मिला है, उनसे मैं आग्रह करूँगा कि आप स्वयं इसके ambassador बनिए। इस आंदोलन का आप नेतृत्व कीजिए। आप इसको आगे बढ़ाइए और ये काम एक प्रकार से भ्रष्टाचार और काले धन के खिलाफ़ जो लड़ाई है, इसमें बहुत बड़ी अहम भूमिका है इसकी। इस काम में जुड़े हुए हर कोई मेरी दृष्टि से, देश में एक नई anti-corruption cadre हैं। एक प्रकार से आप शुचिता के सैनिक हैं। आप जानते हैं कि ‘लकी ग्राहक योजना’ - सौ दिन जब पूरे होंगे, 14 अप्रैल डॉ. बाबा साहेब अम्बेडकर की जन्म-जयंती का पर्व है; यादगार दिवस है। 14 अप्रैल को एक बहुत बड़ा करोड़ों रुपयों के prize का draw होने वाला है; अभी क़रीब चालीस-पैंतालीस दिन बचे हैं। बाबा साहेब अम्बेडकर को याद रखते हुए क्या आप एक काम कर सकते हैं? अभी-अभी बाबा साहेब अम्बेडकर की 125वीं जयंती गई है। उनका स्मरण करते हुए आप भी कम-से-कम 125 लोगों को BHIM App download करने का सिखाएँ, उससे लेन-देन कैसे होती है, वो सिखाएँ और ख़ास करके अपने आस-पास के छोटे-छोटे व्यापारियों को सिखाएँ। इस बार की बाबा साहेब अम्बेडकर की जयंती और BHIM App, इसको विशेष महत्व दें और इसलिये मैं कहना चाहूँगा, डॉ. बाबा साहेब ने रखी नींव को हमें मज़बूत बनाना है; घर-घर जाकर सबको जोड़ कर 125 करोड़ हाथों तक BHIM App पहुँचाना है। पिछले दो-तीन महीने से, ये जो movement चला है, उसका असर ये है कि कई township, कई गाँव, कई शहरों में बहुत ही सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, हमारे देश की अर्थव्यवस्था के मूल में कृषि का बहुत बड़ा योगदान है। गाँव की आर्थिक ताक़त, देश की आर्थिक गति को ताक़त देती है। मैं आज एक बहुत ख़ुशी की बात आपको कहना चाहता हूँ। हमारे किसान भाइयों-बहनों ने कड़ी मेहनत करके अन्न के भंडार भर दिए हैं। हमारे देश में किसानों के परिश्रम से इस वर्ष record अन्न उत्पादन हुआ है। सारे संकेत यही कह रहे हैं कि हमारे किसानों ने पुराने सारे record तोड़ दिये है। खेतों में इस बार फ़सल ऐसी लहराई है, हर रोज़ लगने लगा, जैसे पोंगल और बैसाखी आज ही मनाई है। इस वर्ष देश में लगभग दो हज़ार सात सौ लाख टन से भी ज्यादा खाद्यान्न का उत्पादन हुआ है। हमारे किसानों के नाम जो आख़िरी record अंकित हुआ था, उससे भी ये 8% ज़्यादा है, तो ये अपने-आप में अभूतपूर्व सिद्धि है। मैं विशेष रूप से देश के किसानों का धन्यवाद करना चाहता हूँ। किसानों का धन्यवाद इसलिये भी करना चाहता हूँ कि वे परंपरागत फ़सलों के साथ-साथ देश के ग़रीब को ध्यान में रखते हुए अलग-अलग दालों की भी खेती करें, क्योंकि दाल से ही सबसे ज़्यादा प्रोटीन ग़रीब को प्राप्त होता है। मुझे ख़ुशी है कि मेरे देश के किसानों ने ग़रीबों की आवाज़ सुनी और क़रीब-क़रीब दो सौ नब्बे लाख हेक्टेयर धरती पर भिन्न-भिन्न दालों की खेती की। ये सिर्फ दाल का उत्पादन नहीं है, किसानों के द्वारा हुई मेरे देश के ग़रीबों की सबसे बड़ी सेवा है। मेरी एक प्रार्थना को, मेरी एक विनती को, मेरे देश के किसानों ने जिस प्रकार से सिर-आँखों पर बिठा करके मेहनत की और दालों का record उत्पादन किया, इसके लिये मेरे किसान भाई-बहन विशेष धन्यवाद के अधिकारी हैं। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, ये हमारे देश में, सरकार के द्वारा, समाज के द्वारा, संस्थाओं के द्वारा, संगठनों के द्वारा, हर किसी के द्वारा, स्वच्छता की इस दिशा में कुछ-न-कुछ चलता ही रहता है। एक प्रकार से हर कोई किसी-न-किसी रूप में स्वच्छता के संबंध में जागरूक व्यवहार करता नज़र आ रहा है। सरकार निरंतर प्रयास कर रही है। पिछले दिनों Water and Sanitation का जो हमारा भारत सरकार का मंत्रालय है ‘पेयजल एवं स्वच्छता मंत्रालय’। हमारे सचिव के नेतृत्व में 23 राज्य सरकारों के वरिष्ठ अधिकारियों का एक कार्यक्रम तेलंगाना में हुआ और तेलंगाना राज्य के वारंगल में सिर्फ बंद कमरे में seminar नहीं। प्रत्यक्ष स्वच्छता के काम का महत्व क्या है, उसको प्रयोग करके करना। 17-18 फ़रवरी को हैदराबाद में toilet pit emptying exercise का आयोजन किया। छह घर के toilet pits ख़ाली करके उसकी सफ़ाई की गई और अधिकारियों ने स्वयं ने दिखाया कि twin pit toilet के उपयोग हो चुके गड्ढों को, उसे ख़ाली कर पुनः प्रयोग में लाया जा सकता है। उन्होंने यह भी दिखाया कि यह नई technique के शौचालय कितने सुविधाजनक हैं और इन्हें ख़ाली करने में सफ़ाई को लेकर के कोई असुविधा महसूस नही होती है, कोई संकोच नही होता है; जो psychological barrier होता है, वो भी आड़े नही आता है और हम भी और सामान्य सफ़ाई करते हैं, वैसे ही एक toilet के गड्ढे साफ़ कर सकते हैं; और इस प्रयास का परिणाम हुआ, देश के media ने इसको बहुत प्रचारित भी किया, उसको महत्व भी दिया। और स्वाभाविक है, जब एक IAS अफ़सर खुद toilet के गड्ढे की सफ़ाई करता हो, तो देश का ध्यान जाना बहुत स्वाभाविक है। और ये जो toilet pit की सफ़ाई है और उसमें से जो जिसे आप-हम कूड़ा-कचरा मानते हैं, लेकिन खाद की दृष्टि से देखें, तो ये एक प्रकार से ये काला सोना होता है। Waste से wealth क्या होती है, ये हम देख सकते हैं, और ये सिद्ध हो चुका है। छह सदस्यीय परिवार के लिये एक standard ‘Twin Pit Toilet’ - ये model लगभग पाँच वर्ष में भर जाता है। इसके बाद कचरे को आसानी से दूर कर, दूसरे pit में redirect किया जा सकता है। छह-बारह महीनों में pit में जमा कचरा पूरी तरह से decompose हो जाता है। यह decomposed कचरा handle करने में बहुत ही सुरक्षित होता है और खाद की दृष्टि से अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण खाद ‘NPK’. किसान भली-भाँति ‘NPK’ से परिचित हैं, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - ये पोषक तत्वों से पूर्ण होता है; और यह कृषि क्षेत्र में बहुत ही उत्तम खाद माना जाता है। 

जिस प्रकार से सरकार ने ये initiative लिया है, औरो ने भी बहुत initiative ऐसे प्रयोग किए होंगे। और अब तो दूरदर्शन में स्वच्छता समाचार का एक विशेष कार्यक्रम आता है, उसमें ऐसी बातें जितनी उजागर होंगी, उतना लाभ होगा। सरकार में भी अलग-अलग department स्वच्छता पखवाड़ा regular मनाते हैं। मार्च महीने के प्रथम पखवाड़े में महिला और बाल विकास मंत्रालय, उनके साथ जनजाति विकास मंत्रालय - Tribal Affairs Ministry - ये स्वच्छता अभियान को बल देने वाले हैं, और मार्च के दूसरे पखवाड़े में और दो मंत्रालय - Ministry of Shipping पोत परिवहन मंत्रालय और Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - ये मंत्रालय भी मार्च के आख़िरी दो सप्ताह स्वच्छता अभियान को आगे बढ़ाने वाले हैं। 

हम जानते हैं कि हमारे देश का कोई भी नागरिक जब भी कुछ अच्छा करता है, तो पूरा देश एक नई ऊर्जा का अनुभव करता है, आत्मविश्वास को बढ़ाता है। Rio Paralympics में हमारे दिव्यांग खिलाड़ियों ने जो प्रदर्शन किया, हम सबने उसका स्वागत किया था। इसी महीने आयोजित Blind T-20 World Cup के final में भारत ने पाकिस्तान को हराते हुए लगातार दूसरी बार world champion बन करके देश का गौरव बढ़ाया। मैं एक बार फिर से टीम के सभी खिलाड़ियों को बधाई देता हूँ। देश को हमारे इन दिव्यांग साथियों की उपलब्धि पर गर्व है। मैं ये हमेशा मानता हूँ कि दिव्यांग भाई-बहन सामर्थ्यवान होते हैं, दृढ़-निश्चयी होते हैं, साहसिक होते हैं, संकल्पवान होते हैं। हर पल हमें उनसे कुछ-न-कुछ सीखने को मिल सकता है। 

बात चाहे खेल की हो या अंतरिक्ष-विज्ञान की - हमारे देश की महिलायें किसी से पीछे नहीं हैं। क़दम से क़दम मिला करके आगे बढ़ रही हैं और अपनी उपलब्धियों से देश का नाम रोशन कर रही हैं। पिछले कुछ दिनों में एशियाई Rugby Sevens Trophy हमारी महिला खिलाड़ियों ने silver medal जीता, उन सभी खिलाड़ियों को मेरी ढेर सारी बधाइयाँ। 

8 मार्च पूरा विश्व महिला दिवस मनाता है। भारत में भी बेटियों को महत्व देने, परिवार और समाज में उनके प्रति जागरूकता बढ़े, संवेदनशीलता बढ़े। ‘बेटी बचाओ-बेटी पढ़ाओ’ ये आन्दोलन तेज़ गति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। आज ये सिर्फ़ सरकारी कार्यक्रम नहीं रहा है। ये एक सामाजिक संवेदना का, लोकशिक्षा का अभियान बन गया है। विगत दो वर्षों के दौरान इस कार्यक्रम ने आम जनमानस को जोड़ लिया है, देश के प्रत्येक कोने में इस ज्वलंत मुद्दे पर लोगों को सोचने पर मजबूर किया है और बरसों से चले आ रहे पुराने रीति-रिवाज़ों के प्रति लोगों की सोच में बदलाव लाया है। जब ये समाचार मिलते हैं कि बेटी के जन्म पर उत्सव मनाया गया, इतना आनंद आता है। एक प्रकार से बेटियों के प्रति सकारात्मक सोच सामाजिक स्वीकृति का कारण बन रही है। मैंने सुना है कि तमिलनाडु राज्य के Cuddalore ज़िले ने एक विशेष अभियान के तहत बाल-विवाह पर रोक लगाई। अब तक क़रीब 175 से ज़्यादा बाल-विवाह रोके जा चुके हैं। ज़िला प्रशासन ने ‘सुकन्या समृद्धि योजना’ के अंतर्गत क़रीब-क़रीब 55-60 हज़ार से ज्यादा बेटियों के बैंक अकाउंट खोले हैं। जम्मू-कश्मीर के कठुआ ज़िले में convergence model के तहत समस्त विभागों को ‘बेटी बचाओ-बेटी पढ़ाओ योजना’ में जोड़ा है और ग्राम-सभाओं के आयोजन के साथ-साथ ज़िला प्रशासन द्वारा अनाथ बच्चियों को गोद लेना, उनकी शिक्षा सुनिश्चित करना, इसके भरपूर प्रयास हो रहे हैं। मध्य प्रदेश में ‘हर घर दस्तक’ के कार्यक्रम अंतर्गत गाँव-गाँव घर-घर बेटियों की शिक्षा के लिये एक अभियान चलाया जा रहा है। राजस्थान ने ‘अपना बच्चा, अपना विद्यालय’ अभियान चला करके जिन बालिकाओं का drop-out हुआ था, उनको पुनः स्कूल में भर्ती कराना, फिर से पढ़ने के लिये प्रेरित करने का अभियान चलाया है। कहने का तात्पर्य ये है कि ‘बेटी बचाओ-बेटी पढ़ाओ’ इस आंदोलन ने भी अनेक रूप धारण किए हैं। पूरा आंदोलन जन-आंदोलन बना है। नई-नई कल्पनायें उसके साथ जुड़ी हैं। स्थानीय आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार उसको मोड़ा गया है। मैं इसे एक अच्छी निशानी मानता हूँ। जब हम 8 मार्च को ‘महिला दिवस’ मनाने वाले हैं, तब हमारा एक ही भाव है: -
 

“महिला, वो शक्ति है, सशक्त है, वो भारत की नारी है, 
न ज़्यादा में, न कम में, वो सब में बराबर की अधिकारी है”



मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आप सब को ‘मन की बात’ में समय-समय पर कुछ-न-कुछ संवाद करने का अवसर मिलता है। आप भी सक्रियता के साथ जुड़ते रहते हैं। आप से मुझे बहुत-कुछ जानने को मिलता है। धरती पर क्या चल रहा है, गाँव, ग़रीब के मन में क्या चल रहा है, वो मुझ तक पहुँचता है। आपके योगदान के लिये मैं आपका बहुत आभारी हूँ। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।

My loving greetings to all.
 
It is my honour to be here, in this august gathering.
 
That too, on the auspicious occasion of Maha-Shivratri.
 
There are many festivals, but this one is pre-fixed with ""Maha.""
 
Indeed, there are many Devs, but only one Maha-Dev.
 
There are many Mantras, but the Mantra which is identified with Lord Shiva, is called Maha-Mrityunjayi Mantra.
 
Such is the glory of Lord Shiva.
 
Maha-Shivratri symbolizes a union of divinity with a purpose, of overcoming darkness and injustice.
 
It inspires us to be courageous and fight for good.
 
It marks the shift of seasons, from the cold to the lively spring and brightness.
 
Maha-Shivratri celebrations go on for the entire night. This symbolizes a spirit of vigilance- that we have to protect nature and mould our activities in sync with our ecological surroundings.
 
My home state, Gujarat is the land of Somnath. The call of the people and the longing for service took me to Kashi, the land of Vishwanath.
 
From Somnath to Vishwanath, from Kedarnath to Rameshwaram and from Kashi to Coimbatore where we have gathered, Lord Shiva is everywhere.
 
Like crores of Indians across the length and breadth of the nation, I too feel delighted to be a part of celebrations of Maha-Shivratri.
 
And we are merely drops in the ocean.
 
Through centuries, there have lived countless devotees, in every age and time.
 
They came from different places.
 
Their language may have been different but their longing for the divine is always the same.
 
This longing throbs in the core of every human heart. Their poetry, their music, their love has soaked the very earth.
 
Standing here before this 112-feet face of Adiyogi and the Yogeshwar Linga, we are experiencing a colossal presence enveloping everyone in this space.
In the times to come, the place where we have gathered is going to be a source of inspiration for all, a place to immerse one’s self and discover truth.
ये स्‍थान सबको शिवमय होने के लिए प्रेरित करता रहेगा। It will remind us of the inclusive spirit of Lord Shiva.
Today, Yoga has come a long way.
 
There are various definitions, types, schools of Yoga and ways to practice Yoga that have emerged.
 
This is the beauty of Yoga- it is ancient, yet modern, it is constant, yet evolving.
 
The essence of Yoga has not changed. 
 
And I say this because it is of utmost importance to preserve this essence.
 
Otherwise, we may just have to discover a new Yoga to re-discover the soul and essence of Yoga.
 
Yoga is the catalytic agent, ushering the transformation from Jiva to Shiva.
 
हमारे यहां कहा गया है – यत्र जीव: तत्र शिव:
जीव से शिव की यात्रा, यही तो योग है।
 
By practicing Yoga, a spirit of oneness is created – oneness of the mind, body and the intellect.
 
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
 
Yoga is the journey from ‘me’ to ‘we.’
व्‍यक्ति से समस्‍ती तक ये यात्रा है। मैं से हम तक की यह अनुभूति, अहम से वयम तक का यह भाव-विस्‍तार, यही तो योग है।
 
India is a land of unparalleled diversity. India’s diversity can be seen, heard, felt, touched and tasted.
 
The diversity has been India’s greatest strength and has also brought India together.
 
Think of Lord Shiva and the picture that comes to mind is that of his majestic presence at Mount Kailash, in the mighty Himalayas. Think of Goddess Parvati and you remember the beautiful Kanyakumari, which is surrounded by the vast oceans. The union of Shiva and Parvati is a union of the Himalayas with the oceans.
 
Shiv and Parvati… this is by itself a message of oneness.
 
And look at how this message of oneness further manifests itself:
 
Around the neck of Lord Shiva, there is a snake. The ‘Vahan’ of Lord Ganesh is the mouse. We are well aware of the frosty relations between a snake and a mouse. Yet, they live together.
 
Similarly, the ‘Vahan’ of Kartikeya is the peacock. Peacocks and snakes are supposed to harbor great enmity. Even then, they live together.
 
The family of Lord Shiva is diverse yet the spirit of harmony and unity is vibrant.
 
Diversity is not a cause of conflict for us. We accept it and embrace it whole heartedly.
 
It is a speciality of our culture that wherever there is a God or Goddess, there is either an animal, a bird or a tree that is associated with him or her.
 
That animal, bird or tree is also worshipped with the same spirit as the God or Goddess. There cannot be a better means to inculcate a spirit of reverence for nature. Nature equals to God, this has been firmly established by our ancestors, showing their foresight.
 
Our scriptures say: एकमसत, विप्रा: बहुधा वदन्ति
 
Truth is one, sages call it by different names.
 
We have been living these virtues since our childhood and that is why compassion, kindness, brotherhood and harmony are naturally a part of us. 
 
These are values we have seen our ancestors live and die for.
 
These are virtues that have kept the Indian civilization alive for centuries.
 
Our mind should always be open to new thoughts and ideas from all sides. Unfortunately, there are a select few, who in order to hide their own ignorance, take a very rigid view and destroy any scope of welcoming new thoughts and experiences.
 
Rejecting an idea just because it is ancient can be potentially harmful. It is essential to analyse it, understand it and try to take it to the new generation in a manner in which they understand best.
 
The progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of women. The issue is no longer women development but it is women-led development.
 
I am proud of the fact that in our culture the role of women is central.
 
Our culture has so many Goddesses who are worshipped.
 
India is home to many women saints, who led the movements for social reform be it in the north, south, east or west.
 
They shattered stereotypes, broke barriers and became trendsetters.
 
You would be interested to know, that in India we say –नारी तू नारायणी, नारी तू नारायणी - woman is a manifestation of the divine.
 
लेकिन पुरुष के लिए क्‍या कहते हैं, for man we say नर तू करनी करे तो नारायण हो जाए- if a man does good deeds, he will attain divinity.
 
Do you see the difference- the divine status of the woman is unconditional Women unconditional नारी तू नारायणी whereas for men, it is conditional. He can earn it after good deeds.
That is also why perhaps Sadhguru insists that one takes the oath of being a mother to the world. A mother is someone who is unconditionally inclusive.
The changing lifestyles of the 21st century have brought their own set of challenges.
 
Lifestyle related ailments, stress related diseases are becoming more and more common. The communicable ailments can be controlled but what about the non-communicable ones?
 
It gives me immense sadness, one that I cannot describe in words, when I read about people taking to substance abuse and alcohol because they are not at peace with themselves.
 
Today, the whole world wants peace, not just peace from wars and conflict but peace of the mind.
 
The burden of stress takes a heavy toll and one of the sharpest weapons to overcome stress is Yoga.
 
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic conditions. If the body is a temple of the mind, yoga creates a beautiful temple.
 
That is why I call Yoga a passport to health assurance. More than being a cure to ailments, it is a means to wellness.
 
Yoga is about Rog Mukti (freedom from diseases) as well as Bhog Mukti (desisting from worldly greed).
 
Yoga makes the individual a better person in thought, action, knowledge and devotion.
 
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
 
You may see people twist and turn their bodies in many sorts of fashion. But they are not all yogis.
 
Yoga is far beyond physical exercises.
 
Through Yoga, we will create a new Yuga – a Yuga of togetherness and harmony. 
 
When India mooted the idea of the International Yoga Day at the United Nations, it was received with open arms.
 
The world celebrated both the Yoga Days, 21st June 2015 and 2016 with greatfervour.
 
Be it Korea or Canada, Sweden or South Africa- in every part of the world the rays of the sun were welcomed by Yogis, engaged in the practice of Yoga.
 
The coming together of so many nations to mark the International Day of Yoga illustrates the real essence of Yoga- togetherness.
 
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era)- a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
One truly remarkable thing that Sadhguru has done is he has made yogis out of ordinary, common people. People who stay with their families and work in the world, but who are living at the peaks within themselves – undergoing intense and wonderful experiences on a daily basis. Wherever one is, in whatever situation one is placed, one can be a yogi.
 
I see so many radiant and joyous faces here. I see people working with utmost love and care, paying attention to the smallest of details. I see people full of energy and enthusiasm to offer themselves to a greater cause.
 
Adiyogi will inspire many generations to take up yoga. My gratitude to Sadhguru for bringing this to us.
 
Thank you. Thank you very much. प्रणाम, वाणकम

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his seventeenth interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation. 

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to the telecom sector. Most of the grievances are related to issues of poor service quality, connectivity and non-functioning of landline connections. Secretary (Department of Telecom) outlined the steps taken so far in this regard. The Prime Minister emphasized the need for improving efficiency, and fixing accountability at all levels to bring about a visible change in the situation at the earliest. Recalling his review in April 2015, the Prime Minister called for using available and existing technological solutions to address the problems being faced by the people. 

During a review of the progress of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), the Prime Minister underlined the Union Government’s commitment to provide Housing for All by 2022. He urged the States to come up with strategies, time bound action plans and roadmap, and a monitoring mechanism to follow up on this goal. He called for the use of latest technology inputs to improve the pace and quality of work. 

The Prime Minister urged all Secretaries of Government of India, and Chief Secretaries to review the situation with regard to “Ease of Doing Business.” Referring to the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” Report, he asked the officials to assess the progress based on the parameters used in this Report. He also asked senior officials in the Union Government to review the progress on a weekly basis. 

The Prime Minister also reviewed the progress of vital infrastructure projects in the railway, road, port, power and natural gas sectors, spread over several states including Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana, Bihar, West Bengal, and Meghalaya. The Prime Minister reiterated the importance of completing projects in time, so that cost overruns could be avoided, and the benefits of projects could reach the people, as originally envisaged. Among the projects reviewed today are: Birnihat-Shillong Railway Line; Jogbani-Biratnagar (Nepal) Railway Line; Surat-Dahisar Highway; Gurgaon-Jaipur Highway; Chennai and Ennore Port connectivity project; Cochin Shipyard dry-dock construction; and the East Coast to West Coast Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijayapur Natural Gas Pipeline.

                A bi-partisan delegation of twenty-six members of the United States Congress jointly called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.

Prime Minister welcomed the Congressional Representatives to India. He said it augurs a good start to bilateral exchanges following the new U.S. Administration and Congress. 

The Prime Minister recalled his positive conversation with President Donald Trump and the shared commitment to further strengthen ties that have grown deeper in the last two and a half years. In this regard, he recognized Congress’ strong bipartisan support for the India-US partnership. 

The Prime Minister shared his perspective on areas where both countries can work even more closely, including in facilitating greater people-to-people linkages that have over the years helped contribute to each other’s prosperity. In this context, Prime Minister referred to the role of skilled Indian talent in enriching the American economy and society. He urged developing a reflective, balanced and farsighted perspective on movement of skilled professionals.

                Namaskaram. Greetings to everyone.

 Swami Nirvinananda ji and all the devotees of Sri Sri Thakur Ramakrishna Paramhansa assembled here today, greetings.

 I am privileged to be present among you at the beginning of the 7 day session of Sri Ramakrishna Vachanamrita Satram.

 When I think of the words of a great mind from Bengal, translated into Malayalam, being read and debated in Kerala, I am humbled by how ideas are shared and adapted across our country.

 What could be a better example of Ek Bharat...Shreshtha Bharat?

 This practice that you have started builds on a long tradition of making the teachings of the scriptures, the words of great gurus available to the common people.

 This is part of the long oral tradition of India that has evolved constantly to adapt to changing times and circumstances, keeping the eternal values intact.

 This tradition evolved from the Shrutis to the Smritis.

  The shrutis, the four Vedas and Upanishads are the source of  Dharma: they are sacred knowledge transmitted by great Indian sages from generation to generation.

 Shrutis are believed to be revealed divine knowledge, transmitted orally.

 Smriti is a class of texts that are based on memory and interpretation.

Since the Vedas and the Upanishads were difficult to understand for common people, the smritis were written to explain, interpret, and clarify primary revelation through stories and moral lessons.

 Thus it is clear that the epics, Puranas and the Arthasastra of Kautilya are all smritis.

 The effort to reach every person through the means that are best suited to them continued over time.

 To reach the common people, there was a need to make dharma, or right living, more accessible, closer to their daily lives.

 The Bhagvat describes Devarshi Narada, singing the praise of God

 

अहो देवर्षिर्धन्योऽयं यत्कीर्तिं शांर्गधन्वन:।

गायन्माद्यन्निदं तन्त्रया रमयत्यातुरं जगत्।।

 ‘अहो ! ये देवर्षि नारदजी धन्य हैं जो वीणा बजाते, हरिगुण गाते और मस्त होते हुए इस दुखी संसार को आनन्दित करतेरहते हैं।’

 

The bhakti saints used music, poetry, local languages to bring God closer to people - they broke the barriers of caste, class, religion and gender.

 The message of the saints was carried further by folk singers, the Katha-vachak, the dastangois.

 Kabir's dohas, Meera's bhajans were carried by singers from village to village.

 India is a land that is blessed with a rich cultural and intellectual milieu.

Our land is home to writers, scholars, saints and seers who have expressed themselves freely and fearlessly.

  And whenever the history of human civilization has entered the era of knowledge, India has shown the way.

  A false perception was created about India that India needed social, political and economic reform initiated by outsiders.

 This became a reason to justify colonialism too.

 Such notions were absolutely false because India’s soil is that soil from where change has always originated.

 And this change originated from within, driven by our saints and seers who made it their mission to transform society and undertake mass movements to eradicate evils that may have entered into our society.

 Our Saints integrated each and every citizen in their quest for social reform.

Nobody was left outside the ambit.

This is why our civilization stands tall, overcoming obstacles.

 Those civilizations that did not change with time vanished.

 We, on the other hand even altered practices over centuries.

 Some practice may have been prevalent a few centuries ago but if it was felt redundant, it was altered.

We have always been open to new ideas.

Through our history, our Saints did things that may seem small but their impact was big and this altered the course of our history.

  Long before any faith, any culture, India had women saints who took up the issue of gender equality.

  They wrote fearlessly and expressed themselves through their powerful writings.

 In Hindu philosophy, time is accepted as a very important factor of the absolute - we are Dik-Kaal-Baadhit - conditioned by space and time.

  The role of the Guru is to interpret the eternal values in the context of the times - so that, like a river that flows, and renews itself as it flows, the stream of knowledge is ever fresh and vibrant.

 The scriptures say:

प्रेरकः सूचकश्वैव वाचको दर्शकस्तथा ।

शिक्षको बोधकश्चैव षडेते गुरवः स्मृताः ॥

 Those who inspire you, those who inform you, those who tell you the truth, those who teach you, show you the right way and awaken you, they are all your gurus.

We all remember the role of Shri Narayana Guru in transforming Kerala.

 A saint and social reformer from a backward caste who transcended the barriers of caste and promoted social justice.

 When the Sivagiri pilgrimage was started, he declared its goals to be the promotion of education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training.

Could there be a better example of a teacher setting standards for the advancement of society?

 Speaking of Sri Ramakrishna in this gathering may seem like carrying coals to Newcastle, but I cannot stop myself from mentioning those attributes that make him so relevant to present times.

 He was a part of the tradition of Bhakti saints and in the Kathamrit we find many references to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu - his trances, his songs, his utter devotion.

 But he renewed the tradition and made it stronger.

 He broke the mental barriers that keep us apart barriers between religions, between castes.

He was the saint of social harmony.

 His message is that of tolerance, of devotion, of surrendering oneself to the divine of One Lord with different names – the gyaani, the yogi, and the devotee. “The same Being whom gyaanis call Brahma - the Absolute, is called Atma - Universal Soul, by yogis, and Bhagavan - Personal God with divine attributes, by devotees.

 He lived the Muslim way of life, he lived the Christian way of life, he practised tantra.

 He found that there were many ways to the divine, but followed with devotion, they all lead to one goal.

 ""The Reality is one and the same;"" he said, "" the difference is in name and form.""

 ""It is like water, called in different languages by different names, such as jal, neer, pani, and so forth.

 Likewise, in German it is ‘Wasser’, the French call it ‘Eau’, ‘Acqua in Italian, ‘Mizu’ in Japanese.

 In Kerala you call it ‘Vellam.’

 All of them denote one and the same thing, the difference being in the name only.

 In the same way, some address the Reality as 'Allah', some as 'God', some as 'Brahma', some as 'Kāli', and others by such names as 'Rama', 'Jesus', 'Durga','Hari.'""

 His teachings are particularly relevant to us today, when we are confronted with people who use religion, caste to divide and create animosity.

  Mahatma Gandhi said: Ramakrishna’s life enables us to see God face to face.

 No one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is an illusion.

 Sri Ramakrishna is a link between the ancient and the modern.

 He showed how the ancient ideals and experiences could be realized even while following the modern way of life.

Simple anecdotes, simple messages - told simply.

 But due to their very simplicity, these were embedded in the minds of the listeners.

If we had not a teacher like this, would there have been a disciple like Swami Vivekananda?

 The great karmayogi took forward the thought of his guru –

 Jatra Jeev, Tatra Shiv -  wherever there is a living being, there is Shiva;

 and

 Jeeve Daya Noy, Shiv Gyaane Jeev Seba - जीवे दया नोय, शिव ज्ञाने जीव सेबा"" - not kindness to living beings, but serving the living being as Shiva Himself -

 to his lifelong dedication to serving the Daridra Narayan.

 Swami Vivekananda said - Where should you go to seek God?

 Are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, god? Why not worship them first? Let these people be your God.

 His clarion call -“Now is wanted intense Karma-Yoga with un-bounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart. Then only will the people of the country be roused”

- continues to inspire us to action, continues to give us courage.

 Ramakrishna Mission's record of service is evidence of this commitment.

 We find the mission in poor areas, among tribals, in areas stricken by need or disaster trying to alleviate suffering.

 It does not matter what community the person is from, what her caste or beliefs are.

 All that is important is that he or she can be helped through selfless service.

 On the website of the Mission,

We find the brahmvakya-  आत्मनो मोक्षार्थम जगत हिताय च

 For one's own salvation and for the welfare of the world.

  

सेवा परमो धर्म:

 पृथिवीं धर्मणा धृतां शिवां स्योनामनु चरेम विश्वहा।

 (धर्म के द्वारा धारण की गई इस मातृभूमि की सेवा हम सदैव करते रहें)

 

मैत्री करुणा मुदितोपेक्षाणां। सुख दु:ख पुण्यापुण्य विषयाणां। वनातश्चित्तप्रासादनम्।

 (दूसरे का दु:ख देखकर मन में करुणा, दूसरे का पुण्य (समाज सेवा आदि) देखकर आनंद का भाव, तथा किसी ने पाप कर्मकिया तो मन में उपेक्षा का भाव 'किया होगा छोडो' प्रातिक्रियाएँ उत्पन्न होनी चाहिए।)

The flame that has been lit today - the satram that has been started- should illuminate our hearts - एकदीप से जले दूसरा, जलते दीप हज़ार।

 To quote our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji:

 

 आओ फिर से दीया जलाएं

 भरी दुपहरी में अंधियारा

 सूरज परछाई से हारा

 अंतरतम का नेह निचोड़ें-

 बुझी हुई बाती सुलगाएं।

 आओ फिर से दीया जलाएं।

 

Let Sri Sri Thakur Ramakrishna's words inspire us to see the divine in all things, to harness self and the ego in the service of the poorest and weakest, so that we find the greater truth that is the essence of all religions.

 Again, it is the words of the great disciple that I will take as my guide: Let us work on, doing as we go whatever happens to be our duty, and being ever ready to put our shoulders to the wheel.

  Then surely shall we see the Light!

  Thank you. Thank you very much.

                Hon'ble Chairman,

 

I am here to offer my thanks for the President's address in the joint sitting of both the Houses. About 40 respected members have participated in this discussion - Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, Neeraj Shekhar,Shri A. Navnathakrishnan ji, Mr. Derek ji, Mr. D Raja, Mr. Sharad Yadav, Mr. Sitaram Ji, Mr. Ahmed Bhai and Mr. Anand Sharma. I am very grateful to you all. I am grateful to the other honourable members who have also discussed the subject. Most of the discussions have been around Demonetisation. We cannot deny the fact that this evil of corruption and black money is present in our country and is deeply rooted in our economy and social system. We cannot deny this and therefore the fight against corruption and black money is not a political battle. It is not a fight to harass any political party and there is no reason to think so. Therefore, there is no reason why anyone should associate this issue with himself. In this House, we all have the obligation to do things within the framework of the Constitution and whatever our wisdom permits. It is also true that the poor have incurred greatest loss due to the parallel economy. The poor is deprived of their rights and the middle class is exploited. It is not that efforts have not been made before! Efforts were made before. But even more efforts are required. If these efforts lead to more efforts, we should move towards it. Ultimately, we cannot continue to brush aside the problems under the carpet.

 

Therefore one of the significant issues in this regard is that of the fake notes. The statistics show the percentage of fake notes that have reached the banks. A particular system ensures that most of the fake notes do not reach the bank. It is also used to promote terrorism and Naxalism. Some people were saying with a great excitement that a few 2000 rupee notes were found from a terrorist. We should be aware of the fact that post demonetisation cases of bank robbery were reported from Jammu and Kashmir. This is because the business of counterfeiting notes faced a lot of hurdles after this. Some of the terrorists who were killed after this incident of bank robbery were found with some of these notes. There is a direct link between these incidents which we should understand. So there is no reason to side with these people and there is no reason that we should not raise our voice or fight against them. The honest persons will not feel empowered until the dishonest ones are dealt with a heavy hand. Ultimately we believe that these steps will benefit the honest. 

Hon'ble Chairman, 

 

Several years ago Wanchoo committee was formed. He had given his recommendations in his report submitted to Mrs Indira Gandhi ji. Yashvantrao Chavan had accepted the recommendations and wanted to proceed with it but Indira ji had said that we are in politics and we keep contesting elections. This is mentioned in Godbole ji's book. It would have been better if you had shown a little awareness regarding this book and raised your voices against its publication. Were you sleeping? What were you up to? Were you sleeping when this officer raised such a big allegation against Indira ji? If I were in your place I would have filed a case against Godbole ji. But you did not. But today this situation has progressed a little bit. When Wanchoo committee had submitted its report the problem was limited only to black money. Today the issue of black money has spread to other issues like terrorism, counterfeit currency, drugs, Hawala business.

 

When the decision of demonetisation was taken on November 8, there was no question of the counterfeit notes returning to the banks. If at all some note had entered any small bank the Reserve Bank would have caught hold of it. But the fake notes should have been neutralized at that very moment. Therefore it is surprising to note how the statistics of the fake note is available if at all is available to anyone. The counterfeit currencies are neutralized at that very moment. You must have come across television news which was going on for a long time about how the people running the business of counterfeit currency in enemy nations had to commit suicide.

 

Now see in our country for the first time more than 700 Maoists surrendered within 30 to 40 days between the months of November and December. This process is continuing even after that. Who will not be relieved in this House to know about the surrender of the Maoists? If some are not satisfied that would be due to some other reason. 

 

Similarly, it is true that money in the formal system is necessary for the country. Thousand rupee notes were hardly used in day to day activities and 500 rupee notes were used at a very low rate. Bundles of these notes were going into this business. This is the reality and we cannot deny that. Now that such a huge amount of currency has come into banks, it is natural that the power of banks in lending money to the common man will increase. For the first time in our country all the banks simultaneously have reduced the interest rates. The general public has benefitted out of it. People like Sitaram Ji and his party will expect that workers of unorganized sector should get wage security. It is the reality that all that is promised is not given. Whatever is provided, half the people even don't get that much. These things are well known. So if we create a system where those workers will be linked with the EPF and the ESIC Scheme, the workers will get wage security. We are putting efforts in that direction.

 

I want to give the example of Assam Tea gardens. The Assam government took a little initiative. They opened around seven lakh bank accounts for the workers working in the tea gardens and taught them to do business on mobile app. Earlier, the trade unions opposed the move and wanted transactions in cash because certain things were associated with it. However, due to this move the workers of these tea gardens started getting full payment, wage cuts stopped and their business in that area were secured. It is a great experience. 

 

Similarly, if you quote 10 foreign newspapers or economists, I can quote 20. If you quote 10 great men I can quote 20. This is because the initiative is unparalleled. Nowhere in the world has such a great step been taken. Therefore, the economists around the world have no yardstick to account for this. It can become a case study for the universities and the economists of the world.

 

India has taken a big decision. This is the strength of the common man. I want to tell the dignitaries present in the House that the sociologists will also research the impact of Demonetization. For the first time, a horizontal divide has emerged in the country. When I say horizontal divide, I mean the divide between the general public on one side and the politicians on the other. The politicians are usually cut off from the general public. Whenever a decision is taken by the government, be it any government, the public used to oppose it. But satisfactorily, this is first such instance when by and large the government and the general public were together even though some were against. 

 

Similarly, we should be proud of the fact that despite some hurdles, the 125 crore Indians, some of whom are illiterate (as pointed out by you), are desperate to get the country rid of these evils and are fighting for the same. Be it any political leader or political party, we should be proud of the fact that the people of our country are ready to take the pain in order to fight the evils plaguing the country and they are searching for the paths to accomplish this. Therefore, we should also understand this.

 

The Chairman Sir,

 

In the previous session, Dr. Manmohan Singh ji had presented his thoughts. It is true that you have published a book recently whose foreword page was written by Doctor Sahib. While reading the report I was wondering that since he is such a great economist, his contribution would be there in the book. But I came to know that the book was written by someone else and he wrote only the foreword page.

 

After hearing his speech I felt that for last 30-35 years, the word that I didn’t even utter was understood by him. This is incredible! Dr Manmohan Singh ji, the former Prime Minister is a very respectable personality. He has been associated with the India's economic decision making and he himself has been in decision making for the past 30-35 years. There would hardly be anyone other than him from the field of economics whose predominance could be seen for about half of the period in the past 70 years since India's independence. Several scams have come to the forefront; but the politicians could learn a lot from Doctor Sahib. Even after so much (controversy) his image was not slurred. The art of bathing with the raincoat on is only known by Doctor Sahib and no one else!!

Respected Chairman,

A person of such a great stature had used words like 'loot' and 'launder'. One should think 50 times before crossing the limits. So, one should be ready to face criticism. We have the strength to pay back in the same coin. But we do it within the framework of the constitution. We respect democracy; but if somebody is not prepared to face the truth, how long will it continue?

Respected chairman, it is a fact that there have been attempts to incite the general public. Today we see that even in cases of minor accidents people set 2-3 cars on fire; even if a bus arrives late then also buses are set on fire. The impact of these incidents by and large needs to be analysed but these incidents have become a daily affair. We are committed to fight the internal battles. Therefore, despite these challenges we didn't allow such incidents to occur. We should proudly present the capability of the people of India before the whole world; we should talk about it and only then I believe the world will understand our thoughts.

I want to mention one more thing today. It is natural that my and Sitaram ji's ideologies differ. Therefore, the presentation of arguments also differs. But when I was thinking of this topic I knew it well that Sitaram ji and his party will be with us in this work because one of the senior leaders of your party, Mr. Jyoti rmoy Basu, in 1972, had made a great demand of placing the Wanchoo Committee report in the House and had fought a lot for it. The government was not accepting the demand and was not presenting it. Ultimately he himself brought a copy of the report and placed it on the table. Jyotirmoy Basu ji on his own had placed the report on the table as a private member. The speech he had delivered that day is available today. He had said that on August 26, 1972:

""Sir, on 12 November 1970, one of the primary recommendations of a powerful and prestigious committee was that of demonetization. Sir, Mrs. Indira Gandhi is surviving on black money. Her politics is alive only with the help of black money. That's why this report was not implemented and it was also kept suppressed for one and a half years. Jyotirmoy Basu ji, speaking again on 4th September 1972 in Lok Sabha, had said, ""I had recommended demonetization and other measures. Now I do not want to repeat them. The government should cooperate with the people honestly. But the character of Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi and her government is a government of black money, by black money and for black money."" This is the incident of September 4, 1972. Not only that, senior CPI (M) leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet Ji had said in the same House on August 27, 1981, ""Does the government really want to take any serious step to curb black money? Can the decisions like that of demonetization of hundred rupee notes be taken?"" This question was raised by Surjeet ji in the same House in 1981 and therefore I urge the Left in particular to join us in this fight and I hope you will. You are always open to new thoughts and you cannot keep yourself aloof from such work. Such is your character. Even then, the time will tell. It is true that while taking such tough decisions in the democratic setup, a perception develops that these are populist measures. It becomes the nature of democracy. A perception develops regarding short-term goals. So it takes a little time to understand the importance of such big decisions. Therefore, we cannot blame anyone for it. Gradually the people who are opposing it will understand that such a big decision was for the welfare of the country and that we want to take it forward.

Discussions are going on regarding setting up of a digital system. There were several complaints regarding unavailability of some or the other things in all the speeches till now. For example, toilets are there but there is no water supply. They said what not! I was wondering what they were saying! The report card that they were providing was for the Governments of the 70 year old India. In the past seventy years, my contribution is only two and a half years old. Have we locked the toilets that were constructed by you? Have we demolished the roads that were laid by you? Did we cut the supply line of the water taps installed by you? It is a reality and nobody can deny the fact that the digital system has not completely penetrated the entire country. The question is whether there is a possibility to change the mind-set? Can we make efforts in the areas where it's possible?

Suppose there is a possibility in the city of Delhi, then why can't we start from Delhi? We can make some positive contribution there. It's a matter of Behavioural-change. If people in Calcutta have mobile phones and digital connectivity then we should start from there even if it is not available in remote villages. And secondly, we keep blowing our trumpet regarding the new schemes or facilities but when it comes to implementing them why should we have any trouble?

Secondly, we have a habit of playing with the words. Now if we ask any child, even your child, “do you go to school daily?"" He will say, ""Yes, I go daily."" But all of us know that Sunday is an off day when no child goes to school. Everyone knows this. Similarly, turning the country into a cashless society means, carrying the nation gradually towards digital payment system. Even today several developed countries in the world conduct elections with the help of printed ballot papers. India, the largest democracy, which is considered as an illiterate nation, votes by pressing the buttons. The day this system was put in place could anyone think that the poorest of the poor in our country would also adopt such technologies?

This means that we should not underestimate the strength of our country. Yes we might think that this path is not correct. But despite discomfort and troubles, giving up is not a right step. There will be inconvenience and the system may not be up to the mark but we have to keep moving forward.

Some people say that several countries in the world are way ahead. Anand Sharma ji was saying that there are several such countries. I am surprised! You will be surprised to know that Korea came up with an incentive scheme at such a large scale in order to go digital. But he is complaining that we are spending crores of rupees to promote digitalization. There is no cost involved in using the Bhim app. Transactions can be made without any extra cost. Not a single penny goes as Commission to the banks and therefore the world is moving towards paper-less and premises-less banking. So, I do not see any reason why India should remain behind. In the beginning we may be lacking in several areas and it might take two or five years but we should at least begin our efforts in that direction. We should keep making efforts to promote it in our localities. We should move in that direction.

Now, the common man travels by the Railways. Today 60% of the railway bookings are made online. The refunds on the cancellation are also made online. Several families that live in cities used to face hurdles for paying electricity bills. They have to take half a day leave from work in order to pay the bills. Today they can pay the bill at 12 in the night after coming from work with the help of their mobile phones. The benefits are expanding. We should worry about the shortcomings of the technology since it is increasing our comfort levels and benefitting us. We should rectify the problems in the technology but we can never progress if we have this negative attitude towards the use of technology. 

RuPay Card - right now Arun ji was saying that 21 crore people have been given RuPay cards along with Jan Dhan bank accounts. You cannot even imagine the power of this card. Normally for one section of the society, owning a card has become a matter of prestige. They make payments with the card. A perception has been formed that the poor people cannot own such cards. Just now Anand Kumar ji was telling me that while he was coming here from Bangalore one IT professional was travelling along with him who told him about his driver. He said that his driver was extremely happy with demonetization. He asked him the reason. So in his reply the driver said that just like a rich person who keeps a card with him even he carries one. He started showing his card. He was extremely happy. You can imagine that this is such a big transformation in the life of a common man. It builds a new self-confidence. A person, who had never seen a cycle in his home, is on the ninth cloud, when he gets a motorcycle in his house. So in such a scenario a person feels extremely proud even if the scooter is a small or even an old one. Our efforts should be in the direction of fulfilling those aspirations of the common man in our society. 

Direct Benefit Transfer- it has brought so many benefits. I had talked about that in detail in the other House. We could save 50000 crore rupees that was lost to leakages every year and we can also save more in the future as well by the Direct Benefit Transfer. For example, sometimes one person used to take the scholarship from 6 places; in case of widow pensions, sometimes a daughter who was not even born was made a widow on records and cheques of widow pension were drawn on her name. In this way we can prevent the middlemen from taking these benefits due to such leakages with the help of Direct Benefit Transfer scheme. Now we can cease the loot of the Government's treasury with the help of this scheme. This is how Direct Benefit Transfer scheme has benefited the country. We should keep trying to promote digital payments. 

The government has developed a system. The number of POS machines is being increased at a rapid pace. We are making efforts towards promoting e-wallets for mobile payments. We are working towards internet banking and Aadhaar based payment. If technology keeps developing in this way, that day is not far when one will be able to make payments only on the basis of Aadhaar card even without the need for mobile phones. Therefore, we should try to understand these mechanisms and to engage our teams in their implementation. Bhim app is an excellent system. This was developed under the Government of India. The more it is popularised the lesser these traders will have to deal with outside agencies. There is this directly enabled platform whose benefits can be availed. We should do this.

Now, the drivers who drive on the highways have to wait for paying the toll tax. We know that so much money is spent on petrol and diesel every time the vehicle halts. After 8th November we looked into the matter and now the drivers can use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to pay the toll tax. Earlier very few people had access to this technology. In such a short span of time about 20% of the traffic is now using RFID for the payment of toll tax. As the car passes, it gets registered automatically and the amount is deducted from the owner’s bank account. He is not required to halt. A lot of petrol can be saved across the country with the expansion of this technology. This is the situation for the toll tax on one hand. Similarly about 29 to 30% of the people at petrol pumps are using digital mode of payment. We had set up a committee under the chairmanship of Chandrababu Naidu ji. We have received the interim report. The report is being analysed. The final report is  yet to come out. We should make preparations for the change.

Another important topic which I would like to mention is that of the banking system. Your comments are like a report card for me. It is the report card of the previous governments. This government established a Debt Recovery Tribunal. There were no proper rules for the appointment in banks. There  was a total mismanagement. The government established an independent recruitment agency called Bank Board Bureau for appointing the Chairman, the Managing Director, and the Director etc. We have tried to incorporate professionalism in the banking system.

A two-day round table conference was held for the Banking and Finance sector and the economic world. They discussed upon the ways through which our country's banking sector can be elevated to global standards. They discussed, debated and brainstormed on this issue and tried to understand their shortcomings in order to find solutions.

The dignity of the Reserve Bank- it is very natural for you to attack me, my party and our government. But there is no reason to drag the Reserve Bank in this. There is no reason to drag the RBI Governor into this. We must make efforts to protect the values and dignity of such institutions. Some people had spoken against the previous Governor as well. I had protested against that too as it was not right. Such things should be kept out of controversies. The rest are government systems and will continue like that. The Reserve Bank plays a significant role in regulating the country's economy. We should have a positive approach towards maintaining its credibility. And I want to tell the people, who accuse the government and question the dignity of the Reserve Bank, with a lot of disappointment that the former RBI Governor Dr Subbarao had written a book in 2008- 'Who Moved My Interest Rate?' where he said that he was angry and upset with the government's decision to appoint a Liquidation Management Committee under the Finance Secretary. “Chidambaram had clearly infringed upon the subject of the Reserve Bank of India. Not only did he not consult with me on this matter but he did not even tell me about the issue of the notification. How would I have known that this decision would set the tone for an uncomfortable relationship between the two of us in the last year of my tenure?” The ex- Governor of the Reserve Bank had thus, raised serious allegations against the old government. This has been published in the book but no one has replied to it yet. If someone replies to it now it altogether will be a different matter. Today I want to advise them that they also should realise their faults. I believe that we should keep politics out of it and strive towards preserving its dignity and pride.

This government has taken steps to increase the strength of RBI. We have established a Monetary Policy Committee by making amendments to the RBI Act. This was being discussed for several years but was not coming into force. So now we have established it. This committee has been entrusted with the complete responsibility of monetary policy operations. In addition to the two RBI officials three experts are its members. There is no member of the central government in this committee. The monetary policy committee has been given such a great autonomy. No one can imagine that the government has given such a great autonomy to the RBI. This has strengthened the RBI.

It is true that several issues have been discussed here. No government comes to power and sleeps. The previous governments have also made several efforts. I am not saying that they have not done anything. Unlike any other Prime Minister, I had praised the contributions made by all the former governments and Prime Ministers since Independence, from the ramparts of the Red Fort. We usually hesitate in mentioning about the contributions made by someone else. The history is a witness to this fact. But it is true that this government has done a lot of work in improving the governance. Even though we take small decisions, these decisions have empowered the common man.

We have started the practice of affidavit. The people had to queue up in front of the houses of the MPs, MLAs and others for their stamps. But he never bothered. Either the peon or some worker would make the attestations. Now we have changed that system to self-attestation. Now the common man has got rid of that trouble. Now he can go with the original copy for his final appointment. This is an era of Xerox. There is no need for all those cumbersome processes.

We have ended the system of interview. The merit of the people will be decided by the technology. Jobs will be provided on the basis of merit. Corruption has ended due to this. The two Houses have done away with more than 1100 laws. Several newspapers flashed articles regarding the appointment in the senior posts. For the first time appointments were being made on the basis of merit. We have ended all the age old practices. Several neutral newspapers have written excellent articles on this. 

DBT or Direct Benefit Transfer scheme - leakages were plugged by direct benefit. Earlier it used to take 7 days or 15 days and even 2 months for registering a company. Today a company can be registered within 24 hours. We have established such a system. Earlier it used to take months to get a passport. Today passport can be obtained within a week. Now we are planning to convert the Postal Head Office into a Passport-Office. The common man will avail the benefits of this endeavour and we are working in that direction. 

We know that the issue of coal auction is a big deal. The government has easily implemented a scheme to bring transparency in the process. We have taken an important decision which has not been discussed much but I want to inform this House about it. We have launched GeM for the process of purchases made by the government. Government e-Market place or GeM has been awarded the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World Bank. Now whoever wants to supply his goods to the government can upload the list of products online and the government can choose from them. It has also saved money. One can make payment through GeM if the transaction is more than 5000 rupees. We have made efforts in that direction.

We have been successful in bringing transparency with the use of Technology and good governance for fighting against corruption. 

This government has brought many new schemes for the empowerment of women.

Ujjwala Yojana - we know that there was a time when the MPs used to get 25 coupons for providing gas connections to the people and the people had to queue up for those 25 coupons. The 2014 elections were fought on the issue of providing gas cylinders; whether one should get 9 or 12 cylinders. The way of working of this government is very different. The poor women who could never think of getting a gas oven have been provided with gas connections. About 1 crore 65 lakh poor households have been provided with gas connections till date. Our target is to make it available to 5 crore families. Of the 25 crore families of the country we want to provide it to at least 5 crore families.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - it has been made mandatory to register the houses in the name of the female member of the family. Earlier about 40 to 45% of the women used to work under MGNREGA but now this figure has increased to 55%.

Under Mudra Yojana loans are provided from the bank without guarantee. About 70% of the borrowers are women. This means the country's women are coming forward as entrepreneurs.

Pandit Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - work through Self-Help-Groups was in operation to some extent in Southern India. We have made efforts to encourage it in the entire country especially in Eastern India. 

Rs. 6000 is being provided to the poor pregnant women to reduce IMR and MMR at the time of deliveries. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign has been recognized everywhere and has become a social movement. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana - about 1 crore accounts with 11 thousand crore rupees have been opened in the name of girls which guarantees a secured future for these girls. Mahila Shakti Kendras have been established in 14 lakh Anganwadi centres at a cost of 500 crore rupees. 

Mission Indradhanush - children were not vaccinated even though the government used to organise vaccination programmes. About 55 lakh children were not covered under vaccination. Such children were identified under Mission Indradhanush. Efforts were made to save the lives of those children.

In rural areas - I was surprised at the mockery of sanitation here. I could not understand the reason. None of us wants to live in dirt. We all know that hygiene is largely an issue of behaviour. However, infrastructure is also linked with it. Sometimes even the role of politicians is not enough in this regard. I want to congratulate the media of this country for giving an impetus to the cleanliness movement. Today the media is being rewarded for its role in cleanliness drive. It is natural for the media to negatively report about any programme of the government. But the programme on cleanliness is an exception to that. The media was two steps ahead of the government and the politicians for making efforts in transforming the issue of cleanliness into a movement. I congratulate them from this House. But some of the people here say that toilets are there but without water supply. Mahatma Gandhi was its proponent. I am afraid if Mahatma Gandhi was alive today and propagated cleanliness would we have used the same language as this? Isn't it our responsibility? Shouldn't we take positive steps in order to bring a transformation in the society? Why should we protest against everything? I am delighted that sanitation coverage which was 42% has now increased to 60% after this movement. You can imagine the pain of the women in the villages and slum areas of the cities. They cannot go to relieve themselves till it is dark. This pain should be felt. This is not a matter of argument but it pains a lot when it is being mocked at. It cannot be a subject of joke.

Universalization of women helpline 181- a 24 hour emergency service has been started for the security of women. 18 states and UTs have carried forward this system of women's helpline. Some of the states have accepted the provision of 33% recruitment of women in the police force. It has been made compulsory in the UTs. Haryana has come up with a new experiment which I have presented before you. They have formed a network of police volunteers for helping out the people. They have started a new scheme. They are doing it with the help of panic button Technology. We are going to present it before you in the coming days.

Empowerment of the farmers - the government has taken several steps in this regard. The most important one is Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. We like it or not but in order to secure the farmers' income we have to link it with income assurance. Here, the irrigation facility is lacking. He is dependent on the natural resources only. 

In such a situation even if he cannot sow the crops and the harvest is destroyed then insurance provided to him can come to his rescue. I am happy that in some States about 40 to 50% farmers have opted for insurance. The government has made great efforts in order to encourage Crop Insurance Scheme for the farmers on a large scale. There has been a lot of increase in crop insurance in some States but some states are far behind. This is a matter of concern. There is a need to expand its coverage.

New Fertilizer policy - production of urea: see, there are two benefits of Neem coating. Firstly, the land is getting benefited due to increase in productivity.  Earlier the subsidy bill was drawn in the name of the farmer but it was diverted to the chemical industry in the form of raw material. Urea was used even in the preparation of synthetic milk. With hundred per cent Neem coating it is not possible to use urea for any other purpose than its use for the land. The theft is no longer possible. Black-marketing of Urea has stopped. Today no Chief Minister writes any letter regarding unavailability of urea. Now no one queues up for urea. Today no one is facing any problem because of urea. You can see how small steps can bring about a big transformation.

Production of pulses in our country - the government has tried to promote it. Consequently, today we have a possibility of 50 to 60% increase in the yield. The farmers of our country have accepted the government’s appeal and they have done this work by breaking all records.

e-NAM- now the farmer can sell his produce at the highest price through technology in 500 electronic markets. The situation was not favourable for my farmers to trade using mobile phones in 500 Mandis. Today this work has been completed in 250 Mandis. The states have modified some of the laws. We know that the farmers will be highly benefited by food processing. Therefore, we will emphasize upon food processing. The government has allowed 100% FDI so that the food processing industry gets a boost and with value addition the income of our farmers can increase. We are making efforts in that direction.

Empowerment of tribal population - nearly 28 departments are in some of the other way related to Tribal Affairs. For the first time under Tribal Sub-plan we have not only increased the amount but have made a successful attempt to make a comprehensive plan under Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana so that the outcome is well reflected.

Forest Rights Act- we are working to strengthen it. In our country most of the mining activities and minerals like coal and iron are confined to the tribal belts but the locals are not deriving the benefits out of it. The government has created a District Mineral Foundation and imposed a tax on the amount that comes from mining for the first time. The Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh was saying that there are 7 districts in his state that produce minerals. Because of this scheme and the Foundation, he is not required to allocate separate budget for the development of these districts. The amount coming out of the scheme is going to benefit the poor tribal people. We have worked in that direction.

We have launched the Rurban Mission and it is largely going to benefit the tribal areas. The tribal market should develop into a big market. If such a market develops then the education system, health facilities and entertainment sector will also develop. Gradually it becomes a focal point for the surrounding 50-100 villages. We are working towards developing 300 new cities in the tribal belts through this Rurban Mission. This will be a great initiative for the development of tribal areas.

Similarly, I have been saying that sanitation should become a mass movement. In order to make it a mass movement the contribution of each one of us is required. Since we started ranking the cities for cleanliness through an independent agency, the cities have started competing with each other. If one city moves ahead then the other cities try to beat that city. This is trickling down to lower levels. We should emphasize on that and I want all the political parties in the country that are in power at some or the other levels and have got the opportunity to govern in Nagar Palikas or Zila Panchayats or in any state to compete with each other. For example, all the communist ruled cities can compete with each other; the Communist ruled district Panchayats can compete for cleanliness. Nagar palikas of BJP ruled states can compete with each other. If we push this competition further, I believe, the sanitation campaign will succeed. This is not a government programme but a mass movement. Behavioural change is the need of this era. According to the World Bank report, lack of cleanliness creates a burden of 2.5 lakh crore rupees for health care. This is the World Bank report with reference to India. The poor people have to spend around 7000 rupees annually. It is very natural to contract diseases from unhygienic conditions. We can prevent it.

Everyone believes that children should eat their meals after washing their hands. But when we say this, someone will complain about unavailability of water, taps and so on. Is it right to think this way? Such  way of thinking has been suppressing the country. At least one should think of something new. There will be difficulties on the way but only then can we find new paths. We are asking our children to wash hands but keep complaining about unavailability of something or the other. The country cannot transform this way. Therefore, we have to change this harmful and regressive mind-set. The small neighbouring countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have given about 15 years to cleanliness. They are the model countries for us. Can't we do this in India? This should be our dream that if small countries can do it then why can't we? We should make efforts in that direction. But sometimes I feel that a different kind of atmosphere has been developed.  As one poet had said –‘the city is yours, you are the murderer, you are the martyr and you only are the ruler’. But I believe that we should come out of this mind-set.

I will end my speech with another topic. Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat- we had launched this on 31st October on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. We have been forming sister states and sister cities with that of the other countries of the world but we do not have the habit of interacting with the people of our own country. Several States began to feel that they were being neglected. It is essential that we utilise our country's potential. We have made an attempt with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat and I wish that the people of this House help us to carry it forward. For example, now 12 States have signed MoUs among themselves such as Haryana and Telangana. The people of Haryana should learn 100 sentences of Telugu - ' where is the hospital? Where can I find a rickshaw? Where is the hotel? Where is the Police Station?' They can learn these. Similarly the people of Telangana should learn Haryanvi. Haryana should conduct film festival of Telangana. Similarly, the film festival of Haryana should be organized in Telangana. Quiz competitions should be organized. The children of Haryana should participate in the quiz competition of Telangana. In a way this is a campaign to know and connect with the country. We should encourage it. Sometimes we are short of words in Hindi language but for expressing the same thing we have a brilliant word in Tamil language. However, we are not familiar with it. Similarly, there are beautiful words in Marathi or Bengali languages but we are not familiar with them either. Our country has a lot of strength. Efforts are being made to strengthen this further with the 'Ek Bharat shreshtha Bharat' campaign.

Once again I express my gratitude to all the Honourable members who have placed their opinions and thoughts. I express my gratitude for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts. I would like to end my speech by showing my support to the President's address. Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today replied to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha. 

He said that several members have shared their views and there was considerable discussion on demonetization. The Prime Minister said that the fight against corruption and black money is not a political fight, and it is not to single out any particular party. He emphasized that corruption has adversely impacted the aspirations of the poor and the middle class. He said that those who are cheating the system will have to be dealt with toughness, so that the hands of the poor are strengthened. 

The Prime Minister said that about 700 Maoists surrendered after demonetization and this number is increasing.

Shri Narendra Modi said that there is today a horizontal divide – in which - on one side are the people of India and the Union Government, and on the other side are a group of political leaders. 

The Prime Minister said that today, India is working to correct the wrongs that have entered our society. He said that we should continuously move forward for practical change, and never underestimate the strength of our country. 

The Prime Minister said that institutions should be kept above politics, and the Reserve Bank of India should not be dragged into controversy. 

The Prime Minister said that on matters related to governance, a lot has been done which has given strength to the common man. He mentioned the transparency that has been brought in the Government procurement process, through Government e Marketplace. 

The Prime Minister congratulated the media for furthering the message of Swachh Bharat and creating awareness. He added that sanitation coverage in the rural areas has increased. He said that cleanliness should become a public movement, and we should all work towards this cause. 

The Prime Minister said that under the “Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat” initiative, we all have the opportunity to learn about and appreciate the culture and capabilities of various parts of the country.

 माननीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, राष्‍ट्रपति जी ने संसद के दोनों सत्रों को 2017  के प्रारंभ में ही सम्‍बोधित किया। भारत किस तेजी से बदल रहा है, देश की  जनशक्ति का सामर्थ्‍य क्‍या है, गांव, गरीब किसान की जिंदगी किस प्रकार से  बदल रही है, उसका एक विसतार से खाका सदन में रखा था। मैं राष्‍ट्रपति जी के  अभिभाषण पर धन्‍यवाद देने के लिए आपके सामने उपसिथत हुआ और मैं उनका हृदय  से आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं।
इस चर्चा में आदरणीय श्री मल्लिकार्जुन जी, तारिक अनवर जी, श्री  जयप्रकाश नारायण जी, श्री तथागत जी, सतपति जी, कल्‍याण बनर्जी,  ज्योतिर्दित्य सिंधिया और कई वरिष्‍ठ महानुभावों ने चर्चा को प्राणवान  बनाया। कई पहलुओं को उजागर करने का प्रयास किया है। और मैं इसके लिए चर्चा  में सरीक होने वाले सभी आदरणीय सदस्‍यों का आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं।
कल भूकंप आया। इस भूकंप के कारण जिन-जिन क्षेत्रो में असुविधा हुई है,  मैं उनके प्रति अपनी भावना व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं और केंद्र सरकार राज्‍य के  पूरे संपर्क में है। स्थिति में कोई आवश्‍यकता है तो टीमें वहां पहुंच भी  गई हैं। लेकिन आखिर भूकंप आ ही गया! मैं सोच रहा था कि भूकंप आया कैसे?  क्‍योंकि धमकी तो बहुत पहले सुनी थी। कोई तो कारण होगा कि धरती मां इतनी  रूठ गई होगी।
आदरणीय अध्यक्षा जी, मैं सोच रहा था कि भूकंप आया क्‍यो, जब कोई Scam  में भी सेवा का भाव देखता है, Scam में भी नम्रता का भव देखता है तो सिर्फ  मां नहीं, धरती मां भी दुखी हो जाती है और तब जा करके भूकंप आता है।
और इसलिए राष्‍ट्रपति जी ने अपने अभिभाषण में जनशक्ति का ब्‍योरा दिया  है। हम यह जानते है कोई भी व्‍यवस्‍था लोकतांत्रिक हो या अलोकतांत्रिक हो,  जनशक्ति का मिजाज कुछ और ही होता है। कल हमारे मल्लिकार्जुन जी कह रहे थे  कि कांग्रेस की कृपा है कि अब भी लोकतंत्र बचा है और आप प्रधानमंत्री बन  पाए। वाह! क्‍या शेयर सुनाया है। बहुत बड़ी कृपा की आपने इस देश पर,  लोकतंत्र बचाया! कितने महान लोग है आप, लेकिन अध्‍यक्षा जी, उस पार्टी के  लोकतंत्र को देश भलीभांति जानता है। पूरा लोकतंत्र एक परिवार को आहूत कर  दिया गया है। और 75 का कालखंड माननीय अध्‍यक्षा जी 75 का कालखंड, जब देश पर  आपताकल थोप दिया गया था, हिंदुस्‍तान को जेलखाना बना दिया गया था, देश के  गणमान्‍य वरिष्‍ठ नेता जयप्रकाश बाबू समेत लाखों लोगों को जेल की सलाखों  में बंद कर दिया गया था। अखबारों पर ताले लगा दिए गए थे। और उन्‍हें अंदाजा  नहीं था कि जनशक्ति क्‍या होती है, लोकतंत्र को कुचलने के बाद ढेर सारे  प्रयासों के बावजूद भी इस देश की जनशक्ति का सामर्थ्‍य था कि लोकतंत्र पुन:  स्‍थापित हुआ और उस जनशक्ति की ताकत है कि गरीब मां का बेटा भी इस देश का  प्रधानमंत्री बन सकता है। और इसलिए राष्‍ट्रपति जी ने जनशक्ति का उललेख  करते हुए जो कहा है - चम्‍पारण सत्‍याग्रह शाताब्‍दी का वर्ष है। इतिहास  सिर्फ किताबो की अटारी में पड़ा रहे, तो समाज जीवन को प्रेरणा नहीं देता  है। हर युग में इतिहास को जानने का, इतिहास को जीने का प्रयास आवश्‍यक होता  है। उसमें हम थे या नहीं थे, हमारे कुत्‍ते भी थे या नहीं थे, औरों के  कुत्‍ते हो सकते हैं। हम कुत्‍तों वाली परंपरा से पले-बढ़े नहीं हैं। लेकिन  देश के कोटि-कोटि लोग थे, जब कांग्रेस पार्टी का जन्‍म भी नहीं हुआ था।  1857 का स्‍वतंत्रता संग्राम इस देश के लोगों ने जान की बाजी लड़ा करके  लड़ा था और सबने मिल करके लड़ा था। साम्‍प्रदाय की कोई भेद रेखा नहीं थी,  और तब भी कमल था, आज भी कमल है।
यहां बहुत ऐसे लोग हैं जो मेरी तरह आजादी के बाद पैदा हुए हैं, और इसलिए  हम में से बहुत लोग हैं जिनको आजादी की लड़ाई में सौभाग्‍य नहीं मिला,  लेकिन देश के लिए जीने का तो सौभाग्‍य मिला है। और हम जीने की कोशिश कर रहे  हैं।
माननीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, और इसलिए आपार जनशक्ति देश ने दर्शन किए हैं। लाल  बहादुर शस्‍त्री जी उनकी अपनी एक गर‍िमा थी। युद्ध के दिन थे, हर  हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी के दिल में भारत विजय के भाव से भरा हुआ माहौल था। और उस  समय जब लाल बहादुर शस्‍त्री जी ने कहा था देश ने अन्‍न त्‍याग के लिए पहल  की थी।
सरकार बनने के बाद आज के रानजीतिक वातावरण को हम जानते हैं। ज्‍यादातर  राज व्‍यवस्‍था उन राजनेताओं ने, राज सरकारों ने, केंद्र सरकारों ने जन  सामर्थ्‍य को करीब-करीब पहचानना छोड़ दिया है। और लोकतंत्र के लिए सबसे बड़ा  चिंता का विषय भी रहता है। मुझ जैसे सामान्‍य वयक्ति ने बातों-बातों में कह  दिया था कि जो afford कर सकते हैं, वो गेस की subsidy छोड़ दे। जब हम जनता  से कट जाते हैं, जन-मन से कट जाते हैं, 2014 में हम चुनाव लड़ रहे थे, तो  एक दल इस मुद्दे पर चुनाव लड़ रहा था कि नौ सिलेंडर देंगे या 12 सिलेंडर  देंगे। हमने आ करके 9 और 12 की चर्चा को कहां ले गए, हमने कहा कि जो afford  कर सकते हैं, वो subsidy छोड़ सकते हैं क्‍या? सिर्फ कहा था। इस देश के 1  करोड़ 20 लाख से ज्‍यादा लोग गेस subsidy छोड़ने के लिए आगे आए।
इस सरकार और वहां बैठे हुए लोगों के गर्व का विषय सीमित नहीं है यह। यह  सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की शक्ति का परिचायक है। और मैं इस सदन को  प्रार्थना करता हूं। राष्‍ट्रपति जी के उद्बोधन से प्रार्थना करता हूं,  राष्‍ट्रपति जी के उद्बोाधन के माध्‍यम से प्रार्थना करना चाहता हूं और देश  के राजनीतिक जीवन में निर्णायक की अवस्‍था में बैठे हुए निर्णय प्रक्रिया  के भागीदारी सबको आह्वाहन करता हूं कि हम हमारे देश जनशक्ति को पहचाने, उस  सामर्थ्‍य को पहचाने, हम भारत को नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाने के लिए जन-आंदोलन  की अवधारणा लेते हुए एक सकारात्‍मक माहौल बना करके, देश को आगे बढ़ाने की  दिशा में काम कर रहे हैं। देखिए पहले नहीं मिले उससे ज्‍यादा परिणाम  मिलेंगे।
और उसके कारण अनेक गुना ताकत बढ़ जाएगी। देश की बढ़ने वाली है। इसमें   से कोई ऐसा नहीं है कि जो आने वाला कल बुरा देखना चाहता था। इसमें से कोई  ऐसा नहीं है जो हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का बुरा चाहता था, हर कोई चाहता है गरीब का  भला हो। हर कोई चाहता है, गांव-गरीब किसान को कुछ मिले। पहले भी किसी ने  प्रयास नहीं किया था ऐसा कहने वालों में से मैं नहीं हूं। मैं इस सदन में  बार-बार कह चुका हूं। मैं लालकिले पर से बोल चुका हूं कि अब तब जितनी  सरकारें आईं, जितने प्रधानमंत्री आएं, हर किसी का अपना-अपना योगदान है।
उस तरफ बैठे हुए लोगों से कभी सुनने को मिला नहीं है कि इस देश में कोई  चापेकर बंधू भी हुआ करते थे, जिनकी शहादत थी आजादी में। इनके मुंह से सुनने  को नहीं मिला है, कभी सावकर जी भी थे, जो कालापानी की सजा भुगत रहे थे, तब  देश आजाद हुआ है। उनके मुंह से कभी सुनने को नहीं मिल रहा है, जो भगत  सिंह, चंद्रशेखर आजाद भी थे कि जिन्‍होंने देश के लिए बलि चढ़ा दी। उनके तो  लगता है कि आजादी सिर्फ एक परिवार ने दिलवाई है। समस्‍या की जड़ वहां है।        
हम देश को उसकी पूर्णता में स्‍वीकार करें और इसलिए जनशक्ति को जोड़ करके। हमारे यहां शास्‍त्रों में कहा गया है –
अमंत्रम अक्षरम् नास्ति। नास्ति मूलम् अनौषिधम्, अयोग्‍य पुरूषोनास्ति योजक: तत्र दुर्लभ:।
कोई अक्षर ऐसा नहीं होता है, जिसको मंत्र में जगह पाने का potential न  हो। कोर्ठ ऐसा मूल नहीं होता है, जिसकी औषध में जगह पाने का potential न  हो। कोई इंसान ऐसा न होता है कि जो कुछ करके समाज और देश को दे न सके।  जरूरत होती है योजक: तत्र दुर्लभ। योजक की जरूरत है। और इस संसार ने हर  शक्ति को संवार करके जोड़ने का एक प्रयास किया है। और जनशक्ति के भरोसे  उसके आगे बढ़ाने का प्रयास किया है।
स्‍वच्‍छता का अभियान, मैं हैरान हूं क्‍या इस बात के लिए हमें सोचना  नहीं चाहिए कि आजादी के इतने साल हो गए हैं। महात्‍मा गांधी का नाम हम लेते  हैं, गांधी के दो प्रिय चिन्‍ह् थे। गांधी कहते थे कि आजादी से पहले भी  अगर मुझे कुछ पाना है, तो मुझे स्‍वच्‍छता पानी है। हम स्‍वच्‍छता की गांधी  जी की बात को लेकर आपके सामने आए। देश के सामने आए। इतनी सरकारें आई, इतने  संसद चले सत्र। क्‍या कभी संसद में स्‍वच्‍छता विषय पर चर्चा हुई है। और  इसलिए पहली बार, यह सरकार आने के बाद, और इसलिए क्‍या स्‍वच्‍छता को भी हम  राजनीकि के एजेंडा का हिस्‍सा बनाएंगे। आप में से कौन है जो गंदगी में जीना  चहाता है? आपके इलाके में कौन है जो गंदगी चाहता है? आप भी नहीं चाहते  हैं, यहां वाले भी नहीं चाहते हैं, यहां वाले भी नहीं चाहते हैं। कोई नहीं  चाहता हैं। लेकिन क्‍या हम मिल करके एक स्‍वर में समाज को इस पवित्र कार्य  में जोड़ने को, गांधी जी के सपने को पूरा करने के लिए आगे नहीं बढ़ सकते।  कौन रोकता है?
और इसलिए माननीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, इस आपार जनशक्ति को आगे लेते हुए इस बार  एक चर्चा अब यह तो सही है कि जब राष्‍ट्रपति जी के उद्बोधन पर चर्चा होती  है और बजट भी आया होता है तो बजट की बातें भी आ जाती हैं और राष्‍ट्रपति जी  के उद्बोधन की बातें भी आ जाती हैं। बजट पर जब चर्चा होगी तो वित्‍तमंत्री  जी इसको विस्‍तार से कहेंगे, लेकिन एक चर्चा आई है, बजट जल्‍दी क्‍यों  किया? भारत एक कृषि प्रधान देश है। हमारा पूरा आर्थिक कारोबार कृषि पर  आधारित हैं। और ज्‍यादातर कृषि की स्थिति दिवाली तक पता चल जाती हैं। हमारे  देश की एक कठिनाई है कि हम अंग्रेज जो विरासत छोड़ करके आए, उसको ले करके  चल रहे हैं।
हम मई में करीब-करीब बजट की प्रक्रिया पार निकलते हैं। और एक जून के बाद  हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में बारिश आना शुरू हो जाता है। तीन महीने तक बजट का उपयोग  होना असंभव हो जाता है। एक प्रकार से हमारे पास कार्य करने का समय बहुत कम  बच जाता है। और जब समय होता है, तब आखिरी दिनों की जो पूर्ति करने के लिए   हम जानते हैं, सरकार जानती है कि दिसंबर से मार्च तक किस प्रकार से बिल  कटते हैं और किस प्रकार से रुपये खर्च किए दिखाए जाते हैं। अब यह हमने  सोचना चाहिए कि अब मैं किसी की आलोचना नहीं करता। अभी भी किसी को समझ में  आता है कि क्‍या कारण था कि आजादी के कई वर्षों तक बजट शाम को पांच बजे आता  था। किसी ने सोचा नहीं बस पांच बजे चल रहा है, चल रहा है। क्‍यों चल रहा  है भई। पांच बजे इसलिए बजट चलता था कि UK की पार्लियामेंट के हिसाब से  हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में अंग्रेजों के जमाने से शाम को पांच बजे बजट आया। अब हमने  उसको ही चालू रखा। और बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा। हम घड़ी ऐसे पकड़ते  हैं, तो Indian Time है, लेकिन घड़ी ऐसे पकड़ते हैं तो London Time है।  आपके पास घड़ी है तो देख लीजिए।
 
उसी प्रकार से... अब अटल जी की सरकार आई, तब समय बदला गया। हमारा भी  प्रयास है और जब आपकी सरकार थी, तब आप लोगों ने भी बजट के समय के संबंध में  एक कमिटी बनाई थी। उसका विस्‍तृत रिपोर्ट है। और आप भी चाहते थे कि अब यह  समय बदलना चाहिए। और उन्‍होंने जो proposal दी है, हमने उसी को पकड़ा है,  लेकिन आप लोग नहीं कर पाए। क्‍योंकि आपकी priority अलग है। आप चाहते नहीं  थे, ऐसा नहीं है। लेकिन उस priority में नंबर कब लगेगा। तो इसलिए जो बातें  आपके समय हुई हैं, उन बातों को यह बड़े गर्व से कहना चाहिए आपको, फायदा  उठाइये न, यह तो हमारे समय हुआ था। अब यह भी आप भूल जाते हैं, चलों मैंने  याद दिला दिया, आप इसका भी लाभ दीजिए।
रेलवे के संबंध में भी विस्‍तार से चर्चा जब बजट की होगी, लेकिन एक बात  समझिये कि 90 साल पहले जब रेल बजट आता थाा, तब transportation का एक प्रमुख  mode सिर्फ रेलवे था। आज transportation एक बहुत बड़ी अनिवार्यता बनी है और  इकलौता रेलवे नहीं है कई प्रकार के transportation के mode है। जब तक हम  comprehensively transport इस विषय को जोड़ करके नहीं चलेंगे, तो हम  समस्‍याओ से जूझते रहेंगे। और इसलिए मुख्‍य धारा में रेवले व्‍यवस्‍था भी  रहेगी। उसमें कोई privatization को कोई तकलीफ नहीं, उसके स्‍वतंत्रता को  कोई तकलीफ नहीं है। लेकिन सोचने के लिए सरकार एक साथ comprehensive, हर  प्रकार के mode of transport को देखना शुरू करे, यह आवश्‍यक है। और हमने,  जबसे आए हैं, हमने रेलवे में, बजट में बदलाव किया है।
आप जानते हैं कि पहले बजट में हमारे गौड़ा जी ने बताया था कि करीब 1500  घोषणाएं हुई थी और कौन मजबूत है, कौन हाऊस में ज्‍यादा परेशान करता है,  उसको ध्‍यान में रख करके, उसको खुश रख करके, एक-आध चीज बोल ही दी जाती थी।  वो भी ताली बजा देता था, अपने इलाके में जा करके बता देता था, यह काम हो  गया है। हमने देखा, 1500 ऐसी चीजें हुई थी, जिनका कागज़ पर भी मोक्ष हो गया  था, तो यह ऐसा हम क्‍यों करते हैं। मैं जानता हूं, इससे राजनीकि दृष्टि से  हमें नुकसान होता है। लेकिन किसी ने तो जिम्‍मा लेना पड़ेगा, देश में जो  गलत चीजें develop हो चुकी हैं, उसको हम रोके। और Bureaucracy को suit करता  है यह। ऐसी चीजें उनको suit करती है कि राजनेता ताली बजा दे, उनकी गाड़ी  चला दे। मुझे नहीं चलानी है जी।
देश के सामान्‍य मानव की आशाओं-आकांक्षाओं के लिए फैसले लेने है, अच्‍छे  फैसले लेने का प्रयास है। अच्‍छी तरह करने का प्रयास है। और इसलिए हम उस  दिशा में आगे बढ़ रहे हैं, हम इस काम को कर रहे हैं।
एक विषय नोटबंदी का आया है। पहले दिन से यह सरकार कह रही है हम नोटबंदी  पर चर्चा करने के लिए तैयार है, लेकिन आप लोगों को लगता था कि टीवी पर कतार  देखते हैं, तो कल कभी न कभी कुछ हो जाएगा, फिर देखेंगे। आपको लग रहा था कि  इस समय चर्चा करने से शायद मोदी फायदा उठा जाएगा। और इसलिए चर्चा की बजाय,  आपको TV bite देने में interest था। इसलिए चर्चा नहीं हुई। अच्‍छा है कि  इस बार आपने थोड़ा बहुत सपर्श किया है और कितना बड़ा बदलाव आया है। और मुझे  विश्‍वास है जो बारीकी से चीजों का अध्‍ययन करते हैं, अब तक उनका ध्‍यान  नहीं गया है तो मैं चाहूंगा कि उनका ध्‍यान जाए। 2014 के पहले का वक्‍त देख  लीजिए। 2014 मई के पहले का। वहां से आवाज़ उठती थी कि कोयले में कितना  खाया?  2G में कितना गया, जल करप्‍शन में कितना गया, वायु करप्‍शन में  कितना गया। आसमान के करप्‍शन में कितना गया। कितने लाख गए, यही वहां से  आवाज़ आती थी। यह मेरे लिए खुशी की खबर है कि जब वहां से आवाज़ आती थी,  मोदी जी कितना लाए, कितना लाए, कितना लाए। तब आवाज़ उठती थी कि कितना गया।  अब आवाज़ उठ रही है कितना लाए, इससे बड़ा जीवन का संतोष क्‍या हो सकता है।  यही तो सही कदम है।
दूसरा हमारे खड़गे जी ने कहा कि कालाधन हीरे-जवाहरात में है, सोने में  है, चांदी में है, property में है। मैं आपकी बात से सहमत है लेकिन यह सदन  जानना चाहता है, यह ज्ञान आपको कब हुआ। क्‍योंकि इस बात का कोई इंकार नहीं  कर सकता है कि भ्रष्‍टाचार का प्रारंभ नकद से होता है। उसकी शुरूआत नकद से  होती है। परिणाम में Property होती है, परिणाम में Jewelry होती है, परिणाम  में Gold होता है। शुरूआत नकद से होती है। दूसरा आपको मालूम है कि यही  बुराईयों के केंद्र में है। बेनामी Property है, जवाहरात है, Gold है,  चांदी है, जरा आप लोग बताइये 1988 में जब श्रीमान राजीव गांधी देश के  प्रधानमंत्री थे, पंडित नेहरू से भी ज्‍यादा बहुमत इस सदन में आपके पास था,  दोनों सदन में आपके पास था। पंचायत से पार्लियामेंट तक सब कुछ आपके कब्‍जे  में था। आप ही आप थे, कोई नहीं था।
1988 में आपने बेनामी संपत्ति का कानून बनाया। आपको जो ज्ञान आज हुआ है,  क्‍या कारण था कि 26 साल तक उस कानून को notify नहीं किया गया? क्‍या कारण  था, उसको दबोचकर रखने का। अगर उस समय notify किया होता, तो जो ज्ञान आज  आपको हुआ है। 26 साल पहले की स्थिति थोड़ी ठीक थी। देश के बहुत जल्‍दी  साफ-सुथरा होने की दिशा में, एक काम कम हो जाता। वो कौन लोग थे, जिनको  कानून बनने के बाद ज्ञान हुआ कि अब कानून दबाने में फायदा है। वो किस  परिवार.. आप इससे बच नहीं सकते, आप किसी का नाम दे करके आप बच नहीं सकते।  आपको जवाब देना पड़ेगा देश को। जो ज्ञान आज हुआ है और यह सरकार है, जिसने  नोटबंदी से पहले, पहला कदम उनके खिलाफ उठाया। और मैं आज इस सदन के माध्‍यम  से भी देशवासियों को कहना चाहता हूं, आप कितने ही बड़े क्‍यों न हों, गरीब  के हक का आपको लौटना पड़ेगा। और मैं इस रास्‍ते से पीछे लौटने वाला नहीं  हूं। मैं गरीबों के लिए लड़ाई लड़ रहा हूं, और गरीबों के लिए लड़ाई लड़ता  रहूंगा। इस देश के गरीबी के मूल में, इस देश में गरीबी के मूल में, देश की  पाथ-पाथ प्राकृतिक सम्‍पदा की कमी नहीं थी, देश के पास मानव संसाधनों की  कमी नहीं थी, लेकिन देश में एक ऐसा वर्ग पनपा, जिन्‍होंने लोगों के हक  लूटते रहे, उसी का नतीजा है कि देश जिस ऊंचाई पर पहुंचना चाहिए था, नहीं  पहुंच पाया।
एक बात मैं कहना चाहूंगा, हम यह जानते हैं कि अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था को इस बात  को कोई इंकार नहीं कर सकता है, एक सामान्‍तर अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था develop हुई  थी। और ऐसा नहीं है ये काम भी आपके संज्ञान में पहले भी आया था। ये विषय आप  ही की सरकार की, आप की कमेटियों ने भी आपको सुझाया था। जब इंदिरा जी राज  करती थी तब यसवंतराव जी चौहान यह विषय ले करके उनके पास गए थे। और तब जा  करके उन्‍होंने कहा था कि क्‍यों भाई कांग्रेस को चुनाव नहीं लड़ने का।  आपको निर्णय गलत नहीं था, चुनाव का डर था। हमें चुनाव की चिंता नहीं है,  देश की चिंता है, इसलिए हम निर्णय लिए। इसलिए हम निर्णय लिए। और यह बात  निश्चित है कोई इंकार नहीं कर सकता है, कि कोई भी व्‍यवस्‍था में ‘कैश  कितना, cheque को ना’, यह कारोबार develop हो चुका है। और एक प्रकार से  जीवन का हिस्‍सा बना है, जब तक आप उसको गहरी चोट नहीं लगाओगे तब तक स्थिति  से बाहर नहीं आओगे और इसलिए हमने जो फैसले किए हैं।
आपने किस प्रकार से देश चलाया है, ऐसा लगता है कि कुछ दलों के  दिलों-दिमाग में चार्वाक का मंत्र उनके जिंदगी में बहुत काम आ गया है।  उन्‍होंने चार्वाक के ही मंत्र को लेकर ही शायद और तभी जा करके कोई देश  अंग्रेजी कवि के उल्‍लेख करते हुए यह भी कह देते थे बड़े-बड़े व्‍यक्ति कि  मरने के बाद क्‍या है! क्‍या देखा है! अभी तो चार्वाक का तत्व-ज्ञान है।  मैं उस सदन में जाऊंगा तब इसका उल्‍लेख detail में करूंगा, लेकिन चार्वाक  कहते थे:
यवज्‍जीवेत्, सुखम् जीवेत्।
ऋणम् ऋित्‍वा, घ्रितम् पिबेत्।।
भस्मिभूतस्‍य देहस्‍य।
पुनार्गमनम् कुत:?
 
जब तक जियो मौज करो। जियो, जब तक जियो मौज करो। चिंता किस बात की कर्ज  करो, और घी उस जमाने में यह संस्कार थे इसलिए घी कहा, भाई भगवंत मान नहीं  तो और कुछ पीनो को कहते।  लेकिन उस समय ऋषियों ने, महा-संस्‍कार थे,  उन्‍होंने घी कि शायद आज का जमाना होता तो कुछ और पीने की  चर्चा करनी  पड़ती।  लेकिन इस प्रकार की philosophy से कुछ लोगों को लगता है कि जब  अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था अच्‍छी चल रही थी तो आपने ऐसे समय,  ऐसा निर्णय क्‍यों‍  किया? यह बात सही है। आप जानते हैं अगर आपको कोई बीमारी हो और डॉक्‍टर कहता  है कि operation करना है, operation बहुत जरूरी है फिर भी वह कहता है,  पहले भाई आपको शरीर ठीक करना पड़ेगा। Diabetes control करना पड़ेगा,  ठिगना  control करना पड़ेगा, सात-आठ-बीस और मशवरा, फिर बाद में operation करेगा।  जब तक वह स्‍वस्‍थ नहीं होता है, operation करना पसंद नहीं करता है  डॉक्‍टर, कितनी भी गंभीर स्थिति हो। Demonetisation के लिए यह समय इतना  पर्याप्‍त था कि देश की अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था तंदुरुस्‍त थी। अगर दुर्बल होती, हम  यह कतई सफलतापूर्वक नहीं कर पाते। यह तब सफल होता है, ताकि अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था  मजबूत थी और इसी समय।
दूसरा इसका समय, ऐसा मत सोचिए कि हड़बड़ी में होता है। इसके लिए मोदी का  अध्‍ययन करना पड़ेगा आपको। और आप देखिए हमारे देश में साल भर में जितना  व्‍यापार होता है, करीब-करीब उतना ही व्‍यपार दीवाली के दिनों में हो जाता  है। यानी 50% दीवाली के दिनों में, 50% साल भर में। एक प्रकार से पूरा  उद्योग व्‍यापार, किसानी सब काम दिवाली के पास उसकी Peek पर पहुंच जाता है।  उसके बाद natural lull period हमारे देश में हमेशा होता है। दीवाली के बाद  दुकानदार भी 15-15  दिन बंद रख करके बाहर चले जाते हैं, लोग भी अपने आप  घूमने जाते हैं। यह proper time  था कि जबकि सामान्‍य कारोबार ऊंचाई पर  पहुंच गया है उसके बाद अगर 15-20 दिन दिक्‍कत होती है और फिर 50 दिन में  ठीक-ठाक हो जाएगा और मैं देख रहा हूं जो मैंने हिसाब-किताब कहा था, उसी  प्रकार से गाड़ी चल रही है।
और इसलिए आप यह भी जानते हैं, आप यह जानते हैं, एक जमाना था, Income Tax  Department की मन-मर्जी पर..एक समय था जब देश में Income Tax अधिकारी  मन-मर्जी पड़े वहां जा करके धमकते थे और बाकी क्‍या होता था पुराना इतिहास  कुछ भी दोहराने की जरूरत नहीं है।
नोटबंदी के बाद सारी चीजें record पर है। कहां से आया, किसने लाया, कहां  रखा। अब उसमें से top नामों को technology के द्वारा, data-mining के  द्वारा निकाल दिए गए हैं। अब Income Tax Office को जाना नहीं है सिर्फ SMS  करके पूछना है भाई कि जरा बताई कि detail क्‍या है? आप देखिए किसी भी  प्रकार का अफसर-शाही के बिना जिसको भी मुख्‍य धारा में आना है, उसके लिए एक  अवसर प्राप्‍त हो चुका है। और में मानता हूं इससे बहुत Clean India, जैसे  ‘स्‍वच्‍छ भारत’ का मेरा अभियान चल रहा है, वैसा ही आर्थिक जीवन में  ‘स्‍वच्‍छ भारत अभियान’ भी बहुत तेजी से आगे बढ़ रहा है।
और बेनामी संपत्ति का कानून पास हो चुका है, notify हो चुका है। और जैसा  खड्गे जी ने कहा वहीं पर सबकुछ है। अच्‍छा सुझाव आपने दिया है। हम भी कुछ  करके दिखाएंगे। और जो भी सुन रहे हैं वो भी समझें और उसके प्रावधान बढ़ लें  कि कितना बड़ा कठोर कानून है, जिसके पास भी बेनामी संपत्ति है उनसे मेरा  आग्रह है अपने Charted Accountant से जरा पूछ लें कि आखिर के प्रावधान  क्‍या है? और इसलिए मेरा सबसे आग्रह है कि मुख्‍यधारा में आईये देश के  गरीबों का भला करने के लिए आप भी कुछ contribute  कीजिए।
जहां-जहां कभी-कभी लगता है कि यह निर्णय अचानक हुआ क्‍या। मैं जरा  जानकारी देना चाहता हूं, जिस दिन हमारी सरकार बनी, सबसे पहला काम किया  कैबिनेट में, SIT बनाई। सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने कहा था लंबे अरसे तक लटका पड़ा था  कि विदेश के कालेधन के लिए SIT बनाओ। हमने बनाई, सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने कहा था  उस प्रकार बनाई। और सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने क्‍या कहा था: 26 March, 2014,  Since  1947 for 65 Years  nobody thought of bringing the money stays away in  the Foreign Banks to the country. The Government has failed in its role  for 65 Years. This Court feels that you have failed in your duty. So is  the given order for the appointment of committee headed by the former  judges of this Court. Three years have passed, but you have not done  anything to implement the order. What have you done? Except for filing  one report you have done nothing.
यह 24 मार्च, 2014 को सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने उस सरकार को कहा है। वहीं तो मैं  कह रहा था वो जमाना तब आवाज उठती थी कि कितना गया। अब आवाज उठ रही है कि  कितना आया और आते रहेगा। आप देखिए एक के बाद एक, एक बाद एक देखिए विदेश में  जमा कालेधन के खिलाफ नया कठोर कानून बनाया। प्रोपर्टी जब्‍त करने की बात  कही। इस बार भी बजट में एक नया कानून कही गई है। सजा भी 7 साल से 10 साल कर  दी। Tax Havens जो थे मॉरीशस, सिंगापुर वगैरा उस पुराने जो नियम आप बना  करके गये थे, उसको हमने बातचीत की। उनको समझाया, हमारी परिस्थितियां  समझायी। उसको हम ले आये। हमने स्विटजरलैंड से समझौता किया। वो real-time  information देंगे। कोई भी हिन्‍दुस्‍तानी नागरिक पैसा रखेगा तो उसका पता  चल जाएगा। हमने अमेरिका सहित कई देशों के साथ इस प्रकार के समझौते किए हैं,  जहां पर हमारा कोई भी भारतीय नागरिक, भारतीय मूल का व्‍यक्ति पैसे रखेगा,  तो उसकी जानकारी भारत को मिलेगी।
उसी प्रकार से प्रोपर्टी बिक्री, 20 हजार से ज्‍यादा नकद नहीं, इसके  चलते हमने नियम किया। Real-Estate Bill को पास किया। ज्‍वैलरी के मार्केट  में भी 1% Excise डाली ताकि चीजों को streamline करना था। किसी को परेशान  नहीं करना था।
और आप ही लोग हैं। इस देश सदन में इधर हो या उधर हो। मुझे चिट्ठियां आई  हैं, जब हमने कहा कि दो लाख से ज्‍यादा कोई अगर Jewelry purchase करता है,  तो उसके PAN Number देना होगा। मैं हैरान हूं, कालेधन और भ्रष्‍टाचार के  खिलाफ भाषण देने वाले लोग मुझे चिट्ठियां लिखते थे कि PAN Number मांगने का  नियम रद्द कर दीजिए, ताकि लोग cash money से सोना लेते रहें, गहने लेते  रहें और काला बाजार चलता रहे। हम टिके रहे, उसको करके दिखाया, एक-एक कदम  उठाया। मैं जानता हूं राजनीतिक फायदे के लिए कोई काम ऐसा नहीं कर सकता,  वरना तो आप पहले कर लेते। यह कठिनाई है, लेकिन देश का भला करने के लिए  निणर्य करने दे और गरीबों का भला करना था, इसलिए निर्णय किया।
दो लाख से ज्‍यादा किसी सामान पर, दस लाख से ज्‍यादा महंगी गाड़ी पर 1%  अतिरिक्‍त टैक्‍स लगा दिया। हमने Income Text declaration scheme भी लाई।  और अब तक इस scheme में सबसे ज्‍यादा पैसा लोगों ने declare किया। 1100 से  ज्‍यादा पुराने काननू हमने खत्‍म किये। और यहां बताया गया कि आपने नोटबंदी  के संबंध में कोई कहता है 150 बार, कोई कहता है 130 बार, वह सब अलग-अलग  आंकड़े बोल रहे हैं, इतने नियम बदले। बहुत अच्‍छा याद रखते हैं।
अब मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूं यह तो ऐसा काम था, जिसमें हम जनता की कोई  तकलीफ तुरंत समझने के बाद रास्‍ता खोजने का प्रयास करते थे। दूसरा, जिन  लोगों को सालों से लूटने की आदत लगी है, वो रास्‍ता खोजते थे, तो हमें बंद  करने के लिए कुछ न कुछ करना पड़ता था। लड़ाई का मौसम था। एक तरफ देश को  लूटने वाले थे, और एक तरफ देश को ईमानदारी की तरफ ले जाने की तरफ ले जाने  का मोर्चा लगा हुआ था। लड़ाई पल-पल चल रही थी। वो एक तू डाल-डाल मैं  पात-पात इस प्रकार से लड़ाई चल रही थी। लेकिन जो आप लोगों का बड़ा प्रिय  कार्यक्रम है, जिसको ले करके आप बड़ी पीठ थपथपा रहे हैं। वैसे उसके लिए आपको  हक नहीं हैं, क्‍योंकि जब इस देश पर राजा-रजवाड़ों का शासन था, तब भी  गरीबों के लिए राहत नाम से योजनाएं चलती थीं। उसके बाद भी हिन्‍दुस्‍तान  में Food for work के नाम से कई योजनाएं। देश आजाद होने के बाद नौ प्रकार  से अलग-अलग नामों से चली हुई योजना चलते-चलते-चलते उसने एक नाम लिया, जिसको  MGNREGA कहते हैं। कई यात्रा करके आया हूं और हर राज्‍य में जहां  कम्‍युनिस्‍टों की सरकार थी उन्‍होंने भी पश्चिम बंगाल में  किया था, जहां  शरद पवार की सरकार थी, महाराष्‍ट्र में किया था। गुजरात में भी जो कांग्रेस  की सरकार थी.. हर देश में किसी न किसी ने आजादी के बाद इस प्रकार के काम  किए ही किए थे। हर किसी ने किए थे, तो वो कोई नई चीज नहीं थी, लेकिन नाम  नया था। लेकिन देश को और आपको खुद को भी जान करके आशचर्य होगा कि शांत रूप  से इतने सालों से चली हुई योजना के बाद भी MGNREGA में 1035 बार परिवर्तन  किए हैं। 1035 बार, नियम बदले गए। आप कभी अपने तो आइने में झांक करके तो  देखिए। और उसमें तो लड़ाई नहीं थी। इतने बड़े दबाव में काम करना नहीं था।  क्‍या कारण था कि MGNREGA जैसा एक, जो लम्‍बे अर्से से चल रहा था। उसको भी  आपको आने के बाद 1035 बार परिवर्तन करना पड़ा। और इसलिए नियमों में  परिवर्तन किया। Act एक बार हो गया। Act 1035 बार परिवर्तित नहीं हुआ है।
और इसलिए मैं कहना चाहूंगा, आज मुझे आपको काका हाथरसी की कविता के शब्‍द  सुनाता हूं और मैं काका हाथरसी को याद करता हूं, तो कोई उत्‍तर प्रदेश के  चुनाव के साथ न जोड़े। क्‍योंकि उनके हर चुनाव में काका हाथरसी की बातें  चलती रहती थी। काका हाथरसी ने कहा था –
अंतर पट्ट में खोजिये, छिपा हुआ है खोट और काका हाथरसी ने आगे कहा है ‘मिल जायेगी आपको, बिल्‍कुल सत्‍य रिपोर्ट।’
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, मैं एक बात की ओर भी ध्‍यान देना चाहता हूं, सरकार  नियमों से चलती है, संविधानिक जिम्‍मेदारियों के साथ चलती है। जो नियम  आपके लिए थे, वो नियम हमारे लिए भी हैं। लेकिन फर्क कार्य संस्‍कृति का  होता है। नीतियों की ताकत भी नियत से जुड़ी हुई होती है। अगर नियत में खोट  है तो नीतियों की ताकत माइनस में चली जाती है, जीरो छोड़ो, माइनस में चली  जाती है और इसलिए हमारे देश में उस कार्य संस्‍कृति को भी समझने की जरूरत  है। जब भी हम कुछ बोलते हैं यहां से यह तो हमारे समय था, यह तो हमारे समय  था। तो मुझे लग रहा है मैं ही उसी पर खेलूं थोड़ा। आपके मैदान में खेलने  आना पसंद करूंगा मैं। और इसलिए ऐसा क्‍यों हुआ। ऐसा तो नहीं है कि आपको  ज्ञान नहीं था। आपको ज्ञान कल ही हुआ ऐसा थोड़ा हुआ। आपको जानकारी थी,  लेकिन महाभारत में कहा इस प्रकार से–
‘जानामि धर्मम् न च मे प्रवृति: ‘जानामि अधर्मम् न च मे निवृत्ति: ।
धर्म क्‍या है? यह तो आप जानते हैं, लेकिन वो आपकी प्रवृत्ति नहीं थी।  अधर्म क्‍या है वो भी जानते थे, लेकिन उसे छोड़ने का आपको सामर्थ्‍य नहीं  था। मैं बताता हूं जी, अब मुझे कहिए – National Optical Fiber Network अगर  मैं उसके लिए कुछ भी कहूंगा, तो वहां से आवाज़ उठ आई यह तो हमने शुरू किया  था। मैं हमने शुरू किया था, उसी से शुरू करना चाहता हूं। अब देखिए National  Optical Fiber Network, 2011 से 14 तीन साल सिर्फ 59 गांव में यह Optical  Fiber Network लगा और उसमें भी last mile connectivity का प्रावधान नहीं  था। Procurement भी पूरी तरह centralized था, वो तो क्‍या कारण है सब जानते  हैं। अब आप देखिए, हमने ..पूरी कार्य संस्‍कृति कैसे बदलती हैं, approach  कैसे बदलता है। सबसे सब राज्‍यों को पहले साथ लिया। Last mile connectivity  मतलब स्‍कूल में Optical Fiber Network मिलना चाहिए, अस्‍पताल में मिलना  चाहिए, पंचायत घर में मिलना चाहिए। इन प्राथमिकताओं को तय किया।  Procurement क्‍या था, वो भारत सरकार के हाथ से रख करके हमने उसको  decentralized कर दिया। और परिणाम यह आया कि इतने कम समय में अब तक 76000  गांवो में  Optical Fiber Network, last mile connectivity के साथ पूरा हो  गया।
दूसरा, अभी यहां बताया जा रहा था कल कि आप less-cash society या  cash-less society के लिए बोल रहे हैं। लोगों के पास क्‍या हैं? मोबाइल..  मैं हैरान हूं, मैं तो 2007 के बाद से जितनी चुनाव सभाएं सुनी हैं आपके  नेता गांव-गावं जा करके कहते हैं कि राजीव गांधी computer revolution लाएं,  राजीव गांधी mobile phone लाए, राजीव गांधी ने गांव-गांव connectivity कर  दी। आप ही का भाषण है और जब मैं आज कह रहा हूं कि उस मोबाइल का उपयोग bank  में भी convert किया जा सकता है, तो कह रहे हैं कि mobile phone ही कहां  हैं। यह समझ नहीं आ रहा है भई। आप कह रहे हैं कि हमने इतना कर दिया और जब  मैं उसमें कुछ अच्‍छा जोड़ रहा हूं, तो कह रहे हैं कि वो तो है ही नहीं भई।  तो यह क्‍या समझा रहे थे आपको जी। क्‍यों ऐसा कर रहे हो ?  दूसरी बात है कि  आप भी मानते हैं, मैं भी मानता हूं कि पूरे देश के पास सब नहीं हैं। लेकिन  मान लो कि अगर 40%  के पास है, तो क्‍या उन 40% लोगों को इस आधुनिक  व्‍यवस्‍था से जोड़ने की दिशा हम सबका सामूहिक प्रयत्‍न रहना चाहिए कि नहीं  रहना चाहिए? 60%  का चलो बाद में देखेंगे। कहीं तो शुरू करें और इसका लाभ  है digital currency को हम कम न आंके। आज हमारा एक-एक ATM,  उसका संभालने  के लिए average पांच पुलिस वाले लगते हैं। Currency को एक से दूसरे जगह ले  जाने के लिए सब्‍जी और दूध के mobilization के लिए जितना खर्चा होता है,  उससे ज्‍यादा उसके mobilization से खर्चा होता है। अगर हम इस बातों को  समझें तो, जो कर सकते हैं, सब नहीं कर पाएंगे, हम समझ सकते हैं, लेकिन जो  कर सकते हैं, उनको करने के लिए प्रोत्‍साहित करना यह नेतृत्‍व का काम होता  है, किसी भी दल का हो, उससे लोगों का भला होने वाला है। अभी मुझे कोई बता  रहा था एक सब्‍जी वाले ने शुरू किया। कल कोई मुझे रिपोर्ट दे करके गया।  उसको पूछा तेरा क्‍या फायदा है। बोले साहब पहले क्‍या होता था एक तो मेरे  ग्राहक Permanent थे। सबको मैं जानता था। अब मान लीजिए 52 Rupees का सब्‍जी  लिया तो फिर वो मैडम कहती थी कि चल जेबों में पैसे नहीं है, 50 रूपये का  नोट है ले लो, तो मेरे दो रूपये चले जाते थे। अब मैं भी बोल नहीं पाता था  और बोलने में लगाता था हिसाब तो साल भर में मेरा आठ सौ, हजार रूपया, ये  रूपया दो रूपया न देने में ही हो जाता था। बोले इसके बाद BHIM App लगाने के  बाद 52 रूपया है तो 52 रूपया मिलता है। 53 रूपया है तो 53 मिलता है। 48  Rupees, 45 पैसा है तो पूरा मिलता है। बोले मेरा तो आठ सौ हजार रूपया बच  गया।
देखिए चीजें कैसे बदलती हैं और इसलिए हम कम से कम आप मोदी का विरोध  करें, कोई बात नहीं आपका काम भी है, करना भी चाहिए। लेकिन जो अच्‍छी चीजें  है उसको आगे बढ़ाएं। जहां मान लीजिए गांव में नहीं है। शहरों में है तो आगे  तो बढ़ाओं, उसको योगदान करो, देश का भला होगा। हमको और किसी व्‍यक्ति का  भला नहीं है और इसलिए मैं आग्रह करूंगा कि ऐसी चीजों में हम मदद कर सकते  हैं, तो करनी चाहिए।
कार्य और संस्‍कृति कैसे बदलती है। अब ये रोड बनाना क्‍या हमारे आने के  बाद हुआ क्‍या। ये टोडरमल्ल के जमाने से चल रहा है। शेरशाह सूरी के जमाने  से चल रहा है, तो यह कहना कि ये तो हमारे जवाने से था, हमारे जमाने से था।  अब कहां-कहां जाओगे भाई। फर्क क्‍या है पिछली सरकार में प्रधानमंत्री  ग्रामीण सड़क योजना प्रति दिन 69 किलोमीटर होती थी। हमारे आने के बाद 111  किलोमीटर हो गयी है, यह फर्क होता है।
और और हमने रोड बनाने में Space Technology का उपयोग किया है। Space  Technology से photography होती है, monitoring होता है। हमने रेलवे में  Drone का उपयोग किया है। photography करते हैं, काम का हिसाब लेते हैं।  कार्य संस्‍कृति Technology की मदद से कैसे बदलाव लाया जा सकता है।
आवास योजना, ग्रामीण आवास योजना, राजनीतिक फायदा उठाने के लिए नामों को  जोड़ करके उसका जो उपयोग हुआ, वो हुआ। लेकिन फिर भी आपके समय में एक साल  में, 1083000 घर बनते थे। इस सरकार में एक वर्ष में 2227000 घर बने।  National Urban Renewal Mission एक महीने में 8017 घर बने। हमारी योजना से  13530 घर बने हैं।
रेलवे- पहले Broad Gauge Railway का commissioning एक साल में 1500  किलोमीटर हुआ करता था। पिछले साल यह बढ़ करके 1500 किलोमीटर से सामने 3000  किलोमीटर, double और हम 3500 किलोमीटर तक और इसलिए यह परिणाम अचानक नहीं  आए। योजनाबद्ध तरीके से, हर पल, हर चीज का monitor करते-करते यही लोग, यही  कानून, यही मुलाजि़म, यही फाइल, यही माहौल उसके बाद भी बदलाव लाने में तेज  गति से आगे बढ़ रहें हैं। और यह अचानक नहीं होता है।
इसके लिए पुरूषार्थ करना पड़ता है और इसलिए हमारे शास्‍त्रों में कहा गया है –
उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः ।
न हि सुप्तस्य सिंहस्य प्रविशन्ति मुखे मृगाः ।।
उद्यम से ही कार्य सिद्ध हाते हैं, न कि मनोरथो से, सोये हुए सिंह के  मुख में हिरण आ करके प्रवेश नहीं करता है, उसको भी शिकार करना पड़ता है।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा महोदया, कुछ मूलभूत परिवर्तन कैसे आते हैं। हम जानते  हैं कि राज्‍यों के Electricity Board- DISCOM  सारे राज्‍य संकट में हैं।  तभी तो हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में लालकिले पर से इसकी चिंता की गई थी प्रधानमंत्री  के द्वारा। इतनी हद तक यह हालत बिगड़ी हुई थी। पिछले दो साल में बिजली  उत्पादन में क्षमता बढ़ी। Conventional Energy उसको जोड़ा गया।  Transmission line उसको बढ़ाया गया, Solar Energy को लाया गया। 2014 में  2700 मेगावाट थी, आज हम उसको 9100 मेगावाट पहुंचा दिए हैं। सबसे बड़ी बात,  DISCOM योजना के कारण, उदय योजना के तहत राज्‍यों को उस योजना जब वो सफल कर  पाएंगे करीब-करीब 1 करोड़ 60 हजार से ज्‍यादा रकम राज्‍यों की तिजौरी में  बचने वाली है और राज्‍यों के साथ जोड़ करके अगर भारत सरकार ने 1 करोड़ 60  हजार की घोषणा कर दी होती, तो चारों तरफ कहते कि वाह, मोदी सरकार ने इतना  पैसा दिया। हमने योजना ऐसी बनाई कि राज्‍यों के खजानों में 1 लाख 60 हजार  करोड़ रुपया DISCOM के द्वारा, उदय योजना के द्वारा बचत होने वाली है, जो  उनके लिए विकास के काम आने वाली है और ऊर्जा क्षेत्र का जो बोझ है उस बोझ  से वो बचने वाले हैं।
कोयला- आप जानते हैं कोयला जहां से निकलता है, उसके नज़दीक नहीं दिया  जाता था। दूर-दूर से देखा, क्‍यों? तो बोले रेलवे को थोड़ा कमाई हो जाए।  हमने कहा कमाल हो भई, रेलवे की कमाई के लिए इतना सारा बोलते हैं,  हमने  rationalize कर दिया, जहां नजदीक है उसी को वहां से कोयला मिलेगा, कोयले का  खर्चा हो, उस दिशा में प्रयास किया और उसके कारण करीब-करीब कायेले में  1300 करोड़ रुपये transportation खर्च कम हुआ है।
LED Bulb- अब यह तो हम नहीं कहते कि हम LED Bulb लाए। वैज्ञानिक शोध  हुई, आपने भी शुरू किया। लेकिन आपके समय वो LED Bulb करीब तीन सौ, साढ़े  तीन सौ, तीन सौ अस्‍सी उस रुपये में चलते थे। LED Bulb से energy saving  होता है हमने बड़ा mission रूप में काम उठाया और करीब-करीब इतने कम समय में  पिछले आठ-नौ महीने में इस योजना को बल दिया है। इतने कम समय में 21 करोड़  LED Bulb लगाने में हमने सफलता पाई है और तेज गति से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। और  अब तक जो LED Bulb लगे हैं उसके कारण परिवारों में जो बिजली का बिल आता था,  वो जो बिजली का बिल कम हुआ है, वो परिवारों में करीब-करीब 11000 करोड़  रुपयों की बचत हुई है। अगर किसी सरकार ने बजट में 11000 करोड़ बिजली  उपभोक्‍ताओं को देने का तय किया होता, तो अखबारों में Head-Line बनती। हमने  LED Bulb लगाने मात्र से 11000 करोड़ बिजली का बिल सामान्‍य मानव के घर  में कम किया है। कार्य संस्‍कृति अलग होती है, तो कैसा परिवर्तन आता है  इसका यह नमूना है।
यहां पर हमारे विपक्ष के नेता Scheduled  Casts के बजट को ले करके भाषण  कर रहे थे। लेकिन बड़ी चतुराई पूर्वक 13-14 के आंकड़ों को उन्‍होंने बोलना  अच्‍छा नहीं माना। तुक्‍का लगाते थे 13-14 आता था अटक जाते थे। Scheduled   Casts Sub-Plan कुल आवंटन 2012-13- 37113; 13-14- 41561; 16-17- 38833;  16-17 – 40920, 33.7% Increase और इस साल के बजट में 52393; और इसलिए सत्‍य  सुनने के लिए हिम्‍मत चाहिए एक और मैं काम बताना चाहता हूं, ये सरकार  भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ने वाली सरकार है। भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ  लड़ाई लड़ने के समय किस प्रकार से काम किए जाते हैं।
17 मंत्रालय के 84 योजनाएं, हमने Direct Benefit Transfer AADHAR योजना  के साथ जोड़ करके उसको आगे किया और 32 करोड़ लोगों को 1 लाख 56 हजार करोड़  रूपया  Direct Benefit Transfer स्‍कीम में दिया गया। अब उससे क्‍या लाभ  हुआ है, और इसको समझना होगा कि किस प्रकार से हर गली-मौहल्‍ले में चोरी लूट  की व्‍यवस्‍था रही थी। और मैं जानता हूं इतनी बारीकी से हर जगह पर चोरी  लूट को रोकूंगा तो मेरे पर कितना तूफान होगा। और तब जा करके मैंने गोवा में  बोला था कि मैं जानता हूं मैं ऐसे निर्णय करता हूं। मेरे पर क्‍या बीतेगी।  मेरे को मालूम है। आज भी मालूम है। और इसमें दोबारा कहता हूं ऐसे-ऐसे बड़े  लोगों को तकलीफ हो रही है और ज्‍यादा होने वाली है। उसके कारण मुझे अंदाजा  है मुझ पर क्‍या जुल्‍म होने वाले हैं। उसके लिए तैयार हूं। क्‍योंकि देश  के लिए, मैंने यह प्रण ले करके निकला हुआ इंसान हूं और इसलिए मैं कदम उठा  रहा हूं।
PAHAL योजना हमारे यहां गैस सिलेंडर जाते थे, सब्सिडी मिलती थी, जब उसको  आप AADHAR योजना से जोड़ा तो उसका leakage  करीब-करीब 26 हजार करोड़ रूपये  से ज्‍यादा leakages रूका, जिसका परिणाम यह आया कि डेढ़ करोड़ गरीब  परिवारों को गैस का कनेक्‍शन देने हम सफल हुए हैं। आप जरा अध्‍ययन कर लीजिए  मैं जब सदन में बोलता हूं तो जिम्‍मेवारी के साथ बोलता हूं। पिछले ढाई  वर्षों में, फर्जी राशनकार्ड, गरीब आदमी के हक छीनने का काम, फर्जी  राशनकार्ड वाले करते थे। गरीब को जो मिलना चाहिए उसको बिचौलिए अपने यहॉं  फर्जी राशन कार्ड के ठप्‍पे रखते थे और माल चुरा लेते थे और कालेबाजारी में  बेचते थे जब से हमने Technology का उपयोग किया AADHAR का उपयोग किया  करीब-करीब 4 करोड़, 3 करोड़ 95 लाख, करीब-करीब चार करोड़ फर्जी राशन कार्ड  पकड़े गए, उससे करीब-करीब 14 हजार करोड़, 14 हजार करोड़ इतनी रकम बिचौलिए  मार खाते थे, गरीब के हक का मार खाते थे, वो मुख्‍य धारा में आया और गरीबों  की तरफ गया।
MGNREGA- MGNREGA में AADHAR से payment दिया जाता है, direct transfer  पैसा होता है करीब 94% success मिली है। और उसका परिणाम ये हुआ है कि  leakages 7633 Crore Rupees, उसका leakage अब तक बच पाया है और ये हर वर्ष  एक का वर्ष नहीं आने वाले हर वर्ष में बचने वाला है।
और आगे भी जो है National Social Assisting Programme (NSAP) करीब-करीब  400 करोड़ रूपया है जिसका कोई लेनदार नहीं मिल रहा है, लेकिन पैसे जाते थे  कुछ तो ऐसी चीजें पायी गयीं जिस बेटी का जन्‍म नहीं हु,आ वो बेटी विधवा भी  हो गयी और खजाने से धन भी जा रहा है। इन सब को रोकने की कार्य संस्‍कृति को  ले करके हम चले हैं। Scholarship, ऐसे कई चीजें हैं एक मोटा-मोटा अंदाज  लगाता हूँ। एक वर्ष में और हर वर्ष अभी तो मैं कह रहा हूँ शुरूआत है 49500  Crore Rupees, ये बिचौलिए के पास जाते हुए रूक गए। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं  करीब-करीब 50 हजार करोड़ रूपया जो गरीबों के हक का था वो बिचौलिए खा जाते  थे corruption के नाम पर लूट के नाम पर उनको रोकने का काम उसके लिए एक बड़ी  हिम्मत लगती है और वो करके दिखया है।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, मैं कार्य संस्‍कृति का एक उदाहरण भी देना चाहता  हूँ किसानों की बड़ी-बड़ी बातें करते हैं। हर वर्ष राज्‍यों के  मुख्‍यमंत्री भारत सरकार को इस बात की चिट्ठी लिखते थे कि हमें यूरिया  मिलना चाहिए जब मैं मुख्‍यमंत्री था तब यह लिखता रहता था और यूरिया पाने  में बहुत बड़ी दिक्‍कत होती थी। मैं आज बड़े संतोष के साथ कहता हूँ कि  पिछले दो साल से किसी मुख्‍यमंत्री को यूरिया के लिए चिट्ठी नहीं लिखनी  पड़ी। कहीं यूरिया के लिए कतार नहीं लगी  है, कहीं यूरिया के लिए लाठीचार्ज  नहीं हुआ है, लेकिन ये बात हम भूले नहीं पुराने अख़बार निकाल दीजिए,  किसानों को यूरिया पाने के लिए कितनी तकलीफ होती थी। अब मुझे बताइए  नीम-कोटिंग, नीम-कोटिंग इसका ज्ञान सिर्फ हमी को है क्‍या ? क्‍या आप को  नहीं था क्‍या ? आपको था, आपने 5 अक्‍टूबर 2007 यूरिया नीम-कोटिंग की चर्चा  आपके Group of Ministers के द्वारा principally approved  हुई है, 5  अक्‍टूबर 2007 से ले करके क्‍या हुआ? करीब-करीब छह साल! एक आपने cap लगाई  35%, उससे ज्‍यादा नहीं नीम-कोटिंग करना, आप 100% नहीं करते हैं उसका कोई  लाभ ही नहीं होता है क्‍योंकि यूरिया चोरी होता है कारखानों में चला जाता  है किसान के नाम पर subsidy  के bill कटते हैं लेकिन किसान को लाभ नहीं  मिलता था। यूरिया का दूसरा दुरूपयोग होता था synthetic-milk बनाने में और  उसके कारण गरीब बच्‍चों की जिंदगी के साथ खेला जाता था।  यूरिया को 100%  नीम कोटिंग किया आपने निर्णय किया था, छह साल में आपने सिर्फ 20%, 35% cap  लगाने के बाद 35% भी नहीं पहुँच पाए, सिर्फ 20%, नीम-कोटिंग किया। हमने आ  करके इस बात को हात में लिया और 188 देश, आपका छह साल, मेरा छह महीना  हिंदुस्‍तान में 100% नीम कोटिंग यूरिया कर दिया, imported यूरिया को भी  नीम-कोटिंग कर दिया और उस नीम-कोटिंग का लाभ, इसका हमने सर्वे करवाया यानि  की आप की कार्य संस्‍कृति और हमारी कार्य संस्‍कृति में फर्क इतना है  नीम-कोटिंग की बात आती है आप खड़े हो जाते हो कि ये तो हमारे जमाने का है  तो ये आप के जमाने को आपके मैदान में मैंने खेलना तय किया है इसलिए मैं खेल  करके दिखाता हूँ कि आप का हाल क्‍या है? नीम कोटिंग का अध्‍ययन हमने  करवाया। Agriculture Development and Rural Transformation Centre  उन्‍होंने तो analysis करके Report दिया है, किसानों का कितना भला हो रहा  है देखिए। धान के उत्‍पादन में 5 प्रतिशत वृद्धि, गन्‍ने के उत्‍पादन में  15 प्रतिशत वृद्धि, आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि किसानों को इसके कारण कितना  खर्चा बच रहा है।
किस प्रकार से आदरणीय राष्‍ट्रपति जी ने हम सबसे एक आह्वान किया है कि  लोक सभा और विधान सभा के चुनाव साथ-साथ होने की दिशा में सोचने का समय आ  गया है। इसको राजनीतिक तराजू से न तौला जाए, तत्‍कालीन हर किसी को थोड़ा  बहुत नुकसान होगा हर किसी को थोड़ा बहुत होगा, लेकिन इस विषय पर गंभीरता से  सोचन की आवश्‍यकता है। आज हर वर्ष, पॉंच-सात, राज्‍यों में चुनाव होते ही  रहते हैं। एक करोड़ से ज्‍यादा सरकारी मुलाजि़म कभी न कभी चुनावों में लगे  रहते हैं। सबसे ज्‍यादा नुकसान शिक्षा क्षेत्र से जुड़े हुए हमारे  अध्‍यापकों प्रध्‍यापकों को चुनाव के कामों में जाना पड़ता है। भविष्‍य के  पीढि़यों का नुकसान हो रहा है, बार-बार चुनाव के कारण हो रहा है और उसके  कारण खर्च में भी बहुत बड़ी वृद्धि हो रही है। और इसलिए 2009 का जो लोक सभा  चुनाव हुआ तो 1100 करोड़ रूपये का खर्च हुआ और 2014 का लोक सभा का चुनाव  हुआ 4000 करोड़ से भी ज्‍यादा का हुआ। आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं इस गरीब देश  पर ये गरीब देश पर कितना बोझ पड़ रहा है। आज कानून व्‍यवस्‍था की दृष्टि से  अनेक नई-नई चुनौतियॉं आ रही हैं। प्राकृतिक संकटों के कारण भी security  force की मदद लगती है, दुनिया भर में फैल रहा आतंकवाद और दुश्‍मन देश जिस  प्रकार से हरकते कर रहे हैं हमारी security force को उसमें ताकत लगानी पड़  रही है। इतना बड़ा काम बढ़ता जा रहा है। दूसरी तरफ security forces की  ज्‍यादातर शक्ति चुनावी प्रबंधों में लगानी पड़ रही है उनको भेजना पड़ रहा  है। इन संकट को हम समझें और एक दीर्घ दृष्‍टा के रूप में कोई एक दल इसका  निर्णय नहीं कर सकता है। सरकार इसका निर्णय कतई नहीं कर सकती है, लेकिन  अनुभव के आधार पर जिम्‍मेवार लोगों ने मिल करके इस समस्‍या का समाधान हमने  खोजना होगा, हमें रास्‍ता खोजना होगा और राष्‍ट्रपति जी ने जो चर्चा निकाली  है उस चर्चा को हमने आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए। उनका धन्‍यवाद करते हुए उनके  धन्‍यवाद के लिए हम लोगों ने प्रयास करना चाहिए।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा जी, हमारे देश की ग्रामीण अर्थ-कारण को मजबूत किए बिना  देश का अर्थ-कारण आगे नहीं बढ़ता है। मैं हैरान हूँ हमारे विपक्षी नेता को  राष्‍ट्रपति जी के संबोधन में दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित, वंचित, युवा मजदूर  इनके उल्‍लेख से भी परेशानी हुई है क्‍या इस देश में दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित,  वंचित इन लोगों को इन लोगों का क्‍या उन लोगों का राष्‍ट्रपति के भाषण में  स्‍थान नहीं होना चाहिए। उससे पीड़ा होनी चाहिए मैं हैरान हूँ कि ऐसी पीड़ा  क्‍यों होनी चाहिए। हमने कृषि सिंचाई योजना पर बल दिया है क्‍योंकि मैं  मानता हूँ कि अब आप देखिए MGNREGA में कैसा मूलभूत परिवर्तन आया है आपने  तीन साल में सिर्फ 600 करोड़ रूपया बढ़ाया था। हमने आ करके दो साल में  11000 करोड़ रूपया बढ़ा दिया है। क्‍यों हमने उसमें space technology का  उपयोग किया है, हमने उसके अंदर zero taking की व्‍यवस्‍था की है और हमने बल  दिया है बल दिया है कि तालाब तालाब पर बल दिया जाएगा कि सिंचाई चाहिए सबसे  बड़ी बात है मत्‍स्‍य पालन के लिए भी छोटे-छोटे तालाब चाहिए। गरीब  व्‍यक्ति कता सकता है और उसके कारण करीब 10 लाख से ज्‍यादा तालाब बनाने का  संकल्‍प ले करके हम चल रहे हैं और पिछले बार भी हमने तालाब की ओर बल दिया  था। उसी से हमारे जो किसान हैं उनको एक बहुत बड़ा लाभ होने की संभावना है।  monitoring की व्‍यवस्‍था है zero taking के कारण monitoring की व्‍यवस्‍था  है उसका भी लाभ होगा। और  space technology सेटेलाइट के अंदर बहुत चीजें  होने के कारण भी हम उसका उपयोग नहीं किए हमने सेटेलाइट छोड़ करके अख़बारों  सुरखियों में जगह बना लिया। ये सरकार है जिसने लगातार भरपूर प्रयास किया है  और उसको भी आगे बढ़ाने के लिए काम करें।
प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना- फसल बीमा पहले भी थी लेकिन फसल बीमा लेने  के लिए किसान पहले तैयार नहीं था। फसल बीमा पहले भी थी लेकिन किसान के हकों  की रक्षा नहीं होती थी। मैं चाहुँगा हम सब सार्वजनि‍क जीवन में काम करने  वाले लोग हैं। राजनीतिक दल के सिवाय भी समाज के प्रति हमारी  एक  जिम्‍मेवारी है। इस सदन के सभी लोग प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना का अध्‍ययन  करें और हमारे इलाके के किसानों को कैसे मदद मिल सकती है इसके लिए इसका  फायदा पहुँचाएं। पहली बार बुआई न हुई हो तो प्राकृतिक आपदा के कारण तो भी  वो बीमा का हकदार बना है और फसल काटने के बाद भी अगर 15 दिन के  अन्‍दर-अन्‍दर कोई और आपदा आयी तो भी वो फसल बीमा का हकदार बने, ये निर्णय  छोटा नहीं है और इसलिए ये हम सब का दायित्‍व बनता है कि हम हमारे किसानों  को ये जो लाभ मिला है उस राज्‍य को हम पहुँचाएं।
Soil Health Card- राजनीतिक मदभेद हो सकता है लेकिन अपने इलाके के  किसानों को Soil Health Card समझाइए। उनका फायदा होगा उनकी लागत कम हो  जाएगी। सही भूमि पर सही फसल से उपयुक्‍त लाभ होगा। ये सीधा-सीधा विज्ञान  है, उसमें राजनीति करने की कोई जरूरत नहीं है। इसको हमें आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए  और उसमें मैं तो चाहुँगा छोटे-छोटे Entrepreneur आगे आएं खुद अपनी Private  Lab बनाएं और वे खुद Certify Labs के द्वारा धीरे-धीरे गॉंवों में भी एक नए  रोजगार का क्षेत्र भी खुले उस दिशा में हमें काम करना चाहिए।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा महोदया, हमने और भी अनेक विषयों यहॉं पर युवाओं के लिए  चर्चा हुई रोजगार के अवसर। मुद्रा योजना से करीब-करीब दो करोड़ से ज्‍यादा  लोगों को बिना कोई गारंटी जो धन दिया गया है या तो वह खुद अपने पैरों पर  खड़ा हुआ है या पहले से था तो ये एक से अधिक व्‍यक्ति को रोजगार देने की  ताकत आयी है। हम लोग, हम लोगों की यही सोच रही, जब तक हम देश में रोजगार के  अवसर नहीं बढ़ाएगें हमारी नीतियॉं वो होनी चाहिए कि हर जगह पर उसके रोजगार  की संभावना बढ़े और हमने उस नीति को अपनाया, Skill Development पर बल दिया  है और उसका लाभ है कि हमारे यहॉं कृषि क्षेत्र...ये प्रधानमंत्री कृषि  सिंचाई योजना ये  प्रधानमंत्री कृषि सिंचाई योजना जब लागू कर रहे हैं तो उस  काम में लोगों को रोजगार मिलेगा की नहीं मिलेगा? हम लोगों को ऊर्जा गंगा  योजना के साथ पूर्वी भारत को गैस पाइप लाइन से जोड़ने का एक बड़ा अभियान  चलाया है। सैकड़ों किलोमीटर का गैस पाइप लाइन लगने वाला है क्‍या उसमें नौ  जवानों के रोजगार की संभावना पड़ी है की नहीं पड़ी है?
और इसलिए विकास का वह दिशा हो जिसमें नौजवानों को रोजगार मिले हमने अभी  Textile में, जूतों के क्षेत्र में अनेक Initiative लिए हैं, जिसके कारण  अनेक लोगों को नये रोजगार और नये-नये क्षेत्रों में रोजगार की संभावना हुई  है । देश के छोटे उद्योगों को बढ़ावा देना बहुत जरूरी है, इस बजट में भी  बहुत महत्‍त्‍वपूर्ण फैसले किए हैं और छोटे-छोटे उद्योगों को जितना बल  मिलेगा उसके कारण हमारे देश में रोजगार की संभावनाएं बढेगी।
 ‘Zero Defect Zero Effect’ ये हमारे Production का criteria रखें तो हम  दुनिया के Market को भी capture कर सकते हैं और हमारे छोटे उद्योग-कारों  की export करने की ताकत होती है बड़े-बड़े उद्योग-कारों को छोटे-छोटे पूरजे  लगते हैं वो छोटे-छोटे कारखानों से मिलते हैं और बहुत बड़ा Engineering की  दुनिया में हम miracle कर सकते हैं। और इसलिए सरकार ने और अभी बजट में जो  योजना लाए हैं, नए बजट में उसका लाभ 96% उद्योगकारों को मिलने वाला है,  96%, 4% जो बड़े लोग हैं वो बाहर रह गये, लेकिन 50 करोड़ से कम वाले करीब  96% हैं उन सबको फायदा मिल रहा है और बहुत बड़ा फायदा मिल रहा है। उसके  कारण रोजगार के लिए बहुत बड़ी संभावनाएं बढ़ने वाली है।
Surgical Strike- मैं हैरान हॅूं अपने सीने पर हाथ रख करके पूछिए  Surgical Strike के पहले 24 घंटे राजनेताओं ने कैसे-कैसे बयान दिए थे, कैसी  भाषा का प्रयोग किया था लेकिन जब देखा कि देश का मिज़ाज अलग है, उनको अपनी  भाषा बदलनी पड़ी और मैं आज आपसे आग्रह करता हॅूं, ये बहुत बड़ा निर्णय था  और उस निर्णय को कोई मुझे पूछता नहीं है, नोटबंदी में तो पूछता है कि मोदी  जी secret क्‍यों रखा? Cabinet को क्‍यों नहीं बताया! ऐसा पूछते हैं।  Cabinet को भी नहीं बताया! Surgical Strike के संबंध में कोई नहीं पूछ रहा  है। भाइयों और बहनों! हमारे देश की सेना का, हमारे देश की सेना उसके जितने  गुणगान करें, हमारे देश की सेना का जितना गुणगान करें उतना ही कम है और  इतने बड़े फलक में इतनी सफल Surgical Strike की है surgical strike आपको  परेशान कर रही है मैं जानता हूँ। Surgical Strike आप को परेशान कर रहीं है  और इसलिए Surgical Strike आप की मुसीबत ये है कि Public में जाकर बोल नहीं  पाते हो अंदर पीड़ा अनुभव कर रहे हो, ये आप की मुसीबत है। लेकिन आप मान के  चलिए ये देश ये देश, हमारी सेना इस राष्‍ट्र की रक्षा के लिए पूरी  सामर्थ्‍यवान है पूरी शक्तिवान है।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्षा महोदया, मुझे विश्‍वास है कि हम इस सदन में संवाद हो  नए-नए शोध हो, नए-नए विचारों को रखा जाए क्‍योंकि हम लोग तो ज्ञान के  पुजारी हैं विचारों को स्‍वागत करने वाले लोग हैं, जितने नए विचार मिलेगें  किसी भी दिशा में से विचार आएं जरूरी नहीं की विचार इसी दिशा में आएं, इसी  दिशा में विचार आए उत्‍तम विचारों का स्‍वागत है क्‍योंकि हमने सब मिल करके  ultimately हम सब का उद्देश्‍य है हमारे देश को आगे बढ़ाना, ultimately हम  सब का उद्देश्‍य है देश को बुराइयों से मुक्‍त कराना, ultimately हमारा  उद्देश्‍य है इस देश को नयी ऊँचाइयों पर ले जाना। और विश्‍व के अंदर एक  अवसर आया है ऐसे अवसर बहुत कम आते हैं। आज की जो विश्‍व की व्‍यवस्‍था है  उसमें भारत के लिए एक अवसर आया है इस अवसर का अगर हम फायदा उठाएं और एक  स्‍वर से एक ताकत के साथ हम दुनिया के सामने प्रस्‍तुत होगें। मुझे  विश्‍वास है विश्‍व में भी जो सपना देख करके हमारे पूर्वज चले थे उसको हम  पूरा कर सकते हैं।
आदरणीय अध्‍यक्ष महोदया, आपने मुझे समय दिया सदन ने मुझे सुना इसके लिए  मैं आपका आभारी हूँ और मैं फिर एक बार आदरणीय राष्‍ट्रपति जी को हृदय से  अभिनंदन करते हुए मेरी बात को विराम देता हूँ, बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद!

                The Honourable Speaker, the President addressed both the Houses of Parliament in the beginning of 2017. The detailed blueprint of the way India has been transforming rapidly, the capability of the country's citizens, the way the villages and the poor farmer's life are changing, was placed before the House. I appeared before you to thank the President for his address and express my heartfelt gratitude to him.

The honourable Shri Mallikarjun ji, Tariq Anwar ji, Shri Jai Prakash Narayan ji, Shri Tathagata ji, Satpathy ji, Kalyan Banerjee, Jyotiraditya Scindia and many senior Members turned the discussion lively. Several aspects have been highlighted. And I express my gratitude to all the respected members who have participated in the discussion.

Yesterday an earthquake had struck. I express my concerns for those who are affected due to this earthquake, and the central government is in full contact with the states. The teams have also reached there to address the needs. But the earthquake has finally struck! I was wondering how and why the earthquake occurred now? Because the ominous symptoms have been there for a long time! There must be some reason why our mother earth has become offended.

Respected Speaker of Lok Sabha, I was wondering what caused the earthquake? When someone sees a sense of service or humility in a scam, not only the mother but also the mother earth becomes unhappy and that causes the earthquake.

The President talked about the power of democracy in his address. We know that whether any system is democratic or undemocratic, the nature of the people’s strength is totally different. Yesterday Our Mallikarjunji was saying that it was just because of the kind gesture of Congress Party that democracy is still in place and you were able to become a Prime Minister. Wow! What a couplet! It was a great favour that you did to the nation by saving the democracy! You are really great people!  But respected Speaker, the country knows the democracy of that party very well. The entire democracy was dedicated to just a single family. And during the era of 1975, Honourable Speaker, when emergency was imposed on the nation, India was turned into a prison. Lakhs of people, including the country's senior- most leader Jaiprakash Babu, were locked behind the bars. The freedom of the press was curbed. And they did not realize what the power of the people meant. Despite crushing the democracy, despite numerous efforts, this country had the power of the people that democracy was restored and even the son of a poor mother could also become a Prime Minister. And that is why the President had said about the strength of democracy. This is Champaran satyagraha’s Centenary year. The society does not get inspired merely by reading heaps of books on history. It is necessary not only to know the history but also to live history in every era. Whether we were present or not, our dogs were there or not; probably others’ puppies were there. We have not grown up following the traditions of dogs. But there were a lot of people in the country, even when the Congress party was not born. The people of this country valiantly fought the freedom struggle of 1857 and they fought together. There was no line of discrimination among communities and the lotus was present even then; and even today the lotus is there.

There are many people like me here who were born after independence. So, many of us did not get the opportunity to fight for independence. But have got the opportunity to live for the country and we are trying to do that.

Hon’ble Speaker, therefore, the country has witnessed immense strength of its people. Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji had his own dignity. On the days of the war, in the heart of every Indian, the feeling of India’s victory was entrenched. And at that time the country was ready to sacrifice food on the call of Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.

We know today's political environment after the formation of the government. Most of the princely states, the politicians, the state governments, the central governments have almost abandoned the public identity and this is a major concern for democracy. An ordinary person like me had casually asked the public whoever could afford to give up their subsidies for gas, should give it up. We are generally cut off from the masses. When we were contesting elections in 2014, one party was contesting on the issue whether nine cylinders should be provided or 12. When we came to power, we left the discussion of 9 and 12 and rather asked the people whether those who could afford would give up the subsidy or not? We just said and more than 1 Crore 20 lakh people in this country came forward to give up the gas subsidy.

The pride of this government and the people sitting there is not limited to it. It is a symbol of power of 125 Crore people. And I request this House, the President, I want to request through the inspiration of the President, and to the decision makers and law makers in the political life of the country, to recognize the strength of our country’s citizens. We can create a positive environment to carry India to greater heights by adopting the concept of mass movement. They are working towards advancing the country. We will get better results than before.

And because of that the power will increase manifold. The country is going to grow. There is no person who wants a bad future. There is no one who wants degradation of India. Everybody wants the welfare of the poor. Everyone wants that the villages and the poor farmers get benefitted. I am not one of those who will say that efforts were not made by anyone before. I have repeatedly said in this house and also from the ramparts of Red Fort that every government, Prime Minister, has made its own contribution before.

We never heard the reference of the martyrdom of Chapekar brothers for freedom from the people sitting on that side. Neither did we hear the reference of Savarkar ji who was languishing in the jail of Kalapani while the country was liberated. Reference was never made even to Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad, who also sacrificed their lives for the country. They feel that only one family had freed the nation from colonial rule. The root cause of the problem is there only.

We should accept the country as a whole and therefore participation of the countrymen is indispensable. We have been told in the scriptures -

अमंत्रम अक्षरम् नास्ति। नास्ति मूलम् अनौषिधम्, अयोग्‍य पुरूषोनास्ति योजक: तत्र दुर्लभ:।

There is no letter, which cannot find a place in a mantra or verse. There is no root of any plant that has no potential in finding a place in the medicine. There is no human being who cannot contribute anything for the society and the country. A conduit is needed: योजक: तत्र दुर्लभ।

 This world has made every effort to link all the powers and strength. And the impetus was provided by the power of the people.

Campaign for cleanliness; I am amazed that even after so many years of independence we have not been paying attention to this issue. We take the name of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi ji had two beloved symbols. Gandhi ji used to say that if I wish to have something even before independence, then that is cleanliness. We came up before the country with this desire of Gandhiji. So many governments came to power, several Parliamentary sessions were held over the years. Has the topic of cleanliness ever been discussed in Parliament? Should we make cleanliness a part of the political agenda too? Who among you wants to live in dirt? Who in your area wants dirt? Neither you (the opposition) want nor us (the government). Nobody wants. But can we not move forward together to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji, to join this sacred task for the society? What holds us back?

And so, the Honourable Speaker, we take our discussion on the supremacy of the citizens’ power forward. Now, whenever we discuss on the President's speech, budget also comes into the scene. While discussing the budget, the Finance Minister will provide the details, but there is one question that needs to be answered - why was the budget pre-poned? India is an agricultural country. Our economy is based on agriculture. And the status of the agricultural is well known by Diwali. The problem is that we are still carrying the legacy of the British.

We almost complete the process of budget by May. After 1st June Monsoon begins in India. It is impossible to use the budgetary allocations for three months. In a way, we have very little time to work. And when the time to utilise the funds almost gets over, for the last few days we know, the government knows how from December to March the funds are shown as spent! Now we should think about that. I do not criticize anyone. No one understood the reason as to why the budget was presented at five o'clock in the evening. It went on for many years after independence. Nobody thought why it was so and it continued to be presented at five in the evening. The reason was that the timing was according to the UK's Parliament; they received the budget in India from Britain at five o'clock in the evening. And we continued that system. And very few people know that if we hold the watch like this, then it shows Indian time, but if the clock is reversed then it shows the time in London. You can check if you have a watch.

In the same way when Atal ji’s government came to power, the time (of the Budget) was changed. When your government was in power, you had created a committee in relation to the timing of the budget. It had a detailed report. And you also wanted to change the time. And we had followed that very proposal, but you could not do it because your priority was different. It is not that you did not want to. But when will that fall under your priority. So, whatever has happened in your time, those things should be mentioned proudly. Now you too have forgotten. It is ok. I have reminded you of those things, you may take the benefit of it.

We shall also discuss about the railway budget in detail. But one thing needs to be understood. When the rail budget came 90 years ago, railway was the only major mode of transportation. Today transport has become a necessity and not only the Railways; there are different modes of transport. Unless we view the transport sector comprehensively, we will continue to face problems. Hence the focus will also be the Railway system. There is no problem with any privatization or of its autonomy. But the government should start looking at transport sector in totality and in a comprehensive way. Since we have come to power, we have made changes in the system of railways and in the budget.

You know that in the first budget, Gowda ji had said that about 1500 announcements were made and keeping everyone’s interest in mind, some provisions were declared. Then the politicians would go to their constituencies and brag about the things done. So why did we do this? I know, this leads to political losses. But someone has to take the responsibility and stop the wrong things that have been continuing in the country. And it suits the Bureaucracy. But I do not want such things to go on.

It is an attempt to take good decisions for the aspirations of the common man of the country. Try to do well. And so we are moving in that direction and doing this work.

Demonetization is another topic of discussion. From the very first day the government is insisting on the discussion on demonetization, but you all thought that if you see long queues on TV, then something might happen, and you can hold me guilty. You thought that by discussing demonetization Modi might take advantage of it. And so instead of discussing, you were interested in giving ‘TV byte’. Thus no discussion took place. It is good that this time you touched upon this topic and such a great change has come about. And I want the analysts to look closely at the time before May 2014. Questions were raised regarding how much was lost in coal scam? How much was lost in 2G scam, how much in water scam, how much in the aviation scam? How many lakhs went into it? Those were the voices raised from there in protest. I feel happy when the voices from there ask how much black money was brought back by Modi? What else can be a greater satisfaction in life than this? This only is the right step.

Then, Kharge ji said that black money was in diamond-jewelleries, in gold, in silver, and in property. I agree with your point of view but this House wants to know when did that knowledge dawn upon you? Because no one can deny that corruption starts with cash. It starts with cash. The result is the property, the Jewelleries and Gold. It begins with cash. You know that it is the root of all evils - Benami property, jewels, gold, and silver. You only tell me, in 1988, when Mr. Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister of the country, you had the majority, even more than that of the time of Pandit Nehru, in both the houses. Everything, from the Panchayat to the Parliament was in your possession. No one else was there.

In 1988, you made the law of Benami property. What was the reason that the law was not notified for 26 long years? What was the reason that it remained suppressed? If it was notified at that time, then with the enlightenment that you have had today, the situation 26 years ago could have been better. One step towards the ‘cleanliness of the country’ could have been made. Who were those people, who after making the law felt that suppression of the law is more beneficial? Which family? You cannot escape. You have to answer the country. This very government has taken the first step against them with demonetization. And I want to tell the countrymen through this House today, howsoever rich you may be, you have to return the poor that they rightly deserve. And I'm not going to step back. I am fighting for the poor, and I will continue to fight for the poor. Neither the shortage of natural resources nor of human resources was the root cause of poverty in the country, but there was a section of people in the country which had robbed the rights of the people, as a result of which the country could not reach the height it should have.

One thing I would like to say. We know that a simple economy had developed. Suggestions were made to your government on this by your committees too. When Indiraji used to rule, Yaswantrao Chauhan ji went to her with this topic. And then he had said won’t Congress fight the elections? Your decision was not wrong. You were concerned about the elections. We are not concerned about elections, but about the country; so we took the decisions. That's why we take the decision. And it is certainly no one can deny that a system of 'how much cash, no cheque' has developed. And in a way you have made it a part of life. If you do not face it, if you do not come out of the situation, it will continue; and therefore we have taken the decisions.

How have you governed the country? It seems that Charvak's mantra has been entrenched in the hearts and minds of some parties. They would emulate Charvak's mantra, as nobody knows what happens to big shots after death!  Right now I’m mentioning about  Charvak’s elementary  sayings . When I go to the other house, I will mention it in detail, but Charvak said:

यवज्‍जीवेत्, सुखम् जीवेत्।

ऋणम् ऋित्‍वा, घ्रितम् पिबेत्।।

भस्मिभूतस्‍य देहस्‍य।

पुनार्गमनम् कुत:?

Enjoy as long as you live. There is no worry; so consume Ghee. At that time, Ghee was considered as auspicious, so they have asked to consume Ghee otherwise they would have asked to consume something else. But at that time according to Maha-Samskar,  the Rishis used the word ‘ghee’ that perhaps today would have been replaced with something else. But some people with this type of philosophy think that when the economy was doing well then why was such a decision made at such a time? That's right. You know if you have any disease and the doctor says that you need to be operated, and the operation is very important, yet he says that first you have to fix the body. Diabetes has to be controlled; he will give seven-eight-twenty advices and only then will do the operation. The Doctor does not proceed with the operation unless the patient is fit enough for it, no matter how serious the situation is. For Demonetisation this time was conducive as the economy of the country was healthy. If the economy was weak, we could not have carried it out successfully.

Second, do not think that the demonetization was done in a hurry or without considering the time. You will have to study Modi for this. In our country, the amount of business that takes place in the whole year, almost the same business is generated during Diwali. That is 50% of the year’s business takes place around Diwali and 50% in the rest of the year. In a way, all business activities reach the zenith around Diwali. After that a natural lull period follows in our country. After Diwali, the shopkeepers also take around 15 days off, people also go on vacations. The time was ripe as the peak time of the business was over and one could handle the difficulties for 15-20 days and everything would be normal within 50 days. I believe my calculations were right.

And you are aware of the fact that there was a time when the Income Tax officials in the country used to intimidate and threaten and the rest is well known.

After the demonetization, all things are on record. Where did the money come from, who brought it, where was it deposited? Now the top names in it are known by technology through data-mining. Now there is no need to go to the Income Tax office. One can enquire about the details through SMS. And this, I believe, has provided the opportunity for a Clean India. Just as my campaign of 'Swachh Bharat' is progressing, similarly the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' is also progressing very fast in the economic sphere.

And the law on Benami property has been passed and notified. And just like Kharge ji has said, everything is included there. You have given good suggestions. We will also do the needful. If you read the provisions of the law you will understand that it has been made stringent. I request the people who have Benami property to come to ask their Chartered Accountants about the provisions of the Act and to enter into the mainstream and contribute to help the poor of the country.

Whoever feels that this decision has been taken abruptly, I want to clarify that the day our government was formed, the first thing done in the Cabinet was to create a SIT. The Supreme Court had said that the idea of the formation of SIT for investigating the black money abroad had been long stuck up. We formed the SIT and that too on the guidelines of the Supreme Court. And on 26 March, 2014, the Supreme Court had said, “Since 1947 for 65 Years nobody thought of bringing the money stashed away in the Foreign Banks to the country. The Government has failed in its role for 65 Years. This Court feels that you have failed in your duty. So it gives the order for the appointment of a committee headed by a former judge of this Court. Three years have passed, but you have not done anything to implement the order. What have you done except for filing one report? You have done nothing.”

The Supreme Court had questioned that government on March 24, 2014. I was already saying that earlier; during that period voices were raised against the government regarding the money lost in scams. Now the voices ask how much money is coming and will keep coming to the country. You see, one after other new harsh laws are being enacted against black money deposited abroad which also have the provision of property being seized. This time too, a new law has been mentioned in the budget. The punishment has been increased from 7 years to 10 years. We discussed the laws that had been made by you with the tax Havens, Mauritius, Singapore, etc. and explained to them our circumstances. We made a deal with Switzerland so that they provide real-time information. We will know if any Indian citizen deposits his money there. We have made such agreements with several countries including the United States, by which the information will be provided to India if any of our Indian citizens or the person of Indian origin keeps his money.

In the same way we made the rule that not more than 20 thousand Rupees cash can be used for the sale of property. We have passed the Real-Estate Bill and also imposed 1% excise duty in the jewellery market so that things are streamlined. We didn’t want to inconvenience anyone.

And you only, whether on this side of the House, or that side of the House , have been writing letters to me when we said that a person is required to provide his PAN if any Jewellery is purchased worth more than Rupees two lakhs. I am surprised that those speaking against corruption and black money were the ones who demanded the cancellation of this law through the letters, so that these people could continue to seek gold with the use of cash and continue with the black market. But we were determined and took every step to eradicate corruption. I know no one can do this for political benefits; otherwise you would have done this at the first instance. This was the difficulty, but for the country’s welfare and to uplift the poor such a decision had to be taken.

We have imposed 1% additional tax on items costing more than 2 lakhs and cars costing more than ten lakhs. We also brought the Income Text declaration scheme. Thanks to this scheme, for the first time the highest ever amount of money have been declared by the people. We have ended more than 1100 out-dated laws. Some people say 150 times and some say 130 times the rules have been changed during demonetisation. You remember quiet well.

Now I want to tell you that this was such a thing in which we used to first try and find a way out immediately after understanding the problems of the public. Second, those people who had the habit of looting for years, tried to find the way, then we had to do something to stop them. A battle was constantly going on. On one hand, there were people who tried to rob the country and on the other hand there were those who were making efforts to take the country towards honesty. The battle was going on. But your favourite programme, for which you are taking all the credit; well, you are not entitled to any credit, because this very programme has been existing since the rule of the kings. Such schemes already existed at that time under the name of ‘Rahat’ for the poor. After that, many schemes under the name of Food for work came up in India. After independence, the scheme took several names, which finally became MGNREGA. I have travelled many states and in every state where there was a communist government, like in West Bengal, in Maharashtra, where Sharad Pawar had a government, had implemented a similar scheme. The Congress government In Gujarat, after independence, everywhere this scheme was implemented. It was not a new thing, but the name was new. But the country knows and you yourself will be aware that 1035 changes have been made in MGNREGA which has been in place for so many years. 1035 times, the rules were changed. And there was no confrontation in it. There wasn’t any pressure. What was the reason that one programme like MGNREGA, which was going on for a long time had to be changed 1035 times?

And so I would express myself in the words of Kaka Hathrasi’s poem and when I talk of Kaka Hanthrasi, I request you all not to view it from the prism of Uttar Pradesh elections; because in all the elections, Kaka Hatharasi was deeply discussed. Kaka Hathrasi had said –

‘See within yourself, hidden there are the flaws’ … and Kaka Hathrasi said further, ‘you will get the true report’.

Respected Chairperson, I would like to draw attention to one more thing. The government runs with the rules and constitutional responsibilities. The rules that were for you apply to us also. But the difference is of the work culture. The power of policies is linked to the determination. If there is a fault in the determination, then the strength of the policies falls to negative - beyond zero - it becomes negative and therefore there is a need to understand that work culture in our country too. Whenever we say something, they (the opposition) start off with the same thing that it was there in our time. So I feel I should play with that topic a little bit. I would love to play in your field. I refuse to believe that you did not know about these things. It’s not that you just got to know about this issue yesterday. You had the information, but as it is said in the Mahabharata:

‘जानामि धर्मम् न च मे प्रवृति: ‘जानामि अधर्मम् न च मे निवृत्ति: ।

What is religion? You know this, but that was not your tendency. You also knew what was wrong, but you did not have the strength to leave it. I will tell you - National Optical Fibre Network; if I say anything on this topic, then they will start shouting that it was started by their government. I want to start with that. Now look at the National Optical fibre Network. It was started in 2011 and till 2014, this optical fibre Network was installed in just 59 villages in three years and there was no provision of last mile connectivity. Procurement was also fully centralized; what was the reason for it we all know. Now you see how the whole work culture changes and the approach changes. All the states were taken into consideration first. Last mile connectivity i.e. the optical fibre network should be placed in the school, in the hospital, in the Panchayat, at homes. These priorities were fixed. We decentralized the Procurement process. And the result was that in such a short time so far, 76,000 villages are covered with Optical fibre Network and the objective of last mile connectivity was fulfilled.

Secondly, points were being raised regarding a low-cash society or cash-less society. What do people have? Mobile. I am surprised! I have heard in all the election meetings since 2007, your leaders used to go to villages and say that Rajiv Gandhi brought computer revolution; Rajiv Gandhi brought mobile phones; Rajiv Gandhi connected every village. These are your slogans and when today I am saying that mobiles can be used to link with banks, you are saying that people do not have mobile phones. I don’t understand that you keep saying that you have done so much and when I am just adding something good to it, you are saying that it does not exist in the first place! So what were you trying to explain? Why are you doing this? The second thing is that you also believe and I too agree that the whole country does not have everything. But suppose 40% has it, shouldn’t we make a concerted effort to connect those 40% of people to this modern system? The rest 60% can be connected later. But at least we should start from somewhere and we should not underestimate the power of digital currency. Today, on an average five cops are required to handle a single ATM. The cost of mobilization of the currency is even more than the cost of mobilization of vegetables and milk. If we understand these things and at least encourage them towards digitalization; I know everyone cannot do it but encouraging those who can move towards it, is the work of leadership. Be it any party, the people will benefit out of it. Now someone was telling me about a vegetable vendor yesterday as he was making a report. So when the vendor was asked about the benefits that he was getting out of digital transactions, he said he had many permanent customers and he knew everyone. Now suppose one customer purchased vegetables worth 52 Rupees, then that Madam used to say that there was no 2 rupees change and forced him to take a note of 50 rupees. This led to a loss of two rupees for the vendor. Now he could not even protest and according to his calculations, about 800 or 1000 rupees were lost in a year like this. After installing the BHIM App, it is exactly 52 rupees that I receive. Similarly, if its 53, I get 53, if it is 48 rupees 45 Paisa I get exactly that amount. This way eight hundred or thousand rupees were saved.

See, this is how things change and even if you oppose Modi - okay this is your job, you have to do it - but at least try to promote the good things. Suppose a village doesn’t have the infrastructure required for these things but cities have. Try to develop those areas, make contributions, the country will benefit. Therefore, I insist that if on such occasions we can help, we should help.

How work and culture change! I do not claim that this road construction was created by our government. Roads were laid even by  TodarMal  and  Sher Shah Suri. So to say that this road construction projects have been started in our regime is wrong . The difference is that in the previous regime, the length of roads under Pradhan Mantri  Grameen Sadak Yojana used to be 69 km per day. It has become 111 km after we have come to power. This is the only difference.

And we have used Space Technology to build roads. With the use of Space Technology, photos can be clicked and the work can be monitored. We used drones for monitoring the railways. We use photography and keep track of the work. How the work culture can be changed with the help of technology!

Earlier similar Housing schemes with different names were being implemented to gain political brownie points. Whatever used to happen before has happened. But still in your time, 1083,000 homes were built in a year while this government has built 2227,000 houses in a year. Under the National Urban Renewal Mission 8017 houses were built in a month while we constructed 13530 houses.

Railways- Earlier the commissioning of the Broad Gauge Railway used to be 1500 km in a year. Last year, it increased from 1500 kilometres to 3000 kilometres i.e. ,the double and we are striving to make it 3500 kilometres. We did not get these results immediately. Everything was systematically planned and monitored in order to bring about this change.

Hence, it has to be done for Purushartha or the goals of human life and therefore it has been said in our scriptures –

उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः ।
न हि सुप्तस्य सिंहस्य प्रविशन्ति मुखे मृगाः ।।

This means that a work can be accomplished only with efforts; just like a deer does not enter the mouth of a sleeping Lion; even the Lion needs to hunt the deer.

Hon’ble Speaker Madam, how can we bring about some fundamental changes? We know that the State Electricity Boards- DISCOMs of all states are in a crisis. Therefore one Prime Minister had showed his concern from the ramparts of Red Fort in India as the condition had worsened to such a great extent. Power generation capacity was increased in the last two years. Non-conventional Energy has been added to it; Transmission line has been enhanced, Solar Energy has been augmented. It was 2700 MW in 2014, and today we have increased that to 9100 MW mainly due to the DISCOM scheme. The states under the UDAY scheme will be able to save more than 1 crore 60 thousand rupees. This can be used for the development of these states and they will be saved from the burden of indebtedness in the energy sector.

Coal- Did you know that the coal was not sold closer to the place where it was mined from? Why was it so? They said that let the Railways profit out of it. We were surprised; so we rationalized this and ensured that the nearby areas only get the coal. Therefore, we reduced the transportation cost by nearly Rs.1300 Crore.

LED Bulb- Now we do not claim that we have brought the concept of LED Bulb. Scientific research was done and you had started this scheme before. But in your time the LED bulb used to cost about Rs300-380 or so. Energy can be saved by LED bulbs. We have taken up this mission at a greater scale and in the last eight or nine months, within such a short time, we have succeeded in lighting with 21 million LED bulbs and are moving forward at a faster pace. As a result, the people using LEDs are now able to lower their electricity bills saving nearly Rs 11,000 crores in totality. If the government had decided to allocate 11,000 crore as electricity subsidy in the budget, it would have been the headline in the newspapers. But we reduced the electricity bill by Rs 11,000 crore with the help of LED bulbs only. This is an example of how we can achieve our goals by changing the work culture.

Whenever one of our leaders from the Opposition used to give a speech addressing the Scheduled Castes, he smartly ignored the statistics of 2013-14. Total Allocation for Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan in 2012-13- 37113; 13-14- 41561; 16-17- 38833; 16-17 – 40920.  There is an increase of 33.7%; and in this year's budget it has been increased to 52393. Therefore we must have the courage to listen to the truth. This government is fighting against corruption. What steps are taken to fight against corruption?

We have linked 84 schemes of 17 ministries to the Direct Benefit Transfer AADHAR scheme and 32 crore people were given Rs.1 Lakh 56 thousand crore through Direct Benefit Transfer scheme. How has this benefitted? In order to understand this we should know how every street and colony used to be looted earlier. And I know very well how these steps taken by me to stop these corrupt practices and loots will put me at risk. I had said the same thing about the implications of my decisions at Goa too. And I repeat it; my decisions are affecting and will continue to affect the interests of such big tycoons that make me vulnerable. But I'm ready for that because I am taking steps for the sake of my country.

PAHAL scheme – the people used to get gas cylinders and subsidy but when it was linked to the Aadhaar scheme, its leakage was plugged. The leakage of more than Rs. 26,000 crores could be controlled that helped us to provide gas connections to 1.5 Crore poor families successfully. Whenever I speak in the House I speak with responsibility. In the last two-and-a-half years, fake ration card holders used to rob the poor man of his rights. The middlemen used the fake ration cards, stole the goods and sold them in the black market. We used the technology and  Aadhaar. Now about 4 crore i.e. 3 crore 95 lakh fake ration cards were seized. These middlemen used to take away about 14 thousand crore rupees that were meant for the poor with these fake cards. Now the poor people got their rights back.

MGNREGA- Payments for MGNREGA are made with the help of  Aadhaar, money is directly transferred and about 94% success is achieved in this regard. And as a result 7633 Crore Rupees which was earlier lost due to leakages are now saved every year.

National Social Assisting Programme (NSAP) – there were no takers for about 400 crore rupees but the money was getting spent. There was a widespread misappropriation of funds. For example, the daughter who was not even born was declared as a widow and the money was going to that non-existent daughter from the government’s coffers. We have taken steps to curb these activities. There are many such things. Another example is that of the scholarships. You can imagine about 50 thousand crore rupees meant for the poor was stolen by the middlemen. A lot of courage is needed to stop these corrupt practices and we have done that.

Respected Speaker, I want to give an example of work culture. They make tall promises to the farmers. Every year, the chief ministers of the states used to write letters to the Central government regarding inaccessibility of urea; when I was the chief minister even I used to write and we had to face a lot of trouble in getting urea. Today, I say with great satisfaction that for the last two years no Chief Minister had to write any letter for urea. There has been no queue for urea, or any lathi charge for urea. But we have not forgotten this matter. You may have a look at the old newspapers; the farmers were suffering due to inaccessibility of urea. Now tell me didn’t you know about Neem-coating of Urea? You had a discussion on the 5th of October 2007 regarding neem-coating of urea, which was principally approved by your Group of Ministers. What happened after October 5, 2007? Almost six years! You had set a cap of 35%, for neem coating; you did not make it 100%. There is no use unless it is made 100% because the urea is stolen and goes to factories and the subsidy meant for the farmers goes waste as they are not getting anything. Secondly, the urea was misused in making synthetic-milk which also threatened the lives of poor children. We made it 100% Neem-coated Urea but in 6 years you could not even make it 35%. You applied only 20%. We also applied neem coating on imported urea and the advantage of that Neem coating was surveyed.  It is the difference between your work culture and our work culture. Whenever the topic of Neem-coated Urea comes up, you start claiming credits for starting it. Well, I have decided to play in your field. That's why I have played and showed you the difference in the work culture.  We got the analysis of the Neem coating done. Agriculture Development and Rural Transformation Centre has given a report after analysing which shows how well the farmers are doing now. There is a 5 per cent increase in paddy production and 15 per cent increase in sugarcane production. You can imagine that the farmers are able to save so much.

Our Hon’ble President had suggested simultaneous elections in Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies. It should not be weighed on political scales. Everybody will be at a little loss at the time but there is a need to give a serious thought to this subject. Every year elections are held in five-six states. More than one crore government officials are sometimes involved in elections. One great disadvantage is that the teachers in our education sector have to go for the election work. Future generations are being affected due to repeated elections and there is a huge increase in expenditure. In the Lok Sabha election of 2009, about Rs.1100 crore was spent and in the 2014 Lok Sabha election an amount of more than 4000 crores was spent. You can imagine the kind of burden on this poor country. There are many new challenges coming in terms of law and order. The security forces are needed for natural calamities; they are also needed for countering terrorism and the way terrorism is spreading all over the world, our security forces have to be sent to those operations. But most of our security forces are being forced to make electoral arrangements. We should understand this crisis. No party or the government can predict the future but based on the experience we have to find the solution to this problem and we should go ahead with the discussion that the President has suggested. As a token of Thanks to him, we should try to do this.

Respected Speaker, without strengthening our country's rural economy, we cannot strengthen the country’s economy. I am amazed that one of the leaders from the opposition party was uncomfortable at the mention of the Dalit, the oppressed, the deprived and the young labourers at the President's address. Shouldn’t these afflicted, exploited and disadvantaged people of this country find any mention in the President's speech? I am surprised and deeply pained by such a gesture. We have stressed upon the agricultural irrigation schemes because I believe that basic changes have been made in MGNREGA. You had raised only 600 crores in three years. We have increased that to Rs.11000 crores in two years. This is because we have used space technology in it, we have arranged for zero taking in it. Whether the pond should be emphasized or irrigation? The main thing is that even small ponds are needed for fisheries. We have resolved to make more than 10 lakh ponds. Zero taking will improve the monitoring system. Space technology was never used despite its multifarious applications. But this government has consistently made tremendous efforts to promote it.

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana - Crop Insurance was there before but the farmer was not ready for it; crop insurance was there before but the farmers' rights were not protected. I wish that though we all are people who work in public life but we should not shy away from our responsibilities towards the society and we should keep our political interests at bay. Everyone in this House can study the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and help the farmers of our area get its benefit. If a farmer could not sow the seeds due to any natural calamity or a disaster struck even 15 days after the harvest of the crop, he shall be entitled to the insurance scheme. This is not a small decision. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all of us to deliver the benefits of the scheme to our farmers in each state.

Soil Health Card- There is a possibility of political differences but kindly explain the Soil Health Card to farmers in your area. They will benefit out of it; their input costs will be reduced. The right crop on the right land will have the appropriate benefits. It is purely science; there is no need to politicize the matter. Let us go ahead and I would like to urge small entrepreneurs to come forward to create their own Private Labs to test and certify soils. This will gradually open up new employment opportunities in the villages. We should work in that direction.

Hon’ble Speaker Madam, we have discussed several topics here regarding the youth and the employment opportunities. With the MUDRA scheme, more than two crore people have been given the loans without any guarantee. Once these people become independent or self-employed they will have the power to employ several others. We are moving ahead with the thinking that we should create opportunities for employment at every step and we have adopted that policy and have emphasized Skill Development. We can see its benefits in the agriculture sector. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana promises several employment opportunities for the people. We have launched a major campaign to connect East India with a gas pipeline with the Urja Ganga scheme. A gas pipeline of hundreds of kilometres will be laid. Won’t there be any employment opportunity for the youngsters in the country in that case?

Hence in order to provide jobs, we have started many initiatives in the field of textiles, shoe making and several other areas. It is very important to promote small industries of the country. Several important decisions have been made in this budget and with the increased strength of small industries, employment opportunities in our country will increase.

If we use the criterion of 'Zero Defect Zero Effect' for our production, then we can capture the world's market too. The export strength of our small industries can be improved; big industries need small equipment that they get from small factories and we can do miracle in the field of engineering. Thus, the government has come up with the plans in the budget that will benefit 96% of the industrialists and 4% of the big industrialists are left out but about 96% are those whose transactions are less than Rs 50 crore.  All of them are benefiting. Thus, there is a huge potential for an increase in employment.

Surgical Strike- I am surprised at the way some statements were made by the politicians within 24 hours of the Surgical Strike; but when they realized that the country's mood was different, they had to change their language and this was a very big decision and no one questioned me on this; questions were raised regarding demonetization as to why was it kept a secret? Why was the Cabinet not informed! But nobody questioned me on the Surgical Strike. The army of our country cannot be praised enough for its success in the massive Surgical Strike. The surgical strike is bothering you, I know. Surgical Strike is troubling you and therefore you are unable to speak out publicly and you are feeling the pain inside. But you should understand that the army is powerful enough and capable of protecting the country from any kind of adversary.

Respected chairperson, I believe that we should have a healthy dialogue in this House. New research and new ideas should be shared in this House, because ultimately our purpose is to take our country forward. We have to do this together because ultimately our aim is to liberate our country from evils and to take this country to new heights. And we have got this rare opportunity. If we take advantage of this opportunity and stand in front of the world as a single force, I believe that we can definitely fulfil the dreams of our ancestors.

Hon’ble Speaker Madam, you have given me the time to speak. I am thankful to you for listening to me, and once again I thank you. Hearty congratulations to the President. Thank you very much!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today replied to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address in the Lok Sabha. He thanked the various Members of the House, for adding vigour into the debate, and sharing insightful points.

Stating that there is something very special about 'Jan Shakti' – people’s power – the Prime Minister said that it is due to this 'Jan Shakti' that a person born in a poor family can become the Prime Minister of India.

The Prime Minister said that there are many people like him, who may not have had the opportunity to die for the nation during the freedom struggle, but who, being born in free India, are living for, and serving the nation. Stating that faith in Jan Shakti will give good results, he called upon the Members to understand and appreciate the inherent strength of our people, and take India to newer heights.

Explaining the rationale behind the advancement of the budget date, the Prime Minister said this would ensure better utilization of funds. Similarly, he said that the transport sector in the country now requires a comprehensive approach, which is possible by having just one Union Budget.

The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction at the change of discourse since he assumed office – stating that from a time when the discussion was on how much money is lost through scams, the discussion is now on how much black money has been recovered. 

 The Prime Minister declared that his struggle is for the poor, and this struggle to give the poor their due, will continue. He said that this Government does not see everything from the prism of elections, and the interests of the nation are supreme for the Government.

Comparing demonetization to the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Prime Minister said it is a movement to clean India from corruption and black money.

Responding to criticism of frequent changes in the rules related to demonetization, the Prime Minister said that this was done to stay a step ahead of those who wanted to find loopholes in the exercise. He noted that rules for MNREGA were also changed over a thousand times.

The Prime Minister said steps like crop insurance have been taken in a way that facilitates and benefits farmers.

The Prime Minister also praised the nation’s armed forces, and said that they are fully capable of defending the nation.

 श्री पेजावर मठ के परम श्रद्धेय श्री विश्वेश तीर्थ स्वामी जी,  

श्री विश्व प्रसन्न तीर्थ स्वामी जी, 

श्री राघवेंद्र मठ के श्री श्री सुभुधेन्द्र तीर्थ स्वामी जी, 

और 

वहां कार्यक्रम में उपस्थित सभी श्रद्धालुगण।

 

भारत में भक्ति आन्दोलन के समय के सबसे बड़े दार्शनिकों में से एक जगद्गुरु संत श्री मध्वाचार्य जी के 

सातवीं शताब्दी समारोह में उपस्थित होने से मैं अभिभूत हूं। 

 

कार्य की व्यस्तता के कारण मैं उडुपी नहीं पहुंच पाया। अभी कुछ देर पहले ही अलीगढ़ से लौटा हूं। ये मेरा परम सौभाग्य है कि आप सभी का आशीर्वाद लेने का सुअवसर मुझे आज प्राप्त हुआ है।

 

मानव जाति के नैतिक और आध्यात्मिक उत्थान के लिए जिस प्रकार से संत श्री मध्वाचार्य जी के सन्देश का प्रचार-प्रसार किया जा रहा है, मैं उसके लिए सभी आचार्यों, मनीषियों का अभिनन्दन करता हूँ। 

 

कर्नाटक की पुण्य भूमि को भी मैं प्रणाम करता हूं, जहां एक और मध्वाचार्य जैसे संत हुए, वहीं आचार्य शंकर और आचार्य रामानुज जैसी पुण्य आत्माओं ने भी इसे विशेष स्नेह दिया।

 

 उडुपी श्री मध्वाचार्य जी की जन्मभूमि और कर्मभूमि रही है। श्री मध्वाचार्य जी ने अपना प्रसिद्ध गीताभाष्य उडुपी की इसी पवित्र भूमि पर लिखा था। 

 

श्री मध्वाचार्य जी यहाँ के कृष्ण मंदिर के संस्थापक भी थे। मेरा इस मंदिर में स्थापित कृष्ण मूर्ति से इसलिए भी विशेष नाता है।   उडुपी से भी मेरा लगाव कुछ अलग ही रहा है। मुझे कई बार उडुपी आने का अवसर मिला है। 1968 से लेकर चार दशक से भी ज्यादा तक उडुपी म्यूनिसिपल कॉरपोरेशन की जिम्मेदारी भारतीय जनता पार्टी और भारतीय जनसंघ ने संभाली है। 1968 में उडुपी पहली ऐसी म्यूनिसिपल कॉरपोरेशन बनी थी जिसने manual scavenging पर रोक लगाई थी। 1984 और 1989 में दो बार उडुपी को स्वच्छता के लिए सम्मानित किया गया था। स्वच्छता को लेकर, मानवीय मूल्यों को लेकर जनशक्ति जागृत करने की हमारी प्रतिबद्धता का ये शहर जीता-जागता उदाहरण रहा है। 

 

मुझे दोहरी खुशी है कि इस कार्यक्रम में श्री विश्वेश तीर्थ स्वामी जी स्वयं उपस्थित हैं। 

8 वर्ष की छोटी सी आयु में सन्यास लेने के बाद अपने जीवन के 80 वर्ष उन्होंने अपने देश को, अपने समाज को मजबूत करने में लगा दिए। देश के कोने-कोने में जाकर अशिक्षा, गौरक्षा, जातिवाद के खिलाफ मुहिम चलाई। 

 

ये स्वामीजी के पुण्य कर्मों का ही प्रभाव है कि उन्हें पांचवे पर्याय का अवसर मिला है। ऐसे संत पुरुष को मेरा नमन है।

 

भाइयों और बहनों, 

 

हमारे देश का इतिहास हजारों वर्ष पुराना है। हजारों साल का इतिहास समेटे हुए हुए हमारे देश में समय के साथ परिवर्तन आते रहे हैं। व्यक्ति में परिवर्तन, समाज में परिवर्तन। लेकिन समय के साथ ही कई बार कुछ बुराइयां भी समाज में व्याप्त हो जाती हैं।

 

 ये हमारे समाज की विशेषता है कि जब भी ऐसी बुराइयां आई हैं, तो सुधार का काम समाज के बीच में ही किसी ने शुरू किया है। एक काल ऐसा भी आया जब इसका नेतृत्व हमारे देश के साधु-संत समाज के हाथ में था। ये भारतीय समाज की अद्भुत क्षमता है कि समय-समय पर हमें ऐसे देवतुल्य महापुरुष मिले, जिन्होंने इन बुराइयों को पहचाना, उनसे मुक्ति का रास्ता दिखाया। 

 

 श्री मध्वाचार्य जी भी ऐसे ही संत थे, समाज सुधारक थे, अपने समय के अग्रदूत थे। उनेक ऐसे उदाहरण हैं जब उन्होंने प्रचलित कुरीतियों के खिलाफ, अपने विचार रखे, समाज को नई दिशा दिखाई। यज्ञों में पशुबलि बंद कराने का सामाजिक सुधार श्री मध्वाचार्य जी जैसे महान संत की ही देन है। 

 

 हमारा इतिहास गवाह है कि हमारे संतों ने सैकड़ों वर्ष पहले, समाज में जो गलत रीतियां चली आ रही थीं, उन्हें सुधारने के लिए एक जनआंदोलन शुरू किया। उन्होंने इस जनआंदोलन को भक्ति से जोड़ा। भक्ति का ये आंदोलन दक्षिण भारत से चलकर महाराष्ट्र और गुजरात से होते हुए उत्तर भारत तक पहुंचा था।

 

उस भक्ति युग में, उस कालखंड में, हिंदुस्तान के हर क्षेत्र, पूर्व-पश्चिम उत्तर-दक्षिण, हर दिशा, हर भाषा-भाषी में मंदिरों-मठों से बाहर निकलकर हमारे संतों ने एक चेतना जगाने का प्रयास किया, भारत की आत्मा को जगाने का प्रयास किया। 

 

 भक्ति आंदोलन की लौ दक्षिण में मध्वाचार्य, निम्बार्काचार्य, वल्लभचार्य, रामानुजाचार्य, पश्चिम में मीराबाई, एकनाथ, तुकाराम, रामदास, नरसी मेहता, उत्तर में रामानंद, कबीरदास, गोस्वामी तुलसीदास, सूरदास, गुरु नानकदेव, संत रैदास, पूर्व में चैतन्य महाप्रभु, और शंकर देव जैसे संतों के विचारों से सशक्त हुई। इन्हीं संतों, इन्हीं महापुरुषों का प्रभाव था कि हिंदुस्तान उस दौर में भी तमाम विपत्तियों को सहते हुए आगे बढ़ पाया, खुद को बचा पाया।

 

 आदि शंकराचार्य ने देश के चारों कोनों में जाकर लोगों को सांसारिकता से ऊपर उठकर ईश्वर में लीन होने का रास्ता दिखाया। रामानुजाचार्य ने विशिष्ट द्वैतवाद की व्याख्या की। उन्होंने भी जाति की सीमाओं से ऊपर उठकर ईश्वर को प्राप्त करने का रास्ता दिखाया। 

वो कहते थे कर्म, ज्ञान और भक्ति से ही ईश्वर को प्राप्त किया जा सकता है। उन्हीं के दिखाए रास्ते पर चलते हुए संत रामानंद ने सभी जातियों और धर्मों के लोगों को अपना शिष्य बनाकर जातिवाद पर कड़ा प्रहार किया।

 

 संत कबीर ने भी जाति प्रथा और कर्मकांडों से समाज को मुक्ति दिलाने के लिए अथक प्रयास किया। 

वो कहते थे- पानी केरा बुलबुला- अस मानस की जात...

जीवन का इतना बड़ा सत्य उन्होंने इतने आसान शब्दों में हमारे समाज के सामने रख दिया था। 

 

 गुरु नानक देव कहते थे- मानव की जात सभो एक पहचानबो।

 

संत वल्लभाचार्य ने स्नेह और प्रेम के मार्ग पर चलते हुए मुक्ति का रास्ता दिखाया। 

 

चैतन्य महाप्रभु ने भी अस्पृश्यता के खिलाफ समाज को नई दिशा दिखाई। 

 

संतो की ऐसी श्रंखला भारत के जीवंत समाज का ही प्रतिबिंब है, परिणाम है। समाज में जो भी चुनौती आती है, उसके उत्तर आध्यात्मिक रूप में प्रकट होते हैं। इसलिए पूरे देश में शायद ही ऐसा कोई जिला या तालुका होगा, जहां कोई संत ना जन्मा हो। संत, भारतीय समाज की पीड़ा का उपाय बनकर आए, 

अपने जीवन, अपने उपदेश और साहित्य से उन्होंने समाज को सुधारने का काम किया।

 

 भक्ति आंदोलन के दौरान धर्म, दर्शन और साहित्य की एक ऐसी त्रिवेणी स्थापित हुई, जो आज भी हम सभी को प्रेरणा देती है। इसी दौर में रहीम ने कहा था – 

 

वे रहीम नर धन्य हैं, 

पर उपकारी अंग, 

बांटन वारे को लगे, 

ज्यों मेहंदी को रंग... 

 

मतलब जिस प्रकार मेहंदी बांटने वाले के हाथ पर मेहंदी का रंग लग जाता है, उसी तरह से जो परोपकारी होता है, दूसरों की मदद करता है, उनकी भलाई के काम करता है, उसका भी अपने आप भला हो जाता है।

 

 भक्ति काल के इस खंड में रसखान, सूरदास, मलिक मोहम्मद जायसी, केशवदास, विद्यापति जैसी अनेक महान आत्माएं हुईं जिन्होंने अपनी बोली से, अपने साहित्य से समाज को ना सिर्फ आईना दिखाया, बल्कि उसे सुधारने का भी प्रयास किया।

 

मनुष्य की जिंदगी में कर्म, इंसान के आचरण की जो महत्ता है, उसे हमारे साधु संत हमेशा सर्वोपरि रखते थे। गुजरात के महान संत नरसी मेहता कहते थे- वाच-काछ-मन निश्चल राखे, परधन नव झाले हाथ रे।

यानि व्यक्ति अपने शब्दों को, अपने कार्यों को और अपने विचारों को हमेशा पवित्र रखता है। 

अपने हाथ से दूसरों के धन को स्पर्श ना करे। आज जब देश कालेधन और भ्रष्टाचार के खिलाफ इतनी बड़ी लड़ाई लड़ रहा है, तो ये विचार कितने प्रासंगिक हो गए हैं।

 

दुनिया को अनुभव मंटप या पहली संसद का मंत्र देने वाले महान समाज सुधारक वसेश्वर भी कहते थे कि मनुष्य जीवन निस्वार्थ कर्मयोग से ही प्रकाशित होगा। सामाजिक और व्यक्तिगत आचरण में स्वार्थ आना ही भ्रष्टाचार का पहला कारण होता है। निस्वार्थ कर्मयोग को जितना बढ़ावा दिया जाएगा, उतना ही समाज से भ्रष्ट आचरण भी कम होगा।

 

श्री मध्वाचार्य जी ने भी हमेशा इस बात पर जोर दिया कि कोई भी काम छोटा या बड़ा नहीं होता, 

पूरी ईमानदारी से किया गया कार्य, पूरी निष्ठा से किया गया कार्य ईश्वर की पूजा करने की तरह होता है। 

वो कहते थे कि जैसे हम सरकार को टैक्स देते हैं, वैसे ही जब हम मानवता की सेवा करते हैं, तो वो ईश्वर को टैक्स देने की तरह होता है। 

 

हम गर्व के साथ कह सकते हैं हिंदुस्‍तान के पास ऐसी महान परंपरा है, 

ऐसे महान संत-मुनि रहे हैं, ऋषि-मुनि, महापुरुष रहे हैं जिन्‍होंने अपनी तपस्‍या, अपने ज्ञान का उपयोग राष्ट्र के भाग्‍य को बदलने के लिए, राष्ट्र का निर्माण करने के लिए किया है। 

 

हमारे संतों ने पूरे समाज को:

 

जात से जगत की ओर

 

स्व से समष्टि की ओर 

 

अहम् से वयम की ओर

 

जीव से शिव की ओर

 

जीवात्मा से परमात्मा की और

 

जाने के लिए प्रेरित किया| 

 

स्वामी दयानंद सरस्वती, स्वामी विवेकानंद, राजा राम मोहन राय, ईश्वर चंद्र विद्यासागर, ज्योतिबा फुले, डॉक्टर भीम राव अम्बेडकर, महात्मा गांधी, पांडुरंग शास्त्री आठवले, विनोबा भावे, जैसे अनगिनत संत पुरुषों ने भारत की आध्यात्मिक धारा को हमेशा चेतनमय रखा। समाज में चली आ रही कुरितियों के खिलाफ जनआंदोलन शुरू किया। 

 

जात-पात मिटाने से लेकर जनजागृति तक; भक्ति से लेकर जनशक्ति तक; सती प्रथा को रोकने से लेकर स्वच्छता बढ़ाने तक; सामाजिक समरसता से लेकर शिक्षा तक; स्वास्थ्य से लेकर साहित्य तक

उन्होंने अपनी छाप छोड़ी है, जनमन को बदला है। 

 

इन जैसी महान विभूतियों ने देश को एक ऐसी शक्ति दी है, जो अद्भुत, अतुलनीय है।

 

भाइयों और बहनों, 

 

सामाजिक बुराइयों को खत्म करते रहने की ऐसी महान संत परंपरा के कारण ही हम सदियों से अपनी सांस्कृतिक विरासत को सहेज पाए हैं। ऐसी महान संत परंपरा के कारण ही हम राष्ट्रीय एकीकरण और राष्ट्रनिर्माण की अवधारणा को साकार करते आए हैं। 

 

ऐसे संत किसी युग तक सीमित नहीं रहे हैं,  बल्कि वे युगों-युगों तक अपना प्रभाव डालते रहे हैं।

 

हमारे देश के संतों ने हमेशा समाज को इस बात के लिए प्रेरित किया कि हर धर्म से ऊपर अगर कोई धर्म है तो वो मानव धर्म है। 

 

आज भी हमारे देश, हमारे समाज के सामने चुनौतियां विद्यमान हैं। इन चुनौतियों से निपटने में संत समाज और मठ बड़ा योगदान दे रहें हैं। जब संत समाज कहता है कि स्वच्छता ही ईश्वर है, तो उसका प्रभाव सरकार के किसी भी अभियान से ज्यादा होता है।

 

आर्थिक रूप से शुचिता की प्रेरणा भी इसी से मिलती है। भ्रष्ट आचरण यदि आज के समाज की चुनौती है, तो उसका उपाय भी आधुनिक संत समाज दे सकता है।  

 

पर्यावरण संरक्षण में भी संत समाज की बड़ी भूमिका है। हमारी संस्कृति में तो पेड़ों को चेतन माना गया है, जीवनयुक्त माना गया है। बाद में भारत के ही एक सपूत और महान वैज्ञानिक डॉक्टर जगदीश चंद्र बोस ने इसे दुनिया के सामने साबित भी किया।  

 

वरना पहले दुनिया इसे मानती ही नहीं थी, हमारा मजाक उड़ाती थी। 

 

हमारे लिए प्रकृति मां है, दोहन के लिए नहीं, सेवा के लिए है। हमारे यहां पेड़ के लिए अपनी जान तक देने की परंपरा रही है, टहनी तोड़ने से भी पहले प्रार्थना की जाती है। जीव-जंतु और वनस्पति के प्रति संवेदना हमें बचपन से सिखाई जाती है। 

 

 हम रोज़ आरती के बाद के शांति मंत्र में वनस्पतय: शांति आप: शांति कहते है। लेकिन ये भी सत्य है कि समय के साथ इस परंपरा पर भी आंच आई है। आज संत समाज को इस ओर भी अपना प्रयास बढ़ाना होगा। जो हमारे ग्रंथों में है, हमारी परंपराओं का हिस्सा रहा है, उसे आचरण में लाने से ही climate change की चुनौती का सामना किया जा सकता है।

 

 आज भी आप देखिए, सम्पूर्ण विश्व के देशों में जीवन जीने के मार्ग में जब भी किसी प्रकार की बाधा आती है तब दुनिया की निगाहें भारत की संस्कृति और सभ्यता पर आकर टिक जाती हैं। 

 

 एक तरह से विश्व की समस्त समस्याओं का उत्तर भारतीय संस्कृति में है। ये भारत में सहज स्वीकार्य है कि एक ईश्वर को अनेक रूपों में जाना पूजा जा सकता है। ऋगवेद में कहा गया है- एकम सत विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति... एक ही परमसत्य को अलग-अलग नामों से बुलाया जाता है। विविधता को हम केवल स्वीकार नहीं करते उसका उत्सव मनाते  है।

 

हम वसुधैव कुटुंबकम... पूरी पृथ्वी को एक परिवार मानने वाले लोग हैं। हम कहते हैं- सहनाववतु-सह नौ भुनक्तु... सभी का पोषण हो, सभी को शक्ति मिले, कोई किसी से द्वेश ना करे। कट्टरता का यही समाधान है।  आतंक के मूल में ही ये कट्टरता है की मेरा ही मार्ग सही है। जबकि भारत में केवल सिद्धांत रूप में नहीं पर व्यवहार में भी अनेक उपासना के लोग सदियों से साथ रहते आए हैं। हम सर्वपंथ समभाव को मानने वाले लोग हैं। 

 

मेरा मानना है कि आज के इस युग में हम सभी साथ मिलकर रह रहे हैं, समाज में व्याप्त बुराइयों को दूर करने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं, देश के विकास के लिए प्रयत्नशील हैं, तो इसकी एक बड़ी वजह साधु-संतों द्वारा दिखाई गयी ज्ञान कर्म और भक्ति की प्रेरणा है। 

 

आज समय की मांग है पूजा के देव के साथ ही राष्ट्रदेव की भी बात हो, पूजा में अपने ईष्टदेव के साथ ही भारतमाता की भी बात हो। अशिक्षा, अज्ञानता, कुपोषण, कालाधन, भष्टाचार जैसी जिन बुराइयों ने भारतमाता को जकड़ रखा है, उससे हमारे देश को मुक्त कराने के लिए संत समाज देश को रास्ता दिखाता रहे| 

 

मैं यह कामना करता हूँ कि आप सभी आध्यात्म के द्वारा हमारे देश की प्राणशक्ति का अनुभव जन-जन को कराते रहेंगे| वयम अमृतस्य पुत्राहा, के अहसास से जनशक्ति को और मजबूत करते रहेंगे। मैं अपने इन्हीं शब्दों के साथ आप सभी का आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ। 

 

बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद !!!

                Sri Pejavar Math’s most respected Sri Vishwesh Tirth Swami Ji, 

Sri Vishwa Prasanna Tirth Swami Ji, 

Sri Raghavendra Matt’s Sri Sri Subhudhendra Tirth Swami Ji, 

And all devotees present there on this occasion. 

I am delighted to be present at the seventh centenary celebrations of Jagadguru Sri Madhavacharya Ji, India’s one of the greatest philosophers of the Bhakti Aandolan era. 

I could not reach Udupi due to busy work schedule. I have returned from Aligarh, just a little while ago. It is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity today to get your blessings. 

I welcome all Acharyas, Saints for spreading the messages of Sant Sri Madhavacharya for moral and spiritual upliftment of human being. 

I also salute the holy land of Karnataka, where saint like Madhavacharya emerged in one hand and in other hand spiritual souls like Acharya Shankar and Acharya Ramanuj gave it special affection. 

Udupi has been Sri Madhavacharya Ji’s birth place and work place also. Sri Madhavacharya had written his renowned Geetabhashya on this holy land of Udupi only. 

Sri Madhavacharya was also the founder of the Krishna Temple here. I have special relationship with the Krishna idol installed in this temple. I have special attachment with Udupi. I have got several opportunities to come to Udupi. From 1968 the Bharatiya Janata Party and Bharatiya Jansangh had been accomplishing the responsibility of Udupi Municipal Corporation for more than four decades. In 1968, Udupi become the first such Municipal Corporation, which had put a ban on manual scavenging. Udupi was honoured for cleanliness twice in 1984 and 1989. On the basis of cleanliness, this town has been a live example of our human values. 

I am happy that Sri Vishwesh Tirth Swami Ji is himself present here in these celebrations. 

After attaining Sannyas, in a very little age of 8 years, he dedicated 80 years of his life to strengthen his country and his society. He campaigned across the country against illiteracy, cow slaughter and cast feeling. 

It is only the influence of Swamiji’s good works that he has got the opportunity to become the fifth Paryay. I salute such great Saint. Brothers and sisters, 

Our country’s history is thousands years old. Motivated by thousands years old history, our country has been witnessing changes from time to time. There have been changes among people and society. But, sometimes, some evils find their place in society several times. 

Our society has such characteristic that whenever any evil emerges, somebody from the society itself, start reformatory works. There was such a period also, when its leadership was in the hands of Saints of the country. This is unique capability of the Indian society that we have been blessed with such god-like great men from time to time, who identified these evils and shown the path for liberation. 

Madhavacharya was also such a saint, social reformer and above all, a forerunner of his time. There are several examples, when he had expressed his views against the evils and shown the society a new direction. The social reforms to end the evil of animal slaughter during Yajnasis also a gift from saints like Sri Madhavacharya. 

Hundreds years back, our history has such example that our saints had started people’s movement to bring reforms against evils in the society. They had connected this people’s movement with devotion (Bhakti). This Bhakti Aandolan had reached north India from south India via Maharashtra and Gujarat. 

In that Bhakti Yuga, in that period, our saints had come out of Temples and Mutts and had moved across every part of India, whether it is east, west, north or south or areas associated with any language, they tried to bring awareness and made efforts to awaken the soul of India. 

In south- Madhavacharya, Nimbakacharya, Vallabhacharya, Ramanujacharya, in West-Meerabai, Eknath, Tukaram, Ramdas, Narsi Mehta, in north-Ramanand, Kabirdas, Goswami Tulsidas, Surdas, Guru Nanakdev, Sant Raidas, in East-Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Shankar Dev like saints’ ideology had strengthened Bhakti Aandolan. In that phase, with the influence of these saints, these great men, India was able to move forward and save itself, despite a lot of adversities. 

Adi Shankaracharya went to every nook and corner of the country and show the people the path to get united with God after leaving behind worldliness.Ramanujacharya had explained the specific Dwaitvaad. He had also shown the path that one can find God, if he comes out of cast boundary. 

He said, God could be found only through Karma (duty), Jnan (enlightenment) and Bhakti (devotion). Following the path shown by him, Sant Ramanand had boldly attacked cast system by making people from all casts and religions his followers. 

Sant Kabir had also tirelessly worked to liberate the society from cast system and karmakand. 

He said- Paani kera bulbula-as manas ki jat (cast feeling is just like water bubbles). 

He had presented such a big truth of life in such simple words for the society. 

Guru Nanak Dev said- Manav ki jat sabho ek pahchanbo (Identify all human being as one cast). 

Sant Vallabhacharya had shown the path of liberation by following the path of affection and love. 

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had also shown new direction against untouchability. 

Such a chain of India’s saints is reflection and result of the living society. Solutions emerge in spiritual forms for all challenges emerging in the society. Throughout entire country, there is perhaps any such rare district or taluka, where any saint’s birth has not taken place. Saints came as the solution to the grief of the Indian society. 

They transformed the society through their lives, their teachings and literature. 

The foundation of religion, philosophy and literature established during the Bhakti Aandolan, inspires us even today. During the same phase, Raheem also said-

‘Ve Raheem nar dhanya hain, 

Par upkari ang, 

Baantan ware ko lage, 

Jyon mehandi ko rang...’ 

(those people are great, 

who do good to others, 

as the person who distributes henna, 

gets its colour free.)

It means as the henna colours the hands of its distributor, similarly, those persons are themselves benefited, who do good to others, who help others. 

During this span of Bhaktikaal, many great souls like Raskhan, Surdas, Malik Mohammad Jaysi, Keshavdas, Vidyapati had emerged, who had not only shown the society its truth, but also made efforts to reform it through their speeches and literature. 

Our saints kept the importance of karma (action) in human life, human character, at highest of all. A great saint of Gujarat, Narsi Mehta said- 

wach-kachh-mann nishchal rakhe, par-dhan nav jhale haath re. 

it means, a person should always keep his words, works and thoughts sacred, should not touch others property with his hand. This thought has become very much relevant at this moment, when the country has such a big fight against the black money and corruption. 

A great social reformer, Vaseshwar, who gave the world the ideology of Anubhav Mantap or the first Parliament, said that human lives could only be enlightened through selfless Karma yoga. Involvement of self interest in social and personal conduct is the first cause of corruption. As much the selfless Karma yoga is encouraged, the corrupt conduct will come down in the society. 

Sri Madhavacharya always stressed on the fact that no work is inferior or superior. 

Works performed with honesty and sincerity is like the worship of God. 

He said that paying tax to the Government and serving the humanity are parallel to paying tax to the God. 

We can proudly say that India has such a great tradition. It has such great saints, great men, who utilised their devotion, their knowledge to change the fate of the nation, to build the nation. 

Our saints inspired the whole society to move: 

From individual to the world

From self to the community

From I to We

From Jeev to Shiv

From Jeevatma to Paramatma. 

Innumerable saints like Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Jyotiba Fule, Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Pandurang Shastri Athawale, and Vinoba Bhave have always kept India’s spiritual flow alive. They started people's movement against evil traditions of the society. 

They left the indelible marks on peoples’ opinion from ending cast feeling to people’s awareness, from devotion to peoples’ power, from ending Sati Kupratha to enhancing cleanliness, from social harmony to education and from health to literature and brought changes there. 

The great stalwart like them have given such strength to the country, which is unique and incomparable. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Due to such a great saint tradition of continuous efforts to end social evils, we have been able to keep our cultural heritage intact for centuries. Due to such a great saint tradition, we have been continuously realising the concept of national unification and nation building. 

Such saints are not limited to any particular era, but they have been influencing from era to era. 

The saints of our country have always inspired the society that if any religion is superior to any other religion, that is human religion. 

Our country, our society is facing challenges even today. Saint community and Mutts are giving huge contribution in meeting these challenges. When the saint society says that the cleanliness is God, it has more impact in comparison with any Government campaign. 

This inspires towards economic cleanliness also. If the malpractice is a challenge before the society, the modern saint community can also provide its solution. 

The saint community plays a very important role with regard to environment protection. In our culture, the trees have been considered as sensitive and alive. Subsequently, a India’s son and great scientist Dr Jagdish Chandra Bose had also proved it before the world. 

Otherwise, the world had no belief in it and they used to make fun of us. 

For us, the nature is mother, it is not for exploitation, but it is for service. At our land, there has been tradition to sacrifice own life for the sake of trees, people perform prayer prior to break even a single branch from a tree. We are being taught from childhood to be sensitive towards flora and fauna. 

After performing daily Aarati, we chant peace mantra- vanaspatayah shanti aapah shanti. But it is also a truth that this tradition has been adversely affected gradually with times. Today, the saint community will have to come forward towards this end also. The challenges of climate change can be tackled by adopting the solutions in our conduct, which have been mentioned in our epics and those are the parts of our traditions. 

Today also, you can observe that whenever the countries across the whole world find any kind of obstruction in path of the life, they ultimately look towards India’s culture and civilisation. 

In one way, the Indian culture possesses every answer to entire problems of the world. In India, it is easily acceptable that one God could be worshiped in various forms. It has been told in Rig-Veda- ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti...one super truth is being called in different names. We not only accept diversity, but celebrate it. 

We believe in ‘Vasudhaiv kutumbakam’- entire world as one family. We say- sahnavastu-sah nau bhunaktu...all are nourished, all are having power, no one has enmity to anyone. It is the only solution to radicalism. The radicalism is the root cause of terrorism, claiming its path to be only right. While in India, people of various faiths have been living for centuries, not only in principles but in practical also. We are the people who believe in equal value for all beliefs. 

I believe that if we are living together in this age of today, if we are trying to end the evils of the society, if we are making efforts towards country's growth, its major cause is our saints' inspiration of enlightenment, works and devotion. 

It is the need of today’s time that we must talk about the God of worship and nation God together; during worship we should remember our God of worship and Mother India together. I wish the saint community may continue showing the path to liberate our country from the evils, like illiteracy, unawareness, mal-nutrition, black money, corruption, which have gripped our Mother India. 

I wish that all of you will continue to let the people experience the power of life of our country through the spiritualism. All of you will be continuously strengthening the power of the people through the feeling of – Vayam amritasya putraha. With these words, I express my gratitude to all of you. 

Thanks a lot !!!

                I congratulate the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Jee for presenting an excellent Budget. It will empower the poor and live up to the expectations of all. It will provide an impetus to infrastructure, strength to the financial system and a big boost to the development. The budget has provisions to fulfill the expectations of everyone- from construction of highways to expansion of I-ways, from the cost of pulses to the data speed, from the modernization of railways to simple economic constructions, from education to health, from entrepreneurs to industry, from textile manufacturers to tax deduction. The Finance Minister and his entire team deserve praise for this historic budget. 

This Budget is a reflection of the development measures undertaken by the Government over the past two and a half years and the vision to carry forward the momentum in this direction. The merger of the Railway budget with the Union Budget is a major step. It will help in integrated planning of the transport sector. Railways can now contribute in a much better way in meeting the transport needs of the country. 

The focus of the budget is on agriculture, rural development and infrastructure which is also a reflection of the Government’s commitment to raise investment and create employment opportunities. The allocation for the schemes in these categories has been hiked substantially. The budgetary outlay for Railways and Road transport sector have also been substantially increased. Government’s aim is to double the farmers’ income by 2022 and the policies and schemes have been designed keeping this in mind. Maximum emphasis in this budget has been on the farmers, villages, poor, dalit and the underprivileged sections of the society. Agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, watershed development, Swachcha Bharat Mission are the areas which hold lots of potential to uplift the economic situation in rural India and also bring a sea change in the quality of life there. 

The Budget has laid emphasis on increasing the employment opportunities. Special allocation has been made for the sectors like Electronic manufacturing, Textiles which create new job opportunities. Provisions have been made to bring in the people working in the unorganized sector to the organized sector. Budget allocation for Skill development has been enhanced considerably keeping in mind the youth of our country and the need to gain the advantage from the demographic dividend. Record allocation –the highest ever has been made for Mahatma Gandhi National Guarantee Scheme. Women’s welfare is a priority for our Government. Budgetary outlay for the schemes related to women’s and children welfare has been enhanced. There has been a considerable hike in the allocation of budget for health and higher education. 

Housing and Construction Sector plays a major role in the growth of economy and creating new employment opportunities. This budget will provide an impetus to the housing sector in rural as well as urban areas. 

In the Railway budget, special emphasis has been on railway safety. Railway Safety Fund has been set up which will help in ensuring adequate expenditure of funds on rail safety. Capital expenditure on Railway and Road infrastructure has been hiked substantially in the budget.The Comprehensive package on digital economy will curb the tax evasion and check the circulation of black money. We have undertaken the exercise to launch Digital economy in a mission mode which will go a long way in achieving the target of 2500 crore digital transactions in 2017-18. 

The Finance Minister has brought in tax reforms and amendments which will provide relief to the Middle Class, result in setting up of industries, create job opportunities , will put an end to discrimination and will provide incentives for private investments. The move to reduce the personal income tax is significant as it touches the middle class most. Bringing down the rate from 10 to 5 percent is a bold move. Most of the taxpayers in India would be benefitted by this decision. You would have seen, my fight against black money and corruption is on. Political funding has always been a matter of discussion. Political parties are always under the scanner in this regard. The new scheme by the Finance Minister related to poll funding is along the lines of the hopes and aspirations of the people in our fight against the black money. 

The small and medium industries across the country have been a major source of employment generation. These industries have been demanding that they are facing difficulties in competing at the global level and if the taxes are lowered, then around 90 percent of our small scale industries would be benefitted. Therefore, the Government has amended the definition of Small scale industries, widened their scope and reduced the tax rate from 30 to 25 percent. This implies that over 90 percent of our Small scale industries will be benefitted. I am hopeful that this decision will help a lot in making our SSIs globally competitive. 

This budget is an important step towards overall development of the nation. It will create new employment opportunities, help in overall economic growth and will be complementary in raising the income of the farmers. In order to ensure quality of life for the citizens, the best possible facilities of education, health and housing can be organized. It is an effort to raise the purchasing power of the middle class without increasing the fiscal deficit. 

In a way, it is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to see to it that the speed with which our country is changing, gather momentum. This budget is associated with our aspirations, our dreams and in a way depicts our future. This is the future of our new generation, the future of our farmers. When I say future, it has a meaning in each of its letters. In FUTURE, the letter F stands for the farmer, U stands for Underprivileged which includes dalit, oppressed, women etc., T stands for Transparency, Technology Upgradation- the dream of a modern India, U stands for Urban Rejuvenation –the urban development, R stands for Rural Development and E stands for Employment for youth, Entrepreneurship, Enhancement to give a push to new employment and boost to young entrepreneurs. I congratulate the Finance Minister once again to present this FUTURE in the budget. It is my belief that the budget will carry forward the development agenda of the Government, generate a new climate of confidence and help the nation to scale new heights. Once again, my heartfelt congratulations to the Finance Minister and his team for the budget.

                हमारे देश के वित्‍तमंत्री अरुण जेटली जी को उत्‍तम बजट देने के लिए बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ। ये एक ऐसा बजट है जो गरीब को सशक्‍त बनाएगा बुनियादी ढॉंचे को और मजबूत भी बनाएगा, गति भी देगा हर किसी की उम्‍मीदों को अवसर देगा, अर्थ तंत्र को एक नई ताकत देगा, नई मजबूती देगा और विकास को बहुत तेजी देगा। इस बजट में हाइवे भी बने आइवे भी बढे, दाल के दाम से लेकर Data की स्‍पीड तक, रेलवे के Modernization से लेकर के सरल economic निर्माण करने की दिशा में, शिक्षा से लेकर के स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य तक, उद्यमी से लेकर उद्योग तक, Textile manufacturing से ले करके Tax deduction तक हर किसी के सपने को साकार करने का ठोस कदम इस बजट में साफ-साफ नजर आता है। इस ऐतिहासिक बजट के लिए वित्‍तमंत्री के साथ- साथ उनकी पूरी टीम भी अभिनंदन के अधिकारी हैं। 

ये बजट देश के विकास के लिए पिछले ढाई वर्ष में जो कदम उठाए गए, जो फैसले लिए गए और भविष्‍य में और मजबूती के साथ आगे बढ़ने के इरादों के बीच ये एक बहुत महत्‍तवपूर्ण कड़ी है। इस बजट को मैं देख रहा हूँ, एक अन्‍य महत्‍तवपूर्ण कदम है कि रेलवे बजट को General Budget में merge कर दिया गया है। इससे पूरे ट्रांसपोर्ट सेक्‍टर उसको Integrated planning में मदद मिलेगी। 

देश में परिवहन से जूड़ी आवश्‍यकताओं की पूर्ति में रेलवे अब अपना योगदान और बेहतरीन तरीके से कर पाएगी। ये बजट कृषि क्षेत्र, ग्रामीण क्षेत्र, सामाजिक कल्‍याण, Infrastructure इन सभी क्षेत्रों में एक विशेष ध्‍यान आकर्षित करता है। निवेश बढ़ाने और रोजगार के नये अवसर पैदा करने की दृष्टि से सरकार की जो प्रतिबद्धता है वह इस बजट में साफ-साफ नजर आती है। इन योजनाओं के लिए आवंटन में भी बहुत बढोत्‍तरी की गयी है, सरकारी निवेश को मजबूती देने के लिए रोड और रेल सेक्‍टर के लिए भी आवंटन में काफी वृद्धि की गयी है। सरकार का लक्ष्‍य 2022 तक हमारे देश के किसानों की आय डबल करने का ईरादा है, दोगुना करना है नीतियॉं एवं योजनाएं उसी प्रकार से तय की गयी हैं, बजट में सबसे ज्‍यादा जोर इस बार भी किसान, गॉंव, गरीब, दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित उनपर केंद्रित किया है। 

Agriculture, Animal husbandry, Dairy, fisheries, watershed development, स्‍वच्‍छ भारत मिशन ये सारे क्षेत्र ऐसे हैं जो गॉंव की आर्थिक स्थिति में बहुत बड़ा बदलाव भी लाएंगे और ग्रामीण जीवन जीने वाले लोगों के Quality of life में भी बहुत बड़ा बदलाव लाएंगे। बजट में रोजगार बढ़ाने पर भी भर पूर जोश दिया गया है नौकरी के लिए नए- नए अवसर पैदा करने वाले सेक्‍टर Electronic manufacturing, Textile उसको विशेष राशि दी गयी है, असंगठित क्षेत्र में काम करने वाले लोगों को, संगठित क्षेत्र में लाने के लिए भी व्‍यापक प्रावधान किए गए हैं। Skill development बजट में काफी बढोत्‍तरी की गयी है ये हमारे देश के युवाओं को ध्‍यान में रख करके और जो Demographic dividend है इसका भरपुर फायदा भारत को मिले उस पर ध्‍यान केंद्रित किया है।

महात्‍मा गांधी नेशनल रुरल गॉरेंटी स्‍कीम उसके लिए भी अब तक जितना हुआ है किसी भी वर्ष में न हुआ हो इतना रिकार्ड आवंटन किया गया है। बजट में महिला कल्‍याण पर भी विशेष ध्‍यान दिया गया है, महिलाओं और बच्‍चों से जुड़ी योजनाओं के लिए बजट में वृद्धि की गयी है, सवास्‍थ्‍य और उच्‍च शिक्षा के लिए भी बजट में काफी बढोत्‍तरी की गयी है। आर्थिक विकास में तेजी लाने और रोजगार के नए अवसर बनाने में Housing और construction Sector इसकी बहुत बड़ी भूमिका है ये बजट ग्रामीण के साथ- साथ शहरी इलाकों में भी Housing Sector को मजबूती प्रदान करने वाला है। रेलवे के बजट में एक बात पर विशेष बल दिया है और वो है रेलवे सेफ्टी फंड इस फंड की मदद से रेलवे सुरक्षा पर पर्याप्‍त धन - राशि खर्च करने में मदद मिलेगी। बजट में रेलवे और रोड Infrastructure, Capital expenditure में काफी बढोत्‍तरी कर दी गयी है। 

Digital Economy के लिए जो comprehensive package दिया गया है उससे टैक्‍स चोरी की संभावनाएं कम होंगी और अर्थ व्‍यवस्‍था में काले धन के प्रवाह पर नियंत्रण संभव होगा। Digital Economy को एक मिशन के तौर पर शुरू किए जाने से आने वाले वर्ष में 2017-18 में दो हजार पांच सौ करोड़ Digital transaction के बड़े लक्ष्‍य को प्राप्‍त करने में बहुत बड़ी मदद मिलेगी। हमारे वित्‍तमंत्री जी ने कर प्रणाली में जो सुधार और संशोधन किए हैं उससे मध्‍यम वर्ग को राहत मिलेगी उद्योगों की स्‍थापना होगी, रोजगार के अवसर मिलेंगे, भेद-भाव के अवसर खत्‍म होंगे और सबसे महत्‍तवपूर्ण पहलू है कि निजी निवेश को प्रोत्‍साहन मिलेगा। 

बजट में वैयक्तिगत Income Tax कम करने की घोषणा देश के मध्‍यम वर्ग को ज्‍यादा स्‍पर्श करती है, बड़ी महत्‍तवपूर्ण है। 10 प्रतिशत से एकदम 5 प्रतिशत कर देना बड़ा साहसपूर्ण निर्णय है। करीब-करीब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के अधिकतम कर दाताओं को इससे बहुत बड़ा लाभ होने वाला है। आपने देखा होगा बजट में कालेधन और भ्रष्‍टाचार के खिलाफ मेरी लड़ाई निरंतर चल रही है। Political Funding की चर्चा हमारे देश में बहुत होती रही है, राजनीतिक दल हमेशा चर्चा के घेरे में रहे हैं, चुनाव के अंदर Donation एकत्र करने की नयी योजना भी वित्‍तमंत्री जी ने देश की आशा और आकांक्षा और काले धन के खिलाफ अपनी लड़ाई के अनुरूप प्रस्‍तुत की है। देश के छोटे और मध्‍यम उद्योग नौकरी के नए अवसर पैदा करने के सबसे बड़े स्रोत हैं। इन उद्योगों की पूरानी मॉंग रही है कि Global competition में वैश्विक स्‍तर पर मुकाबला करने में उनकों कठिनाइयां आ रही हैं। अगर इसके लिए टैक्‍स कम किया जाए तो हमारे लघु उद्योग जो कि करीब-करीब 90 प्रतिशत से ज्‍यादा हैं, देश में और इसलिए सरकार ने छोटे-छोटे उद्योगों को और उसमें परिभाषा में बदलाव करके उनके दायरे को भी बढाया है और टैक्‍स को भी 30 प्रतिशत से घटा करके 25 प्रतिशत कर दिया है। यानि देश के उद्योग जगत के 90 प्रतिशत से ज्‍यादा लोग इसका लाभ ले पाएंगे। ये फैसला मुझे विश्‍वास है कि देश के छोटे उद्योगों को Globally competitive बनने में बहुत बड़ी मदद करेगा। 

ये बजट देश के विकास के लिए एक मजबूत कदम है इस बजट से रोजगार के नए अवसर पैदा होगें संपूर्ण आर्थिक विकास में मदद मिलेगी किसानों की आमदनी बढ़ाने में ये पूरक होगा। नागरिकों को उनकी Quality of life को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए शिक्षा, स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य, आवास ये सारी चीजों में अति अच्‍छी सुविधा की संभावना बढ़ेगी और बिना वित्‍तीय घाटा बढ़ाए देश के मध्‍यम वर्ग के पास उसकी खरीद शक्ति बढ़े उसके जेब में ज्‍यादा पैसे आएं। उस दिशा में प्रयास है, एक प्रकार से ये बजट हमारा देश जो बदल रहा है उसको और अधिक तेजी से बदलने का प्रयास एक प्रकार से हमारे स्‍वपनों से जुड़ा हुआ, हमारे संकल्‍पों से जुड़ा हुआ, ये बजट एक प्रकार से हमारा Future है। हमारी नयी पीढ़ी का Future है, हमारे किसान का Future है और जब मैं Future कहता हॅूं तब उसका मेरे मन में एक meaning है। F से Farmers किसानों के लिए; U से underprivileged दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित, वंचित, महिला उनके लिए; T से Transparency पारदर्शिता Technology का Up gradation, आधुनिक भारत बनाने का स्‍वपना; U से Urban Rejuvenation शहरी विकास के लिए; और R से Rural Development ग्रामीण विकास के लिए; और E से नौजवानों के लिए Employment उद्योग साहसियों के लिए Internship, Enhancement नए रोजगार को बढ़ावा देने के लिए नौजवान उद्यमियों को बढ़ावा देने के लिए मैं इस बजट के लिए इस Future को प्रस्‍तुत करते हुए वित्‍तमंत्री जी को फिर से एक बार बधाई देता हूँ, और देश वासियों को उनके स्‍वपने साकार करने की दिशा में ये बजट एक बहुत बड़ी सहाय व्‍यवस्‍था है जो देश को आगे भी बढ़ाएगा। विकास की नयी ऊंचाइयों को पार करेगा और देश में एक नया विश्‍वास का महौल बनाने में ये बजट बहुत ही उपकारक होगा। ऐसा मेरा पूरा विश्‍वास है, फिर एक बार वित्‍तमंत्री को, वित्‍त मंत्रालय को उनकी पूरी टीम को हृदय से बहुत-बहुत बधाई।

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved: 
(i)               the Establishment of  Food Legumes Research Platform (FLRP) at Amlaha, Sehore, Madhya Pradesh  with Satellite Hubs in West Bengal (for pulses) and Rajasthan (for  Natural Resource Management) by ICARDA in the second phase; by  International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA);
 
(ii)             Signing of lease deed with State  Government of Madhya Pradesh for the land provided by them (70.99  hectares, 175.42 acre) at Amlaha Farm, Sehore on land rent of Rs. 1 per  acre per year for 30 years on lease and to further lease it to ICARDA to  establish the FLRP at Madhya Pradesh;
 
(iii)            ‘In principle’ approval of the Cabinet  for conferring on the Food Legume Research Platform of ICARDA an  international status as contemplated in Clause 3 of the United Nations  (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.
 
(iv)            Authorizing the Department of  Agricultural Research (DARE) on behalf of Government of India in all  matters regarding establishment of the Platform.
 
(v)             Authorizing the Ministry of Agriculture  to carry out technical modifications in the Supplementary Agreement  signed between ICAR and ICARDA relating to establishment of FLRP, if  required. 
 
            The establishment of FLRP in India will  enable India to harness the best of international science in meeting the  emerging food security challenges. India would be able to rapidly and  effectively absorb the research output achieved in the country by FLRP. A  major international R&D institution will make India an even bigger  center for agricultural research in the world and this in turn, will  attract further research & development investment in the country.  
            This  is a research set up by an international organization. ICARDA has a  good track record of innovation, as in climate resilient technologies  including suitable food legume varieties for dry-land production  systems. ICARDA will carry out research through a multi-disciplinary  team of scientists for enhancing productivity of crops range-land and  livestock. This platform will contribute significantly towards reducing  poverty, improving food security, improving nutrition and health, and  sustaining the natural resource base.    
The research output would benefit farmers  of all regions, whether big, small or marginal; and as technologies  developed would be eligible for use by all farmers, the project is  equitable and inclusive.

The  Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  approved a proposal to introduce a Bill in Parliament to extend the  jurisdiction of the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008 to Jammu &  Kashmir on statistics relevant to any matters under any of the entries  specified in the List-I (Union List) and the List- III (Concurrent List)  in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, as applicable to Jammu  & Kashmir under the Constitution (Application to Jammu &  Kashmir) Order, 1954. The Amendment will strengthen data collection  mechanism in the State of Jammu & Kashmir.
 
The Amendment will:
 
(a)  Provide  for extending the jurisdiction of the Act to Jammu & Kashmir State  in respect of matters not reserved for the State as per the Constitution  (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954;
 
(b)  Provide  for appointing a nodal officer at the Centre and in each State/Union  Territory to effectively coordinate data collection activities and  provide consultation to Government Departments for avoiding unnecessary  duplication, etc.
 
Background
 
The  Collection of Statistics Act, 2008 was enacted to facilitate the  collection of statistics on economics, demographic, social, scientific  and environmental aspects etc. The Act extends to the whole of India,  except Jammu & Kashmir. The Jammu & Kashmir State legislature  enacted the Jammu & Kashmir Collection of Statistics Act, 2010,  which extends to the whole of the State of Jammu & Kashmir and is  almost a replica of the central legislation. The Collection of  Statistics Act, 2008 and the Jammu & Kashmir Collection of  Statistics Act, 2010 are not applicable to statistical subjects falling  in the Union List, as applicable to the Jammu & Kashmir under the  Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order 1954. This has  created a legislative vacuum. Moreover, the concurrent jurisdiction to  be exercised by the Centre in Jammu & Kashmir has also not been  provided for, in the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008. The amendment  is intended to address this vacuum.

The  Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modihas  approved the acquisition by the State Bank of India of its subsidiary  banks namely State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad,  State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of  Travancore.  
The  Cabinet also approved the introduction of a Bill in Parliament to  repeal the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 and the  State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956.
The  merger is likely to result in recurring savings, estimated at more than  Rs. 1,000 crore in the first year, through a combination of enhanced  operational efficiency and reduced cost of funds.  Existing customers of subsidiary banks will benefit from access to SBI’s global network.  The  merger will also lead to better management of high value credit  exposures through focused monitoring and control over cash flows instead  of separate monitoring by six different banks.
The acquisition under Section 35 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 will result in the creation of a stronger merged entity.  This will minimize vulnerability to any geographic concentration risks faced by subsidiary banks.  It will create improved operational efficiency and economies of scale.  It will also result in improved risk management and unified treasury operations.  
            The  acquisition of subsidiary banks of State Bank is an important step  towards strengthening the banking sector through consolidation of public  sector banks.  It is in pursuance  of the Indradhanush action plan of the Government and it is expected to  strengthen the banking sector and improve its efficiency and  profitability.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  approved 'Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan' (PMGDISHA) to  make 6 crore rural households digitally literate.  The outlay for this  project is Rs.2,351.38 crore to usher in digital literacy in rural India  by March,.2019. This is in line with the announcement made by Finance  Minister in the Union Budget  2016-17. 

PMGDISHA is expected to be one of the largest digital literacy  programmes in the world. Under the scheme, 25 lakh candidates will be  trained in the FY     2016-17; 275 lakh in the FY 2017-18; and 300 lakh  in the FY 2018-19. To ensure equitable geographical reach, each of the  250,000 Gram Panchayats would be expected to register an average of  200-300 candidates. 

Digitally literate persons would be able to operate computers/digital  access devices (like tablets, smart phones, etc.), send and receive  emails, browse internet, access Government Services, search for  information, undertaking cashless transactions, etc. and hence use IT to  actively participate in the process of nation building. 

The implementation of the Scheme would be carried out under the overall  supervision of Ministry of Electronics and IT in active collaboration  with States/UTs through their designated State Implementing Agencies,  District e-Governance Society (DeGS), etc. 

  Background:

As per the 71st NSSO Survey on Education 2014, only 6% of rural  households have a computer. This highlights that more than 15 crore  rural households (@ 94% of 16.85 crore households) do not have computers  and a significant number of these households are likely to be digitally  illiterate. The PMGDISHA being initiated under Digital India Programme  would cover 6 crore households in rural areas to make them digitally  literate. This would empower the citizens by providing them access to  information, knowledge and skills for operating computers / digital  access devices. 

As the thrust of the Government is on cashless transactions through  mobile phones, the course content would also have emphasis on Digital  Wallets, Mobile Banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Unstructured  Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System  (AEPS), etc.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  has given its approval for amendments in (i) the Constitution (Scheduled  Castes) Order, 1950 to modify the list of Scheduled Castes of the State  of Odisha, and (ii) the Constitution (Pondicherry) Scheduled Castes  Order, 1964 so as to change name of the Union Territory from Pondicherry  to Puducherry in the Order.  The Bill namely Constitution (Scheduled  Castes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2017 incorporating the above changes  will be introduced in the Parliament.
Proposal of Sualgiri, Swalgiri caste, as per approved Modalities,  was found to be eligible for its inclusion as a synonym of Sabakhia  caste at SI. No. 79 in the list of Scheduled Castes of Odisha. Further,  the name of Union territory of Pondicherry has been changed to  Puducherry vide the Pondicherry (Alteration of name) Act, 2006 w.e.f.  01.10.2006. Accordingly, an amendment is needed in the Constitution  (Pondicherry) Scheduled Castes Order, 1964 to this effect.
The Government approved Modalities in June 1999, as amended in June  2002, for considering proposals in regard to modifications in the lists  of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. According to the approved  Modalities, amending legislation to the concerned Constitution Order is  proposed only in respect of such proposals of the concerned State  Government/Union Territory Administration, which have been agreed to  both by the Registrar General of India (RGI) as well as the National  Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC).
The Constitution of India provides certain privileges / concessions  to the members of Scheduled Castes which are notified under the  provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution of India.   First list of  Scheduled Castes in relation to a State or Union Territory is to be  issued by a notified Order of the President after having consultation  with the State Government concerned. Any subsequent inclusion in or  exclusion from the list of Scheduled Castes can be effected through an  Act of Parliament as envisaged under clause (2) of Article 341.
Six Presidential Orders were issued between 1950 and 1978 for  specifying Scheduled Castes in respect of various States/Union  territories. These Orders have been amended from time to time by Acts of  Parliament enacted as per Article 341(2) of the Constitution between  1956 and 2016.
After the Bill becomes an Act, members of the community included in  the list of Scheduled Castes will be able to derive benefits meant for  Scheduled Castes under the existing schemes. Some of the major schemes  of this kind include Post Matric Scholarship, National Overseas  Scholarship, Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship, Top Class Education,  Concessional Loans from National Scheduled Castes Finance and  Development Corporation, Hostels for SC Boys and Girls etc. In addition  to above, they are also entitled to the benefits of reservation in  services and admission to educational institutions.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today approved the enhancement of capacity from 20,000 MW to 40,000 MW of the Scheme for Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects. The enhanced capacity would ensure setting up of at least 50 solar parks each with a capacity of 500 MW and above in various parts of the country. Smaller parks in Himalayan and other hilly States where contiguous land may be difficult to acquire in view of the difficult terrain, will also be considered under the scheme. The capacity of the solar park scheme has been enhanced after considering the demand for additional solar parks from the States. 

The Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects will be set up by 2019-20 with Central Government financial support of Rs.8100 crore. The total capacity when operational will generate 64 billion units of electricity per year which will lead to abatement of around 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year over its life cycle. 

It would also contribute to long term energy security of the country and promote ecologically sustainable growth by reduction in carbon emissions and carbon footprint, as well as generate large direct & indirect employment opportunities in solar and allied industries like glass, metals, heavy industrial equipment etc. The solar parks will also provide productive use of abundant uncultivable lands which in turn facilitate development of the surrounding areas.

All the States and UTs are eligible for benefits under the scheme. The State Government will first nominate the Solar Power Park Developer (SPPD) and also identify the land for the proposed solar park. It will then send a proposal to MNRE for approval along with the name of the SPPD. The SPPD will then be sanctioned a grant of upto Rs.25 Lakh for preparing a Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the Solar Park. Thereafter, Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of up to Rs. 20 lakhs/MW or 30 percent of the project cost including Grid-connectivity cost, whichever is lower, will be released as per the milestones prescribed in the scheme. Solar Energy Corporation India (SECI) will administer the scheme under the direction of MNRE. The approved grant will be released by SECI.

The solar parks will be developed in collaboration with State Governments/UTs. The State Governments/UTs are required to select the SPPD for developing and maintaining the solar parks.

Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is already implementing a scheme for development of at least 25 solar parks with an aggregate capacity of 20,000 MW, which was launched in December 2014. As on date, 34 solar parks of aggregate capacity 20,000 MW have been approved which are at various stages of development.

 The  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister  Shri Narendra Modihas given its approval to award contract in 31  contract areas (23 on onshore and 8 in offshore) of discovered small  fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Limited  (OIL).    
Award  of contract is expected to provide faster development of fields and  facilitate production of oil and gas thereby increasing energy security  of the country.   
These  areas were discovered long back but these discoveries could not be  monetized due to various reasons such as isolated locations, small size  of reserves, high development costs, technological constraints, fiscal  regime etc. 
It  is expected that in-place locked hydrocarbons volume of 40 Million  Metric Tonnes (MMT) oil and 22 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) of gas will be  monetised over a period of 15 years.  The production from these contract areas will supplement the domestic production.  
For  early monetization of these fields, in September, 2015, Cabinet  approved 69 marginal fields for offer under Discovered Small Fields  Policy.  Out of these, 67  Discovered Small Fields were clubbed into 46 contract areas and put on  offer through online international competitive bidding.  A total of 134 e-bids were received for 34 contract areas.  A total of 47 companies submitted their bid, out of which 43 are Indian companies and rest four are foreign companies. 
These contract areas have been awarded under the new regime of Revenue sharing Model.

                 Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik inaugurated the World Integrated Medicine Forum on Regulation of Homeopathic Medicinal Products: National and Global strategies in New Delhi today. Speaking on the occasion, the AYUSH Minister said that in India, Homoeopathy has been well institutionalized and we have 235 homoeopathic hospitals and more than 8000 clinics in public sector. He said that most of production plants in India are GMP-compliant and adhere to policies related to quality, packaging and distribution. He further said that all these manufacturing units are bound by Drugs & Cosmetics Law and their renewal of license depends on regular quality check and thorough inspections.
In his inaugural address, Shri Shripad Naik remarked that there is clearly a need for a high-level strategic exchange platform, where stakeholders can meet outside their immediate work related context and this forum could address that need. In the other countries Homoeopathy remains largely under-utilized due to lack of availability of homoeopathic medicines or stringent or non-existent regulatory provisions for these medicines, the Minister added.
Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Sh. Ajit M. Sharan also expressed his happiness that the Ministry, through CCRH, could demonstrate global leadership by hosting this unique event.  Director General, CCRH, Dr. Raj K. Manchanda, hoped that this forum could provide impetus to further dialogues for strengthening regulatory framework worldwide, to assure that the users of Homoeopathy could have wider access to quality-assured homoeopathic medicines. Dr. Robbert van Haselen, Director of the WIMF and also the international consultant for the forum, thanked the Government of India for spearheading this challenging task of bringing together the regulators and homeopathic industrialists from so many countries on a common platform to exchange their concerns and issues.
On this occasion an MoU was also signed between Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States (HPCUS) and Indian bodies – Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (PCIM&H) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) on cooperation in the field of Homoeopathic Medicine.  It is hoped that this agreement will be a benchmark for many more agreements to follow with the aim to develop and harmonise homoeopathic pharmacopoeias and to strengthen regulatory provisions for homoeopathy in the whole world.
            The two day event is organised by Ministry of AYUSH and  Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH) and supported by Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (PCIMH) & Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). This is the first-of-its-kind forum considering the increased perception of the international world towards India as a key player in the progress of the homoeopathy drug industry. Drug lawmakers, regulators, manufacturers and pharmacopeial experts from various regulatory authorities, eminent scientific organisations and pharmaceutical industries  from 25 countries, are participating in the two days forum to strategize the  actionable aspects in the homoeopathic drug industry, which, in turn, will promote global harmonisation in the sector.
Through this forum, regulators from more than 15 countries including France, Germany, Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India etc .will share the current status, challenges and outlook with regard to the regulation of homeopathic products. At least 15 international industries manufacturing homoeopathic medicines and more than 30 Indian industries are participating and interacted with the drug regulators and controllers. Regulators and drug controllers of various states of India are also particpaing in the Forum. Forum discussions will explore the commonalities as well as differences in regulatory affairs among various countries. The common concern is how to promote regulatory practices that met the highest modern standards, whilst at the same time respected the unique tradition of homeopathy worldwide.
Major points of discussion will include current regulatory status in different countries; practices and possible trade opportunities in key countries worldwide; possible solutions to regulatory challenges; building knowledge and network to deal more efficiently with challenges at national and global level and a strategic perspective on the possibilities and limitations of what can be achieved at a national level via further international collaboration and harmonization.  
In India, homoeopathic medicines are regulated by Drugs & Cosmetics Act & Rules. All pharmaceutical industries are legally bound to comply with these rules, which, in turn, assures safety and quality of homoeopathic medicines. Further, these industries adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) that further assure accredited production, packaging and distribution. In that sense, India has a relatively well-established regulatory framework for Homoeopathy. However, the implementation of these Acts and Rules are sometimes challenging at the end of the pharmaceutical industries, and despite their best efforts to comply, some practical challenges remain that come in their way.
Homoeopathy is one of the most followed medical systems in India and its strength lies in the fact that its medicines are gentle, safe as well as cost-effective. In the era of growing adverse drug reactions and auto-immune and lifestyle-related illnesses, Homeopathy has a crucial role to play in the well-being of mankind. The use of homoeopathy is steadily growing in India and as per an analysis by Ministry of AYUSH, this sector exhibited an annual growth rate of 26.3% in the past year, the highest among the other AYUSH modalities.

One of  the highlights of the forum will be exchange of Memorandum of  Understanding among Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United  States (HPCUS) and Indian bodies – Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian  Medicine & Homoeopathy (PCIM&H) and Central Council for Research  in Homoeopathy (CCRH) on cooperation in the field of Homoeopathic  Medicine.

In that sense, India has a relatively  well-established regulatory framework for Homoeopathy. However, the  implementation of these Acts and Rules are sometimes challenging at the  end of the pharmaceutical industries, and despite their best efforts to  comply, some practical challenges remain that come in their way.
On  the other hand, the international scenario of regulations of  homoeopathic medicinal products is also varied and in many countries,  the regulatory provisions are either non-existent or minimalist, thereby  advocating reforms in policies for wider accessibility of quality  homoeopathic products. 
Homoeopathy  is one of the most followed medical systems in India and its strength  lies in the fact that its medicines are gentle, safe as well as  cost-effective.

Public Health being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide health care services lies with the respective State/UT Governments. However, Government of India through Centrally Sponsored scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) facilitates the promotion of AYUSH in the country including urban, semi urban and rural areas as per the following activities:
 
(i) Co-location of AYUSH facilities at Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs).
(ii) Up gradation of exclusive State Government AYUSH Hospitals and Dispensaries.
(iii) Setting up of up to 50 bedded integrated AYUSH Hospital.
(iv) Upgradation of State Government Educational Institutions.
(v) Setting up of new State Government AYUSH Educational Institutions including Yoga and Naturopathy in the State where it is not available.
(vi) Strengthening of State Government/ Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) Pharmacies and Drug Testing Laboratories (DTL).
(vii) Cultivation and Promotion of Medicinal Plants.    
 
With these measures, the Ministry has been able to expand its visibility and scope of AYUSH in the country significantly. There are 771468 AYUSH registered practitioners throughout the country as on 01.01.2016 who contribute to AYUSH health care services in the country including urban, semi-urban and rural areas. However, the data on para-medic staff for AYUSH systems of medicine is not maintained by the Central Government. 
 
With regard to funds allocation for promotion of AYUSH, budgetary allocation of Rs. 1326.20 Crore has been made to Ministry of AYUSH for various activities for the year 2016-17.
This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri ShripadYesso Naik in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.

The Centre of Integrative Oncology (CIO) was inaugurated today at the National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research  (NICPR) at Noida on the eve of  world Cancer Day (4th February). The Centre was inaugurated by Dr. Saumya Swaminathan, Secretary, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare & Director General, Indian Council for Medical Research and Shri Ajit M. Sharan, Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH in the presence of Prof. Ravi Mehrotra, Director, NICPR-ICMR.
Addressing the inaugural session, Shri Sharan said that the first idea about collaboration between AYUSH and NICPR was given by a team of scientists from USA. This collaboration will definitely lead to development of novel drugs for cancer prevention and management.  Shri Sharan further informed that  5 Senior Research Fellowships and 5 Post-doctoral  fellowships will be released every year (in both modern medicine and Ayurveda) to facilitate quality research in the country in the area of cancer research.
Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, added that Bridge courses will be introduced for the practitioners who will be working in Centers of integrative medicine. She said, evaluation of risk factors for cancer should be thoroughly done, especially focusing on dietary risk factors. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan gave thrust on extensive research of natural systems of medicine since they follow a holistic approach, unlike the allopathic one. 
The main objective of the Centre is to build collaborations in the areas of cancer prevention, research and care in an integrated approach involving both modern and traditional medicine. This would pave the way to carry forward the ongoing bilateral dialogue and facilitate collaboration with stake holders, both national and international, like National Cancer Institute, USA. The setting up of this Centre is an outcome of the deliberations held in Indo-US Workshop on 3-4th March 2016 organized by Ministry of AYUSH, where the invited US delegates from Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute deliberated with the eminent experts from India with expertise in Cancer research and other promising areas for two days to share experiences and work out a road map for future collaborations. The Centre would be the clearing house for information for AYUSH projects on cancer research and management. Prof. Abhimanyu Kumar, Director, All India Institute of Ayurveda along with eminent cancer specialists including Prof. G. K Rath (AIIMS, New Delhi), Dr. Preetha Rajaraman (US-NCI), Bhawana Sirohi (London), and Dr D. C Katoch (AYUSH) were also present on this occasion.

                In its thirty ninth flight (PSLV-C37), ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch  Vehicle successfully launched the 714 kg Cartosat-2 Series Satellite  along with 103 co-passenger satellites today morning from Satish Dhawan  Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota. This is the thirty eighth consecutively  successful mission of PSLV.  The total weight of all the 104 satellites  carried on-board PSLV-C37 was 1378 kg. 

PSLV-C37 lifted off at 0928 hrs (9:28 am) IST, as planned, from the  First Launch Pad.  After a flight of 16 minutes 48 seconds, the  satellites achieved a polar Sun Synchronous Orbit of 506 km inclined at  an angle of 97.46 degree to the equator (very close to the intended  orbit) and in the succeeding 12 minutes, all the                       104 satellites successfully separated from the PSLV fourth stage in a  predetermined sequence beginning with Cartosat-2 series satellite,  followed by INS-1 and INS-2. The total number of Indian satellites  launched by PSLV now stands at 46. 

After separation, the two solar arrays of Cartosat-2 series satellite  were deployed automatically and ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking and Command  Network (ISTRAC) at Bangalore took over the control of the satellite. In  the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational  configuration following which it will begin to provide remote sensing  services using its panchromatic (black and white) and multispectral  (colour) cameras. 

Of the 103 co-passenger satellites carried by PSLV-C37, two – ISRO Nano  Satellite-1 (INS-1) weighing 8.4 kg and INS-2 weighing 9.7 kg – are  technology demonstration satellites from India.  

The remaining 101 co-passenger satellites carried were international  customer satellites from USA (96), The Netherlands (1), Switzerland (1),  Israel (1), Kazakhstan (1) and UAE (1). 

With today’s successful launch, the total number of customer satellites  from abroad launched by India’s workhorse launch vehicle PSLV has  reached 180.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Indian Space Research  Organisation (ISRO) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been  signed on July 09, 2016  for cooperation in the exchange  and  use of  satellite remote sensing data. Under this MoU, USGS is facilitating  availability of data of Indian region using American remote sensing  satellites viz. Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 to ISRO. ISRO is facilitating  availability of data of US region using Indian remote sensing satellite  ‘Resourcesat-2’ to USGS.
The sharing of each other’s satellite remote sensing data provides  enhanced frequency of earth observation data to both organisations. The  AWiFS payload (onboard Resourcesat-2) enables USGS to acquire earth  observation data every 5 days. The Landsat satellites enable ISRO to  acquire multi-spectral earth observation data including thermal data.   These data sets help both countries to carry out applications in the  field of natural resources inventory & management and disaster  management support.

Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is planning to deploy a rover on the lunar surface in the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
The Chandrayaan-2, India’s second mission to the Moon, is a totally  indigenous mission comprising of an Orbiter, Lander and Rover. After  reaching the 100 km lunar orbit, the Lander housing the Rover will  separate from the Orbiter. After a controlled descent, the Lander will  soft land on the lunar surface at a specified site and deploy a Rover.
The six-wheeled Rover will move around the landing site in  semi-autonomous mode as decided by the ground commands. The instruments  on the rover will observe the lunar surface and send back data, which  will be useful for analysis of the lunar soil.  Collection of soil and  rock sediments is not planned in this mission.
ISRO is working towards the launch of Chandrayaan-2 during the first quarter of 2018.

                In the last two decades, there has been a continuous increase in  availability of Radiation Oncology facilities for cancer care in India  and the number of treatment units (Linear Accelerators and Telecobalts)  have increased from less than 250 in year 1995 to approximately 552  units in 2015. The newer Radiation facilities, though lesser than the  actual requirement in the country, do have advanced facilities for  catering to radiotherapy cancer treatment. The Radiation Oncology  community within India has utilized the available infrastructure to  develop a strong scientific programme for radiation treatment delivery  in India across academic centres of excellence.   

The radioisotopes produced by use of nuclear energy are being  effectively utilized in the fields of medicine (both diagnostic and  therapeutic), agriculture and industry.   Radioisotopes applications are  on increasing trend world over in medical treatment, agriculture etc.  Since radioisotopes are produced in reactors, increase in the numbers of  reactors will increase the availability of indigenously made  radioisotopes in medical treatment and agriculture. DAE also has  developed technology in recovering Cs137 radioisotope from the  radioactive waste generated from the fission products of the reactor,  which has got application in medical field. BARC has a major  agricultural research programme on improvement of oilseeds, pulses,  wheat and rice using radiation-based mutation breeding methods for the  past several decades. Already 42 varieties of different crops have been  developed by BARC that include groundnut (15 varieties), mustard (3  varieties), soybean (2 varieties), sunflower (1 variety), mungbean (8  varieties), uridbean (5 varieties), pigeonpea (5 varieties), cowpea (1  variety) and 1 variety each of rice and jute. These crop varieties are  endowed with one or more improved and desirable attributes such as  higher yields, early harvesting, large seed sizes, along with resistance  to biotic and abiotic stresses. These crop varieties are notified and  released to the Indian farmers for commercial cultivation in the  country. The farmers’ feedback about these varieties from various states  is extremely good as these are tailored to suite the agro-climatic  conditions of the regions of cultivation. The seeds are available from  the State Seed Corporation, National Seed Corporation, various  agricultural state universities and also institutes of Indian Council of  Agricultural Research. Some companies are also exporting seeds of these  varieties to other countries. 

The Atomic Energy Act, 1962 empowers the Government to produce, develop,  use and dispose of atomic energy either by itself or through any  authority or Corporation established by it or a Government company. In  this regard, an indigenous sequential three-stage nuclear power  programme based on optimum utilization of the country’s nuclear  resources of modest uranium and abundant thorium is being pursued. Large  capacity nuclear power reactors based on foreign cooperation are also  being implemented as additionalities, for faster capacity addition. In  addition, the Government has taken the following measures to facilitate  nuclear power capacity addition: 

•	In principle approval of sites to locate nuclear power plants in future. 

•	Creation of India Nuclear Insurance Pool to cover the Operator’s  Liability as prescribed under the provisions of the Civil Liability for  Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010. 

•	Amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 to facilitate establishment  of Joint Venture Companies (JVC) by Nuclear Power Corporation of India  Limited (NPCIL) with other Central Public Sector Undertakings to set up  nuclear power plants.

                Department  of Atomic Energy (DAE) is putting up a 5000 cubic meter per day (5.0  MLD) seawater desalination plant in Odisha’s coastal district of Ganjam,  adjacent to Gopalpur, through MoU mode between Bhabha Atomic Research  Centre (BARC) and Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL), a Public Sector  Undertaking under DAE.  A 6300 cubic meter per day (6.3 MLD) Nuclear  Seawater Desalination plant has already been commissioned and is in  operation at Kalpakkam, Chennai along Bay of Bengal in IGCAR, DAE  premises which is in operation since 2002 and now also is in operation  at designed capacity and availability factor.  The site at Ganjam  district, Odisha has been considered since it is located on the  coastline of Bay of Bengal (only 750 meters away from shore line) and a  drought prone zone facing acute water shortage.  There is no proposal at  present to set up desalination plant in coastal area of Maharashtra.  Capacity of the plant at Odisha is 5000 m3/day (5.0 MLD) at a cost of Rs 112.90 crore.
Necessary financial sanction of Rs 112.90  crore has been issued by the Government for the OSCOM plant. All the  statutory clearances, namely, OSPCB (Odisha State Pollution Control  Board), MoEF-CRZ (Ministry of Environment & Forests- Coastal  Regulation Zone), AERB (Atomic Energy Regulatory Board) are obtained and  MoU between BARC and IREL has been signed.

At present, the Site Selection Committee of  the Government is exploring the possibility of identifying a suitable  coastal site in Andhra Pradesh for locating nuclear power plants with  Russian cooperation.
            
Some sections of local people and certain  groups have expressed their opposition to location of nuclear power  plants near Kavali in Andhra Pradesh due to apprehensions about safety  of the nuclear power plants and loss of traditional means of livelihood.  An  extensive public outreach programme (including public hearings and  consultations) to spread awareness about nuclear power and all its  related aspects based on a multipronged approach has been instituted in a  structured manner. 
 
The Government of Andhra Pradesh has given  its consent to carry out technical studies required to identify  potential coastal sites for locating nuclear power plants in the state.

The Kudankulam  reactors deploy passive safety features, namely the Passive Decay Heat  Removal System, additional system for Core Passive Flooding, Passive  Filtering Systems, etc. Post Fukushima, a task force of NPCIL  constituted for safety evaluation found KKNPP design to be safe.  However, to enhance further the safety level, the task force suggested  17 recommendations, all of which have been implemented.  These measures have already bolstered the safety systems and are the most current. 
A site at  Haripur in West Bengal has been accorded ‘in principle’ approval by the  Government for locating six units of 1000 MW or higher capacity in  technical cooperation with Russian Federation. Subsequently, as an  alternative to the Haripur Site, the possibility of a coastal site in  the state of Andhra Pradesh is also being examined by the Site Selection  Committee of the Government to locate nuclear power plants with Russian  technical cooperation.

The share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation in the country was about 3.4% in the year 2015-16. 
The share of nuclear power in total  electricity generation is planned to be progressively increased by  addition of nuclear power capacity. The present capacity of 5780 MW will  reach 6780 MW by the end of this financial year, with the commercial  operation of Kudankulam Unit-2, which is already generating infirm power  at the rated capacity. The capacity is expected to reach 9580 MW by  2020 on progressive completion of projects under construction and about  12980 MW by 2024 on completion of new projects accorded sanction. A  large expansion programme based on both indigenous technologies and with  foreign technical cooperation is planned in future.

Proposals for setting up of ten indigenous  Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors each of 700 MW and two Light Water  Reactors each of 1000 MW (Kudankulam Units-5&6) with foreign  cooperation have been prepared and finalised. These are presently under  consideration of the Government for accord of administrative approval  and financial sanction.            
Presently two Central Public Sector  Enterprises viz. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and  Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI) are involved in  nuclear power generation. In addition, the Government has amended the  Atomic Energy Act, 1962 to facilitate establishment of Joint Venture  Companies (JVC) by NPCIL with other Central Public Sector Undertakings  to set up nuclear power plants.  
Government does not propose to allow private sector to enter into the nuclear power sector.

Government has received request from  Government of Tamil Nadu to expedite early commissioning of Unit II of  Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) and make it fully operational.
 
The second  unit of Kudankulam project (KKNPP-2 - 1000 MW) was connected to the  grid on August 29, 2016 and has since been generating infirm (non  commercial) power. Thereafter, the unit power was raised in steps in  line with regulatory clearances and it reached its full power of 1000 MW  on January 21, 2017. It has generated about 1325 Million Units of  electricity (upto January 23, 2017) since its connection to grid.            
The allocation and expenditure on the KKNPP 1&2 project in the last three years (in ₹ crore) is as follows:

The Commission had notified on 27-01-17 the period during which conducting any exit poll and publishing or publicizing by means of print or electronic media or disseminating results in any other manner would be prohibited during the current elections, specifying the period between 7 AM on 04-02-17 and 5.30 PM on 08-03-17 .
Now, it has been brought to the notice of the Commission that the Dainik Jagran Newspaper has published result of exit polls conducted by a company by the name of Resource Development International (I) Pvt. Ltd. on the first phase of elections in UP, through their website.  
Therefore, the reported violation by the Resource Development International (I) Pvt. Ltd. and Dainik Jagran by conducting the exit poll and dissemination of results amount to offence under Sections 126A and 126B of RP Act, 1951 as well as offence under Section 188 of IPC. The offence also amounts to disobedience to Order duly promulgated by the Commission. 
The Commission has decided to take stringent action against the perpetrators of this serious violation of the Provisions of Section 126A of R. P. Act, 1951 to uphold the law to ensure the smooth conduct of free and fair elections. Accordingly, the Commission has directed that the District Election Officers of each of the districts covered under the first phase of poll and Lucknow shall immediately file FIR against the Managing Director and/or such other authorities of RDI and Dainik Jagran including the Managing Editor/Editor in Chief/Editor/Chief Editor of the Newspaper under Section 188 of IPC read with Section 126A and 126B  of RP Act, 1951.
Under sub-section 3 of Section 126 A of R.P. Act, 1951, Offence under Section 126A is punishable by imprisonment for a term up to 2 years or with fine or both.  Section 126B provides that if the offence is committed by a company, every person who is in charge of and is responsible for conduct of the business of the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and face punishment. 
Commission while reiterating its directions, makes it clear that it will not hesitate to take stern legal action in the event of any violations of the above mentioned legal provisions.

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh inaugurated India’s Western Regional Agriculture Fair – 2017 in Bikaner today. 
Shri  Singh, while addressing the people, said that most of the blocks in  Rajasthan have gone into dark zones. In such circumstances, the  scientists are to develop such techniques and high yielding varieties of  seeds which are adaptable with lesser quantity of water. He further  said that the farmers and agriculture scientists should work together  for the utilization of every drop of water in agriculture. The Minister  of Agriculture briefed this today on the eve of inaugural function  organized in the complex of Swami Keshwanand Rajasthan Krishi  University, Bikaner on the occasion of Indian Western Regional  Agriculture Fair 2017.
The  Minister of Agriculture said that the government has initiated Pradhan  Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to channelise maximum potential for  irrigation and to get rid of the problems related to drought. He added  that the scheme aims at water for every farm. The government has started  another ambitious programme titled as Soil Health Card Scheme for the  farmers. Now, the farmers will be capable to get the knowhow of  nutritious elements existed in their soil resulting in better production  on their farms.
The  Minister of Agriculture further said that Government of India has fixed  an ambitious target for making the farmers income double in the next  five years. To achieve this target, the out of box initiative has been  taken instead of traditional system. Towards this, the establishment of  National Agriculture Mandi E-NAM portal is an revolutionary initiative  for the farmers with which farmers can sale their agricultural products  on better prices in any of the mandis.
Shri  Singh said that the agriculture budget for 2017-18 has been increased  to Rs. 51,026 crores from Rs. 44,250 crores in the previous year. A  separate fund has been set up amounting to Rs. 20,000 crores meant for  irrigation with the assistance of NABARD. The government has increased  agriculture loan up to Rs. 9 lakh crore this year which would enable the  farmers to get more loans. He added that till 2013-14 under National  Food Security Mission, only 3 crops – rice, wheat and pulses were  covered. Now, seven crops viz. rice, wheat, pulses, jute, sugarcane,  cotton and cereals have been covered under the mission. 
Thereafter  the Minister of Agriculture addressed the people in a function  organized in Veterinary and Veterinary Science Univeristy, Rajasthan  (Rajuvas), Bikaner. He said that for the first time in the country a new  initiative titled as Rashtriya Gokul Mission has been initiated with  the allocation of Rs. 500 crore for preserving and promoting the  domestic species of bovines under National Bovine Breeding and Dairy  Development Programme. Under this mission, 14 Gokul Villages are being  set up and 35 Animal Breeding Centers are being made sophisticated by  providing the bulls of improved species with the assistance of more  funds. Further, 3629 bulls have been allocated for genetic improvement.
Shri  Singh further said that government had incurred only Rs. 45 crores  during 2007-08 to 2013-14 for the growth of the domestic species of  bovines whereas the existing government has sanctioned a sum of Rs.  582.09 crores for 35 proposals obtained from 27 states only within a  span of 1½ years by December, 2015. This amount has been multiplied 13  times more during two last years. Two new National Kamdhenu Breeding  Centres (each in Madhya Pradesh – North India and Andhra Pradesh – South  India) are being established for which Rs. 50 crore have been allotted.  
The  Minister of Agriculture said that for removing the shortfalls of  trained veterinary physicians, the strength of veterinary colleges has  been increased from 36 to 46 and the strength of the students to be  admitted in these colleges has been increased from 60 to 100. He further  said that the number of total seats in 17 veterinary colleges have been  enhanced from 1914 to 1334. The number of veterinary post graduate  students has been increased up to 1½ times more. Even 1½ times more  seats have been enhanced in veterinary colleges. Extensive modifications  have been made in Veterinary Minimum Standards Regulations, 2008 to  transform the existing graduate veterinary courses and parameters as per  the approved standards on global level. 
Shri  Singh further added that new scheme – National Bovine Productivity  Mission has been started in November 2016 with the amount of Rs. 825  crores. This scheme is comprised of four components – Pashudhan  Sanjivini Nakul Swasthya Patra, Unnat Prajanan Taknik, Rashtriya Desi  Nasal Genomic Kendra, e-Pashudhan Haat. He further added that outbreaks  have been reduced from 377 to 109 as compared to the year of 2013 by  dint of the improved techniques for the treatment of foot and mouth  diseases of animals under Animal Health Improvement Programme.
On  this occasion, Minister of Agriculture briefed that total milk  production during 2015-16 was 52.21 million ton which increased to 54.50  million ton in 2016-17. An increase of 4.38% has been recorded in the  area of milk production. During 2015-16 the total production of eggs was  27.33 billion which increased up to 29.09 billion during 2016-17. An  increase of 6.42% has been recorded in eggs production. During 2015-16,  the production of meat was 2.24 million ton which enhanced to 2.23  million ton in 2016-17. An increase of 8.74% has been recorded in meat  production.
Shri Singh briefed that Government of India has taken a decision to celebrate 3rd December as Agriculture Education Day to commemorate the anniversary of 1st  President and Agriculture Minister of India, Bharat Ratna, Dr. Rajendra  Prasad, for inspiration of youth. Similarly, it has been decided to  celebrate 15th October as Women Agriculture Day. He further  informed that the report of 5th Dean Committee on ICAR is being  implemented from academic session of 2016-17. Three new Central  Agricultural Universities have been established. Simultaneously two new  IARI (Jharkhand, Assam) are also being set up. The government has  decided to implement Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Improved Agriculture  Education Scheme in 100 education institutes of the country so as to  promote agriculture education on grass root level. He added that record  310 new species of crops have been released this year and 663 Krishi  Vigyan Kendras have been set up to make the agriculture and livestock  techniques accessible to the farmers.

The Integrated Sample Survey is a regular sample survey under taken on a general principle of 15% sample basis across the country. The sample Villages/Urban wards are selected from the entire rural and urban areas of States/UTs and the survey is conduct by the States/UTs in three seasons. The list of latest Livestock Census villages constitutes the sampling frame. As per general principle, for the estimation of livestock numbers, 15% (5% for each season) of the villages/urban wards will be selected in the form of two independent sub-samples in a State for complete enumeration of livestock and poultry population by using Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR). Subsequently, 5 samples will be selected from each of the sub-sample to carry out detailed survey for the estimation of yield rates. The number of sample will increase or decrease according to the number of villages in each district. 
2.         Period of Survey: The Survey period for rainy season was 1st July, 2016 to 31st October, 2016. 
3.         Key Findings: The key finding of the survey is summarised as under:

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan  Singh met H.E. Shri Jon Georg Dale, Norwegian Minister for Agriculture  today in New Delhi. On this occasion, Shri Singh said that India and  Norway have traditionally close relations and our efforts will be to  maintain the same in future. Shri Radha Mohan Singh further said that  bilateral cooperation in fisheries between India and Norway has grown  and there is ample potential for furthering relationship in this sector.  

Shri Singh said that both countries can cooperate on developing and  introduction of climate smart fishing techniques; to explore and develop  technologies to capture underutilized fish resources; to increase the  export of marine products. Shri Singh further said that Norway may also  consider cooperation in the field of dairying for increasing the yield  of milk in India. 

The Agriculture Minister appreciated the research work being done on  CLIMAWATER, CLIMARICE and ClimaAdapt in Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and  Tamil Nadu states in India by Norwegian Institute of Bio-economy  Research (NIBIO), Ministry of Agriculture. ClimaAdapt focuses on climate  change in the Agriculture and water sectors. Shri Singh hoped that  Norway may consider extending the research programme to other states  also. 

Shri Singh stated that India’s trade in agricultural commodities with  Norway in 2014-15 included US$ 17.65 million in exports which increased  to US$25.57 million the next year.  Imports were of the order of US$  2.48 million in 2015-16.  Both the countries can, however, do much more  in bilateral trade. 

India is a signatory of the Global Crop Diversity Trust since 2006 to  ensure the long-term conservation and availability of plant genetic  resources for food and agriculture to achieving global food security and  sustainable agriculture. Accordingly, Government of India has deposited  25 accessions of pigeon pea (Arhar) to Svalbard Global Seed Vault in  2014 for safety duplication.

Availability  of certified/quality seeds increased in the country due to the policy  initiatives of the government: Agriculture Minister
Besides  vegetables, there is great potentiality to export hybrid maize, paddy,  pearl millet and cotton seeds to SEI & African countries: Shri Singh
Indian seed industry has the potential to become a major industry to supply quality seeds in global markets: Shri Singh
 
The  Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan  Singh today spoke about National Farmer Policy of the Union Government  and said that the objective of this policy is to accelerate agricultural  output, develop infrastructural facilities in the villages, promote  value addition, expedite the growth of agro-business, create employment  in the rural areas, ensuring better livelihood status of the farmers and  agriculture workers and their families, discourage migration to urban  areas and face the challenges emerging out of economic liberalization  and globalization. Shri Radha Mohan Singh stated this on the inaugural  function of Indian Seed Congress – 2017, in Kolkata today. The  theme of Seed Congress is “Seed of Joy” which is very much in line with  vision of this government to bring happiness and prosperity in the  lives of farmers by doubling their farm income by 2022.

Shri Singh  further said that the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation &  Farmers Welfare has asked the State Governments to prepare variety wise  seed rolling plants to meet year wise, season wise requirements of  quality seeds. This seed rolling plant will fulfil the double purpose of  improving the Seed replacement rate along with Variety replacement rate  so that sustainable agricultural production and productivity could be  ensured. 
Agriculture  Minister further said that Indian Seed Market is growing fast and  during the recent past, hybrid seed market of vegetables and cereals has  shown remarkable growth. Shri Singh was of the view that Indian Seed  Industry can emerge as a prominent industry for supplying seeds in  international markets. India has great potentiality to produce hybrid  seeds specially costly vegetable seeds on cheap rates as compared to the  seeds of the other countries. Apart from vegetables, the hybrid seeds  of maize, paddy, pearl millet and cotton may be exported to SEI and  African countries in magnitude. 
Shri  Singh further added that the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers  Welfare is continuously attempting to streamline the regulatory  framework in order to make it transparent, substantial and progressive.  The Minister assured the representatives present that Central Government  is making all out efforts to help them to grow even more, both  domestically and in the international arena. 
Shri  Singh on this juncture said that under the able guidance of Hon’ble  Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, a number of schemes have been  initiated. Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi  Sinchai Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi  Vikas Yojana, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Soil Health Scheme, Neem  Coated Urea and E-National Agriculture Mandi Scheme’s aim at to bring  improvement in crop productivity as well as income of the farmers. 
Shri  Radha Mohan Singh said that the opportunities of employment have been  created for the skilled men and women and the girls in the field of  agriware housing, cold chain, supply chain, dairy, poultry, meat,  fisheries, horticulture, agriculture mechanization as well as micro  irrigation. Skill India Mission is being implemented for imparting  opportunities as well as skills to the rural youth in rural areas. 
Agriculture Minister placed emphasis on 7  points programmes laid down by Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra  Modi to make the income of the farmers double. The details thereof are  as follow:
•                    Big focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of “per drop-more crop”
•                    Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field
•                    Large investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post-harvest crop losses
•                    Promotion of value addition through food processing
•                    Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and e-platform across 585 stations
•                    Introduction of a new crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost

                The Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that cooperative societies have provided inputs like credit, fertilizer, seed and have established themselves in many fields of Indian economy such as dairy, banking, sugar, fertilizer, marketing, handloom, fisheries and housing. Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said this at Golden Jubilee celebrations of Cooperative Institution, IFFCO in Motihari, today. IFFCO is completing its 50 years of establishment on the 3rd November, 2017.
Shri Singh has said that IFFCO came into existence with only 57 cooperative societies in the year 1967-68 but, today, it is one of the largest cooperative societies of India. Now, it has more than 36,000 cooperative societies. Its business is spread over from general insurance to rural telecommunication apart from manufacturing and sale of manure. Agriculture Minister said that through its vast network, IFFCO is rendering its services to about 5.5 crores of farmers. IFFCO has extended its international involvement through important memorandum of understanding and agreements for supply of raw materials to many international fertilizer industries. He said that IFFCO is working for the prosperity of the farmers after providing environment friendly and real time reliable, high quality agricultural products and services. IFFCO is implementing several schemes and programmes for their welfare.
Shri Singh further added that the present government of the centre is committed to the development and strengthening of the cooperatives. The government has formed NCDC keeping in view of the importance of cooperatives in rural economy and it caters to the several dimensions and necessity of the cooperatives. Agriculture Minister said that there are more than 249 million of members of cooperatives in India in which 6.10 lakh cooperative societies and more than 71% rural families are the members of the cooperatives. Cooperatives have provided direct and indirect employment to about 23.86 millions of people. 
Shri Singh hoped on this occasion that the production of the farmers will increase from the profitable schemes of IFFCO and it will help to get them additional income. The Minister said that cooperative societies should be made strong democratically and by providing occupational services to the farm labourers, we will have to make the rural people strong. Agriculture Minister also praised the Managing Director of IFFCO, Dr. U.S. Awasthi and his team for the best efforts and assured every possible assistance to the IFFCO.

                To understand the impact of demonetization on farming sector, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research (NIAP) conducted a short survey of farmers in few villages around Delhi under Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav (MGMG) initiative. Survey findings could not establish any significant adverse effect of demonetization on input availability, market arrivals of produce and area sown in Rabi season. As per preliminary reports received from the States, the total area sown under Rabi crops as on 27th January, 2017 stands at 637.34 lakh hectares as compared to 600.02 lakh hectares this time in 2016 indicating no significant impact of demonetization on Rabi sowing.
 
In order to achieve the target of doubling of income of farmers by March 2022, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary, for the following aspects:
 
i)          To study the current income level of farmers/ agricultural labourers
ii)         To measure the historical growth rate of the current income level
iii)        To determine the needed growth rate to double the income of farmers/agricultural labourers by the year 2021-22
iv)        To consider and recommend various strategies to be adopted to accomplish (iii) above
v)       To recommend an institutional mechanism to review and monitor implementation   to  realise   
             the goal
vi)       To examine any other related issue.
 
The Committee has held five meetings so far to evolve a suitable strategy.
This information was given by the Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Parshottam Rupala, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Budget has provided security coverage to agriculture sector as well as farmers: Shri Singh
Budgetary provision of Rs. 45,250 crore for the year 2016-17 has now been increased by 15.31% to Rs. 51,026 crore for the year 2017-18
 
Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that this time it has become very clear again that the Central Government is working for the villages, the poor and farmers. Shri Singh further added that agriculture growth rate has increased from 2% to 4.1% and it shows that the government is working seriously for the betterment of the farmers and farming. The commitment of the Government to double the income of the farmer in 5 years has been under scored in this budget. Shri Singh said this in an informal talk with journalist in the Ministry. On this occasion, Union Agriculture Minister informed the journalist in detail the provision made for agriculture sector in the budget.
Shri Singh said that this budget manifests government’s commitment to double the farmers income in a span of 5 years. Apart from this, provisions have been made to continue erstwhile schemes. Goals of White and Blue Revolution have been reiterated in this budget. Ambitious schemes have been chalked out to promote the agriculture sector in this budget. For instance, a sum of Rs. 9000 crores have been provided for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana resulting in the enhancement of crop security coverage to the farmers.
Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister said that this budget has provided security coverage to agriculture sector as well as farmers. The government has made up its mind to dig one million ponds. This is a praise worthy step. By providing irrigation and fisheries facilities through these ponds, the farmers will be helped to double their incomes.  In the previous year, 5 lakh ponds have been built. Besides, this budget aims to provide 100 employment days to the farmers through MNREGA which is also a praise worthy step.  To promote “per drop more crop”, those areas will also be provided water for irrigation which were earlier deprived of this facility through long term irrigation fund.
Shri Singh informed that budgetary provision of Rs. 45,250 crore for the year 2016-17 was made for Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare which has now been increased by 15.31% to Rs. 51,026 crore for the year 2017-18. The Minister highlighted the following provisions of the Budget:
·        While accelerating the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, 40% agricultural area will be brought under the scheme this year. It was 30% in the previous year. Similarly, it will be increased to 50% for the year 2018-19. During the previous year, there was a budget provision of Rs. 5.5 thousand crores which will be increased to Rs. 9000 crore during this year. Simultaneously, an additional sum of Rs. 7.7 thousand crores has also been provided during this year for the dues of previous year.
·        Soil Health Card – for all 648 KVKs, a provision has been made to establish mini soil testing labs. 1000 labs will be activated through local entrepreneurs. Loan related subsidy will be provided for this purpose by the government. 
·        e-NAM – at present, 250 mandis are linked with e-NAM platform which will be increased to 585 mandis.

Pursuing Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Affordable,  Quality Healthcare for All, Government of India has issued the  notification for fixing the ceiling prices of coronary stents, informed  Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary  Affairs, Shri Ananthkumar here today. The step would bring down the cost  of coronary stents by about 380%, the Minister added.  

Shri Kumar informed that now the ceiling prices of Bare Metal Stents  (BMS), having 10% market share, has been capped at Rs. 7,260 and Drug  Eluting stents (DES), having 90% market share, at Rs. 29,600. These  prices are exclusive of VAT and other local taxes. The Minister further  stated that since most of the States have 5% VAT on stents, the MRP of  BMS and DES would be Rs.7623 and Rs. 31,080.  National Pharmaceutical  Pricing Authority (NPPA) has fixed the prices within 60 days as  required, he added.  

Informing that the step is a major decisive action on the unethical  margins charged at each stage in the supply chain of coronary stents,  the Minister stated that the new prices are not likely to make much  adverse impact on industry.  The average MRP in the market for BMS was  Rs. 45,000 and for DES Rs. 1,21,000.  This has been reduced to Rs. 7623  for BMS and Rs. 31,080 for DES. Thus, based on price reduction, patients  will get average benefit of 80-90 thousand per stent resulting into a  gross relief of Rs. 4450 crores in one year.  

Shri Kumar informed that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare  included Coronary Stents in the National List of Essential Medicines,  2015 (NLEM, 2015) on 19th July 2016 and the Ministry of Chemicals and  Fertilizers incorporated Coronary Stents in Schedule I of the Drug  Prices Control Order (DPCO), 2013 on 21st December 2016.  

Shri Kumar informed that the Ministry, after reviewing the  recommendation of Ministry of Health, had directed the NPPA to hold  multi-stakeholder consultations with industry and industry associations,  manufacturers, importers, hospital associations, distributors’  associations, doctors and NGOs and other civil society members for  fixing the ceiling prices of coronary stents. All the data provided by  industry was put on NPPA website and major options for price fixation  and prices put in public domain for consultation.  The new ceiling  prices decided by the Government have taken into account interests of  all the stakeholders.  

Shri Kumar assured that he will write to the Ministry of Health and  Family Welfare to keep a check on increase the price of procedure,  doctor’s fee and prolong the patients’ stay by hospitals to make up for  losses it and also ensure that price reduction is passed on to patients.  He also said that the prices of all stocked stents will have to be  revised according to the new ceiling price. The Minister laid stress  that the landed price/manufacturing cost of imported BMS is Rs. 5415 and  for DES is Rs. 16,918, hence the ceiling prices have been set taking  into account the ethical profit margins and R&D costs of each member  of the supply chain of coronary stents.  

Shri Kumar also added that in case of serious violations of the ceiling  prices, the NPPA has the authority to recover the overcharged amount  along with 15% interest. For addressing the grievances of the common  people, the Minister informed that the Ministry has already started two  mobile apps, Pharma Jan Samadhan and Pharma Sahi Daam, on which  aggrieved person can register complaints and the Ministry would act  swiftly to resolve it.  

Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are major cause of death in India, about  25% of total deaths.  Out of these, 90-95% CVD deaths happen due to  coronary artery diseases. As per the report of National Commission on  Macroeconomics and Health, prevalence of CAD in India is about 61.5  million as per 2015 report. As per Health Ministry report, more than 3.5  lakh procedures were done in 2015 which used 4.73 lakh stents.  In  2016, the figure of cardiac stent must have been above 5 lakhs.  Presently market size of India made stents is roughly 30%. The Minister  thus stated that the new ceiling prices will promote ‘Make in India’ in a  big way and seeing the huge number of patients and future requirement,  foreign companies will also try to make in India for cutting costs and  remain competitive.  

Other dignitaries present on the occasion were Shri Jai Priye Prakash,  Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Shri Bhupendra Singh,  Chairman, NPPA and Smt. Sharmila Mary Joseph, Member Secretary, NPPA.

                Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri Ananth Kumar addressed the media here today and appraised the gathering about the achievements of Department of Chemicals, Fertilizers and Pharmaceuticals during the last three years. Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Shri Mansukh Lal Mandaviya was also present on the occasion. 
 
Speaking on budget allocations for the Fertilizer sector, the Minister said that the overall budget allocation for the Department of Fertilizer for the year 2017-18 is 74,235 crores. He added that Fertilizers, along with Power, has been the torchbearer of achievement of this Government. It has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the last quarter. Further, to reduce the burden of fertilizer subsidy backlogs, a Special Banking Arrangement of Rs. 10000 crores has been approved in this Budget to clear fertilizer subsidy dues, the Minister informed.
 
Shri Ananthkumar stated that the Government has taken key measures to make the country self-sufficient in urea and other fertilizers like promoting energy efficiency in urea production, maximizing indigenous urea production, timely import of urea and other fertilizers, prepositioning of fertilizers with the States during lean season to ensure adequate supply in the season and rationalizing the subsidy. Such steps have resulted in highest ever production of 245 LMT of urea previous year, without adding additional capacity. Indigenous urea as well as imported urea have been neem coated. This has resulted in an increase in farm yield with less urea required and helped check black marketing and hoarding of urea, he added.
 
Regarding the revival of the Gorakhpur, Sindri units of FCIL and Baruni unit of HFCL, the Minister informed that approval of the Cabinet has been obtained to revive the three units. Cabinet approval has also been obtained for setting up of new ammonia urea complex at Namrup within existing premises of Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizers Corporation Limited. Further, the Talcher plant will be the first ever unit to be revived based on the coal gasification technology, he added.
            
Keeping in pace with the international market, the Department has engaged fertilizers companies to reduce the prices of DAP, MOP and complex fertilizers by Rs. 125, 250 & 50 respectively per 50 gm bag from June, 2016. Prices of DAP has again been reduced by Rs. 65 per 50gm during December, 2016. 
            
Informing about the implementation of policy of promotion of city compost, Shri Ananthkumar said that the Government of India approved policy on promotion of city compost in which Marketing Development Assistance (MDA) of Rs. 1500/MT has been provided for scaling of production and consumption of city compost. A budget provision of Rs. 15 crores has been made for releasing the MDA during 2017-18 on sale of city compost.
            
Speaking about the Direct Benefit Transfer in fertilizer subsidy payment it was informed by the Hon’ble Minister that a decision to implement the DBT in fertilizer sector was announced during the budget speech of 2016-17 with a view to improve service delivery to farmers. The proposed DBT model in fertilizers is different from conventional system of continue to receive urea at statutory price and P&K fertilizers at subsidized prices in the market. The fertilizers companies used to receive subsidy on receipt of fertilizes at the district, will now get subsidy after the fertilizers are sold to farmers/ beneficiaries by the retailers to point of sale (POS) machines through biometric authentication.
            
In the Pharmaceutical sector, the Minister informed that under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) over 760 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are functioning across the country. With the Government’s target to achieve 3000 JAKs, every tehsil would have one JAK soon. Currently over 450 medicines and 150 health supplements are available at around one-third the price of branded drugs at the JAKs. Further, the Minister that Medical devices parks are coming up at four locations including Vishakhapatnam, Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) and others in Gujarat and Telangana. Shri Kumar also informed about the coming up of National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), the latest been set up at Jhalawar, Rajasthan. These institutes would lead to path breaking research in pharma sector and give a boost to creating a strong force of pharma scientists in the country.
 
Talking about achievements in Chemicals & Petrochemicals sector, Shri Kumar informed about the focus of the government on establishing Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET) and Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIRs) and plastic parks to give a boost to the Make in India mission. This step would lead to the generation of over 39 lakh employments opportunities in times to come, he added. Answering a question on strategic sales of Fertilizer PSUs, Shri Kumar informed that strategic sale is a method of utilizing the excess land resources available with loss making fertilizer PSUs to mitigate all liabilities and aid in the revival of the plant in turn. This would have no effect on the availability of affordable medicines in the market, he added.
 
Other dignitaries present at the occasion were Shri Anuj Kumar Bishnoi, Secretary Chemicals & Petrochemicals, Shri Jai Priye Prakash, Secretary, Pharmaceuticals, Smt. Bharathi Sihag, Secretary, Fertilizers, along with other senior officers of the Ministry.

Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today, said that the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) being implemented in fertilizer subsidy payment is slightly different from the normal DBT being implemented in LPG subsidy. The Minister informed that under the DBT in fertilizer sector, the subsidy will be released to the fertilizer companies instead of the beneficiaries, after the sale is made by the retailers to the beneficiaries. 
 
Shri Mandaviya further explained that at present direct transfer of subsidy to beneficiaries like in LPG cannot be introduced in fertilizer sector as the beneficiaries and their entitlement is not clearly defined.  Multiple subsidized products, urea and 21 grades of Phosphatic & Potassic fertilizers have different subsidy rates. The subsidy rate in respect of urea varies from company to company due to different production processes, energy efficiencies of plants, vintage etc. As the amount of subsidy in some fertilizers, particularly urea is more than double the MRP, it will be a huge financial burden on the farmers to pay the MRP and subsidy upfront and receive the subsidy amount subsequently, he added.
 
The Minister informed that the pilot project to introduce DBT in Fertilizer Sector has been undertaken in 16 districts as given below:

Air India continuously monitors the market developments, performance of  its flights and carries out studies with an objective to withdraw, to  introduce new routes or increase or decrease frequency on existing  routes.  Air India has withdrawn flights which were not meeting their  fuel and variable cost.  However, Air India analyses the reasons for the  losses and based on the strategic importance of such services to its  network arrives at a decision whether to continue or withdraw such  services.  While determining the desirability or otherwise of  discontinuing services of loss making services, Air India takes into  account the revenue contributions made by the subject services to its  other services by way of feeder traffic. As such non-profitability of  any one flight is not taken in isolation as the sole barometer of its  financial performance. 

The Government had approved a Turnaround Plan (TAP) / Financial  restructuring Plan (FRP) for operational and financial turnaround of Air  India.  The TAP/FRP provides equity infusion of Rs.30231 crores upto  2021 subject to achievement of certain milestones as laid down in the  TAP/FRP.  The Company has made substantial progress in both Operational  as well as Financial Areas as per TAP milestones.  As a part of the  Turnaround Strategy for Air India Ltd., the company with the overall  support of the Government  has initiated a number of steps in order to  cut costs and losses.

Air India has acquired 23 ‘Dreamliners’ progressively from September,  2012 to 9th January, 2017. The Dreamliner aircraft have experienced  technical reliability issues, since induction into Air India fleet.   These issues, however, do not adversely affect the safety of the  airplane due to the system design and in-built system redundancy.  Further, regular improvements are incorporated as a part of reliability  enhancement process. 

One B787-8 aircraft will be delivered in July, 2017, two B787-8 aircraft  in August, 2017 and the 27th B787-8 aircraft will be delivered in  October, 2017.

                Air India over the past few years and especially since the implementation of the Turnaround Plan by the Govt. has been constantly improving its operational as well as financial performance.  In the Financial Year 2015-16, the company has posted an Operating Profit of Rs.105 crores.  In the Financial Year 2016-17 also the company has been steadily improving its all round performance and it is expected that the company would again post an improved Operating Profit margin in the current year also.
 
However, liquidity constraints continue to impact the smooth performance of the company, the impact of which have been met by the Equity infused by the Government.  In this connection the company has been making constant efforts for substituting its high cost working capital loans with long term low cost debt.   Air India has been in consultation with various banks in this direction so that the interest costs can come down substantially in the coming years.
 
The Government had approved a Turnaround Plan (TAP) / Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) for operational and financial turnaround of Air India. The TAP/FRP provides equity infusion of Rs.30231 crores upto 2021 subject to achievement of certain milestones as laid down in the TAP/FRP. The Company has made substantial progress in both Operational as well as Financial Areas as per TAP milestones. As a part of the Turnaround Strategy for Air India Ltd., the company with the overall support of the Govt. has initiated a number of steps in order to cut costs and losses.

            The first  Executive Development  Programme of Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University was inaugurated by the Minister for Civil Aviation Shri  Ashok Gajapathi Raju in the capital today.  Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that the Aviation University   should play  the important role of spreading  knowledge and see that  it is applied practically in the growth of the Aviation sector.  Shri  Raju pointed out  that  skill development was a key of the growth of the Aviation sector which  is likely to see an increase in demand for skilled workers   in the years to come .  He  also asked  the University to co-ordinate its activities with the Aviation Academy.
 
            The Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha said that   to have  better  infrastructure and transportation facilities in the country, it was  necessary to close the gap of increasing demand for trained and skilled  people   in the Aviation sector.  In the present scenario people are looking for jobs and  airlines are looking for trained persons, he added.  Shri Jayant Sinha also advised the university to be innovative and include research programmes.
            Secretary for Ministry of Civil Aviation, Shri R.N. Choubey said that the   Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University  should not only organize training courses but  also act as a think tank for the Aviation sector.  
The  Vice Chancellor of the University Shri Nalin Tandon in his welcome  address said that the Executive Development Programme and Management  Development Programme had been  structured after conducting detailed workshops with the industry and other stakeholders.  He informed that  the first Executive Development Programme on Aviation Management is  being conducted by the University in collaboration with Indo US –  American Cooperation Program. The programme is being attended by senior  leadership from the Indian aviation sector to include air operators,  airport operators, ancillary service providers and regulatory  authorities.
India  is on the cusp of exponential growth in the aviation sector and a  critical need was felt for India to invest in research and innovation in  the aviation milieu in order to ensure that the growth is protected and  to develop into a global aviation hub. The establishment of Rajiv  Gandhi National Aviation University is therefore a step by the Ministry  of Civil Aviation towards promoting this growth on a sustainable basis  and building a foundation on which India’s aviation sector shall be  showcased to the rest of the world.  
Key  learning outcomes from premier Indian institutions have been drawn to  build Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University into a world class  university and a centre of excellence for aviation education and  research that is focused at meeting industry needs and skill  requirements.
This  University is the first of its kind in the country that has been  established to promote aviation studies and research to achieve  excellence in areas of aviation management, policy, science and  technology, aviation environment, training in governing fields of safety  and security regulations on aviation and other related fields to  produce quality human resources to cater to the needs of the aviation  sector that is witnessing a massive transformation and growth. 
The  University is planning the launch of its flagship programme in 2018 at  its campus in Fursatganj, Rae Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.  A number of Management Development Programmes have also been planned and shall be conducted in  subsequent years.

Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines chaired a meeting of the parliamentary consultative committee attached to the Ministry of Coal and the Ministry of Mines on the issues of “mines safety in coal mines’ and ‘initiatives in exploration regime’ respectively in New Delhi last evening. The Secretary Mines Shri Balvinder Kumar and the Secretary Coal Shri Susheel Kumar presented their reports for the information of the members on the respective subjects of their ministries. 
The Members of the Committee were apprised of the ‘Initiatives in Exploration Regime’ in the Mines Ministry after it brought about far reaching changes in the mining sector since January 2015 when the Amendment Act of 2015 made the amendments to the MMDR Act 1957. The most important feature of this amendment is the grant of Mining Leases (ML) and Prospecting License-cum-Mining Lease (PL-cum-ML) only through an auction process. The Rule also specifies that for auction of mining lease, at least general exploration (G2) is required to be completed and for auction of composite license, at least preliminary exploration (G3) is to be completed. The Amendment Act removed the earlier provision of Reconnaissance Permit (RP) and provided for Non-Exclusive Reconnaissance Permits (NERP). The holder of such NERP would not be entitled to make any claim for the grant of any PL-cum-ML or a ML. To encourage exploration, the amended Act abolished the restriction on lease transferability and allowed the transfer of mineral concessions held by leaseholders to any person eligible to hold such lease. 
Further, amended MMDR Act has established National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) and the holder of a Mining Lease or PL-cum-ML would pay to the Trust, a sum equivalent to 2% of the royalty paid in terms of the second schedule. The Trust is aimed to support regional and detailed exploration and related activities for development of exploration.  The Act also has provisions for notifying organizations by the Central Government for exploration without licences. As of today, 13 such organizations and PSUs have been notified under this provision. The Act further has provisions for easy transferability of concessions obtained through auctions so as to attract private investment and FDI.
The compelling need to provide an impetus to exploration activity in the country at this juncture has prompted a thorough review of the Government’s Exploration Policy and strategy. Keeping in view the immense untapped mineral potential of the country, it was realised that there are many areas that need further facilitation and added emphasis is required for attracting investments and private exploration agencies in regional exploration. Accordingly, the new National Mineral Exploration Policy has been notified in July 2016 with a view to provide a new set of objectives, sense of purpose and direction within the amended legal framework. It is aimed at attracting private exploration agencies, and has the following main features:
(i)     The Government will make available pre-competitive baseline geoscientific data free of charge. Geological, geochemical and geophysical data and maps on 1:50K will be provided in public domain.
(ii)   Aero-geophysical survey of the country with a flight height of 80m and line spacing of 300m will be carried out in a mission mode under the National Aerogeophysical Mapping Project (NAGMP). Initially, the potential areas will be covered in three years and the data placed in public domain.
(iii)  A National Geoscientific Data Repository (NGDR) will be set up.  It will comprise all baseline and mineral exploration information generated by diverse exploration agencies. 
(iv)  Regional exploration of identified blocks by private exploration agencies through competitive bidding on an attractive revenue sharing basis.   
(v)   Government will launch a special initiative to probe deep-seated/concealed mineral deposits in the country aimed at characterizing India’s geological cover, resolving the metallogenic evolution, and detecting the distal footprints of deep-seated ore deposits.
The organizations under the Ministry of Mines engaged in mineral exploration viz. the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd. (MECL) are actively working towards fulfilling these objectives. 
On the issue of ‘Mines Safety in Coal Mines’, Mines Act 1952 is the mother Act to ensure regulation of labour and safety in mines. To match the pace of technological advancement in various aspects of mining and related safety issues the Directorate General of Mine Safety (DGMS) takes care by issuing circulars and emphasising incorporation of Risk Management process in the mining activity. The members were informed about the measures taken by the Coal Ministry after the recent accident in Rajmahal Open Cast project of Eastern Coalfields Limited on 29.12.2016. A number of issues concerning safety in coalmines were deliberated upon and members contributed their useful suggestions.   
The Members of Lok Sabha who participated in the meeting included Shri Hari Manjhi, Shri Kaushlendra Kumar, Shri Lakhan Lal Sahu, Shri Laxmi Narayan Yadav, Shri Midhun Reddy, Shri Ram Tahal Choudhary, Shri Ramchandra Paswan, Shri Ravindra Kumar Pandey, Shri Santosh Kumar and Shri Vishnu Dayal Ram.     The Members of Rajya Sabha present in the meeting were Dr. Anil Kumar Sahani         , Dr. Bhushan Lal Jangde, Smt. Chhaya Verma and Smt. M.C. Mary Kom.

Coal  India Limited (CIL) has surrendered two prospecting licenses held by its  subsidiary Coal India Africana Limited in Mozambique and presently does  not hold any foreign coal assets. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal,  Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy  and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today. The  Minister further stated that CIL is scouting for acquiring coking coal  assets abroad, as India is faced with constraints of techno-commercially  viable domestic coking coal reserves. The recent spurt in global coal  prices, particularly for coking coal, is expected to create an  encouraging scenario for such acquisition process, the Minister added.
The Minister further said that since CIL, at present does not have  any assets abroad, the comparative analysis between coal mines in India  and coal mines abroad can not be ascertained.

The provisions of Mines Act, 1952, Subordinate Rules and Regulations made thereunder are being administered for ensuring the safety in coal mines by Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS).  Coalmine owners are responsible for implementing these provisions.   This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today. The Minister further stated that these provisions are reviewed from time to time by DGMS taking inputs from experience of officials of DGMS, industry & academic institutions and the recommendations of the tripartite committees.

India’s bilateral trade with the Republic of Croatia during  2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 were US$ 148.86 million, US$ 205.04 million  and US$ 148.44 million respectively.  The bilateral trade during the  last three years has remained stable despite global slowdown.

                 Small tea growers in West Bengal and Kerala have shown their interest to export their produce to foreign countries on their own. So far four applications have been received in the Tea Board for issue of export license from organizations promoted by small tea growers and one registered small tea grower has been issued tea export licence.
 
            In order to motivate small tea growers to work as collectives by formation of self Help Groups (SHGs), financial assistance is provided under the Small Growers component of the “Tea Development & Promotion Scheme” being implemented by the Tea Board. The Self –Help Groups are encouraged to supply green leaf directly to the factory for better price realization. So far, 332 SHGs of small tea growers have been formed. Further, in order to encourage the small tea growers to have their own tea manufacturing factories and get better price for their produce, the Tea (Marketing) Control Order, 2003 has been  amended and mini tea processing factories have been exempted from obtaining any registration/ no objection certificate.

                Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology is mandated to  assist in the promotion of e-commerce. As regards trade related issues,  the subject of ‘Internal trade’ has been allocated to Ministry of  Consumer Affairs. Further, issues relating to Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI) in the country are administered by Department of Industrial Policy  & Promotion.  

Information Technology Act 2000 provides legal recognition for the  transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange and  other means of electronic communication, commonly referred to as  ""Electronic Commerce"", which involve the use of alternatives to paper  based methods of communication and storage of information. The  e-commerce companies have to comply with the Companies Act and other  applicable laws of the country. Such companies with FDI can operate only  in activities which are specifically permitted as per the ‘Consolidated  FDI Policy Circular of 2016’, which is available at the website of  Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion at www.dipp.nic.in.  Further, activities of e-commerce companies inter alia involve  compliance of Shops and Establishment Act of the State concerned. 

Furthermore, Consumer Protection Act, 1986, has been enacted to better  protect the interests of the consumers. It covers all goods and services  and all mode of transactions including e-commerce. Under the provision  of said Act, a three tier quasi-judicial mechanism, called Consumer  Disputes Redressal Commission/ Forum, has been set up at the district,  State and National levels to provide simple, quick and inexpensive  redressal to consumer disputes.

The current membership of APTA consists of six countries, namely, Bangladesh, China, India, Lao PDR, Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka. Three Rounds of tariff concessions have already been exchanged among the member countries till 2003. The tariff concessions being granted to APTA member States, on Margin of Preference basis, are being expanded under the fourth round of exchange of tariff concessions.The APTA Ministerial Council in its meeting held on 13th January, 2017 has formally approved the implementation of the fourth round of exchange of tariff concessions. 
            APTA is a preferential treaty based on Margin of Preference. Concessions on tariff lines offered by China and Korea, inter-alia, cover certain textiles and chemical products, which are likely to benefit the Indian exporters. Some of items on which concessions have been offered by China and Korea include certain organic and inorganic chemicals, knitted and crocheted fabrics, and articles of apparel and clothing accessories etc.

                The annual production of spices in the country is around 6 million tonne, out of which 14% is exported while the rest is available for domestic consumption which is sufficient to meet the domestic demand.  Government implements several programmes for increasing production and availability of spices such as Cardamom through the Spices Board and other spices through the State Horticulture Missions under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). While on one hand, programmes aimed at increasing production and ensuring remunerative prices to farmers through pre and post harvest management and support activities are undertaken, on the other hand, the industry is assisted through adoption of upgraded technology in spice processing, setting up of quality evaluation labs, quality certification and making them available for exports.

            The Cauvery variety of coffee is more suitable for coffee cultivation in the Western Ghats areas and is not recommended for the coffee growing areas of Andhra Pradesh. ln order to improve the productivity in the coffee growing tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh, improved varieties like Sln.SA, Sln.5B and Sln.8 are being promoted by the Coffee Board as they have better adaptability to these areas. Besides, the Coffee Board has introduced various on-farm training programs and exposure visits to improve the coffee productivity in Andhra Pradesh.
 
            With the aim to give visibility to the coffee produced by the native tribal growers of Andhra Pradesh in the national/international markets, the Coffee Board has developed an exclusive logo under the brand name of ""Araku valley"". The Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) of Government of Andhra Pradesh has already taken steps to market the coffee under the brand name 'Araku Valley'. Coffee Board is providing support for marketing of coffee by providing incentives @Rs.10 per kg of coffee marketed through designated channels. Besides, the Coffee Board has introduced incentives for organic certification of tribal coffee, so as to facilitate better market access and premium to the tribal growers.

      Though various schemes and programmes are implemented by the Ministry, none of them fall within the category of flagship programmes.
The Government regularly reviews the performance of CPSEs to strengthen them.

Extending the 'Swachh Bharat' campaign to the cyber world, the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad, today launched the Cyber Swachhta Kendra–Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre for analysis of malware and botnets that affect networks and systems. This is a part of MeitY’s Digital India initiative aimed at creating a secure cyber space by detecting botnet infections in India and to notify, enable cleaning and securing systems of end-users to prevent further infections. The centre is operated by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).The Centre aims to enhance coordination between the Government and industry in order to encourage cyber hygiene among all end-users and to create a secure and safe internet ecosystem in India. 
 
Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Electronics and Information Technology said, “India is going to take a lead in the digitization process of the world. India today joined the distinguished club of countries that have malware cleaning systems for the use of its citizens. As of now, we have 13 Banks & internet service providers using this facility. With the expanding digital footprint in the country, I see a surge in start-ups in the area of cyber security by the end of the year”
 
“With the expanding role of Information and Communication technology across sectors and growth in volume of transactions and data exchange via internet, Cyber Security as reiterated by Hon’ble Prime Minister, has emerged as the most critical factor when we move towards Digital India. Combating cyber threats is not something that can be done just by the government or an organisation or an individual alone. It requires a partnership approach. This centre being launched today will work in coordination with the Internet Service Providers and Industry. This Kendra will also enhance awareness among citizens regarding botnet and malware infection along with measures to be taken to secure their devices”, added Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad.
 
The Hon’ble Minister made the following announcement at the launch of Cyber Swachhta Kendra:
 
·         The National Cyber Coordination Centre to be operational by June 2017
·         Sectoral CERTs to be created, that would operate under CERT-In
·         CERTs are to be set up in the state level as well
·         10 more STQC (Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification) Testing Facilities to be set up
·         Testing fee for any star-up that comes up with a digital technology in the quest of cyber security, to be reduced by 50%
·         Empower designated Forensic Labs to work as the certified authority to establish cyber crime 
 
The Centre will operate in close co-ordination and collaboration with Internet Service Providers (ISP) and Anti-Virus companies. Whenever an infection is detected, the Centre will send alerts on the infected IP addresses to the Internet Service Providers, who in turn will inform the end-user about the malware and botnet infections on their system. The Centre will also work in close collaboration with the Banks to detect malware infections in their banking network and enable remedial actions. The launch of the Centre will help the Internet service providers and the banks to keep their networks clean and prevent cases of cyber fraud and theft.
 
Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said, “With the increased penetration of ICT infrastructure in our country, the threat of cyber security has become more serious and visible. Today, the common man is confronted with hacking, spamming, malware and loss of data, yet public awareness about these issues and how to protect themselves is extremely low. There is a need to collaborate and come forth with solutions like the Cyber Swachhta Kendra in order to ensure a safe and secure cyber world for the citizens of India.”
 
With the growth in digitalization and proliferation of broadband and mobile internet, security of end users’ systems is vital for enhancing their trust in ICT and online transactions. User information from the computer and the mobile devices can be compromised if systems get affected with Bots. Users therefore need to practice a rigid cyber hygiene regimen to prevent malware infections on their systems and to ensure security of their systems through suitable anti-malware tools. The Cyber Swachhta Kendra will provide free tools for detection and removal of malicious programmes. More than 3500 users have currently downloaded and tried the free bot removal tools till date. The end-user can log on to the Cyber Swachhta Kendra Portal (www.cyberswachhtakendra.gov.in) and clean their systems using the free cleaning tools. Users can also educate themselves about the various cyber threats and get information on the security tips in order to secure their computers, mobiles and prevent infections in their systems. 
 
Given below are details of some of the tools released for citizens:
 
·         USB Pratirodh -A desktop security solution, which protects from USB mass storage device threats. 
·         AppSamvid - A desktop solution which protects systems by allowing installation of genuine applications through white listing. This helps in preventing threats from malicious applications.  
·         M-Kavach – An indigenously developed solution to address the security threats in mobiles.

                India today offered the secure ICT products to ASEAN countries at  competitive costs and also renewed its pledge to share “know how” and  “know Why” as New Delhi is willing to provide long-term financing for  buying Indian telecom products and services. Inaugurating the India  Telecom-2017 here, Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that  Indian Telecom companies are willing to share technologies and enter  into joint production ventures to develop entire telecom eco-system in  any host country. In the event organized to commemorate the 25th year of  the ASEAN-India relations, the Minister urged the participating  countries to ensure that Indian telecom products and services should  become their number one choice as they accelerate the digital  connectivity initiatives.

Referring to one of the lowest  mobile tariffs in the world, Shri Sinha said that India has already  overtaken the United States to become the world’s 2nd largest Internet  market, with more than 220 million Broadband subscribers and more than  450 million users, only behind China.
In his address, Secretary Telecom, Shri J,S,Deepak said that the  potential of partnership between India and ASEAN is indeed huge and  specific areas like GSM, broadband, e-education, tele-medicine, disaster  management and capacity building can be explored in a win-win fashion.  He said that Indian telecom products and designs are more affordable,  durable and competitive and Indian companies can also provide services  in the most difficult areas.
India has already committed to provide financial as well as  technological support for projects that could include-high-speed fibre  optic networks, digital villages, rural broadband, national knowledge  network, secured communication networks and telecom training and skill  development.
Addressing the Telecom conclave, Secretary(East), Ministry of  External Affairs, Ms Preeti Saran said that enhancing connectivity with  ASEAN is a priority for India and this should not only be geographic and  physical, but also institutional, digital, economic and socio-cultural.  She said that ASEAN member states should benefit from the institutional  expertise of the Indian telecommunication and IT industry.

The meeting of Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on prices and  availability of select essential commodities held on February 9, 2017  under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs  noted that for the first time a buffer stock of 10 lakh MT of pulses has  been created through domestic procurement and imports. Of this, five  lakh tonne have been procured during ongoing kharif marketing season.  The Government procurement intervention has helped farmers get  remunerative prices for kharif pulses. IMC directed procuring agencies  to continue procurement operations for pulses at MSP plus bonus.   Procurement and price support would incentivize farmers to take up  cultivation of pulses on larger scale.

The use of Aadhaar as identity document for delivery of services or  benefits or subsidies simplifies the Government delivery processes,  brings in transparency and efficiency, and enables beneficiaries to get  their entitlements directly in a convenient and seamless manner and  Aadhaar obviates the need for producing multiple documents to prove  one’s identity. Aadhaar Act interalia provides that the Central/State  Govt while making expenditure from Consolidated fund of India for any  subsidy, may require such individual to  furnish proof of possession of  Aadhaar number or undergo authentication. 

Since, subsidized foodgrains under PDS and Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy  under NFSA etc. involves recurring expenditure from the Consolidated  Fund of India, the Ministry Consumer Affairs, Food and Public  Distribution has issued a Notification under Aadhaar Act on 8-2-2017  which requires individual beneficiaries having Ration Cards under NFSA  to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar  authentication to receive subsidies under NFSA [ i.e. subsidised food  grains or Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy under NFSA]. This condition will  also be applicable for all the new beneficiaries. This notification  shall come into effect from 08-2-2017 in all States and Union  Territories except the States of Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu and Kashmir.  

Beneficiaries under NFSA who do not possess the Aadhaar Number or are  not yet enrolled for Aadhaar, but are desirous of  availing  subsidies  under  NFSA are required to make application for Aadhaar enrolment by  30thJune, 2017 and may visit  any  Aadhaar  enrolment  centre  (list   available  at  www.uidai.gov.in)  to  get  enrolled  for  Aadhaar. 

Till the Aadhaar is assigned to the beneficiaries of subsidises under  NFSA, the entitlements shall be given to such individuals on production  of Ration Card and either Aadhaar Enrolment ID slip or copy of his/her  request made to State Govt for Aadhaar Enrolment alongwith  any of the 8  documents i.e. Voter ID Card, PAN, Passport, Driving License,  Certificate of Identity with photo issued by Gazetted Officer/Tehsildar  on official letter head, Address card having Name and Photo issued by  Deptt of Posts,  Kisan Photo Passbook and any other document as  specified by State/UT Govts. Beneficiaries can make their request for  Aadhaar enrolment by giving their name, address, mobile number with  Ration Card number  and other details with their fair price shop owners  or through the web portal provided for the purpose by State /UT  Governments. 

The Food Department of State/UT Government, shall make wide publicity  through media and individual notices through the district food supply  office or fair price shops, etc., to make the beneficiaries aware of the  requirement of Aadhaar under the scheme. The State /UT Govt shall also  advise beneficiaries to get themselves enrolled at the nearest enrolment  centres available in their areas by 30th June, 2017 and  a list of  locally available enrolment centres shall be made available to them.  State Govt shall also offer enrolment facilities for the beneficiaries  and in case there is no Aadhaar enrolment centre located in the  respective Block or Taluka or Tehsil, the State/UT Govt is required to   provide enrolment facilities at convenient locations in coordination  with the UIDAI or the existing Registrars of UIDAI or by becoming UIDAI  registrar themselves.  

The State/UT Government shall link the Aadhaar number of  beneficiary  with the Ration Card or with Bank Account for Cash Transfer of Food  Subsidy within thirty days after receiving the same. 

Provision has also been made that any member of eligible household  listed in the Ration Card shall be entitled to receive the entire  quantity of entitled subsidised food grains or Cash Transfer of Food  Subsidy under NFSA, if any one member of the household in the Ration  Card fulfils the identification conditions in case Aadhaar number is not  yet assigned to all such members of the household.

The received complaints were dealt with as per consumer grievance redressal procedure.

                The Government has received a number of complaints from consumers through the National Consumer Helpline that some hotels and restaurants have been levying service charge at the rate of 5-20 per cent on the bills of food and beverages in lieu of tips which a consumer is forced to pay irrespective of the kind of service provided to him.
The Department of Consumer Affairs has examined the matter and  issued advisory to the State Governments to sensitize the companies, hotels and restaurants in the states regarding the  provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 on unfair trade practices and also to advise the hotels/restaurants to disseminate information through display at the appropriate place in the hotels/restaurants that the 'service charges"" are discretionary/ voluntary and a consumer dissatisfied with the services can have it waived off.
The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides that a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or the supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or deceptive practice, is to be treated as an unfair trade practice. The said Act further provides that a consumer can make a complaint to the appropriate consumer forum established under the Act against
 
(i)         an unfair trade practice adopted by any trader or service provider
(ii)      the services hired or availed of, suffered from deficiency in any respect
(iii)       a trader or service provider, as the case may be, has charged for the goods or for the services a price in excess of the price (a) fixed by or under any law for the time being enforce, (b) displayed on the goods or any package containing such goods, (c) displayed on the price list exhibited by him or under any law for the time being in force or (d) agreed between the parties.
This information was given by Shri C.R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan congratulated Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitely on 1st February, 2017 for presenting a historic Budget for the year 2017-18. He said that Government’s yesterday budget is significant on two counts – In the first place Shri Jaitley presented the Rail Budget alongwith the General Budget breaking the colonial tradition of a separate Rail Budget since 1924. The second significant move is that by presenting the budget on 1st February, the Government Departments will get complete 12 months times to implement Government schemes and would get sufficient time before the onset of monsoon. This year’s Budget has once again reflected Government’s commitment towards socio-economic and political reforms. 

Shri Paswan thanked the Finance Minister for deliberating upon the initiatives taken by the Government for taming price rise in his Budgetary Speech. As a result, the Government has been able to control inflation and the CPI based inflation has been reduced to 3.4% in December, 2016 from a level of 6% in July, 2016. 

Government has moved from discretionary and favouritism based to a system and transparency based persistently for over 2 ½ years, the results of which are showing. 

Shri Paswan elaborated the PDS Reforms being undertaken across the country in the implementation of the NFSA. The Minister was hopeful that by March-end this year majority of the States will have cashless arrangements for distribution of foodgrains. By June-end, all the 5.27 lakh FPS shops will be computerized; beneficiaries will be identified based on Aadhar. Most importantly, all these shops will have cashless system in place. This will ensure direct and transparent benefit to 81 crore beneficiaries. Central Government is assisting States in computerisation of FPS shops. The allocation of margin money for FPS operators has been increased to Rs. 4500 crores in the Financial Year 2017-18, which was Rs. 2500 crore in the present year. 

Shri Paswan personally thanked the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for successfully reigning in the price of Essential Commodities. He lauded the initiative of creation of Buffer Stock for pulses and increasing its size to 20 lakh MT. The Budget Estimate of Rs. 900 crore has been revised to Rs. 3400 crore to achieve the same. This move has also benefited lakhs of farmers in the country. 

The total budgetary allocation for Consumer Affairs Department is Rs. 3727 crore out of which the allocation for PSF alone is Rs. 3500 crore. 

NFSA has been implemented in the entire country in the current Financial Year. Accordingly, the allocation for food subsidy for the Financial Year 2017-18 has been increased to Rs.145138.60 crore which was Rs.130334.61 crore in the Fiancial Year 2016-17. 

Centre has been persuading the States for adopting the Decentralized Procurement scheme as a result of which 17 states have adopted the DCP system. FCI has started Online Procurement and many states have also implemented it. This has created a positive impact on farmers who are now receiving payments directly in their accounts, transparently. The budgetary provision for DCP States has been increased to Rs. 38000 crore in the Financial Year 2017-18 which was Rs. 30672.96 crore in the present year.

                INS Betwa, a P-16A Class frigate has been made upright by the unstinted  efforts put in by the Naval Dockyard, Mumbai and the salvage firm M/s  Resolve Marine, specially contracted for the operation. It may be  recalled that, the ship which was undergoing major repairs, had keeled  on to her side during her undocking on 05 Dec 2016.   

The salvage operations were progressed on a war footing and the initial  stabilisation of the ship was achieved by 29 Dec 2016. The complete  salvage operation involving complex hydrodynamic calculations and  rigging up of intricate measuring and monitoring systems was completed  in less than two months. 

As the ship was undergoing major refit and mid-life up-gradation since  Apr 2016, majority of the equipment/ machinery had already been removed  for routine servicing/ replacement with upgraded equipment. 

Indian Navy is confident that with in-house expertise and sustained  efforts, the ship will be made fully operational by her scheduled date  of refit completion i.e by      Apr 2018.

Curtains came  down on the Aero India – 2017 at Air Force Station Yelahanka in  Bengaluru today. Having evolved over the years, the 11th edition of the  event went through smoothly without a glitch drawing unprecedented  crowds that bear testimony to the premier Air Show of Asia having come  of age. 
The highlights of this year’s show have been:
 
(a)        Participation from 270 Indian Companies and 279 foreign companies. That is a total of 549 companies.
(b)        The gross area grew from 2,50,000 Sq Mtrs last time to 2,60,000 Sq Mtrs in this edition.
(c)        A total of 72 aircraft participated in the show.
(d)      Several seminars were conducted by State Governments.  
The first  three days at the show, earmarked exclusively for business visitors saw a  foot fall of approximately 1.5 lakh. The air show saw a lot of activity  from business point of view and witnessed several round table meets.  The show was a success.  
The push that  the show gives to the ‘Make in India’ campaign of the Government of  India by virtue of its sheer magnitude and presence of stake holders  from across the globe cannot be over emphasized.  
The  awe-inspiring manoeuvres by various types of aircraft and formations  enthralled the audience – young and old alike, every single day.  The  flying displays went smoothly with immaculate precision painting a  colourful aerial symphony in the clear Bengaluru skies twice every day. 
The last two days at the event saw an unprecedented foot fall of approximately four lakh people swarming in to the venue   to catch a glimpse of their heroes in their magnificent flying machines. 
The  Directorate of Public Relations, Ministry of Defence, empowered by their  recent forays into the social media, with their consistent efforts  ensured timely updates and wide outreach to enthusiasts around the  globe.

To mark the  successful conclusion of the Aero India 2017 and to serve as a token of  remembrance of fruitful association over the last few days during the  airshow, the aerobatic display teams got together today. Posing in front  of the Grumman G-164 A of the Scandinavian team and the Yak-50 of the  Yakovlev team, stunt pilots of the Surya Kiran Aerobatic team (SKAT),  the Yakovlevs and the Scandinavian along with their three ‘skycats’  provided for a visual treat. The SKAT pilots, led by Wg Cdr Ajit  Kulkarni, looked resplendent in their red flying overalls. The  Scandinvan leader Jacob Hollander’s flying suit matched the colour of  his flying machine while the skycats placed themselves atop the yellow  and blue airplane for photographs. The Yakovlev pilots, led by Jez, in  their black flying suits gave a very professional look. After the ‘photo  session’ the SKAT daredevils met up with the spectators to shake hands  and distribute memorabilia.

Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chief of the Naval  Staff paid homage and laid wreath at the ‘Shaheed Smarak’ this morning  at a solemn function organized by the Noida Sanstha. While speaking on  the occasion, the Chief of the Naval Staff stated that it was indeed an  honour for him to pay tributes to these soldiers, airmen and sailors. He  also took the opportunity to assure the families of these brave souls  that the Armed Forces shall continue to steer firmly on the path shown  by them in ensuring security of our seaward and landward frontiers. 
The function was attended by a large number of civil and  military dignitaries, IAS and IPS officers, ex-servicemen, school  children and common citizens who came together to pay homage to our  immortal martyrs.
The greatness of any nation is reflected by the tribute  its citizens pay to the Valiant Armed Forces Personnel who had made the  supreme sacrifice for the safety and security of our Motherland. The  ‘Noida Shaheed Smarak’ is one such unique Tri- service memorial raised  by the Noida township which is keeping the memories and spirit of our  martyrs alive.
The idea of setting up such a War Memorial to honour  Martyrs was conceived in 1998.The existing Memorial is an eloquent  tribute and homage to all those armed forces personnel whose ultimate  sacrifice led to several decisive victories since independence. Today  Noida Shaheed Smarak (NSS) is an iconic landmark, which not only keeps  the memories of these brave hearts alive and serves as a source of  inspiration for coming generation but is also for expressing of our  eternal gratitude to those who made the supreme sacrifice so that we may  see a better a tomorrow. Every year NSS Sanstha organizes Annual Wreath  Laying ceremony in the month of February to pay homage to our Martyrs.
The apt tribute to the war Heroes truly instilled great sense of pride in the hearts of all those present on the occasion.

The Indian Navy’s second ocean going sailboat Tarini will be inducted at a ceremony scheduled to be held at the INS Mandovi Boat Pool on evening of 18 February 2017.  Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of Naval Staff will also be present on the occasion.  INSV Tarini is a sloop built by M/s Aquarius Shipyard Pvt Ltd at Divar, Goa. The sail boat Tarini is being inducted into the Navy and is slated to be the platform for First Indian All Women Circumnavigation of the Globe expedition of the Indian Navy. 
 The boat has been built to a stock design by Van de Stadt, Netherlands called Tonga 56. The hull is made of wooden core fiberglass sandwich construction for a better performance than aluminum and steel.  INSV Tarini carries a suite of six sails including a Main sail, Head sails (Genoa and stay sails), Downwind sails and Storm sail. Her mast is 25 meters tall and has been custom built by M/s Southern Spars, Cape Town, for sailing in extreme conditions. She boasts a Raymarine navigation suite and an array of latest satellite communication systems through which she can be contacted anywhere in the world.
            The trials of the newly built INSV Tarini were successfully completed on 30 January 17 and all the learning experience from INSV Mhadei has been incorporated in this vessel right from the start. The keel of the vessel was laid by the Defence Minister, Shri Manohar Parrikar on 27 March 2016 at the Aquarius Shipyard. The construction was diligently overseen by the Warship Overseeing Team, Goa and the vessel is being delivered before the scheduled date of delivery by the boat builder. The successful construction of both the Mhadei andTarini in Goa are a tribute to the Government’s ‘Make in India’ policy.
            INSV Tarini is almost identical to her illustrious predecessor, the iconic Mhadei which has sailed over 115000 nautical miles in the past eight years. This includes path breaking voyages like the first Indian solo circumnavigation undertaken by Capt Dilip Donde (Retd) in 2009 and first solo, non-stop and unassisted circumnavigation by Cdr Abhilash Tomy in 2013.
            The boat draws her origin from the famous Tara-Tarini temple of Orissa’s Ganjam district. The word Tarinimeans a Boat and is also a Sanskrit word for Saviour. Tara-Tarini is a patron deity for sailors and merchants and is worshipped for safety and success at sea. Tara-Tarini of Orissa is known to have historical linkages with the river Goddess Mhadei- the exclusive boat deity of the Mhadei river of Goa. Both the deities Tariniand Mhadei have sculptural similarities.
            In order to promote ocean sailing activities and to encourage women empowerment, the Indian Navy conceptualized the idea of the First Indian All Women Circumnavigation of the Globe. A team of six women Officers led by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi was selected for this project. These officers have done basic sail training courses at INWTC Mumbai followed by Navigation, Seamanship, Communication and Meterology courses at various naval training schools at Kochi. After completion of theoretical courses, the officers sailed INSV Mhadei to Vizag for the International Fleet Review 2016 and thereafter to Mauritius and back. Following that, they sailed the boat on a grueling voyage to Cape Town in Dec 16. 
The boat is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi and crew members include Lieutenant Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lieutenant Aishwarya Boddapati, Lieutenant Patarapalli Swathi, Lieutenant Sh Vijaya Devi and Lieutenant Payal Gupta.

During his inaugural address Shri Parrikar said that this edition of  Aero India would witness the emerging dynamism of defence manufacturing  in India, especially the rising role of Indian defence industry.  He  further stated that the government is committed to creating an enabling  environment for a domestic ecosystem of defence manufacturing, the  results of which were already visible. He added, “The defence public  sector undertakings are being revitalized and encouraged. Government has  also taken several initiatives for ease of doing business for private  firms and additional initiatives are underway to support the role of  private sector in defence manufacturing”. 

Minister for Civil Aviation, Shri P Ashok Gajapathi Raju speaking at the  occasion highlighted that India was the fastest growing aviation sector  in passenger terms in the world and held tremendous potential to  graduate from the present position of being ninth in the world to being  the third largest by 2022.

The Yakovlev aerobatic team, the Skycats, the  Surya Kiran Aerobatics Team and the Sarang helicopter display team  enthralled the spectators with their performance. Another unique feature  of this air show was the 20-minute sortie by the Chief of the Air  Staff, Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, who flew in the Tejas  LCA Trainer during the day. 

Present at the occasion were MoS Defence, Dr. Subhash Bhamre, Minister  of State for Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha, the three service chiefs  of the Army, Navy and the Air Force, and Industry Minister, Government  of Karnataka, Shri RV Deshpande, Secretary Defence Production, delegates  from several foreign countries, senior serving officers from the three  Services, veterans, and senior executives from defence industries were  also present.

                The first indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control System  (AEW&C) in IOC configuration shall be handed over to the Indian Air  Force (IAF), on 14th February during Aero India 2017 at Yelahanka Air  base in Bengaluru. This was announced by Chairman DRDO and Secretary  Department of Defence (R&D), Dr. S. Christopher while addressing the  media in Bengaluru today, during the curtain raiser on DRDO’s  participation in Aero India-2017.   

The Airborne Surveillance System is a game changer in air warfare.  The  AEW&C System is a system of systems populated with state-of-the art  Active Electronically Scanned Radar, Secondary Surveillance Radar,  Electronic and Communication Counter Measures, LOS (Line of Sight) and  beyond LOS data link, voice communication system and self protection  suite, built on an Emb-145 platform, having an air to air refueling  capability to enhance surveillance time. A Complex tactical software has  been developed for fusion of information from the sensors, to provide  the air situation picture along with intelligence to handle  identification/classification threat assessment. Battle management  functions are built in house to work as a network centric system of  Integrated Air Command & Control System (IACCS) node. 

This system has been developed and evaluated through collaborative  efforts between DRDO and the IAF, with coordination for certification  clearance and quality assurance by CEMILAC and DGAQA. The AEW&C  system has undergone all weather and environmental trials and has been  accepted by the IAF for induction.

Government of India has implemented a web based Centralized Public  Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) in all its Ministries /  Departments including the Ministry of Defence. This system provides  online access to all citizens including the jawans and other Armed  Forces personnel to lodge their grievances with the Ministry of Defence.  The CPGRAMS system allows the Ministry to monitor the grievances and  ensure their time bound redressal by the organisations / institutions  concerned of the Ministry.  

The Armed Forces also have systems in place for the redressal of  grievances of their personnel. The procedures for dealing with statutory  and non-statutory complaints and representations have been laid down  under various sections of The Army Act, 1950; The Navy Act, 1957; The  Air Force Act, 1950 and the regulations and orders issued on the  subject. 
There are also informal mechanisms in place for redressal of grievances  in the Armed Forces like the sainik sammelans, personal interviews,  suggestion boxes, informal meetings, etc.

Thus well laid out grievance redressal systems are in place to deal with  the statutory and non-statutory complaints and grievances of the Armed  Forces personnel including the jawans.

A new redressal mechanism has been started wherein soldiers can air  their grievances directly to the Chief of Army Staff through WhatsApp  messages after exhausting all laid down redressal procedures. All the  grievances appearing on the social media sites and online relating to  Air Force are being monitored at Air Head Quarters for authenticity and  remedial measures. There is also a system of open forum on Air Force  internet where the Air Force personnel can share their views and project  their problems with the senior officers.

This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash  Bhamre in a written reply to Shrimati Chhaya Verma and  Shri Vishambhar  Prasad Nishad in Rajya Sabha today.

A complaint against Score Information Technology Limited (SITL),  nominated for supplying smart card / software, was received from the  Director (Operations & Coordination) of Central Organisation Ex  Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) in September 2011 regarding  an attempt to bribe him for obtaining        a favourable feedback on  the performance of the Company. 

A show Cause Notice was issued to the Company in October 2011.  This  issue was examined and was brought to the notice of Adjutant General and  Vice Chief of Army Staff by the Managing Director, ECHS.  The Contract  of SITL has been terminated on 31st May 2015 and it is no longer  associated with ECHS.  An enquiry was conducted by Central Bureau of  Investigation (CBI) also regarding various complaints, including  regarding cost of card of ECHS.  As per the CBI report, no irregularity  could be attributed to the ECHS officials.

The  retirement age of medical officers in the Armed Forces Medical Service  (AFMS) is based on their rank, which ranges from 56 years in the rank of  Lieutenant Colonel (& equivalent) to 60 years in case of Major  General (& equivalent).  In certain cases, Director General of AFMS  in the rank of Lieutenant General and other Lieutenant Generals (&  equivalent) may retire respectively at the age of 61 & 62 years.

There is no proposal to equate the retirement age of medical officers of  AFMS to those doctors working in the civil sector as the terms and  conditions of service for the two categories of doctors are totally  different.

The present total authorised strength of AFMS is 7073 out of which 843  posts are vacant.  Recruitment drives are conducted from time to time to  fill up the vacancies.

‘Make  in India’ initiative in defence production, is primarily driven by  capital acquisition of defence equipment and other policy initiatives of  the Government. Capital acquisition of defence equipment is carried out  as per the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), which stipulates a time  schedule for completion of the procurement cycle. However, the time  taken to undertake capital procurement of defence equipment depends on  the nature and complexity of the equipment being procured.  Nonetheless,  under the DPP-2016, Government has laid down provisions for ensuring  swift decision making and effective implementation of the procurement  process.

Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a Research &  Development wing of Ministry, is primarily involved in design  &development of strategic, complex and security sensitive systems in  the field of armament, missiles, combat vehicles, combat aircrafts,  radars, etc for the Armed Forces.

Procurement of capital equipment from Indian companies, is carried out  under the ambit of ‘Buy (Indian – IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy &  Make (Indian)’, ‘Make’ and the Make phase of ‘Buy & Make’ categories  of capital acquisition. Projects are awarded to Defence PSUs, Ordnance  Factory Board (OFB) and private players as per the provisions of Defence  Procurement Procedure (DPP).  During the last two financial years  (2014-15, 2015-16), 85 cases involving Rs 1,60,362 crore have been  accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AON) by Defence Acquisition Council  under these categories.

The entry of private companies in defence is not likely to adversely  affect the role of DRDO and DPSUs; as role of these segments are  complimentary and supplementary in nature.  The wider participation of  defence industry, including private sector, is beneficial for the  overall objective of self-reliance and indigenisation in the defence  sector.  The Government has taken several steps to encourage  participation of private sector including foreign investment in the  sector.

Six  firms including their allied and subsidiary firms are debarred from  further business dealings with Ministry of Defence for a period of ten  years w.e.f. 11.4.2012.  Further, business dealings are suspended / put on hold in respect of 13 firms.  In  respect of another four firms, orders were issued restricting  procurement from the concerned firms to cases where procurements are  justified and necessary on the basis of operational urgency, national  security and non-availability of other alternatives.
Guidelines for penalties in business dealings with entities have been promulgated, which have come into effect from 21.11.2016.  These  guidelines have been promulgated to ensure probity, transparency,  propriety and compliance in the defence procurement process.  The  guidelines are also aimed at ensuring fairness, impartiality, rigour  and correctness in dealings with entities, keeping in view the overall  security interests of the country.

There  have been no major complaints by the soldiers regarding quality of  food.  The soldiers of Armed Forces are provided rations as per  entitlement and Defence Food Specifications.  However, the improvement  in quality of food is ongoing process and is undertaken based on  feedback from troops and advice of scientific bodies.

Some of important steps taken by Government towards the improvements are mentioned below:-

    •    Increase in scale of meat / chicken (broiler) dressed for JCOs /  ORs and authorisation of chilled / frozen meat / chicken as basic  ration at 136 stations.

    •    Introduction of ready to eat vegetables in retort pouches with longer shelf life.

    •    Extension of Special Rations of Siachen Glacier to troops across the country anywhere above 12000 feet.

The requirements of defence equipment for the Indian Armed forces are met through both indigenous production and imports.  Whilst  considerable thrust has been accorded to indigenisation, certain  equipment are imported due to non-availability of indigenous expertise,  lack of vendor base and need for induction of such equipment based on  threat perception.  73 contracts  involving a value of Rs. 72,303.34 crore were signed with Indian vendors  during the last two financial years (2014-15 and 2015-16).  85  cases involving Rs. 1,60,362 crore have been accorded Acceptance of  Necessity (AON) by Defence Acquisition Council under the ‘Buy (Indian)’  ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ categories.
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO),  an R&D Wing of Ministry of Defence, is primarily involved in design  and development of strategic, complex and security sensitive systems in  the fields of armaments, missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, radars,  electronic warfare systems, sonars, combat vehicles, combat aircraft,  sensors, etc., for the Armed Forces as per their specific Qualitative  Requirements. Some of the major indigenously designed and developed  weapon platforms that have been successfully inducted into the Services  inter alia include Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), Light Combat  Aircraft (LCA), Akash Missile Systems, Multi Barrel Rocket System –  Pinaka, MBT Arjun Tanks, Sonars, etc.
Projects for defence research are undertaken by DRDO, based on the priorities of Armed Forces and existing capabilities.  To involve private sector in defence R&D, projects are undertaken under ‘Make’ category.  The Government has also launched Technology Development Fund (TDF) to involve industry, particularly SMEs in defence sector.  According  highest preference to ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM-Indigenously Designed,  Developed and Manufactured)’ category of acquisition, and revision of  ‘Make’ procedure in the Defence Procurement Procedure-2016 (DPP) are  expected to catalyse investment into defence research, development and  innovation.

There  have been no instances of incursions along our border with China.   However, as there is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC)  between India and China, there are areas along the border where India  and China have differing perception of LAC.  Due to both sides  undertaking patrolling upto their perception of the LAC, transgressions  do occur.

To resolve such issues, there is a well established mechanism of Border  Personnel Meetings (BPMs), flag meetings, Working Mechanism for  Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) and diplomatic channels wherein  they are guided by provisions of various agreements between India and  China.

                The National Maritime Foundation (NMF) is conducting its Annual Maritime Power Conference-2017 at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) Auditorium, Development Enclave, New Delhi, on 09-10 February 2017, with the theme ‘The Blue Economy: Concept, Constituents and Development’.
The  NMF was established in 2005 to provide a common platform for discourse  between maritime-related institutions, organisations and disciplines,  within the country and abroad. The Foundation conducts independent  academic research and provides policy-relevant recommendations to  advance the nation’s maritime goals. 
As  a part of its charter, NMF endeavours to foster maritime awareness on  contemporary issues through academic engagements and towards this end,  the Foundation organises an Annual Maritime Power Conference (AMPC). 
During the International Fleet Review, 2016, the Hon’ble Prime  Minister recalled India’s vision for the Indian Ocean through ‘SAGAR’  (meaning ocean), which stands for ‘Security and Growth for All in the  Region’. Later, whilst inaugurating the Maritime India Summit 2016, the  Hon’ble Prime Minister articulated his maritime vision for the nation. These events showcased India’s growing maritime power and signalled a clear intent of a resurgent maritime nation.
Taking  forward the maritime vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra  Modi, the theme for the Annual Maritime Power Conference -2017 has been  chosen as “The Blue Economy: Concept, Constituents and Development”. 
The  Blue Economy encompasses various traditional marine sectors such as  fisheries and aquaculture, shipping, port infrastructure, ship building  and repair, island development, seabed exploration, hydrocarbon  extraction and marine tourism industry. There are also many emerging  sectors in the such as marine renewable energy, deep seabed mining, salt  water desalination, marine bio-technology and provisioning specialised  Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) services for the  marine industry. Innovative technologies have also created new  opportunities for harnessing ocean resources and enable job creation  which are vital for inclusive growth. 
In  order to fully harness the potential of the blue economy, India needs  to envision the seas and oceans as development spaces. This involves an  integrated approach towards oceanic resources comprising marine spatial  planning and integrated coastal zone management. 
This  conference aims to add to the understanding of the discourse on Blue  Economy and intends to discuss its constituents in an attempt to develop  a common understanding of the concept. It seeks to identify the  opportunities and challenges with the aim of evolving concrete  recommendations towards harnessing the Blue Economy, while ensuring  efficient utilization of marine resources and sustained development of  the oceans. 
The conference will be conducted over five sessions, namely:-
Session 1: Blue Economy and Sustainable Development 
Session 2: Habitat Protection and Ocean Ecology
Session 3: Ocean Governance and Marine Resources 
Session 4: Maritime Security and Industry
Session 5: Enablers of Blue Economy
Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, and Shipping will inaugurate the two-day conference on 9thFebruary, and deliver the keynote address.
Shri  Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Union Minister for State (Independent Charge) Skill  Development and Entrepreneurship, is the Guest of Honour and will make  his special address during the inaugural session.
Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff and Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, will deliver the opening address.
Admiral  RK Dhowan (Retd), Chairman National Maritime Foundation and former  Chief of the Naval Staff, will deliver the welcome address for the  participants and delegates.
Members  from academia, representatives from maritime related trade bodies and  industry, stakeholders in various Governmental and non-Governmental  organisations, related to the maritime domain, and members of the  strategic community in India have been invited to attend this  conference. In addition, experts and policy makers from India,  Australia, China, Bangladesh, Seychelles, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and  Singapore, will participate in this flagship event of the NMF.

Capital acquisition of defence equipment is carried out as per the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), which stipulates a time schedule for completion of the procurement cycle. However, the time taken to undertake capital procurement of defence equipment depends on the nature and complexity of the equipment being procured. The procurement of defence equipment involves rigorous trials, after which detailed bid evaluations and comprehensive commercial negotiations have to be undertaken. Nonetheless, under the DPP-2016, Government has laid down provisions for ensuring swift decision making and effective implementation of the procurement process. 

Defence Procurement Procedure focuses on achieving the “Make in India” vision by according priority to ‘Buy (Indian – IDDM (Indian Designed, Developed and Manufactured)), ‘Buy (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ categories over Buy (Global) category of capital procurement. During the last two financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16), 73 contracts involving a value of Rs.72,303.34 crore were signed with Indian vendors. During the same period, 85 cases involving Rs.1,60,362 crore have been accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AON) by Defence Acquisition Council under the ‘Buy (Indian)’ ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ and ‘Buy & Make’ categories. 

The Dhirendra Singh Committee has recommended a ‘Strategic Partnership Model’ for creating capacity in the private sector on a long-term basis over and above the capacity and infrastructure that exists in Public Sector Units. However, the policy and criteria for selection of Strategic Partners, is to be finalised after wider consultations with all stakeholders.

For the redressal of grievances of the Armed Forces personnel, procedures have been clearly laid down in The Army Act, 1950; The Navy Act, 1957; and The Air Force Act, 1950. Further, the procedures for dealing with non-statutory representations / complaints have been laid down by the regulations and orders issued on the subject. 

There are also informal mechanisms in place for redressal of grievances in the Armed Forces like the sainik sammelans, personal interviews, suggestion boxes, informal meetings, open forum on Air Force internet etc. 

A web based Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) has been designed and implemented in all the Ministries / Departments of Government of India including the Department of Defence. This system provides online access to all including the Armed Forces personnel to lodge their grievances with the Ministry of Defence. The CPGRAMS system allows the Ministry to monitor the grievances and ensure their time bound redressal by the concerned organisations / institutions of the Ministry. 

Thus well laid out grievance redressal systems are in place to deal with the statutory and non-statutory complaints/grievances of the Armed Forces personnel.

Trails of guided Pinaka Rocket were successfully conducted at Integrated Test Range (ITR) Balasore in two phases on 12th and 24th Jan 2017 with range of 65 km and 75 km, respectively. The guided version of Pinaka Rocket incorporates Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)/ Global Positioning System (GPS) for the mid-course guidance with accuracy of 60m to 80m at all ranges. In the recent trials conducted, the desired accuracy has been achieved. 

Pinaka has been design and developed for induction into Army after successful User Trials. Two Regiments of Pinaka Unguided Version have already been inducted in Army. Current trials have been conducted for demonstrating the feasibility of the development of Guided Version of Pinaka Rocket using the same Launcher and Ammunition Configuration.

The Minister of State for DNortheast to play a leadership role in Swachhta drive, says MoS (DoNER)  (I/C),  Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions,  Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh administered the ‘Swachhta  pledge’ to the officers and staff of the Ministry of Development of  North Eastern Region (DoNER), on the occasion of Swachhta Pakhwada,  which began here today. The DoNER Ministry is observing “Swachhta  Pakhwada”, from February 16-28, 2017. 

During the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Swachhta should be  inculcated as a habit among us and the cleanliness activities should be a  continuous process beyond the observation of Swachhta Pakhwada. In this  regard, he said that there is a need for change in the mindset and also  stressed upon the participation of youth in the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’  launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in the year 2014. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said whether it is Swachh Bharat Mission or the  decision of demonetisation, people across India have supported the  initiatives taken by the Central Government. He said that North East  Region (NER) is known for cleanliness, for instance, Sikkim has become  the Open Defecation Free (ODF) state and it is the first state in India  to be so. He also said that a village in Megalaya has won the title of  Asia's cleanest village. The Minister said that the rest of India should  take inspiration from these examples set by Northeast. He said that NER  should play a leadership role in the Swachhta drive. 

The activities to be undertaken during the Swachhta Pakhwada being  organised by the DoNER Ministry, include workshop on clean technologies,  Swachhta walks, blog writing/photography and video clip contest,  weeding out of old files, cleanest  room in the Ministry’ award, visit  of officers to all the 8 NE states to spread the message of cleanliness.

The State Governments and  affiliating boards for schools have the responsibility to ensure that  schools provide a safe and child friendly environment.  This Ministry had written on 27th  July, 2004 to all States and Union Territories (UTs) directing that  school buildings should be free from inflammable and toxic materials and  there should be provision for adequate emergency exits and adequate  supply of water and sand for fire fighting purposes.  Further, this Ministry’s guidelines issued on 9th October, 2014 state that school buildings should be resistant to earthquakes, fire, safe from floods and other calamities. 
 The Schedule to the Right of Children to Free and  Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 provides for norms and standard for  a school, which inter alia stipulate for all-weather school building.  Under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, School Management Committees (SMCs)  can avail of training on all aspects of safety and security of children  in schools.  The guidelines on  Food Safety and Hygiene for School Level Kitchen under the Mid Day Meal  scheme stress on the safety aspects of procurement, storage and  preparation of food items. 

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has  formulated and circulated detailed guidelines to its affiliated schools  for safety of students in schools and prevention of accidents relating  to school children.  Rule 8.5 of  the Affiliation Bye laws prescribes that “the School should scrupulously  observe prescription from the Municipal Authority/District  Collectorate/Transport Department regarding drinking water, fire safety  and transport precautions in the school. A certificate from the  Municipal/Fire/Transport Authority regarding sanitary conditions,  water/fire/transport safety should be submitted along with the  application. A fresh certificate regarding fulfilment of these  requirements should be obtained and submitted to the Board every five  years.
 This  information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra  Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down Pupil  Teacher Ratio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools. At  primary level the PTR should be 30:1 and at the upper primary level it  should be 35:1. The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) framework  stipulates that the PTR at secondary level should be 30:1. 
 
            As  per Unified District Information System For Education (UDISE) the PTR  at national level for elementary schools is 24:1 and for secondary  schools it is 27:1.  The PTR in most of the States and UTs is found to be satisfactory.  However,  since some schools have lesser teachers than the required number, it is  clear that while there are sufficient teachers, the main issue is their  correct deployment.
            Globally,  there are variations in the optimum number of students taught in a  particular class and as such the data is not uniformly comparable. Data  from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics on PTR in primary schools shows  that India has a national PTR comparable to countries with similar  social-economic indicators.
            The  recruitment, service conditions and redeployment of teachers are  primarily in the domain of respective State Governments and UT  Administrations.  However, the  Central Government through the flagship programmes of Sarva Shiksha  Abhiyan (SSA) at elementary level and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha  Abhiyan (RMSA) at secondary level provides assistance to the State  Governments and UTs for additional teachers to maintain appropriate PTR  as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling.
            The  Central Government has been consistently pursuing the matter of  expeditious recruitment and redeployment of teachers with States and UTs  at various fora.  Advisories on this issue have also been issued to States and UTs from time to time.

                Registration of students in higher education is measured in terms of  total enrolment in higher education out of the eligible population in  the age group of 18-23 years. Total enrolment in higher education as  percentage of the population in the 18-23 years age group is defined as  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER). As per the report of All India Survey on  Higher Education (AISHE), GER in Higher Education during 2015-16 is  24.5% as compared to 10.0% in 2004-05. The quantum jump in GER over the  years indicates considerable improvement in registration of students in  higher education.  

To increase the percentage of students to continue studies in  institutions of higher education, the Government has taken several  initiatives such as opening of new institutions, scholarship and  interest subsidy on educational loans availed by the students. Extensive  use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications is  also being made in furtherance of higher education in the country.  During the Twelfth Five Year Plan a new scheme called the Rashtriya  Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan  (RUSA) has been launched  with the  aim to  achieve equity, access and excellence in state higher education system.  The scheme supports components such as upgrading autonomous colleges to  universities, clustering colleges to establish a university, setting up  of new professional colleges in un-served and underserved areas as well  as providing infrastructure grants to universities and colleges to scale  up capacity.

                Improvement of standards of higher education and upgradation of  infrastructure is an on-going endeavour and the Central Government has  been making a constant effort in this direction. The Central Government  has launched several new initiatives viz. National Institutional Ranking  Framework (NIRF), Impacting Research Innovation & Technology  (IMPRINT), Uchchatar Avishkar Yojna (UAY), Global Initiative of Academic  Networks (GIAN) & Global Research Interactive Network (GRIN) in the  field of education for the qualitative development of education in the  country.  

The project Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds  (SWAYAM) is intended to provide massive open online courses (MOOCs) to  the students across the country and thereby expanding the reach of best  quality education to students using the ICT tools.  An Higher Education  Financing Agency (HEFA) has also been established to give a major push  for creation of high quality infrastructure in premier educational  institutions.  

The UGC has issued guidelines for autonomous colleges during the 12th  Plan Period for promoting academic excellence of autonomous college.   Under this an autonomous college will have the freedom to determine and  prescribe its own course of study and syllabi, use modern tools of  educational technology to achieve higher standards and greater  creativity. 

The UGC undertakes maintenance of standards in teaching, research and  quality assurance in Universities, Deemed to be Universities and  Colleges through framing and notifying regulations, schemes and  disbursing grants to the eligible institutions. The UGC has notified  several regulations with a view to sustain and improve the quality of  higher education and to undertake academic reforms such as the  introduction of a semester system, the regular updating of curricula and  Choice Based Credit Systems (CBCS). 

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) too has taken such  measures by issuing the Regulations for Collaboration &  Partnerships between Indian and Foreign Universities/Institutions in the  field of Technical Education, Research and Training. It has also  notified Regulations making accreditation mandatory for all technical  institutions. AICTE has also launched Start-up Policy to promote  students driven start-ups in AICTE approved Technical Institutions which  also involves industry-academia interaction. 

The Ministry also launched a scheme for research parks and start-ups and  incubation centers within the Centrally Funded Technical Institutions. 

Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha  Abhiyan (RUSA), the overall quality of existing State higher educational  institutions is sought to be improved by ensuring their conformity to  prescribed norms and standards and adoption of accreditation as a  mandatory quality assurance framework. Certain academic, administrative  and governance reforms are a precondition for receiving funding under  RUSA. 

The Ministry of Human Resource Development, in consultation with  University Grants Commission (UGC) has formulated draft UGC (Declaration  of Government Educational Institutions as Institutions of Eminence)  Guidelines, 2017 for 10 public institutions and draft UGC (Institutions  of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 for 10 private  institutions. These institutions are proposed to be named as  ‘Institutions of Eminence’.  The selection of Institutions of Eminence  shall be made only after the Guidelines and Regulations are notified.

Under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), a Web Based School Geographical Information System (GIS) application has been initiated for seamless visualization of school locations across the country. Geographic location of schools collected by the various School Education Departments of the states has been collated and mapped on GIS Platform established by National Informatics Centre. Further, these school locations have been interlinked with the school report cards based on Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) database, developed and hosted by National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA).
 
In this web application, base map services like street maps, and high resolution satellite images are available for better understanding of the topography/ terrain of the location. This web service application comprises of administrative boundaries up to village level and location information up to habitation level along with basic GIS functionalities and measurement tools which will help to improve the quality of planning and better utilization of resources available under the schemes.
 
In the centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has developed a mobile application for uploading geo-tagged
photographs and associated details captured by the educational institutions, on Bhuvan-RUSA portal as a part of implementation of RUSA funded works in States. This application for geo-tagging of institutions under RUSA is a location based service. The mobile geo tagging App of RUSA covers the following attributes: construction work or equipment, institution name, new or upgraded work, type of work, current stage of work, percentage completed, completion date, bank name, account number, amount released and amount utilised. The portal for Bhuvan-RUSA can be accessed at http://bhuvan-staging.nrsc.gov.in/events2/forest/rusa. 
 
The key stakeholders in Bhuvan RUSA are: Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development; National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO); State Governments and institutions of the States/UTs funded under RUSA.

India  participated in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)  2009 only through schools in two states, i.e., Tamil Nadu and Himachal  Pradesh. India has not participated in the PISA Test after 2009 as India  has developed its own student assessment system called the National  Achievement Survey (NAS), which is independently conducted by National  Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) across the country  on the latest international Item Response Theory (IRT) methodology. The  NAS is conducted for classes III, V, VIII & X, i.e., the critical  stages of education, early primary, end of primary, upper primary and  secondary levels. From current year onwards, Government has decided to  conduct annual National Achievement Surveys covering all students from  grade I-VIII in all government and government aided schools. The  students learning assessment will be according to the Learning Outcomes  developed by NCERT for all subjects covering all classes in the  elementary cycle.
The Central Government through a centrally funded programme, Sarva  Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), financially supports State and UT Governments to  address gaps and challenges in ensuring quality education to children in  elementary classes through recruitment of additional teachers to  improve the Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR), regular annual-in- service  teacher training to all teachers to update their skills and knowledge,  support for Computer Aided Learning at upper primary level and regular  academic support through Block Resource Centres and Cluster Resource  Centres. Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat, a sub-programme under SSA has been  launched to enhance the quality of foundational learning in languages  and early mathematics in classes I and II and a focused programme for  Science and Maths at upper primary level under SSA is also being  supported.  For secondary education, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikhsa  Abhiyan programme similarly provides for in-service teacher training,  academic support to schools for improving performance, including  training for Principals.

At  present there is no law which allows the entry and operation of foreign  educational providers to set up their campuses and offer dual degree in  India. However, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has notified the  UGC (Promotion and Maintenance of Standards of Academic Collaboration  between Indian and Foreign Educational Institutions) Regulations 2016,  which spell out the modalities regarding the eligibility criteria and  the conditions for the collaboration of a foreign educational  institution with an Indian educational institution.  The regulations  stipulates that the degree of the student graduating from Indian  Educational Institution, in collaborative arrangement with Foreign  Educational Institution, shall be awarded only by the Indian Educational  Institution and not by Foreign Educational Institution whatsoever and   Joint degrees are not permitted. The degree may incorporate a para that  ‘this degree is being awarded in collaboration with the Foreign  Educational Institution’ to make it amply clear that the primacy and the  award of the degree is by the Indian Educational Institution and that  the degree awarded is not to be construed as a Joint Degree.
AICTE has also issued Regulations for Entry and Operation of  Foreign Universities/Institutions imparting Technical Education in India  to facilitate collaboration and partnerships between Indian and Foreign  Universities/Institutions in the field of technical education, research  and training.

There  has been an upsurge in the demand for higher education after  independence, resulting in a substantial expansion in the number of  universities and colleges in the country. India has the second largest  higher education system in the world. As per UGC Annual Report 2014-15,  as on 31.03.2015, the number of Universities had gone up to 711 (46  Central, 329 State, 205 State Private, 128 Deemed to be Universities,  three Institutions established under State Legislation) and 40760  colleges in the Higher Education sector. The Indian higher education has  already entered a stage of massification and the Gross Enrolment Ratio  in higher education in 2015-16 is 24.5 percent, which is 3.45 crore in  absolute numbers. The current target is to increase Gross Enrolment  Ratio to 25.2 percent in 2017-18 and further to 30 percent in 2020-21.
The extant National Policy on Education (NPE) provides for a National  System of Education which implies that, up to a given level, all  students, irrespective of caste, creed, location or sex, have access to  education of a comparable quality. The Government is committed to  provide equitable access to quality education to all, by enhancing  access to public funded education across all levels ranging from  elementary to higher education.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar while interacting with media at New Delhi emphasized that improvement of quality at all levels is the theme of the whole education reforms and that is the thrust of the government lead by The Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He further noted that, considering changes in funding pattern after devolution by Finance Commission, there has been 25% more allocation made for education and we are progressing towards the expenditure 6% of GDP. The Union HRD Minister highlighted five specific initiatives mentioned in the Union Budget 2017-18.
Learning Outcomes are assessment standards indicating the expected levels of learning that children should achieve for that class. These indicators can be used as check points to assess learning at different points of time and should be the point of reference for assessment of learning. The learning outcomes for students at elementary level have been finalized and they will be included in the Central Rules of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE), Act, 2009.
It is proposed to conduct an Annual Survey of Learning Outcomes (ASLO) through a third party.  It will be conducted in all 36 States and UTs in sample Government and aided schools.  This assessment will be benchmarked against the learning outcomes already finalized and will be a granular and diagnostic tool to identify students who need additional support to achieve the required learning levels and to assist teachers in identifying the gaps in the teaching-learning process. This will help the teacher to make necessary changes to his/her teaching practice as well as provide additional support to ensure that all children achieve the desired level of learning outcomes.
 
The MHRD is supporting all States and UTs through the SSA and its component Learning Enhancement Programmes to improve the Learning Outcomes of their students.
 
The Innovation Fund for Secondary Education would be provided from the budget of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) Scheme to encourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and quality improvement, to be introduced in 3479 educationally backward blocks and Rs. 100 Crore have been earmarked for this in the Budget 2017-18.
 (a)       One time allocation would be made to the State/UT under the innovation Fund.  The States/UTs would be required to submit a proposal in this regard.  The proposals from States will need to include in their proposals innovation element, sustainability etc. The proposals may include projects like:-
·         ICT enabled learning tablets/ smart classrooms/ virtual classrooms/ IT based teaching aids for CWSN.
·         Enrolment and retention drive for SC/ST/girls/minority students in EBBs.
·         Transport facilities for students in difficult areas in EBBs.
·         Portacabin residential schools in worst affected LWE districts.
·         Guidance and counseling for adolescent children.
·         Innovative science labs/ tinkering labs/ robotics labs.
·         Boys hostels in EBBs.
(b)       A national level committee would be constituted which would be headed by the Additional Secretary- Department of School Education & Literacy, MHRD which would consider and approve the proposals under the Innovation Fund.  
 
Reforms in University Grants Commission, responding to a felt need to bring about great process efficiency and role clarity in the University Grants Commission, the Finance Minister’s Budget Speech has referred to reforms to be undertaken for the UGC. 
·         While the details and modalities of the reforms will be worked out over the next few months, the intended direction is to allow good quality institutions to be brought under a more liberal regulatory measure, initially with provisions for self regulations and peer review.
·         The UGC should focus more on improving quality and helping institutions which are presently of lesser quality to reach higher academic and educational standards. Graded oversight by the UGC depending on the nature of the institutions is one possibility with less oversight and regulation for good quality institutions and greater UGC guidance and handholding of lesser quality.
·         It is intended that a system be put in place for regular curriculum reform which would ensure that the intuitions upgrade their curriculum in consonance with the present day requirements to meet the challenges of the modern world.
·         A possible area of focus would be the Credit Based Qualification Framework to be framed with equivalence being determined on credit hours rather than calendar duration.
·         There is a need to focus on teacher education, including at the time of induction, and periodically, the latter in the form of refresher training.
 
National Testing Agency, the outlines of the structure and the tasks to be assigned have by and large been prepared and a proposal will shortly be prepared for processing.
·         CBSE is presently being overburdened with conducting multiple examinations for about an estimated 1.12 Crore number of students over the year.
·         In the first instance best entrance examinations for streams of higher education, including the IITs, NITs and even university system would be prepared. 
·         It is hoped that later the Agency will move from being merely an examination body to one that is able to support education system. In other words, providing for including outcome learning and outcome assessments for students and in evolving good examination processes. 
 
The SWAYAM platform is ready, content is currently under review with the objective of making it more attractive for students and easier for them to absorb and learn content. The objective is to have a system of quality assurance for courses offered.
·         At the same time, a system for encouraging and preparing faculty of educational institutions to work in conjunction with the MOOCs and to use them in classroom teaching and in smaller students groups.
·         The credit framework being developed for the MOOCs too.
·         An outreach and awareness programme for SWAYAM and the DTH channels will be prepared to make them more acceptable to stakeholders.
·         MOOCs will be blended with Open and Distance Learning system, for better communication and learning structure as a platform of the future.

The Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar signed MoU for Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (Phase- III) with 18 States and 1 UT in New Delhi today. The Union HRD Minister expressed his happiness on the occasion as the programme is implemented in assistance with World Bank in a sustainable way to improve over all standard and quality of technical institutes. The Union Minister emphasised that innovation and research can happen only when physical infrastructure and trained manpower is available, and therefore this programme is vital for much needed technical up-gradation in education institutes.
For implementation of the project, TEQIP-III, a MoU was signed between MHRD and Focus States in the presence of Hon’ble HRM. 
 
The Focus States are 7 Low Income States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh), 3 Hill States (Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand), 8 North-Eastern States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) and Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
 
The project will be implemented as Central Sector Scheme with the facility of Direct Funds Transfer to the accounts of beneficiary institutes. The project will be initiated in April 2017 and will be coterminous with Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) i.e. 2019-20. 
 
TEQUIP I and TEQUIP II had a positive impact on the infrastructure and educational standards in the technical institutions where they were taken up. Institutions in the central, eastern and north-eastern region and hill States are at present in need of similar and specific interventions. The initiation and implementation of the project TEQIP-III arises from the need to bridge this gap.
 
The major impacts/ outcomes of the project are: 
(i)                 Better academic standards, through accreditation, filling up faculty positions, training faculty in better teaching methods, improved research outputs in institution in Focus States/UTs
(ii)               Better administration of the institutions with improved financial/academic autonomy,  
(iii)             Better systems for assessment of Student Learning, higher transition rates 
(iv)             Transparent and expeditious release of funds to institutes by way of Direct Funds Transfer (DFT) System.
 
The Project will be implemented as a ‘Central Sector Scheme’ with project outlay of Rs. 2660 crore. An estimated 200 Government/ Government aided engineering institutes and ATUs including the Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) will be selected. The funding pattern for institutes/Affiliating Technical Universities (ATUs) would be as under:-
 
o   Non-autonomous institutes: upto INR 10 crores
o   Autonomous institutes: upto INR 15 crores
o   Affiliating Technical Universities (ATUs) : upto INR 20 crores 
o   Mentor institutions: upto INR 7 crores
 
Background: 
 
The Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) commenced in 2003 with World Bank assistance as a long term programme to be implemented in 3 phases. The first phase of Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) commenced in 2003 and ended on March 31st, 2009. TEQIP-II commenced in August 2010 and is scheduled to conclude in March 2017. The project will cover all Government / Government aided engineering institutes, affiliating technical universities (ATUs) and CFTIs from Focus States/UT. 
 
High-performing TEQIP-I/ TEQIP-II Government / Government aided institutes/ATUs across the country would be eligible to participate in twinning   arrangements   for   knowledge transfer, exchange of experience, optimizing the use of resources and developing long-term strategic partnerships.

The Agro-meteorological Advisory Services (AAS) under the Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva (GKMS) is operated to prepare biweekly weather based AAS bulletins for wider dissemination to the farmers at district scale through multimedia channels and also through SMS so as to plan farm operations accordingly. At present, 24.5 million farmers are directly subscribing SMS based AAS bulletins and have benefitted by and large. Efforts are continuously made for expanding the outreach of the AAS to every farming household across the country. 
 
As per the recent National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) report, farming community of the country is using the GKMS service products for critical farm operations viz. 
 
i) Management of sowing (Delayed onset of rains); 
ii) Changing crop variety (Delay in rainfall); 
iii) Spraying Pesticides for disease control (occurrence of rainfall); 
iv) Managing Irrigation (Heavy rainfall Forecast). 
 
According to a survey, the weather forecast based AAS of IMD is found to be reliable by more than 93% of surveyed farmers and 95% of the farmers say that forecasts of IMD have improved during last 2-4 years. Further, most of farmers felt that there had been an improvement in the timeliness of the issuance of AAS bulletins of the weather forecasts. Among various components of weather elements, rainfall component has the highest priority. Concurrently, with the implementation of District Level Agro Meteorological Advisory services, India has seen improved agriculture performance in the rain fed farming (Covers 60% of arable land). Incremental profit due to GKMS is assessed at 25% of the net income. The Potential Annual Economic profit by using GKMS by 24% of the community currently cultivating 4-principle crops (wheat; paddy; sugarcane; cotton) in 2010 was assessed at Rs. 38,463 Crores (when 2.0 million farmers were subscribed to SMS service), which rose to Rs.42,000 Crores in 2015 (11.5 million farmers have been subscribed to SMS service). The study suggests that GKMS has the potential of generating net economic benefit up to Rs.3.30 lakh crores when Agro-Meteorological advisory is fully utilized by the 95 million agriculture dependent households.

                Three institutes of Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun, have developed 20 high-yielding varieties of plant species. The Variety Releasing Committee (VRC) of ICFRE, granted approval for the release of these varieties of plant species, at a meeting held here today. 

Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, has worked, for more than a decade, on ten improved varieties of Melia dubia and three clones of Eucalyptus tereticornis, the timber of which is in high demand in the industry. The released cultivars of Melia, popularly known as Dreake, or Malabar Neem, not only have a high productivity per unit area, with an average of 34.57 cubic metre per hectare per annum, but also have an excellent bole form, which is a desirable characteristic for plywood industry. Similarly, the average productivity of the released varieties of Eucalyptus has been recorded as 19.44 cubic meter per hectare per annum, against the present productivity level of 5-7 cubic meter per hectare per annum. These clones have also been found to be resistant to pink disease and wall gasp. Research at Institute of Forest Genetic and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore, has resulted in the development of five inter-specific hybrids of Casuarina equisetifolia X Casuarina junghuhniana for use as timber. Similarly, Tropical Forest Research Institute, Jabalpur, developed two varieties of medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina. 

The developed varieties have to go through stringent long field trials and testing before release. The VRC meeting that released the varieties was held under the chairmanship of Director General, Forest and Special Secretary, Dr. S.S Negi granted approval for the release of these varieties. The three institutes that have developed the varieties are – Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun, Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding (IFGTB), Coimbatore and Tropical Forest Research Institute, Jabalpur. Director General, ICFRE and Co-Chair of VRC, Dr. Shashi Kumar, Director, TFRI, Dr. Prakasham, Director, FRI, Dr. Savita, Director, IFGRB, Dr. Prashanth and two experts of the subject matter, Dr. D.K Khurana, Dr. Vishnu Bhatt, Shri Omkar Singh PCCF (HoFF), AGMUT and Dr. Amrinder Kaur, PCCF (HoFF), Haryana, were also present at the VRC meeting.

Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun established as an autonomous organisation under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, carries out the holistic research on forestry species. The nine Institutes under ICFRE are actively engaged in improvement of plantation tree species to improve yield, quality and productivity to meet the demand for domestic consumption by industries. 

In its earlier efforts, ICFRE released 27 high-yielding clones in 2010, 2011 and 2014 of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus Hybrid, Casuarina equisetifolia, Casuarina junghuhniana and Dalbergia sissoo and are in commercial production now. Of these, 27 varieties have been released in the past. Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore, developed 25 varieties and remaining two varieties of Dalbergia sissoo and Eucalyptus Hybrid were developed by Forest Research Institute, Dehradun.

Three Ministers jointly flagged off the 9th phase of Science Express Climate Action Special (SECAS) from Safderjung Railway Station here today.   While Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave and Union Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan were present at the railway station, Union Railway Minister, Shri Suresh Prabhu, joined the flagging off event through videoconferencing.  
            Addressing the gathering, Shri Dave said that in future, the Science Express should reach out to 6.5 lakh villages of the country.  He emphasised that till the train is transformed into a peoples’ movement and a vehicle to motivate people to take individual actions and initiatives to fight climate change, it will not succeed in its endeavours on the ground and will only be reduced to becoming a point of discussions in seminars.   “What should each individual do, what should the governments do, what should the society do, everyone’s role has to be determined”, Shri Dave pointed out.  The Minister highlighted that transparency in work and every pie of taxpayer’s money must be utilized in the right measure and past efforts have to be continued to ensure that the money reaches the people.  
            Minister of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu said that Climate Change is a big threat for the mankind and we can tackle this through collaborative efforts. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, India played a key role in initiating Climate Action Plan during Paris meet. He also said that Science Express will not just convey the message about climate change, but also generate dialogue and discussion on this burning issue. Science Express will embark on its journey of over 19000 km to cover 68 locations across India till September 8, 2017 and is expected to attract 30 lakh visitors. Climate Action Special will spread awareness on this key issue and augment our efforts to ensure a better future.
            Speaking on the occasion, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that four more such trains must be run in the coming years to develop the train into an even bigger movement.   The Minister also said that the importance of Climate Change can be gauged from the fact that it is the only theme that has been chosen for two consecutive years for Science Express.  Recalling his visit to San Fransisco to represent India at two meetings on Mission Innovation and Clean Energy Ministerial last year, the Minister said that 21 big nations of the world acknowledged that led by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, India has taken unparalleled initiatives in the field of Clean Energy, Mission Innovation, or Climate Change and that India has the ability and the strength to lead the world.  He added that the role of school students is most critical in making the Science Express a peoples’ movement.   Recounting the statistics, the Minister said over 1.5 crore visitors and students from    33, 801 schools have visited the Science Express till now.   The Minister also lauded the role and contribution of all departments and agencies at the Centre and States, as also the educators aboard the train in the running of Science Express.
Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha, Secretary, Department of Science & Technology, Shri Ashutosh Sharma, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Amita Prasad, Member, Railway Board, Shri Ravindra Gupta were among those present on the occasion.  Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha gave the welcome address and Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Amita Prasad delivered the vote of thanks.
After today’s flagging off, the SECAS will be open for public viewing at Delhi Cantonment Railway Station on February 18-19, following which it will embark upon its journey across the country.  SECAS II will run from February 17 to September 8, 2017 (See Schedule), over 19, 000 km during which it will be exhibited at 68 stations across India. The exhibition will convey a message about Climate Change and will also be a good opportunity to generate dialogue and discussion.
At each halt of SECAS, activities are planned to engage visitors across different age groups to reinforce its message. An exciting and much sought-after Outreach Programme is also conducted in local schools/institutions, along with activities on the railway platforms. In addition, informative take-away material has been made available for wider distribution amongst schools and visitors.
DST has entrusted Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC), Ahmedabad with the task of managing the SECAS across India. VASCSC’s team of qualified, trained and highly motivated Science Communicators travelling with the train explain and interpret the exhibition, answers queries, facilitate the visitors and conduct complementary activities.
The exhibition is open to all, but primarily targets students and teachers. More information is available on the website www.sciencexpress.in. For visit to the exhibition, an email can be sent to sciencexpress[at]gmail[dot]com, or the team aboard the train can be contacted on 09428405407. School students can participate in the JOS Lab in small batches of up to 20 students, by prior registration. 
There is no entry fee for visiting the exhibition.  Items such as mobiles, cameras, bags, match-boxes, cigarettes, beedis, tobacco, water bottles, any liquid, and any sharp/ pointed objects.  During its run across the country, the Railway station of the respective city will be the venue for visiting the train.  The timing for visiting the train is from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm.  
 
BACKGROUND:
Science Express is an innovative mobile science exhibition mounted on a 16-coach AC train which has been custom-built for Department of Science & Technology (DST) by Indian Railways. This unique mobile exhibition was first launched in October 2007 by DST. Since then, it has made eight tours of the country, travelling about 1, 42, 000 km and exhibiting at 455 locations. Over its 1602 exhibition days, Science Express received an overwhelming response and 1.56 crore visitors. SECAS has become the largest, the longest running and the most visited mobile science exhibition.
Climate Change is an important environmental issue, with many short-term and long term impacts. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are not just global in scope and unprecedented in scale but they also more severely affect the poor and marginalized people. However, there is very little understanding about climate change and its impacts. The state-of-the-art exhibition on board the SECAS aims to create awareness among various sections of society as to how climate change can be combated through mitigation and adaptation. 
Science Express, redesigned as SECAS, intends to contribute towards increasing understanding of the science of climate change, the observed and anticipated impacts, and different possible responses. The previous 3 phases of Science Express were rolled out as a joint initiative of DST and MoEFCC as ‘Biodiversity Special’ and showcased the myriad biodiversity of India. Thus it was rational to shift the focus to the theme of climate change, as it will affect the biodiversity of not just India but the entire globe as well.
Of the 16 coaches of SECAS, exhibitions in 8 coaches developed by MoEFCC. These exhibitions have been exclusively devoted to information, case studies and material related to various aspect of climate change, the underlying science, impacts, adaptation activities, mitigation solutions and policy approaches in a manner that is easy to understand and interesting for not just school students, but also the masses.  Exhibits and activities have been put up by DST and DBT in other coaches.
Science Express Phase I to IV showcased cutting-edge research in Science and Technology being carried out worldwide. Phase V to VII was based on the theme of biodiversity and as ‘Science Express Biodiversity Special (SEBS)’, it showcased the rich biodiversity of India and its conservation measures. Phase VIII as ‘Science Express Climate Action Special (SECAS)’ highlighted the global challenge of climate change. 
SECAS II is a unique collaborative initiative of Department of Science & Technology (DST), Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Railways and Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC).   MoEFCC has asked Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to make a contribution to the initiative.
The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. The first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA-1) took place in Marrakech in November 2016.  The Conference successfully demonstrated to the world that the implementation of the Paris Agreement is underway and the constructive spirit of multilateral cooperation on climate change continues. 
 
The broad themes covered in each exhibition of the coaches are:
·         Coach 1: Understanding Climate Change - Insights in the climate as a system, the greenhouse gas effect and the underlying reasons for climate change with key message that the current change in the climate is due to human activities. 
·         Coach 2: Impact of Climate Change -How temperature rise, monsoon variations, sea level rise are predicted to affect vital sectors like water, agriculture, forests and biodiversity, and human health and ways to reduce these.

Science  Express Climate Action Special (SECAS II) will be flagged off on  February 17 at 11 a.m from Safdarjung Railway station in Delhi.  Five  Ministers - Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment,  Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, Ministers of Science  and Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of State, Shri Y.S Choudhary  and Ministers of Railways, Shri Suresh Prabhu and Minister of State,  Shri Manoj Sinha, are likely to be present at the flagging off ceremony.  After  the flag-off, the SECAS will be open for public viewing at Delhi  Cantonment Railway Station on February 18 and February 19.   Following the public viewing, the train will embark upon its journey across the country.
The SECAS II will run from February 17 to September 8 2017, culminating its journey at Gandhinagar.  During its journey, the Science Express will cover over       19,  000 km, and will be exhibited at 68 stations across 20 states of the  country. During this seven month journey, SECAS will roll into Tripura  for the first time.  
Science  Express, redesigned as SECAS, intends to contribute towards increasing  understanding of the science of climate change, the observed and  anticipated impacts, and different possible responses.  It  is an innovative mobile science exhibition mounted on a 16 coach AC  train, which has been custom-built for Department of Science &  Technology (DST) by Indian Railways. This unique mobile exhibition was  first launched in October 2007 by DST. Since then it has travelled  across India eight times, traveling about 1, 42, 000 km and exhibiting  at 455 locations. More than 1.50 crore people visited the exhibition  over 1, 602 exhibition days. Science Express has become the largest, the  longest running and the most visited mobile science exhibition.  It has six entries in the Limca Book of Records.
The  exhibition will convey a message about Climate Change and will also be a  good opportunity to generate a dialogue and discussion. The  state-of-the-art exhibition on board the SECAS aims to create awareness  among various sections of society, as to how climate change can be  combated through mitigation and adaptation.   Exhibitions in 8 out of the 16 coaches of SECAS have been developed by MoEFCC.    Exhibits and activities by DST and DBT have been put up in the remaining 8 coaches.   
Some  of the broad themes of the coaches include – Underlying reasons for  climate change, with a key message that the present change in the  climate is due to human activities; impact of climate change and ways to  reduce it; adaptation strategies and adaptation measures being taken by  India; mitigation and various programmes implemented; international  negotiations for climate change and focus on concept of lifestyle  choices on what one can do to “Increase the Handprint and decrease your  Footprint”.   
The exhibition is exclusively devoted to  information, case studies and material related to various aspects of  climate change, the underlying science, impact, adaptation activities,  mitigation solutions and policy approaches in a manner that is easy to  understand and interesting, not just for school students, but also for  the masses. 
The  SECAS II is a unique collaborative initiative of Department of Science  & Technology (DST), Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate  Change (MoEFCC), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Railways  and Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC). MoEFCC has  asked Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to extend support in the  endeavour.
Science  Express Phase I to IV showcased cutting-edge research in Science and  Technology being carried out worldwide. Phase V to VII was based on the  theme of biodiversity.  As  ‘Science Express Biodiversity Special (SEBS)’, it showcased the rich  biodiversity of India and its conservation measures. Phase VIII as  ‘Science Express Climate Action Special (SECAS)’ highlighted the global  challenge of climate change.
The  previous three phases of Science Express were rolled out as a joint  initiative of DST and MoEFCC as ‘Biodiversity Special’ and showcased the  myriad biodiversity of India. Thus, it was rational to shift the focus  to the theme of climate change, as it will affect the biodiversity of  not just India, but the entire globe as well.
Queries on the visit to the exhibition can be sent through an email to sciencexpress[at]gmail[dot]com, or contact the team aboard the train on 09428405407.  The exhibition is open to all and there is no entry fee for the exhibition.  The railway station of the city will be the venue of the exhibition.  The timing of the exhibition will be from 10 a.m to 5 p.m.
Items  such as mobiles, cameras, bags, match-boxes, cigarettes, beedis,  tobacco, water bottles, any liquid, and any sharp/ pointed objects are  not allowed on the Science Express. 
Background:  
Climate  Change is an important environmental issue, with many short-term and  long-term impacts. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food  production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic  flooding, the impact of climate change are not just global in scope and  unprecedented in scale, but they also severely affect more, the poor and  marginalized people. However, there is very little understanding about  climate change and its impact.  
The  Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. The central aim  of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to the  threat of climate change and to strengthen the ability of countries to  deal with the impacts of climate change. The first session of the  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the  Paris Agreement (CMA 1) took place in Marrakech in November 2016.  The  Conference successfully demonstrated to the world that the  implementation of the Paris Agreement is underway and the constructive  spirit of multilateral cooperation on climate change continues.

                World Wetlands Day is celebrated on February 2 each year to mark the Day the Convention on Wetlands was adopted in the Iranian City of Ramsar in 1971. India is a party to the Convention since 1982 and committed to the Ramsar approach of wise use of wetlands. 
Continued functioning of wetlands has acquired a new meaning in the age of increasing water and food security. Wetlands are the life support for a range of plant and animal life and as wetlands degrade, the existence of these life forms would be under stress. At the same time, it is for the security of human well-being, that wetland conservation acquires prominence.
Wetlands support human well-being in a number of ways. As ‘kidneys of landscape’, wetlands receive flows of water and waste from upstream sources. They help stabilize water supplies, cleanse polluted waters, protect shorelines and recharge groundwater aquifers. The extensive food chain and biological diversity in wetlands make them ‘biological supermarkets’. Wetlands have special attributes as cultural heritage of humanity, and have deep connections with our beliefs and practices. They are an important part of our natural wealth and “liquid assets”. Despite their tremendous value, wetlands are also one of the most rapidly degrading ecosystems.
The theme of World Wetlands Day for 2017 is ‘Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction’. This theme has been selected to raise awareness on the vital roles of healthy wetlands in reducing the impacts of extreme events on communities and in helping to build resilience.
This year World Wetland Day is being celebrated in collaboration with the Government of Madhya Pradesh at Bhoj Wetlands, Bhopal, which is one of the 26 Ramsar sites that India has designated under the Ramsar Convention.  All the State Governments have been requested to celebrate the World Wetland Day in their respective States in a befitting manner. 
The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), Chennai, under the Ministry, has planned two events to spread public awareness about conservation of Wetlands. The first is a radio-outreach and awareness generation campaign. In partnership with a prominent radio station with a multi-city presence, NBA will run information snippets on wetlands, their role in disaster management, and ways and means to protect them, over the period of two weeks spread over a month (February 1 – March 2, 2017) in five cities across the country - Chennai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Thiruvanathapuram. NBA has also planned a school outreach and awareness raising exercise for February 2, 2017. A large number of schools in Chennai will receive translated copies of the Ramsar handouts for use of students through their school libraries, and school administrators are being requested to organise a small event during the morning assembly to spread the key messages. Municipal Councillors are also being contacted and being requested to take part in the event at their nearest corporation school. 
 
Wetlands are our natural buffers against increasing risk of floods, droughts and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act as sponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during lean season. The floods in Kashmir Valley in September, 2014 and Chennai city in December, 2015 are reminders of the ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable.  Evidences from Super Cyclone Kalinga of 1999, Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004 and Phailin of 2013 underline the role coastal wetlands as estuaries and mangroves can play in buffering communities from impacts of these cyclones and wave surges. 
Integration of wetlands within disaster risk reduction planning can be achieved by a series of collaborative actions between wetlands managers and those responsible for implementation disaster risk reduction actions. Assessment of wetland ecosystem health should be made a part of District level disaster planning processes. Wetland management plans should have an in-built component of disaster risk reduction to address the likely impacts of disasters on ecosystem health. Wetlands conservation and restoration should be included within the suite of actions proposed for reducing disaster risk, particularly those related to water, food and climate security. States should constitute Wetland Authorities as nodal agencies for integrated policy, planning and regulation of wetlands. Representation of Disaster Management Authorities should be ensured within the State Wetland Authorities. Mass awareness campaigns should be undertaken to educate stakeholders from all walks of society, particularly local communities on the value of wetland ecosystems.
The Ministry accords high priority to wetlands conservation, and has a dedicated scheme of ‘National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems’ (NPCA) to support State Governments in integrated management of these ecosystems. Till date, over 170 wetlands have been covered under the programme. The Ministry has also introduced Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 as the regulatory framework for conserving wetlands of the country.
A poster exhibition has been organised at the Ministry to celebrate the occasion. Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ajay Narayan Jha inaugurated the exhibition today. 
                   
 
Seventy five students from Kalindi College and Bharati College of Delhi University visited the exhibition.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Department of Posts (DOP) announced on 24 January, 2017 their decision to utilize the Head Post Offices (HPO) in the various States as Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) for delivering passport related services to the citizens of our country. The objective of this partnership is to extend passport services on a larger scale and to ensure wider area coverage.
The pilot projects for this joint venture between MEA and DOP was inaugurated on 25 January, 2017 at the HPO at Mysuru in Karnataka by Shri Ananth Kumar, Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs; and at the Post Office at Dahod in Gujarat by Gen (Retd.) Dr. V.K.Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs, and Shri Jaswantsinh Sumanbhai Bhabhor, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs, Government of India. The POPSK at these two places have been running successfully since their inauguration. One hundred appointments are being released every day for each of these POPSK.
With the successful operationalization of these two pilot projects, the Government has now decided to scale up this programme by opening 56 POPSKs at the following places in the first batch of expansion:

MEA and DOP are working closely for the early commencement of passport related services at the above mentioned POPSK. Once fully functional, applicants who apply for their passports on-line through the Passport Portal will be able to schedule an appointment at the above POPSK to complete the formalities necessary prior to the issue of the passport.
Following the liberalization of passport policies announced on 23 December, 2016, we have seen nearly 30% surge in demand for passports. For example, a record number of 53,400 applications were processed on 7.2.2017 out of which 49,259 were fresh applications. This is the highest since the commencement of the Passport Seva Project. Our Passport Offices are conducting special Passport Melas during the weekends to cater to the increasing demand for passports.
The pilot projects of the Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) have been running successfully at Mysuru and Dahod. We have been releasing 100 appointments for Mysuru and Dahod POPSK per day with cent per cent utilization. Appointments for Mysuru are now available in ten days while at Dahod it is available the next day. 
These are clear indicators that the liberalization of the passport policies and opening of the POPSK have been successful efforts of the Government that have been welcomed by our citizens. We expect that opening of these additional POPSK would further help our citizens in getting passports easily.

Yatris  can also see the scenic beauty of Chialekh Valley, or the ‘Om Parvat’,  which has the natural occurrence of snow in the shape of ‘Om’ on this  mountain.

The route through Nathu La Pass (Sikkim) is motorable and suitable for  senior citizens unable to undertake arduous trekking. From Gangtok the  route passes through scenic places like Hangu Lake, and through the vast  landscape of the Tibetan plateau. It is estimated to cost about Rs.2  lakhs person, and duration would be 21 days including 3 days in Delhi  for preparatory work.

The Central Board  of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into 10 more Advance Pricing  Agreements (APAs) over the last one week, including 7 Unilateral APAs  signed today. Two of these ten agreements are Bilateral APAs with the  United Kingdom and Japan. Seven of these Agreements have Rollback  provisions in them. 
 
         With this, the total number of APAs entered into by the CBDT has reached 140. This includes 10 Bilateral APAs and 130 Unilateral APAs.  In the current financial year, a total of 76 APAs (7 Bilateral APAs and  61 Unilateral APAs) have already been entered into. The CBDT expects  more APAs to be concluded and signed before the end of the current  fiscal.
 
The APAs entered  into over the last week pertain to various sectors of the economy like  Telecom, Pharmaceutical, Banking & Finance, Steel, Retail,  Information Technology, etc. The international transactions covered in  these agreements include Payment of Royalty Fee, Trading in Goods, IT  Enabled Services, Software Development Services, Marketing Support  Services, Clinical Research Services, Non-binding Investment Advisory  Services, Payment of Interest on ECB, etc. 
The APA Scheme was  introduced in the Income-tax Act in 2012 and the “Rollback” provisions  were introduced in 2014. The scheme endeavours to provide certainty to  taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of  pricing and setting the prices of international transactions in  advance. Since its inception, the APA scheme has evinced a lot of  interest from taxpayers and that has resulted in more than 700  applications (both unilateral and bilateral) being filed so far in about  five years. 
 
         The  progress of the APA Scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of  fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA programme has  been appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to  address complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent  manner.

The Indian  economy is expanding at a fast pace, boosting living standards and  reducing poverty nationwide. Further reforms are now necessary to  maintain strong growth and ensure that all Indians benefit from it,  according to a new report from the OECD. 
The latest OECD Economic Survey of India 2017 finds that the  acceleration of structural reforms and the move toward a rule-based  macroeconomic policy framework are sustaining the country’s longstanding  rapid economic expansion. 
The Survey,  launched in New Delhi today by OECD Secretary-General Mr Angel Gurria  and Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance,  Govt. of India, Shri  Shaktikanta  Das, hails India’s recent growth rate of more than 7 percent annually as  the strongest among G-20 countries. It identifies priority areas for  future action, including continuing plans to maintain macroeconomic  stability and further reduce poverty, additional comprehensive tax  reforms and new efforts to boost productivity and reduce disparities  between India’s various regions. 
Speaking on  the occasion, Mr Gurria said that India provides a welcome counter-point  to a global economy that has been under-performing for years. He  further said that India has been top performer and reforms are bearing  fruit, growth is strong and other macroeconomic indicators are  improving. Mr Gurria said that Maintaining the reform momentum will be  critical to boosting investment and creating the quality jobs needed to  ensure strong and inclusive growth for future generation, with all  segments of society benefitting from it. 
Later, Shri  Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of  Finance, Government of India said that he was pleased to note that the  OECD survey considers India as a top reformer in the world. As per the  report, the ease of doing business in India has improved. He assured  that the Government of India is well aware about the challenges before  it and there is work in progress on all of the recommendations enshrined  in the Survey. 
The  implementation of the landmark GST reform will contribute to making  India a more integrated market. By reducing tax cascading, it will boost  competitiveness, investment and job creation. The GST reform – designed  to be initially revenue-neutral – should be complemented by a form of  income and property taxes, the Survey said.  
The Survey  points out the need to make income and property taxes more  growth-friendly and redistributive. A comprehensive tax reform could  help raise revenue to finance much-needed social and physical  infrastructure, promote corporate investment, enable more effective  redistribution and strengthen the ability of states and municipalities  to better respond to local needs, according to the Survey. 
The OECD  points out that achieving strong and balanced regional development will  also be key to promoting inclusive growth. Inequality in income and in  access to core public services between states and between rural and  urban areas is currently large across India, while rural poverty is  pervasive. Continuing efforts to improve universal access to core public  services is essential.  
Recent  changes in India’s federalism model have given states more freedom and  incentives to modernize regulations and tailor public policies to local  circumstances. Ranking states on the ease of doing business is opening a  new era of structural reforms at the state level and will help unleash  India’s growth potential. Further benchmarking among states and  strengthening the sharing of best practices, particularly labor  regulations and land laws could add to the reform momentum. 
Raising  living standard in poorer states will require increasing productivity in  the agricultural sector. With employment expected to gradually shift  away from the agricultural sector, urbanization will gather pace. Thus,  better urban infrastructure will be needed to fully exploit cities’  potential for job creation, productivity gains and improving the quality  of life.

The  Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India signed here  $375 million in loans and grants to develop 800-kilometer  Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor, which is the First Phase of a  planned 2,500–kilometer long East Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC). The  Corridor is expected to spur development on India’s eastern coast in  line with the Government of India’s Make in India policy to stimulate  manufacturing, and Act East policy to integrate the Indian economy with  Asia’s dynamic global production networks.
The signing event was held on 23.02.2017 followed the ADB approval  of $631 million in loans and grants in September 2016 to develop the  Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor. ADB’s approved loans comprise  a $500 million multi-tranche facility to build key infrastructure in  the four main centers along the corridor – Visakhapatnam, Kakinada,  Amaravati, and Yerpedu-Srikalahasti in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The  First Tranche of $245 million was signed today that will finance  sub-projects to develop high-quality internal infrastructure in 2 of the  4 nodes of the corridor–Visakhapatnam and Yerpedu-Srikalahasti.
Another component of the approved ADB funds signed on 23.02.2017 was  a $125 million policy-based loan that will be used for capacity  development of institutions engaged in corridor management, provide  support to enhance ease of doing business and for supporting industrial  and sector policies to stimulate industrial development.
“ADB is supporting an industrial corridor development approach that  involves creation of efficient transport, and reliable water and power  supplies in the industrial clusters along with a skilled workforce, to  be backed by industry-friendly policies that improve ease of doing  business for integration of local economy with global production  networks,” said L. B. Sondjaja, Deputy Country Director of ADB’s India  Resident Mission who signed the loan agreement on behalf of ADB. “We  estimate that by 2025, annual industrial output along the corridor will  increase fourfold to $64 billion from about $16 billion in 2015 if  investment opportunities are maximized over the next few years.”
The project is an important milestone in the process of developing  the corridor and realizing the objectives of Make in India. We sincerely  hope that the project will complement the ongoing efforts of the  Government of Andhra Pradesh to enhance industrial growth and create  high-quality jobs,” said Raj Kumar, Joint Secretary (Multilateral  Institutions), in the Ministry of Finance, who signed the loan agreement  for Government of India. The project agreement was signed by Hema  Munivenkatappa, Special Secretary to Government (Finance) on behalf of  the Government of Andhra Pradesh.
Along with the ADB loans, agreement was also signed for a $5 million  grant from the multi-donor Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund  that is managed by ADB to build climate change resilient infrastructure.  The Government of India will provide extra funding of $215 million to  the $846 million project.
Among the outputs envisaged under the $245 million tranche 1 loan  include strengthening and widening of a 29.6-kilometer section of state  highway to four lanes to improve connectivity from Kakinada Port to  National Highway 16, investments in smart water management in  Visakhapatnam to reduce nonrevenue water and provide continuous water  supply, upgrading 7 power substations to supply high-quality and  reliable power supply to Visakhapatnam, Naidupeta, and  Yerpedu-Srikalahasti industrial clusters, and effluent treatment  facility in Atchutapuram and Naidupeta clusters.
The tranche 1 loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace  period of 5 years, a 20-year straight line repayment method at an annual  interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s LIBOR-based lending  facility.

                Since April-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Office (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, is bringing-out a Quarterly Report on Debt Management on regular basis. The Current Report pertains to the Quarter October-December 2016 (Q 3 FY 17).
 
            During Q3 of FY17, the Government issued dated securities worth Rs.161,000 crore taking the Gross Borrowings in April-December of FY17 to Rs. 5,02,000 crore or 83.7 per cent of BE, vis-a-vis 85.6 per cent of BE in April-December of FY 16. Net market borrowings from April-December of FY17 were at Rs.362,012 crore, 85.1 per cent of BE. Auctions of both Government dated Securities and Treasury Bills, during Q3 of FY17 were held in accordance with the pre-announced issuance calendar. In the 11 tranches of G-securities auction, five new securities, namely 7.06% GS 2046, 6.51% FRB 2024, 6.62% GS 2051, 6.57%GS 2033 and 6.79% GS 2029 were issued during the Quarter on October 10, November 7, November 28, December 5 and December 26, 2016, respectively. The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and Weighted Average Yield (WAY) issued during Q3 FY17 was 15.59 years and 6.78 per cent. The liquidity condition in the economy continued to improve during the quarter. The cash position of the Government during Q3 of FY17 was comfortable and remained in surplus mode. 
 
            The Public Debt (excluding liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Central Government provisionally increased by 2.4 per cent in Q3 of FY 17 on Q-o-Q basis. Internal debt constituted 92.6 per cent of Public Debt as at end-December 2016, while marketable securities accounted for 83.6 per cent of Public Debt.  About 26.6 per cent of outstanding stock has a residual maturity of up to 5 years at end – December 2016, which implies that over the next five years, on an average, around 5.3 per cent of outstanding stock needs to be repaid every year. Thus, rollover risk in the debt portfolio continues to be low. The implementation of budgeted buy back/ switches in coming period is expected to further reduce roll over risk.
 
            G-sec yields declined sharply across the curve during the quarter, post the Government’s decision on November 8, 2016 to demonetize high denomination value notes which was viewed positively by market as deposits were expected to surge in banks and led to bullish market sentiment, particularly for short end bonds. The bullish market sentiment was however, restrained to a certain extent with rise in global crude prices on OPEC agreement with Russia in its meeting to cut oil output, hiking by US Fed of key policy rate by 25 bps and FOMC commentary suggesting further rate hikes at a faster pace. The trading volume of Government Securities on an outright basis during Q3 FY 17 decreased by 11.87 per cent over the previous quarter.

The  Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance,  Government of India, Shri Shaktikanta Das said that IMF’s South Asia  Training and Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) is a pioneering  initiative of the Government of India and the International Monetary  Fund (IMF). He said that this is the IMF’s First Fully Integrated  Capacity Development Center, which brings together under one roof the  two building blocks of capacity development —training and technical  assistance. Shri Das was delivering the Inaugural Address after  inaugurating the IMF’s South Asia Training and Technical Assistance  Center (SARTTAC) in Delhi today. Shri Das said that he is sure the  center will build on this unique advantage, and overtime will evolve as a  model for others to emulate.  

Deputy Managing Director, IMF, Ms Carla Grasso and senior officials from  the SARTTAC’s six South Asian member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan,  India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) and development partners attended  the event. Less than a year after IMF Managing Director Ms Christine  Lagarde and the Finance Minister of India, Shri Arun Jaitley, signed a  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish a capacity development  center for South Asia, the opening of SARTTAC marks a major milestone in  the partnership between the IMF and its member countries in the region.   

Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Managing Director ​,IMF,​ Ms Grasso said that she is very appreciative of the strong partnerships  and determined efforts of so many that have paved the way for SARTTAC’s  opening. Ms Grasso further said that she is confident that the center  will make a very strong contribution to capacity building in South Asia,  which is so important for sustainable economic development, growth, and  stability.  

SARTTAC is a collaborative venture between the IMF, the member  countries, and development partners. The center’s strategic goal is to  help its member countries strengthen their institutional and human  capacity to design and implement macroeconomic and financial policies  that promote growth and reduce poverty.  

South Asia is a rapidly growing region that is home to one fifth of the  world’s population. SARTTAC will allow the IMF to meet more of the high  demand for technical assistance and training from the region. Through  its team of international resident experts, SARTTAC is expected to  become the focal point for the delivery of IMF capacity development  services to South Asia.  

SARTTAC, the newest addition to the IMF’s global network of fourteen  regional centers, is a new kind of capacity development institution,  fully integrating customized hands-on training with targeted technical  advice in a range of macroeconomic and financial areas, and generating  synergies between the two. SARTTAC is located in world class facilities  in New Delhi andis financed mainly by its six member countries —  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka — with  additional support from Australia, the Republic of Korea, the European  Union and the United Kingdom.  

Background:  

A global network of fourteen Regional Technical Assistance and Training  Centers anchor IMF support for economic institution building and are  complemented by global thematic fundsfor capacity development. They are  financed jointly by the IMF, external development partners, and member  countries.

The Income Tax Department (ITD) had initiated ‘Operation Clean Money’ on 31st January, 2017 for the e-verification of large cash deposits made during the period from 9th November to 30th December, 2016. Email and SMS were sent to 18 lakh taxpayers for submitting online response on the e-filing portal. 
The operation has seen an overwhelming response and till 12th February, 2017 more than 5.27 Lakh taxpayers have already submitted their response. Out of the 7.41 Lakh accounts confirmed by the 5.27 Lakh taxpayers, the cash deposit amount has been confirmed in more than 99.5 per cent accounts. The Department is encouraged to note that taxpayers have increased the cash deposit amount in nearly 90,000 accounts and provided details of additional 25,000 bank accounts in which cash was deposited. The explanation of cash deposit submitted by the taxpayer is being analysed in the context of nature of business and business profile in the earlier returns of the taxpayer.

The Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) of the Income Tax Department  (ITD) at Bengluru has already processed over 4.19 crore Income Tax  Returns (ITRs) and issued over 1.62 crore refunds during the current  financial year up to 10th February, 2017.  The amount of refunds issued  at Rs.1.42 Lakh Crore is 41.5% higher than the corresponding period last  year.  

As a result of emphasis on expeditious issue of refunds, 92% of all  Income Tax returns were processed within 60 days demonstrating CBDT’s  commitment to faster and more efficient taxpayer service. Of the refunds  issued, 92% are below Rs.50,000 due to the high priority given to  expeditious issue of refunds to small taxpayers. Only 2% of refunds less  than Rs. 50,000 are remaining to be issued. Majority of these cases  relate to recently filed ITRs or where the taxpayer’s response to the  Department is awaited.  

Taxpayers reposed faith in CBDT’s e-governance initiatives by filing  electronically a whopping 4.01 Cr ITRs till 10th February 2017  representing an increase of 20% over the previous year. Also, more than  60 lakh other online forms were filed with an increase of nearly 41%  compared to the previous year.

CBDT is committed to ensuring best possible taxpayer  services through its e-governance programs and increasing the coverage  and scope of electronic filing and processing of various forms and  applications.

                A  Meeting was held today in Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) along with the  Senior Officers of various Departments to review the functioning of  ‘Shell Companies’ (companies which does not conduct any operations and  indulge in money laundering) in India, so as to prevent their misuse for  money laundering and tax-evasion, especially in the context of  unearthing black money post demonetization. There are about 15 lakh  registered companies in India; and only 6 lakh companies file their  Annual Return. This means that large number of these companies may be  indulging in financial irregularities.   

In  the initial analysis, it has been found that ‘Shell Companies’ are  characterized by nominal paid-up capital, high reserves & surplus on  account of receipt of high share premium, investment in unlisted  companies, no dividend income, high cash in hand, private companies as  majority shareholders, low turnover & operating income, nominal  expenses, nominal statutory payments & stock in trade, minimum Fixed  Asset.

In a  small sample analysis of such companies, it has been found that Rs.1,238  crore cash has been deposited in these entities during  November-December period. Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has  filed criminal prosecution for cheating National Exchequer after  investigation of entry operators running a group of 49 Shell Companies  and other proprietorship concerns. It has been found that 559  beneficiaries have laundered money to the extent of Rs.3900 Crore with  the help of 54 Professionals who have been identified. These information  has been shared with SIT, Income Tax Department, Enforcement  Directorate, SEBI and The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  (ICAI). Income Tax Department has reopened completed assessment in these  cases and Enforcement Directorate has initiated action under Prevention  of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002. ICAI has also initiated  disciplinary proceedings against its members. Winding up process has  been initiated in respect of 49 Shell Companies.
In  order to create a credible deterrence a “Whole of Government Approach”  will be adopted through coordinated efforts and by leveraging  technology. It has also been decided that appropriate red flag  indicators would be used for identifying shell companies, and a data  base of such companies and their Directors would be built by pulling in  information from various agencies. The data base will also capture  Aadhar number of individual Directors in the companies.

Harsh  punitive actions will be taken against the deviant shell companies  which will include freezing of Bank Accounts, striking off the names of  dormant companies, invocation of Benami Transactions (Prohibition)  Amendment Act, 2016.

A  Task Force with members from various regulatory Ministries and  Enforcement Agencies has been set-up under the Co-chairmanship of the  Revenue Secretary and Corporate Affairs Secretary to monitor the actions  taken against deviant shell companies by various agencies.   The  concerned regulatory Ministry will ensure that disciplinary actions are  initiated against the professionals indulging in mal practices and  abetting the entry operators of the shell companies.

Enforcement Directorate has intimated that bank employees have been found indulging in money laundering and other unfair practices during the phase of demonetisation and that the investigations have been initiated under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 against certain bank officials of various banks during post demonetization. The act provides for attachment of property as well as prosecution of the accused involved in money laundering.
 
            Further, as part of their staff accountability mechanisms, on the basis of prima facie involvement in irregularities relating to demonetisation, Public Sector Banks (PSBs) are so far reported to have placed 156 officials under suspension and to have  transferred 41 officials.  PSBs are also reported to have filed 26 cases with Police/CBI wherever criminal cases are involved.  In respect of Private Sector Banks, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has informed that 11 employees have been placed under suspension where bank employees have been found involved in ‘irregular exchange of transaction’ of Specified Bank Note (SBN) during the phase of demonetization.  RBI has further informed that the banks have initiated internal investigation and complaints have been filed with police/CBI.
 
Whenever a complaint against a bank official(s) is received and any irregularities are found or observed on the part of Banks’ official (s), the Banks initiate action as per their extant rules and commensurate punishment is awarded to the delinquent employees based on the seriousness of the wrongdoings as per Bank’s disciplinary rules.

The  Government is not thinking to hike service tax if GST roll out is  delayed. The Government is taking steps to expedite the GST and to take  the concerns of the States on board.  

Goods and Services Tax Council (GST Council) has been constituted on  15.09.2016 under Article 279A of the Constitution. The GST Council  consists of the Union Finance Minister, the Union Minister of State in  charge of Revenue or Finance and the Minister in charge of Finance or  Taxation or any other Minister nominated by each State Government. The  GST Council is presently deliberating on various issues entrusted to it.  The GST Council has held nine meetings so far and has made  recommendations with respect to thresholds, tax rates, GST Rules,  treatment of existing tax incentives, Draft GST Compensation Law and  Model GST Law for implementation of GST. All the decisions taken by the  Council so far have been based on consensus. The Government is making  concerted efforts in the form of IT readiness, rigorous consultations,  workshops and training sessions for the industry and traders, and all  other stake holders involved.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT),Department of Revenue, Ministry  of Finance has entered into four more unilateral Advance Pricing  Agreements (APAs) yesterday. 

The four APAs signed pertain to the Manufacturing, Financial and  Information Technology sectors of the economy. The international  transactions covered in these agreements include Contract Manufacturing,  IT Enabled Services and Software Development Services. 

With this, the total number of APAs entered into by the CBDT has  reached 130. This includes 8 bilateral APAs and 122 Unilateral APAs. In  the current financial year, a total of 66 APAs (5 bilateral APAs and 61  unilateral APAs) have already been entered into. The CBDT expects more  APAs to be concluded and signed before the end of the current fiscal. 

The APA Scheme was introduced in the Income-tax Act in 2012 and the  “Rollback” provisions were introduced in 2014. The scheme endeavours to  provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by  specifying the methods of pricing and determining the prices of  international transactions in advance. Since its inception, the APA  scheme has evinced a lot of interest from taxpayers and that has  resulted in more than 700 applications (both unilateral and bilateral)  being filed so far in about five years. 

The progress of the APA Scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of  fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA program has been  appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to address  complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent manner.

As per the First Advance Estimates released by the Central Statistics  Office (CSO), the economy is estimated to grow at 7.1 per cent in  2016-17, as compared to the growth of 7.9 per cent achieved in 2015-16.  Data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the quarter October-December,  2016 and January-March, 2017 is yet to be released by the CSO. 

The International Monetary Fund, in its World Economic Outlook Update,  released in January 2017, has estimated that India’s growth in 2016-17  would be 6.6 per cent, as compared to 7.6 per cent in the previous year.  

As per the first advance estimates released by the CSO, the growth rate  in agriculture and allied sectors, manufacturing sector, services  sector has been estimated to be 4.1 per cent, 7.4 per cent and 8.8 per  cent respectively in 2016-17, as compared to the corresponding figures  of 0.8 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 9.8 per cent as per the first revised  estimates for 2015-16. 

Apart from the interest waiver announced on 31stDecember 2016, the  agricultural sector is expected to receive a boost from the measures  announced in the Budget 2017-18 including higher target for agriculture  credit, increased coverage under Fasal BimaYojana scheme and  augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund set up in NABARD. The  rural economy is also expected to be supported by the emphasis given by  the Budget on employment generation. The manufacturing sector is likely  to benefit from measures announced in the Budget 2017-18 like lower  income tax for companies with annual turnover up to Rs 50 crore;  allowing carry-forward of MAT credit up to a period of 15 years instead  of 10 years at present; further measures to improve the ease of doing  business; and the scheme for creating employment in the leather and  footwear industries. Apart from the measures listed above to encourage  business and enterprise, the services sector will also be boosted by the  major push to digital economy and the focus on infrastructure like  construction and affordable housing. 

The decision on the Repo rate is taken by the Monetary Policy Committee  of the Reserve Bank of India, taking into account various factors  including the inflation and the state of the economy. 

This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the  Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Consequent to the announcement of withdrawal of Legal Tender status of  banknotes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations from the midnight of  November 8, 2016, the Reserve Bank of India made arrangements for supply  of adequate quantity of banknotes in various denominations to the  public through the banks. 

Over the period from November 10, 2016 upto December 19, 2016, banks  have reported that banknotes worth Rs. 5,92,613 crore have been issued  to public either over the counter or through ATMs. 

In this period, the Reserve Bank has issued to the banks and their  branches, for distribution to the public, a total of 22.6 billion pieces  of notes of various denominations of which 20.4 billion pieces belonged  to small denominations of Rs. 10, 20, 50 and 100s and 2.2 billion  belonged to higher denominations of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given banks the freedom to fix bank service charges for transactions. 

RBI has deregulated interest rates on credit card dues. Interest rates  are determined by banks with the approval of their respective Board of  Directors subject to regulatory guidelines on interest rate on advances  issued by RBI from time to time. RBI does not maintain information on  the rate of commission charged. 

National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has  approved a scheme for giving 0.5% incentive on payments made through the  Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) to merchants. 

In respect of debit card transactions on PoS devices, between 1.1.2017  and 31.3.2017, Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) has been capped at 0.25% for  transaction value upto Rs. 1,000, and for debit card transactions value  between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000, MDR has been capped at 0.5%.

Further, Government has issued a direction in  public interest to all public sector banks not to charge fees for  transactions settled on IMPS and UPI in excess of rates charged for  National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) for transactions above Rs.  1,000, with service tax being charged at actual; for USSD transactions  till 31.3.2017 above Rs. 1,000, a further 50 paise discount is provided.  

NPCI has waived switching fees for RuPay Card transactions (both for PoS  and e-commerce), IMPS, UPI, National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP) and  AEPS, with effect from 1.1.2017 till 31.3.2017. 

Credit card, debit card, charge card and other payment card services by  banks have been exempted from payment of service tax for transactions of  up to Rs. 2,000. 

Government has introduced Lucky Grahak Yojana for customers and Digi  Dhan Yojana for merchants to promote means of cashless transactions. 

In terms of Office of Controller General of Accounts Office Memorandum  dated 14.12.2016, the applicable Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) charges on  debit cards for payment up to Rs. 1 lakh shall be absorbed by the  Government. In terms of Department of Public Enterprises letter dated  9.12.2016, all Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are required to  ensure that transaction fees, MDR charges associated with payment  through digital means shall not be passed on to the consumers and all  such expenses shall be borne by CPSEs. 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the  Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

The demand of such machines in the country has increased after November  9, 2016, which is evident from the fact that during the months of  November and December 2016, 2.52 lakh PoS machines have been installed. 

Neither the Government has undertaken any study to assess the number of  PoS machines needed to ensure smooth cashless economy in the country nor  Government has any proposal for procuring PoS machines. 

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued guidelines to prevent PoS fraud  and directed the banks to add more security features in credit and debit  cards to stop frauds, vide its circular dated May 26, 2016 on  upgradation of ATMS and cards. 

Public Sector banks have been advised by the Government to structure  rental payments in such a manner that the small merchant does not have  to pay more than Rs. 100 per month rental on installation of PoS  terminals. 

National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has  committed to support banks through the Financial Inclusion Fund for  deployment of up to two PoS devices per village, to cover one lakh  villages of Tier 5 and 6 areas. 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the  Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Public Sector banks have been advised by the Government to structure  rental payments in such a manner that the small merchant does not have  to pay more than Rs. 100 per month rental on installation of PoS  terminals. 

National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has  committed to support banks through the Financial Inclusion Fund for  deployment of up to two PoS devices per village, to cover one lakh  villages of Tier 5 and 6 areas. 

This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State in the  Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

Promotion of Digital economy is in integral part of Government’s  strategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money.  The earlier initiatives of the Government to promote financial inclusion  and the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity were important  pre-curser. However, RBI has cautioned the users, holders and traders of  Virtual Currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins about the potential  financial, operational, legal customer protection and security related  risks that they are exposing themselves to. The creation, trading or  usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment have not been  authorised by the Reserve Bank of India.

Government is contemplating to revise the tax treaties with partner  countries to enable the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and  Enforcement Directorate (ED) to use the data for prosecution of those  who have stashed black money abroad. Treaty partner countries have been  requested to modify the tax treaties, so as to explicitly include  provisions that will enable information exchanged for tax purposes to be  utilized for other purposes, including criminal proceedings in non-tax  matters. 40 treaties for avoidance of double taxation have been revised  accordingly. In addition, India has also signed the Multilateral  Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which  also similarly facilitates exchange of information. These developments  enable use of such information by non-tax agencies, subject to agreement  by the Competent Authorities of the Requested Contracting State. 

All treaty partner countries have not agreed to the proposal. Since a  bilateral treaty cannot be modified unless both treaty partners agree,  it is not possible to provide any time frame for this purpose

All decisions of GST Council so far have been taken unanimously. Various  states may have different points of view on an issue but the final  decisions have been unanimous. 

The issue regarding treatment of the existing tax incentive schemes of  the Central and State Governments was discussed during the 2nd Meeting  of the GST Council held on 30th September, 2016 and the Council agreed  that all entities exempted from payment of indirect tax under any  existing tax incentive scheme shall pay tax in the GST regime and that  in case the Central or State Government decided to continue any existing  exemption/incentive/deferral scheme, then it shall be administered by  way of a reimbursement mechanism through the budgetary route. 

In the ninth meeting of GST Council held on 16th Jan, 2017, it has been  agreed that for taxpayers with turnover below Rs.1.5 Crore, 90% of the  taxpayers shall be under the administrative control of the State tax  administration and 10% shall be under the administrative control of the  Central tax administration. It has also been decided that the total  number of taxpayers with turnover above Rs.1.5 Crore shall be divided  equally between the Central and State tax administrations.

NITI Aayog constituted a committee on Sick/Loss making/Non performing  Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) on March 9th 2016. The  committee noted that financial performance of 74 CPSEs has been  unsatisfactory and a number of these have requested for and received  periodic support from budgetary resources. Over the years, this has  become a significant drain on limited resources of the government. The  committee has made the recommendations of closure/winding up of 26 such  CPSEs. 

Under the Central Sector Scheme of DPE i.e. Counseling, Retraining &  Redeployment (CRR Scheme) skill development training is providing to  CPSE’s employees separated under Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS)/Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) (VRS/VSS Optees) to enable them  to get redeployment or to take up self-employment. The Scheme has a  provision for training of the dependent also in lieu of the VRS/VSS  Optees.

                In  a bid to provide further impetus to the National Pension System (NPS),  the following provisions have been introduced in the Finance Bill 2017  laid down in the Parliament today.  
 
Tax-exemption to partial withdrawal from National Pension System (NPS) 
 
The existing provision of section 10(12A)of the Income Tax Act, 1961  provides that payment from National Pension System (NPS)  to a subscriber  on closurer of his account or opting out shall be exempt up to 40% of total corpus  at  the time of withdrawal . The amount utilized for purchase of annuity is  also tax exempt. At the time of normal exit, 40% of the total corpus is  mandatorily required to be purchased for annuity. The subscriber has  the option to use higher amount for purchase of annuity. 
 
In order to provide further relief to the subscriber  of NPS, it has been proposed to insert a new clause (12B) in the section  10 of Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide exemption on partial withdrawal  not exceeding 25% of the contribution made by an employee in accordance  with the terms and conditions specified under Pension Fund Regulatory  and Development Authority Act, 2013 and regulations made there under. 
 
This benefit will be effective on partial withdrawal made by the subscriber after 1st April 2017. 
 
Further,  Contribution up to 20% of the Gross Income of the Self-employed  individual (Individual other than salaried class) will be deductible  from the taxable income under Section 80CCD (1) of the Income Tax Act,  1961, as against 10% earlier.

This is with a view to provide parity between a salaried employee and a self-employed.
This benefit will be available on contribution made by the self employed persons on or after 1st April 2017. 
This  increased limit for tax benefit will help the self-employed  individuals, to save taxes on higher contribution in NPS and thereby  properly plan for their old age income security.
 
Additional  tax deduction on investment upto Rs. 50000/- under Section 80CCD (1B)  will continue to remain the same for all NPS subscribers whether  salaried or self-employed.

                The  Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley said  that India has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and  policy making in the last one year and there were two tectonic policy  initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST  and the progress made for its implementation ; and demonetisation of  high denomination bank notes. Presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in  Parliament today, the Finance Minister said, the advantages of GST for  the economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax  simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively  discussed in both the Houses of Parliament. 
The  Finance Minister said that demonetisation seeks to create a new  ‘normal’ wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real .He said that   this exercise is part of the  Government’s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit  currency and terror funding. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley  said,  that the demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term  benefits in terms of greater digitisation of the economy,increased flow  of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues. It also helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived at large. There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society. 
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley underlined that  demonetisation  and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of  our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact  on our economy and the lives of our people. He said that in the last  two and half years, it has been the Government's mission to bring a  Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed as we have moved  from a discretionary administration to a policy and system based  administration; from favouritism to transparency and objectivity in  decision making; from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted  delivery; and from informal economy to formal economy. Finance Minister  further said that inflation, which was in double digits, has been  controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a  massive war against black money has been launched. He added that the  Government will continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that  the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the  youth, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, women and other  vulnerable sections of our society.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley while presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Parliament today said that the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly. He said that the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people who are evading taxes. In this direction, the Finance Minister has reduced the Income Tax rate from 10 to 5 per cent for small taxpayers. Besides it, the Finance Minister  announced various rationalization measures in the General Budget 2017-18, some of which are listed below-
  
(i)                 Continuing the Government’s crackdown against the dishonest and the corrupt, the Budget proposed that if an accountant or a merchant banker or a registered valuer, furnishes incorrect information in a report or certificate, he shall be liable to a penalty of Rs 10000 for each such default. 
 
(ii)               To promote green growth, the Finance Minister has proposed to provide a concessional tax rate of 10 per cent in case of income arising from sale of carbon credit. 
 
(iii)             In line with exemption available to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund, now the income of the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund or the Lieutenant Governor’s Relief Fund shall be exempt from tax.
 
(iv)             To boost the growth of call center industry and increase employment opportunities for the Indian youth, the Finance Minister proposed to lower the rate of deduction of tax in case of payments made to a person engaged only in the business of operation of call centre. 
 
(v)               It is proposed to provide for grant of interest in case of refund of excess payment of TDS. At the same time, to ensure timely filing of returns of income, a fee will be levied in case of delay in filing the return. 
 
(vi)             It is proposed to authorise the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), to issue
directions or instructions in order to remove hardships faced by the taxpayers in
connection with imposition of penalty relating to tax deduction or collection at
source.
 
(vii)           The Budget also clarifies that provisions relating to tax deduction at source shall not apply to exempt compensation received under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
 
(viii)         In order to strengthen the TCS regime, it is proposed to provide that the collectee
shall furnish his PAN to the collector, failing which, tax shall be collected at a
higher rate.
 
 
(ix)             It is proposed to provide that no person shall receive payment or aggregate of payments of an amount of Rs 3 lakh or more from a person in a day, or in respect of a single transaction, or in respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion, otherwise than by an account payee cheque or account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account. This restriction shall not apply to Government, banks or certain other categories as notified by the Central Government. Contravention of this provision will invite penalty.
 
(x)               In order to remove hardship, it is proposed to omit section 197(C) of the Finance Act, 2016 which provided for assessment of undisclosed income relating to any period prior to commencement of the Income Declaration Scheme, 2016. However, in search cases, it is proposed to provide that in case tangible evidence is found during the search, the Assessing Officer can assess income upto ten years preceding the year in which search took place
 
(xi)             It is proposed to merge the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) for Income-Tax with AAR for Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax; and create common AAR.  It is proposed to make the orders passed by the authority under section 10(23C) of the Income-tax Act, appealable before the Tribunal.
 
(xii)           In order to provide parity between an individual who is an employee and an individual who is self-employed, it is proposed to provide that the self-employed individual shall be eligible for deduction upto 20 per cent of his gross total income in respect of contribution made to National Pension System Trust.
 
(xiii)         It is proposed to provide tax neutrality in case of conversion of preference shares of a company into equity shares of that company.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun  Jaitley while presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Parliament today  informed that the  total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017-18 stands at  Rs. 3,96,135 crores. In the road sector, the Budget allocation has been  stepped up for Highways from  Rs. 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs. 64,900 crores in 2017-18.  Further, 2,000 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified  for construction and development to facilitate better connectivity with  ports and remote villages. 
 
The Finance Minister,Shri Arun Jaitley in his Budget Speech, stated that the total length of roads, including those under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY),  built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which is  significantly higher than previous three years. Further, Shri Jaitley  informed that a specific programme for development of multi-modal  logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, will be  drawn-up and implemented that will make our economy more competitive.
 
Speaking on upgradation of Civil Aviation infrastructure, Shri Jaitley said that the  Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and  maintenance in the PPP mode. Further, Airport Authority of India Act  will be amended to enable effective monetization of land assets. The  resources, so raised, will be utilized for airport upgradation. For  transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, the  Budget provides Rs. 2,41,387 crores in 2017-18. This magnitude of  investment will spur a huge amount of economic activity across the  country and create more job opportunities, the Finance Minister said in  his Budget speech.
 
Calling Telecom sector  as an important component of the infrastructure eco-system, Shri  Jaitley noted that the recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum  scarcity in the country. This will give a major fillip to mobile  broadband and Digital India for the benefit of people living in rural  and remote areas. Further, for the BharatNet Project, the allocation has been stepped up to  Rs.10,000 crores in 2017-18 and 1,55,000 kms of Optical Fiber Cables  have been laid. Shri Jaitley informed that by the end of 2017-18, high  speed broadband connectivity on optical fiber will be available in more  than 1,50,000 gram panchayats, with wifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon initiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills through digital technology, he added.
 
For strengthening our Energy sector,  the Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In  the first phase, 3 such Reserve facilities have been set up and in the  second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations,  namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in Rajasthan. This will take  the country’s strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. Further, the  Finance Minister, in his Budget speech, proposed to create an integrated  public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the performance  of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies. In solar energy, the second phase of Solar Park development is proposed to be taken up for additional 20,000 MW capacity, Shri Jaitley added.
 
The Finance Mini9ster Shri Jaitley further stated that the Government is creating an ecosystem to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing.  Over 250 investment proposals for electronics manufacturing have been  received in the last 2 years, totaling to an investment of Rs.1.26 lakh  crores. A number of global leaders and mobile manufacturers have set up  production facilities in India, hence the Finance Minister said that  allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and EDF have been  exponentially increased to an all-time high of Rs. 745 crores in  2017-18. Further, a new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade  Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18 to  focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive world.

                The  Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley  while presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Parliament today said  that the Government  has prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by  2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020. Elimination of tuberculosis  by 2025 is also targeted. Similarly, action plan has been prepared to  reduce IMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to  100 by 2018-2020. 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into  Health and Wellness Centres.
The  Finance Minister Shri Jaitley in his Budget Speech said that to  strengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care, adequate  availability of specialist doctors is needed. We have therefore decided  to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per annum.  In addition, steps will be taken to roll-out DNB courses in big District  Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal  Corporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start  DNB courses. The Central Government will work with the State Governments  to take these tasks forward. The Government is committed to take  necessary steps for structural transformation of the Regulatory  framework of Medical Education and Practice in India.
Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will be set-up in the States of Jharkhand and Gujarat.
The Budget  also proposes to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure  availability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic  medicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be  formulated. These rules will be internationally harmonised and attract  investment into this sector. This will reduce the cost of such devices.

                In a bid to give a push to Digital Economy  and weed-out corruption and black money, the Union Minister for Finance  and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in his Budget Speech today said  that the Government has decided that no transaction above Rs 3 lakh  will be permitted in cash. Accepting a suggestion by Special  Investigation Team on Black Money to ban cash transactions above Rs 3  lakhs, the Finance Minister has proposed an amendment to the Income-tax  Act in the Finance Bill.
Presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in the  Parliament, the Finance Minister said that the Government will launch  two new Schemes to promote the usage of BHIM App i.e, Referral Bonus  Scheme for individuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants. BHIM App was  launched to promote digital transactions and will unleash the power of  mobile phones for digital payments and financial inclusion, The Finance  Minister Shri Jaitley informed the House that 125 lakh people have  adopted the BHIM app so far.
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley also  announced that Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment  System, will be launched shortly. This will be specifically beneficial  for those who do not have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones.  A Mission will be set-up with a target of 2,500 crore digital  transactions for 2017-18 through UPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit  cards. Banks have targeted to introduce additional 10 lakh new PoS  terminals by March 2017. They will be encouraged to introduce 20 lakh  Aadhar based PoS by September 2017.
Highlighting the Government’s strategy to  clean the system through digital economy, Shri Jaitley said that it has a  transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the economy  and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system. This, in  turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country through  lower cost of credit. India is now on the cusp of a massive digital  revolution, he added. The Finance Minister said that a shift to digital  payments has huge benefits for the common man. The earlier initiative of  the Government to promote financial inclusion and the JAM trinity were  important precursors to the current push for digital transactions, the  Finance Minister added.
In a bid to incentivize the digital  transactions, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley proposed that the  presumptive income tax for small and medium tax payers whose turn-over  is up to Rs 2 crore will be reduced from the present 8% of their  turnover which is counted as presumptive income to 6% in respect of  turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will be  applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also, he  added.

The Finance Minister also proposed to limit  the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as  capital expenditure, up to Rs 10,000. Similarly, the limit of cash  donation which can be received by a Charitable Trust is being reduced  from Rs 10,000/- to Rs 2000/-.
To promote cashless transactions, the Finance  Minister in the Budget has proposed to exempt BCD, Excise/CV duty and  SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for m-POS, micro ATM standards  version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris Scanners. He also  proposed to exempt parts and components for manufacture of such devices,  so as to encourage domestic manufacturing of these devices.
To strengthen and regulate the digital  economy, the Finance Minister has proposed to create a Payments  Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India(RBI) by replacing the  existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement  Systems.  The Committee on Digital  Payments constituted by the Department of Economic Affairs has  recommended structural reforms in the payment eco system, including  amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The  Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and bring  about appropriate amendments, Finance Minister added. 
To strengthen the digital payment  infrastructure and grievance handling mechanisms, the Finance Minister  said in his Budget Speech  that  the focus would be on rural and semi urban areas through Post Offices,  Fair Price Shops and Banking Correspondents. He added that steps would  be taken to promote and possibly mandate petrol pumps, fertilizer  depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport offices,  universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have  facilities for digital payments, including BHIM App. A proposal to  mandate all the Government receipts through digital means, beyond a  prescribed limit, is under consideration. The Government will strengthen  the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment resources for taking up these  initiatives, the Finance Minister added.
In his Budget Speech, the Finance Minister  informed that increased digital transactions will enable small and micro  enterprises to access formal credit. He said that the Government will  encourage SIDBI to refinance credit institutions which provide unsecured  loans, at reasonable interest rates, to borrowers based on their  transaction history. 
The Finance Minister  assured the House that the Government will consider and work with  various stakeholders for early implementation of the interim  recommendations of the Committee of Chief Ministers on digital  transactions.
Shri Jaitley said that the Government is  considering the option of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act to  ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are able to realise the  payments.

While presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Lok Sabha here  today, the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley has said that the shares  of Railway Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON  will be listed in stock exchanges. The Government will encourage  strengthening the CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions  and soon create an integrated public sector ‘oil major’, he added.
Stating that the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has proved an overwhelming success in extending funds for  the deprived sections, Shri Jaitley doubled the budget target under the  scheme to Rs. 2.44 lakh crores.
Easing  the stressed legacy accounts of banks, Shri Jaitley earmarked Rs.  10,000 crores for recapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18 and assured need  based additional allocation.
Stating  that the disinvestment policy announced in the last budget will  continue, Shri Jaitley further said that the Government will put in  place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of  identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. This will foster greater public  accountability and unlock the true value of these companies, he added.
Shri  Jaitley said the CPSEs will be integrated across the value chain of an  industry through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these  methods it will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies  of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for  the stakeholders, he added. Possibilities of such restructuring are  visible in the oil and gas sector. The Government proposes to create an  integrated public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the  performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas  companies.
The Finance Minister said that the  Exchange Trade Fund (ETF), comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received  overwhelming response in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO). The  Government will continue to use ETF as a vehicle for further  disinvestment of shares. Accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE  stocks and other Government holdings will be launched in 2017-18, he  added.
Shri  Jaitley said that the focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts  of Banks will continue and the legal framework has been strengthened to  facilitate resolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code and the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery  Tribunal Acts. In line with the ‘Indradhanush’ roadmap, an amount  of Rs. 10,000 crore is provided for recapitalisation of Banks in  2017-18 and additional allocation will be provided, as may be required,  he added.
Shri Jaitley said that the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has  contributed significantly to funding the unfunded and the underfunded.  He further said that the last year target of Rs.1.22 lakh crores was  exceeded and for 2017-18, he proposes to double the lending target of  2015-16 and set it at Rs. 2.44 lakh crores. Priority will be given to  Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women, he added.
Shri  Jaitley said that the Stand Up India scheme was launched by the  Government in April 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women  entrepreneurs to set up green field enterprises and become job creators.  Over 16,000 new enterprises have come up through this scheme in  activities, as diverse as food processing, garments, diagnostic centres,  etc, he added.

                While presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Lok Sabha here  today, the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley proposed that the  Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) will be phased-out in the  next fiscal. Expressing concern over dubious deposit schemes, Shri  Jaitley said that a Bill will soon be tabled in Parliament to protect  the poor and gullible investors.
Stating that the Government  has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI policy in the last two  years and more than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now through the  automatic route, Shri Jaitley said that the  FIPB has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI  applications and now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out.  Therefore, FIPB will be abolished in 2017-18, he added. 
Pointing  out that there is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible  investors from dubious deposit schemes, operated by unscrupulous  entities, the Finance Minister  said that a draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes  has been placed in the public domain and will be introduced in  parliament shortly after its finalisation. This Act will be amended in  consultation with various stakeholders, as part of our ‘Clean India’  agenda, he added.
Dealing  with the markets, the Finance Minister proposed that high net worth  NBFCs can also now participate in IPOs just like the banks and insurance  companies. Shri Jaitley said he proposed to allow systemically  important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be  categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI at par with  the banks and insurance companies, making them eligible for  participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. This will  strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments, he added.
Shri  Jaitley said that a common application form for registration, opening  of bank and demat accounts, and issue of PAN will be introduced for  Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). SEBI, RBI and CBDT will jointly put  in place the necessary systems and procedures. This will greatly enhance  operational flexibility and ease of access to Indian capital markets.  The commodities and securities derivative markets will be further  integrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational  frameworks, he added.
In  effort to improve the ease of doing business, the Finance Minister said  the process of registration of financial market intermediaries like  mutual funds, brokers, portfolio managers, etc. will be made fully  online by SEBI. Steps will be taken for linking of individual demat  accounts with Aadhar, he added. 
To  check bank NPAs and enhance capital flows into the securitisation  industry, Shri Jaitley said that the listing and trading of Security  Receipts issued by a securitisation company or a reconstruction company  under the SARFAESI Act will be permitted in SEBI registered stock  exchanges.
Stating that in the Financial Sector, the Government’s focus is  on building stable and stronger institutions, Shri Jaitley said this  thrust will be continued with several new measures as part of the  reforms agenda. Shri Jaitley said that the Cyber security is critical  for safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial sector and  a Computer Emergency Response Team for our Financial Sector (CERT-Fin)  will be established. This entity will work in close coordination with  all Financial Sector Regulators and other stakeholders, he added.

                While presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Lok Sabha here  today, the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley announced a slew of  reliefs in the Government’s continuing policy towards providing an  environment of “Ease of Doing Business”.
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley raised the threshold limit for  audit of business entities that opt for presumptive income scheme from  Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2 crore. Similarly, the threshold for the maintenance  of books for individuals and HUF is proposed to be increased from  turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs or income from Rs. 1.2 lakhs to  Rs. 2.5 lakhs.
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley further said that the Foreign  Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II will be exempt from  indirect transfer provision under the IT Act. Besides, indirect transfer  provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests  outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of  investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India. This will  remove apprehensions over taxation upon transfer of stake of investors  of India-based funds located abroad but investing in India-based  companies, he added.
Bringing relief to individual insurance agents, Shri Jaitley said  they will be exempted from the TDS provision of 5% being deducted from  commission payable after filing a self-declaration that their income is  below taxable limit. Professionals with receipt upto Rs. 50 lakhs p.a.  can pay advance tax towards presumptive taxation in one installment  instead of four.
In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously,  the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the time period for revising  a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial  year, at par with the time period for filing of return. Also the time  for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from  21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and further to 12  months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter, he added.
The Finance Minister proposed to restrict the scope of domestic  transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party  transaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction. Shri Jaitley said  this will reduce the compliance burden for domestic companies since the  number of entities being covered under domestic pricing had gone up  substantially resulting in longer scrutiny.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate  Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley while presenting the General Budget 2017-18  in Parliament today said that the GST  Council has finalised its recommendations on almost all the issues based  on consensus after spirited debate and discussions. The Finance  Minister said that the Government on its part has promptly given effect  to various provisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including  constitution of the GST Council. The GST Council held 9 meetings to  discuss various issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the  GST rate structure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition  scheme, details for compensation to States due to implementation of GST,  examination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation  Law and administrative mechanism for GST.  He said the preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule. 
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley in his Budget Speech further said that the extensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st  April, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system. He said that  since the enactment of the Constitution (One Hundred and First  Amendment) Act, 2016, there has been substantial progress on preparatory  work towards ushering in GST which is by far the biggest tax reform  since Independence. Several teams of officers both from the States and  Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)have been working to give  finishing touch to the Model GST law, rules and other details, he added.  
Shri  Jaitley said that the Government, through the Central Board of Excise  & Customs (CBEC) shall continue to strive to achieve the goal of  implementation of GST as per schedule without compromising the spirit of  co-operative federalism. He added that the implementation of GST is  likely to bring more taxes both to Central and State Governments because  of widening of tax net. The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley stated that  not many changes have been proposed in current regime of Excise &  Service Tax in the Budget proposals since they are to be replaced by GST  soon.

                Making the Scheme for profit-linked income tax exemption for  promoters of affordable housing scheme announced last year more  attractive, the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley proposed a  number of changes while presenting the General Budget 2016-17 in Lok  Sabha today. Shri Jaitley said that instead of counting the built-up  area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., it will be the carpet area of 30 and 60  sq.mtr. of the houses that will be counted under the scheme. He also  said that the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only in case of municipal  limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country  including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will  apply. The Finance Minister also proposed to extend the completion  period of the building of the houses after commencement under the Scheme  from the present 3 years to 5 years.
At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting  completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income.  For builders for whom the constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, Shri  Jaitley proposed to apply this rule only after the end of the year in  which completion certificate is received so as to give the builders some  breathing time for liquidating their inventory.
In his Budget Speech, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley also  proposed to reduce the holding period for considering gain from  immovable property to be long term from the present 3 years to 2 years  and the base year for indexation to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001  for all classes of assets including immovable property. The Minister  said that this move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax  liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. Shri Jaitley added  that his Government also plan to extend the basket of financial  instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment  of tax. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of  property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year  the project is completed.
For the new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh which is being  constructed by innovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land  Acquisition Act, the Union Finance Minister proposed to exempt from  capital gains tax all persons who were holding land on 2.6.2014 - the  date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was re-organised - and whose  land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government  Scheme.

                The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley reduced the rate of taxation from existing 10 per cent to 5 per cent for individual assesses between income of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs. This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below Rs 5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50 per cent of their existing liability.
 
While presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in the Parliament today, the Union Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly. Therefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this class of people to reduce their burden of taxation. The Finance Minister further said that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more people will prefer to come within the tax net. The Finance Minister made an appeal to all the citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5 per cent tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of Rs 2.5 lakhs  to Rs 5 lakhs.
 
The Union Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people who are evading taxes. So, in order to expand tax net, it is decided to have a simple one-page form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto Rs 5 lakhs other than business income. Also, a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction. 
 
In his Budget Speech, the Finance Minister further said that in order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate available to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to Rs 2500, available only to assessees upto income of Rs 3.5 lakhs. The combined effect of both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for people getting income upto Rs 3 lakhs per annum. and the tax liability will only be Rs 2,500 for people with income between Rs 3 and Rs 3.5 lakhs. While the taxation liability of people with income upto Rs 5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of Rs 12,500 per person. The total amount of tax foregone on account of this measure is Rs 15,500 crore.
 
In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, a surcharge of 10 per cent of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between Rs 50 lakhs and Rs 1 crore has been proposed. This is likely to give additional revenue of Rs 2,700 crore.
 
The Finance Minister said that the direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would result in revenue loss of Rs 22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain of Rs 2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net revenue loss in direct tax would come to Rs 20,000 crore.

                In a major relief to small taxpayer and to bring more people in the  tax net, the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitly announced a  reduction in tax rates from 10 per cent to 5 per cent for individual  income between Rs. 2.5 to 5 lakhs.  The total amount of tax foregone on  account of this measure is expected to be Rs 15,500 crores. So the  Finance Minister also announced several revenue mobilization measures in  the Budget 2017-18.
While presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Parliament today  , the Union Finance Minister proposed the following measures:
I.	Extend the provisions of Section 115BBDA of the Income-tax Act which  provides for levy of tax at the rate of 10 per cent on dividend income  exceeding Rs 10 lakh, to all resident persons except domestic companies  or trust or institution or fund registered under section 12AA or  referred to in section 10(23C). Presently, these provisions are  applicable only to the individuals, Hindu undivided family (HUF) and  firms.
II.	Widen the scope of Section 56 of the Income-tax Act to provide that  any money, immovable property or specified movable property received  without consideration or with inadequate consideration, by any person,  subject to certain exemption and exceptions, shall be taxable if its  value exceeds Rs 50000.
III.	In case of transfer of unquoted equity shares, where the fair  market value, determined in the prescribed manner is less than the  consideration received, such fair market value shall be the deemed value  of consideration for the purpose of computation of capital gains.
IV.	Some restrictions have been put on the exemption from long term  capital gains in case of transfer of listed shares acquired after 1st  October, 2004.
V.	Introduction of a new provision  in the Income-tax Act to provide for  tax deduction at source at the rate of 5 per cent by an individual or  HUF, other than those whose books of account are required to be audited,  while making payment of rent of an amount exceeding Rs 50,000 per  month.
VI.	In order to align the transfer pricing provisions with the OECD  transfer pricing guidelines and international best practices a new  section will be inserted to provide that the assesse shall make  secondary adjustment where the primary adjustment to the transfer price  has been made in certain cases. The provision shall apply if the primary  adjustment exceeds one crore rupees and the excess money attributable  to the adjustment is not brought to India within the prescribed time.
VII.	In order to address the issue of thin capitalisation, a proposal  has been made that the interest paid by an Indian company or permanent  establishment of a foreign company, shall not be allowed as deduction in  computing its taxable profit subject to certain conditions.
VIII.	 Provisions have also been made to address the existing anomaly of  interest deduction in respect of let-out property vis-à-vis  self-occupied property.
IX.	The donation by an entity registered under Section 12A or approved  under section 10(23C), to other entity, registered under Section 12A,  with the direction that such donation shall form part of the corpus,  shall not be treated as application of income for charitable purposes.

                Government says, with a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to  grow at 4.1% in the current year i.e.2016-17 as the total area sown  under kharif and rabi seasons are higher than the previous year.   Presenting his Fourth Budget in Parliament today, the Union Finance  Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that adequate credit would be made  available to the farmers in time and the target for agricultural credit  in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record level of 10 lakh crores. He said  that special efforts would be taken to ensure adequate flow of credit to  the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir.  The farmers will also benefit from 60 days’ interest waiver announced by the Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the  cooperative credit structure.
The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that about 40% of the small  and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure and the  Government is committed to support NABARD for computerisation and  integration of all 63,000 functional Primary Agriculture Credit  Societies (PACS) with the Core Banking System of District Central  Cooperative Banks. This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of  Rs 1,900 crores, with financial participation from the State Governments  to ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers.
Elaborating on other pro-farmer measures, the Finance Minister said  that a Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set-up in NABARD and  the Prime Minister has announced an addition of Rs 20,000 crores to its  corpus which will take the fund to Rs 40,000 crores.
The coverage of  Fasal Bima Yojana will be increased from 30% of  cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19. The  Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that the Budget provision of `Rs.  5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was increased to Rs. 13,240  crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims. For 2017-18, a sum of   Rs 9,000 crores will be provided and the  sum insured under this Yojana  has more than doubled from Rs 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to Rs 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016.
Referring to his last year’s Budget Speech, where the Finance  Minister had focused on ‘income security’ of farmers to double their  income in 5 years, Shri Jaitley said, that the Government will take more  steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and  productivity and to deal with post-harvest challenges. The coverage of  National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current  250 markets to 585 APMCs. Moreover, assistance up to a ceiling of Rs 75  lakhs will be provided to every e-NAM market for establishment of  cleaning, grading and packaging facilities.
Admitting that Dairy is an important source of additional income  for the farmers, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley announced that a  Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund would be set-up in  NABARD with a corpus of Rs 8,000 crores over 3 years. He said that  issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum, even as the  Government has decided to set-up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras  (KVKs) and ensure 100% coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun  Jaitely while presenting the General Budget 2017-18 in Parliament today  said that the political party can receive maximum donation up to Rs.  2,000 in cash from one person. Proposing steps towards transparent  funding of political parties, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley proposed  that banks will issue Electoral Bonds to enable donations to political  parties.
In his Budget Speech, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley further said  that the political parties will be entitled to receive donations by  cheque or digital mode from their donors. Every political party will  have to file its Income-Tax Return within the prescribed time limit, he  added.
In a significant step to cleanse the system of funding of political  parties, Shri Jaitley said that donations to political parties can soon  be made by purchasing electoral bonds from authorized banks. The Finance  Minister said that the Government will soon frame a Scheme in this  regard and an amendment is being proposed to the Reserve Bank of India  Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds. He said that a donor  could purchase bonds from authorised banks against cheque and digital  payments only. These bonds shall be redeemable in the designated account  of a registered political party within the prescribed time limit from  issuance of bond, he added.
The Finance Minister said that these steps have been proposed as the  political funding for elections couldn’t become transparent though  attempts were made to cleanse the system. Despite amendment to the  Representation of Peoples’ Act, the Companies Act and the Income Tax Act  to incentivise political donations by individuals, partnership firms,  HUFs and companies, political parties continue to receive most of their  funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash. He said that  the situation has only marginally improved since the provisions were  introduced, such as granting exemption from payment of tax to both the  donor and the donee, provided a list of donors is maintained, who had  contributed more than Rs. 20,000.

                The  Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley  while presenting the General Budget 2017-18, in Parliament today, said  that this Budget is the First combined Budget of Independent India that  includes the Railways. He said that India is now in a position to  synergize the investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil  aviation. For 2017-18, the total capital and development expenditure on  Railways has been pegged at Rs. 1,31,000 crores. This includes Rs.  55,000 crores provided by the Government, the Finance Minister added.
 
The  Finance Minister Shri Jaitley in his Budget Speech said that, the  Railways will focus on four major areas, namely, passenger safety,  capital and development works, cleanliness and finance and accounting  reforms. For passenger safety, a ‘Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh’ will  be created with a corpus of Rs.1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years,  to be funded by seed capital from the Government, Railways’ own revenues  and other sources. Further, Shri Jaitley informed that the Government  will lay down clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various  safety works to be funded from this ‘Kosh’.  Unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge lines will be eliminated by  2020. Expert international assistance will be harnessed to improve  safety preparedness and maintenance practices.
 
Talking about the proposed steps for modernization and upgradation of identified corridors  in his Budget Speech, Shri Jaitley said that Railway lines of 3,500 kms  will be commissioned in 2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17 and  steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for tourism and  pilgrimage. In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be  enhanced by 10%. Further, the Minister added that Railways have set-up  joint ventures with 9 State Governments and 70 projects have been  identified for construction and development. 
 
Regarding station redevelopment,  the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley informed that at least 25 stations  are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for redevelopment and 500  stations will be made differently abled friendly by providing lifts and  escalators. It is also proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar  power in the medium term, of which, a beginning has already been made in  300 stations. Works will be taken-up for 2,000 railway stations as part  of 1000 MW solar mission, the Minister added.
 
Emphasizing the Government’s focus on ‘Swachh Rail’,  the Finance Minister informed that a series of steps are proposed to be  taken to enhance cleanliness in Railways, of which, an SMS based ‘Clean My Coach Service’ has already been started. It is now proposed to introduce the ‘Coach Mitra’ facility,  a single window interface to register all coach related complaints and  requirements. Further, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley said that by  2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio toilets.  Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and  conversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set-up at New  Delhi and Jaipur Railway Stations and five more such Solid waste  management plants are now being taken-up.
 
The  Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech, also gave details about  proposed steps to be taken by the Government to help Railways stay  competitive vis-a-vis other modes of transportation dominated by the  private sector and retain their position of pre-eminence. These include:
(i)     End to end integrated transport solutions for select commodities  to be implemented through partnership with logistics players, who would  provide both front and back end connectivity. Rolling stocks and  practices will be customized to transport perishable goods, especially  agricultural products.
(ii)   Competitive ticket booking facility to the public at large.  Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC has been withdrawn.  Cashless reservations have gone up from 58% to 68%.
(iii) As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial statements will be rolled-out by March 2019.
 
During  his Budget Speech, the Finance Minister Shri Jaitley re-emphasized on  the Government’s continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio  of the Railways. He informed that the tariffs of Railways would be  fixed, taking into consideration costs, quality of service, social  obligations and competition from other forms of transport.
 
Regarding Metro Rail, the Finance Minister informed that a new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on  innovative models of implementation and financing, as well as  standardization and indigenization of hardware and software. This will  open-up new job opportunities for our youth.  A  new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalizing the existing laws.  This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in  construction and operation, he added.

Speaking at the session Smt.Harsimrat Kaur Badal said “Recently, the Government of India has allowed 100% FDI in marketing of food products produced and manufactured in India. This initiative has opened up vast opportunities for international companies to invest in India in the food processing manufacturing, supply and marketing. Additionally, attractive incentives have been established by state andcentralgovernments to include capital subsidies, tax rebates, and reduced custom and excise duties. Increasing focus is also being given to supply-chain related infrastructure, such as cold storage, abattoirs and food parks. The whole idea is to spur greater growth in the food processing sector and transform Indian food economy as well as connect farmers with the value chain to increase their returns”.
During the interaction, the Minister also invited the countries to partner with World Food India 2017 - a three day flagship event being organized by Ministry of Food Processing Industriesfrom 3-5 Nov 2017 at New Delhi. The eventwill focus on showcasing achievements and opportunities of the Indian Food Processing Sector and fostering maximum investment commitments. The event will also provide a platform for exhibiting innovative products and manufacturing processes, showcasing the entire value chain of food processing industry with a vision to leverage innovation, technology, development & sustainability of the sector.
Speaking at the occasion, Shri Avinash K Srivastava, Secretary, Ministry of Food processing Industriessaid “With increasing disposable income and changing consumer preferences in India, processing, retail and e-commerce are the sectors where the opportunity lies. Over the past two years, the Government of India has taken a number of policy decisions to spur vibrant growth in the food processing segment. With a progressive policy outlook, we will offer full support towards new collaborations and greater investment.Given that the right framework is in place, acloser interaction is required between Indian and Global food & beverage sector and this platform will be provided by World Food India 2017.”
Shri J P Meena, Special Secretary, Ministry of Food processing Industries said,“India already has all the requirements for a head-start in the food-processing industry. Basic materials such as food grains, pulses, vegetables, meat and fish can be sourced locally. What is required is an integration and collaboration across players in the value chain, to garner mutual benefits. We are hopeful that investments resulting from opening up of the FDI policy will further help build up the required infrastructure in the food processing sector thus reducing wastages and integrating farmers to the markets”.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India had entrusted the work relating to carrying out a Survey of the extent of Problems of ‘Spurious and Not of Standard Quality Drugs’ to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Noida. The NIB has since submitted the report to the Government.
The statistical design of the Drug Survey included as many as 224 Drug molecules belonging to 15 different therapeutic categories of the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) 2011. As part of this survey, 47,954 drug samples relating to 23 dosage forms were drawn from 654 districts of 36 States and Union Territories from the supply chains including retail outlets, Government sources and from eight airports and sea ports. 
A nationwide training in drugs survey methodology was imparted at 28 centres across the country to over 1800 Sample Drawing Officers (SDOs) and representatives of the Civil Society / Pharmacy Council of India (PCI). The role of the Civil Society / Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) representatives was to observe that the drugs samples are drawn in accordance with the sampling methodology and the highest degree of transparency and objectivity is maintained in the process to eliminate any bias. 
All the samples were subjected to test / analysis as per pharmacopoeial requirements in the Central and State Drug Testing Laboratories that have been accredited by NABL. Overall, out of the 47,012 samples tested, 13 samples were found to be Spurious and 1,850 samples were found to be ‘Not of Standard Quality’ (NSQ). As such, the percentage of NSQ Drugs in India has been found to be 3.16% and that of Spurious drugs 0.0245%. 
This is the largest ever scientifically designed and professionally executed drug survey undertaken in the world for determining the quality of drugs. The entire survey report has been uploaded in the Reports section of website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare viz. www.mohfw.gov.in and also on the website of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) viz. www.cdsco.nic.in.

                Shri C K Mishra, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare launched the  SAATHIYA Resource Kit including ‘Saathiya Salah’ Mobile App for  adolescents, here today, as part of the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya  Karyakram (RKSK) program. One of the key interventions under the  programme is introduction of the Peer Educators (Saathiyas) who act as a  catalyst for generating demand for the adolescent health services and  imparting age appropriate knowledge on key adolescent health issues to  their peer groups. In order to equip the Saathiyas in doing so, the  Health Ministry has launched the Saathiya Resource Kit (including  ‘Saathiya Salah’ Mobile App).   

Introducing the Resource Kit and the Mobile App, Shri C K Mishra said  that ‘our country is home to 253 million adolescents which is largest in  the world in terms of absolute numbers and when RMNCH programs were  launched globally, India was the first country to add the ‘+A’ i.e.  adolescent component to the RMNCH, making it today’s RMNCH+A program’.  He emphasized that ‘adolescents are the critical mass of asset which in  future would be the biggest dividends to the country’s economy; thereby  their health and wellness are of utmost priority’. To address and cater  to the health and development needs of the country’s adolescents,  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya  Karyakram (RKSK) in January 2014. RKSK identifies six strategic  priorities for adolescents i.e. nutrition, sexual and reproductive  health (SRH), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), substance misuse,  injuries and violence (including gender-based violence) and mental  health. 

The most important component and driving force of RKSK program are its  Peer Educators and this resource kit has been launched to enable them to  communicate with the adolescents of their community, Shri Mishra  stated. He specified that the ‘kit is being launched to enable the 1.6  lakhs Peer Educators towards taking their job forward and answering all  the queries in the minds of an adolescent in-spite of the plethora of  media (Magazines, TV, internet etc.) available’. The Peer Educators will  be trained across the country in a phased manner, ensuring optimum use  of the resource kit, which is a ready source of a range of communication  material specially designed to help the Peer Educator to be recognized  and respected as ‘saathiya’, a good friend for the adolescents. 

This Resource Kit comprises i) Activity Book, ii) Bhranti-Kranti Game  iii) Question-Answer Book and iv) Peer Educator Diary. In addition to  the kit is the mobile app ‘Saathiya Salah’ (downloadable from Google  play-store) which acts as a ready information source for the adolescents  in case they are unable to interact with the Peer Educators. The mobile  app is also linked to another important piece of cost-effective  information platform of a toll-free Saathiya Helpline (1800-233-1250)  which will act as an e-counselor. While the short films will be played  by the Peer Educators at their group meetings, the activity book and  games will bring about discussion and resolve adolescent queries.  Encashing on mobile technology, the shy adolescents or those unable to  interact with the peer educators due to family reasons, can access the  information through the free mobile app as well the toll free helpline. 

Among senior officials of the Ministry at the launch, also present were  the representatives of Development Partners (UNFPA, PFI) who contributed  to development of the Resource Kit. Mr. Diega Polacios, Country  Director,UNFPA stated that ‘the Resource Kit has being designed to  present the Peer Educators with key information on adolescent health,  which would then enable them to communicate the same and help the  adolescents at the grass root/village level’.  Further at the launch,  demo of the Mobile App was conducted wherein a mock call was made to the  Saathiya Helpline by Secretary (HFW). The launch was attended by the  and

It is our  endeavour to protect each and every child in the country from vaccine  preventable diseases and reduce child mortality: Shri J P Nadda  


“It  is our endeavour to protect each and every child in the country from  vaccine preventable diseases. This is a new milestone towards expanding  the coverage of full immunization in the country aimed at reducing child  mortality”. Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family  Welfare stated this as he announced the expansion of the Rotavirus  vaccine under its Universal Immunization Programme in five additional  states in function atAgartala, today. The Health Minister further added  that the Government is committed to reducing morbidity and mortality in  children. Strengthening routine immunization is an essential investment  in India’s children and will ensure a healthy future of the country, he  noted.
Shri  BadalChoudhary, Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Revenue &  Public Works, Government of Tripura, Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional  Secretary (Health), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government  of India and Dr. Rakesh Sarwal, Principal Secretary (Health & Family  Welfare), Government of Tripura were also present on the occasion.
Recognizing  immunization as a crucial intervention in reducing the country’s child  mortality, Shri J P Nadda stated that “Diarrhoea is one of the biggest  killers in children and Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of  severe diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. Rotavirus vaccine  along with proper sanitation, hand washing practices, ORS and zinc  supplementation will go a long way in reducing the mortality and  morbidity due to diarrhoea in children.” He further added that the “The  government is also committed to increasing the full immunization  coverage and ensuring that the benefit of the life-saving vaccines is  provided to every child. The fourth phase of Mission Indradhanush has  already begun in North-eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,  Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura from 7th  February 2017 and will be rolled out in rest of the country in April  2017” and urged the states to “successfully roll out of the mission  which has already created a significant impact across the country.” 
“This  life-saving vaccine will not only improve the health of our children  but will also reduce hospitalization and other conditions associated  with diarrhoea due to Rotavirus such as malnutrition, delayed physical  and mental development among children.Reduced hospitalization reduces  the economic burden on the family and the health cost burden on the  country”, Shri Nadda said. He further stated that the Rotavirus vaccine  has been developed indigenously, under a public-private partnership by  the Ministry of Science and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This  therefore is a landmark achievement under ‘Make in India’ initiative, he  stated.
Appreciating  the plan of expansion of Rotavirus vaccine in Tripura, Shri  BadalChoudhary, Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Revenue &  Public Works, Government of Tripura, stated that rotavirus vaccine will  reduce morbidity and mortality among children from rotavirus diarrhoea  and will benefit more than 53000 children in Tripura. He also informed  that JE vaccine has also been added in the RI program in Tripura. Shri  Choudhary further highlighted some state related health issues regarding  Tripura and requested for support from the central government.
The  vaccine will prevent Rotavirus diarrhoea in children which accounts for  approximately 40 per cent of hospitalizations from diarrhoea in India.  Rotavirus diarrhoea is responsible for nearly 78,000 deaths, 32 lakh  out-patient visits and nearly 9 lakh hospitalizations every year.  Rotavirus diarrhoea can also lead to dehydration, malnutrition and  delayed physical and mental development in children.
In  March 2016, the Rotavirus vaccine was first introduced in four states  namely Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Till date,  about 38 lakh children have been vaccinated with Rotavirus vaccine in  these four states. Now, the vaccine will be expanded to five more states  of Assam, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Currently,  India has the one of the number of deaths due to diarrhoea in children  under the age of 5 years. Globally, diarrhoea is responsible for  5,76,000 child deaths every year. 
India’s  UIP provide free vaccines against 11 life threatening diseases, to 26  million children annually, the largest birth cohort in the world. The  Universal Immunization Programme provides life-saving vaccines to all  children across the country free of cost to protect them against  Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Hepatitis B,  Pneumonia and Meningitis due to Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib),  Measles, Rubella, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Rotavirus diarrhoea.

Accelerating efforts to eliminate measles and control rubella, the  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, today convened a meeting of an  Expert Advisory Group to recommend strategies to end the scourge of  these killer and debilitating diseases by 2020. 

“The Government of India will take every possible measure to ensure that  children and families do not suffer from the devastating effects of  measles and rubella. We have made India Polio free and are committed to  eliminating measles and controlling rubella, while also protecting  children against all other vaccine preventable diseases, Mr C K Mishra,  Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, said. 

The expert advisory group on measles and rubella, congratulated India  for its efforts so far and, especially for launching the Measles and  Rubella campaign earlier this month. It recommended timely roll out of  the remaining phases of the MR campaign, besides further stepping up  surveillance and strengthening the reach of the measles-rubella  vaccination campaign, to maximize the gains made so far, and make  progress in the fight against measles and rubella. 

“India’s measles and rubella vaccination campaign is a truly remarkable,  world-beating effort, with 41 crore children expected to be covered  across the country in the next two years. Apart from improving the  life-chances of crores of children in India, the campaign will have a  substantial effect on global measles mortality and rubella control  targets.,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director for WHO in  South-East Asia said. 

India has made important gains in recent years. Measles deaths have  declined by 51% from an estimated 100,000 in the year 2000 to 49 000 in  2015. This has been possible by significantly increasing the reach of  the first dose of measles vaccine, given at the age of nine months under  routine immunization programme, from 56% in 2000 to 87% in 2015. In  2010 India introduced the second dose of measles-containing vaccine in  routine immunization programme to close the immunity gap and accelerate  measles elimination. Nearly 11.8 crore children aged nine months to 10  years were vaccinated during mass measles vaccination campaigns between  2010 and 2013 in select states of the country. During the recent annual  Union Budget presentation, the government reiterated its commitment to  measles elimination. 

Dr T Jacob John, Co-Chair of the expert advisory group on measles and  rubella to the Government of India, said, “measles elimination and  rubella control is possible. The MR vaccine is safe and effective. We  have tried and tested strategies that are proven to be effective in  eliminating measles and controlling rubella. Rigorous implementation of  these strategies is needed for India to achieve the 2020 target.” 

Measles is one of the major causes of death in children and the public  health importance of rubella is due to congenital rubella syndrome  (CRS), which occurs when rubella infection occurs in the first trimester  of pregnancy. CRS is characterized by severe irreversible birth defects  affecting the eyes (glaucoma, cataract), ears (hearing loss), brain  (microcephaly, mental retardation) and heart. 

In 2015, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization  recommended introduction of rubella vaccine as combined measles-rubella  vaccine, as a nation-wide campaign, covering children in the age group  of 9 months to less than 15 years age group. After the campaign, MR  vaccine is scheduled to be introduced in routine immunization, replacing  the currently given two doses of measles vaccine. 

The ongoing MR campaign in five states – Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa,  Puducherry & Lakshadweep, to vaccinate 3.48 crore children, has till  date, reached 1.16 crore children.

WHO has completed the assessment of the status of the Indian vaccine  regulatory system against WHO NRA Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for  benchmarking and measured the maturity of the system. The assessment has  been carried out by a WHO team comprising lead experts in different  areas from WHO Headquarters Geneva, WHO India Country Office, experts  drawn from the regulators of USA, Italy, Germany, Netherlands,  Indonesia, Thailand and Egypt. The assessment has been done in respect  of nine different functionalities and Indian NRA has been declared  ‘functional’ with a maturity level of 4 i.e. the highest level as per  currently evolved definitions in respect of 5 functions, and maturity  level 3 in respect of 4 functions. While, maturity level 4 indicates  good results and sustained improvement trends, maturity level 3 reflects  systematic process based approach, early stage of systematic  improvements, data availability regarding conformance to objectives and  existence of improvement trends. 

India is one of the main players in the pharmaceutical industry  worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry covers conventional as well as  biological medicinal products including vaccines, medical devices, and  traditional medicines. India, as a large vaccine producing country, is  currently supplying several vaccines to the UN agencies (UNICEF, WHO and  PAHO). 

A fully functional NRA is a pre-requisite for WHO prequalification of  vaccines. One of the requirements to become eligible and retain  prequalification status is to have the National Regulatory Authority  (NRA) assessed as functional against the WHO published NRA indicators.  WHO Prequalification Programme, as such, facilitates access to vaccines  that meet the unified standards of quality, safety and efficacy as well  as programme needs. The vaccine manufacturers can only apply for WHO  vaccine prequalification if the NRA meets the standards of the WHO NRA  published indicators i.e. WHO Global benchmarking Tool on functional  regulatory system for vaccines. 

World Health Organisation (WHO) has, based on a robust benchmarking tool  developed over years in consultation with various experts drawn from  across the globe, carried out assessment of the National Regulatory  Authority (NRA) of India comprising the Central Drugs Standard Control  Organisation (CDSCO), State Drug Regulatory Authorities,  Pharmaco-vigilance Programme of India (PvPI) and Adverse Events  Following Immunization (AEFI) structures at the Central and States  levels. The nine functions included in the tool are National Regulatory  System; Registration and Marketing Authorization; Vigilance; Laboratory  Access and Testing; Regulatory Inspection; Clinical Trial Oversight; NRA  Lot Release; Licensing Premises; and Market Surveillance and Control.  The Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) so developed has 63 indicators and  288 sub-indicators, out of which 150 are critical with the following  maturity level definitions: 

The result reflects the growing maturity of the Indian NRA emanating  from a concerted effort by the Government in consultation WHO to build  capacity and capability of the National Regulatory Authority over last  several years.

“We  want to change the image of the public health facilities. The thrust of  Kayakalp is to inculcate culture of cleanliness for gaining the trust  and confidence of community in these facilities.” This was stated by  Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfareduring the  national felicitation ceremony of Kayakalp awardees (2016-17) for their  work in maintaining high standards of sanitation and hygiene in public  health facilities, here today. 
ShriNadda  congratulated the awardees and said that many good practices have been  initiated like emphasis on good cleaning practices, pest control,  measuring infection control etc. and healthy competition amongst  healthcare facilities is motivating them to go an extra mile in pursuit  of excellence.  He further added  that the zest and zeal shown by the hospitals and their collective  efforts in improving cleanliness, hygiene and infection control  practices should continue unabated. 
Referring  to the ICT based application ‘MeraAspataal (My Hospital)’ that captures  patients’ feedback about their experience in the health facilities on  the services that they received or sought to receive, ShriNadda said  that the Ministry is seeking the feedback of people digitally to improve  the quality of services at the health centres. “Patient satisfaction is  the ultimate test for assessing quality of services provided by a  healthcare facility and we are now making a paradigm shift by seeking  their views on quality of experience in a public healthcare facility.  This will help us improving the experience of people at a health  facility,” ShriNadda elaborated. 
The  Health Minister also informed that to complement and leverage the  efforts and achievements made so far, MOHFW have launched a joint  initiative with the Ministry of Drinking Water and  Sanitation- SwachhSwasthSarvatra. Under this initiative Community Health  Centres (CHCs) in Open Defecation Free (ODF) blocks will be supported  to achieve Kayakalp certification and Gram Panchayat of Kayakalp Primary  Health Centres (PHCs) will be prioritized to become ODF. “Improved  sanitation practices of the community are expected to complement the  high level of sanitation and hygiene in the health care facility, and  consequently reduce the disease burden related to water borne diseases,”  ShriNadda said.  
The  Kayakalp scheme launched in 2015 covered 10 Central Government  Institutions and District Hospitals in the year of launch. This year the  scheme expanded coverage to 16 Central Government institutions  including 6 new AIIMSs and all Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and  Community Health Centres (CHCs). Thus, in the current year the Kayakalp  assessment in States covered over 700 District hospitals, over 5,000  CHCs and over 25,000 PHCs. The system adopted for central Government  institutions follows a two tier assessment process of internal and  external assessment followed by decision by a Jury constituted in the  Ministry. Eight (8) external assessment teams were constituted for  assessment of the 16 Central Government institutions. In the states,  Kayakalp awards are declared based on score arrived at through a three  tier assessment system of internal, peer and external assessment.  
At  the function, Shri J P Nadda released the Kayakalp Coffee Table book  and also gave away the awards to the winners under various categories.  Under the Central Government Hospitals category, the first prize of Rs 5  Crore was given to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences  (AIIMS), Delhi.North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health  and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS), Shillong got the second prize of Rs 3  Crores and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research  (PGIMER), Chandigarh receivedthe third prize of Rs 1 Crore. Commendation  awards of Rs 50 lakh each were given to AIIMS, Raipur, AIIMS, Jodhpur  and National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD),  Delhi. Shri J P Nadda also felicitated the District Hospitals, PHCs and  CHCs for winning the awards in their respective states and union  territory.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which is addressing the nutritional gap in the population through fortification of various foods, has now constituted a Scientific Panel on “Food Fortification and Nutrition” totake the program further.
 
The Panel will identify critical nutritional gaps in the Indian diet in general as well as in specific target groups based on diet surveys and credible scientific evidence, define strategies to address nutritional needs of the general population and vulnerable groups, and review the standards for all suitable food fortifying vehicles,in addition to the healthy dietary intake of Fat, Sugar & Salt. It will also address regulatory and related technological issues, review proposals from industry using modern risk assessment methods, and prescribe standard sampling and test methods for effective monitoring, surveillance and enforcement of the relevant regulations.
 
The Scientific Panel has elevendistinguished experts and scientistsand includes Dr AmbrishMithal from Medanta, Dr C. S.Pandavand Major General (Dr) R. K.Marwaha (Retd) from AIIMS, Dr AnuraKurpad from St. John’s Medical College, Dr Yogeshwar Shukla from CSIR- Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Prof. H. P. S.Sachdev from Sita Ram Bharatia Institute of Science and Research, Dr K. M. Nair from National Institute of Nutrition, Dr P. Ramachandran from Nutrition Foundation of India, Dr Sumit Arora from National Dairy Research Institute, Dr Sirimavo Nair from the MS University, Baroda, and Prof.Harsulkar from BharatiVidyapeeth.Apart from these, members from Scientific Panels dealing with fortification of food such as wheat flour, refined flour, rice, milk, edible oil and salt will also be a part of this Panel. In addition, Ministries of Women & Child Development as well as Health & Family Welfare; Department of Biotechnology; and the Indian Council of Medical Research will also be working with the Panel.
 
Micronutrient Malnutrition Disorders are ubiquitously prevalent in all age groups of the population. According to National Family Health Survey (2006-07) and the World Bank (2006), about 70% preschool children suffer from iron deficiency anaemia and 57% preschool children have sub-clinical Vitamin A deficiency respectively. Further, as per the World Bank (2006), Iodine deficiency is endemic in 85 per cent of districts. Moreover, folate deficiency which leads to Neural Tube Defects (NTDS)are the most common congenital malformation in Indian context with an incidence that varies between 0.5-8/1000 births. It is estimated that 50-70% of these birth defects are preventable.
 
FSSAI being the standard setting and regulatory body has taken a step in public health domain to address these and other vitamin deficiency-related Malnutrition Disorders through fortification of food.  
It may be noted that FSSAI had earlierbrought outDraftRegulations for fortified food namely “Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Food) Regulations, 2016 which were operationalized at the National Summit on Food Fortification held in mid-October, 2016. Based on the comments received on the draft Regulations, the Panel will finalize the Regulations. 
 
As a consequence of the National Summit, FSSAI has launched the Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) to promote large-scale fortification of food across India. An online portal of FFRC to nudge and facilitate food businesses and bring fortified foods into Government programs was launched on November 17, 2016 in the presence of Mr. Bill Gates.
 
Meanwhile,four Zonal Consultations for States/UTs covering Northern region at Delhi, Western region at Bhopal, Eastern region at Bhubaneswar, Southern region at Bengaluruhave been convened jointly with Ministry of Women and Child Development, other line Ministries/Departments and development partners such as Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), World Food Programme (WFP), Micronutrient Initiative (MI) along with continued engagement with staple food manufacturers. The fifth Consultation with the North Eastern region is scheduled for February 15, 2017 at Guwahati.
 
FSSAI anticipates that with an effective regulatory mechanism ensuring food safetyand quality along with the continuous support of theGovernment and programme partners, stakeholdersand the consumers,the problem of malnutrition in general and micronutrient malnutrition in particularwould be overcome soon.
 
Food Fortification Logo: FSSAI has also unveiled a Logo for fortified foodswhich may be used by food businesses. This Logocomprises of a square encompassing an F with a ‘+’ sign with a ring around it which signifies the addition of extra nutrition and vitamins to daily meals toprovide good health, protection and an active life. Several food businesses have already started using this logo.

The Universal Immunization Programme of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) provides immunization services free of cost to all children across the country as per its Immunization schedule.
 
There have been reports in a section of media which have highlighted concerns regarding the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and the transitioning of the NTAGI Secretariat to the National Institute of Health & Family Welfare (NIHFW) from Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU).
 
NTAGI is the highest advisory body on immunization in the country which consists of independent experts who provide recommendations on vaccines after reviewing data on disease burden, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccines. 
 
The Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU) was established to support MoHFW for evidence based planning, program operations, monitoring and evaluation, strategic communication, cold chain and vaccine logistics management and support for Adverse Event Following Immunization. One of the functions of ITSU was to host the NTAGI Secretariat to facilitate the secretarial work of NTAGI which includes coordination of its regular meetings. 
 
In the last few years, many steps have been taken to strengthen NTAGI by providing a Secretariat, establishing a code of practice and now institutionalizing it at the NIHFW. The transitioning of the NTAGI Secretariat from ITSU to NIHFW was a planned activity and is part of the health system strengthening efforts by the Government. This will have no adverse impact on its functioning. There is no financial link of NTAGI with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) or any other organization as the body consists of independent experts. 
 
As far as technical support by ITSU is concerned, it is functioning till 28th February 2017 and the project will continue to support the immunization program in techno-managerial capacity beyond this date. The contours of this support are being finalized with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and BMGF.
 
Some media reports have suggested that all health related collaboration with the Gates Foundation with National Health Mission (NHM) has been stopped. This is inaccurate and misleading. BMGF continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

                Health is a State subject and it is the responsibility of the State  Governments to provide adequate health care facilities including MRI to  the people of the State. The State Government is not required to seek  approval of this Ministry for installing MRI scanning facilities in  their Hospitals.
As far as the health care establishments under the Ministry of  Health and Family Welfare are concerned, all such proposals are examined  expeditiously and necessary approval of competent authority is conveyed  to make the facilities functional for the use of patient care.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh  Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                Indian Council of Medical Research has informed that according to  the Global Burden of Disease Report 2015, the number of deaths due to  diabetes increased from 2.24 lakhs (in the year 2005) to 3.46 lakhs (in  the year 2015), thus leading to the shift from 11th position to 7th  position in terms of cause of death due to diabetes.
While Health is a State Subject, the Central Government supplements  the efforts of State/UT Governments to create awareness and provide  health care facilities. Government of India is implementing National  Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular  Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) for interventions up to District level  under the National Health Mission. It has focus on awareness generation  for behaviour and life-style changes, screening and early diagnosis of  persons with high level of risk factors and their treatment and referral  (if required) to higher facilities for appropriate management for Non-  communicable Diseases including Diabetes.  Under NPCDCS, diagnosis and  treatment facilities for Diabetes are provided through different levels  of healthcare by setting up NCD Clinics in District Hospitals and  Community Health Centres (CHCs). Endocrinology is one of the major focus  area for new AIIMS and many other institutions upgraded under Pradhan  Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna. Free or subsidised treatment of Diabetes  is also available at many Central and State Government Health Care  Facilities. The Government of India, under NHM, also supplements the  efforts of the States for free diagnostics and drug initiatives, as per  the Programme Implementation Plan of the States.
Operational Guidelines for implementing population level screening  for diabetes, hypertension & common cancer viz. oral, breast and  cervix have been released to State Governments. These guidelines include  screening for risk factors of these diseases. Such screening will  generate awareness on risk factors of these diseases.
In order to leverage mobile technology, an application called  mDiabetes has been launched to generate awareness, promote adherence to  treatment and inculcate healthy habits among the masses.
Several awareness initiatives have been undertaken by the  Government including observance of World Diabetes Day, organising of  screening for major NCDs including blood pressure and major awareness  events at occasions such as the India International Trade Fair (IITF),  Delhi and use of print, electronic and social media, etc. In addition  NPCDCS supports awareness generation activities to be undertaken by the  States.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh  Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

A Sub-Committee had been constituted by the Drugs Consultative  Committee (DCC) to examine issues relating to online sale of drugs. The  Sub-Committee has submitted its report to the Drugs Consultative  Committee.
The Sub-Committee has inter-alia recommended:-
•    Creation of a National Portal to act as the nodal platform for transacting and monitoring online sale of drugs.
•    Necessity of evolving a mechanism to register e-pharmacies.
•    Geographical restrictions for operation of e-pharmacies.
•    Existing licencees involved in retail sale of drugs could also  register on the National Portal for carrying out online sale of drugs.
•    certain categories of drugs viz. the Narcotic and Psychotropic  drugs, tranquilizers, habit forming drugs and Schedule X drugs that are  prone to being abused or misused be excluded from sale through  e-pharmacies.
All matters relating to sale of drugs including through online will  continue to be regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Drugs  and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 as amended from time to time.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh  Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                There is no state-wise/national data maintained under National Program for Palliative Care (NPPC)  which suggest the number of specialized palliative care units established in India from 2010-2016 as the support under the Program to the States/UTs is primarily for establishing basic palliative care services at district hospitals.
 
The Ministry had constituted an expert group on Palliative care which submitted its report ‘Proposal of Strategies for Palliative Care in India’ in November, 2012. On the basis of the Report, National Program for Palliative Care (NPPC) was implemented under National Health Mission (NHM). NPPC is now part of the ‘Mission Flexipool’ of NHM. A model PIP, a framework of operational and financial guidelines, for the states was also drafted on the basis of which the states/UTs prepare their proposals related to Palliative Care and incorporate them in their respective PIPs to seek financial support under NHM. The details of funds provided to the States/UTs from 2013-14 onwards till date under NPPC programme is given below:

As per Medical Council of India’s Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997 and Postgraduate Medical Education, 2000, no study on palliative care is included in the undergraduate and post-graduate curriculum. However, a course named “MD (Palliative Medicine)” is included in the Schedule of Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

                Samples of food items are picked up for testing and analysis by the State/UT Food Safety Departments from time to time. Separate data about samples of soft drinks having been tested/found not conforming to specified standards, has not been compiled centrally. A study was conducted by the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIP&PH) and the National Test House (NTH), Kolkata, in which  AIIH&PH collected 4 bottles each of the cold drink brands (Sprite, Coca Cola, Mountain dew, Pepsi and 7 UP) and tested for heavy metals antimony, lead, chromium and cadmium and DEHP. The study takes bottled (packaged) water as the reference point. Since a number of other substances are added while making soft drinks, its composition will be different from packaged drinking water. The details of the findings of the study are given below:

Diabetes  is one of the common Non-Communicable Diseases. Indian Council of  Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that according to the International  Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 7th Edition, the prevalence  of diabetes in India is 69.2 million in 2015.
Indian  Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has undertaken a study on diabetes  viz. ICMR India Diabetes (ICMR-INDAB) Study on the prevalence of  diabetes. It is an ongoing study and current results available from 15  States/UTs indicate overall prevalence of Diabetes which varies from 4%  to 13%.
 While  Health is a State Subject, the Central Government supplements the  efforts of State/UT Governments to create awareness and provide health  care facilities. Government of India is implementing National Programme  for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases  and Stroke (NPCDCS) for interventions up to District level under the  National Health Mission. It has focus on awareness generation for  behaviour and life-style changes, screening and early diagnosis of  persons with high level of risk factors and their treatment and referral  (if required) to higher facilities for appropriate management for Non-  communicable Diseases including Diabetes.  Under NPCDCS, diagnosis and  treatment facilities for Diabetes are provided through different levels  of healthcare by setting up NCD Clinics in District Hospitals and  Community Health Centres (CHCs). Endocrinology is one of the major focus  area for new AIIMS and many other institutions upgraded under Pradhan  Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna. Free or subsidised treatment of Diabetes  is also available at many Central and State Government Health Care  Facilities. The Government of India, under NHM, also supplements the  efforts of the States for free diagnostics and drug initiatives, as per  the Programme Implementation Plan of the States. 
 Operational  Guidelines for implementing population level screening for diabetes,  hypertension & common cancer viz. oral, breast and cervix have been  released to State Governments. These guidelines include screening for  risk factors of these diseases. Such screening will generate awareness  on risk factors of these diseases.
In  order to leverage mobile technology, an application called mDiabetes  has been launched to generate awareness, promote adherence to treatment  and inculcate healthy habits among the masses. 
Several  awareness initiatives have been undertaken by the Government including  observance of World Diabetes Day, organising of screening for major NCDs  including blood pressure and major awareness events at occasions such  as the India International Trade Fair (IITF), Delhi and use of print,  electronic and social media, etc. In addition NPCDCS supports awareness  generation activities to be undertaken by the States.

CBSE will be conducting NEET (UG) on 07.05.2017. It was decided by the  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in consultation with MCI that  there shall be an upper age limit of 25 years as on the date of exam  with 5 years relaxation for reserved categories and a maximum of 3  attempts for all candidates.  

In the information bulletin published by CBSE on its website, it was  mentioned that the candidates who have already appeared in AIPMT/NEET on  three occasions are not allowed to take this examination.  

It is now clarified that since any new regulation takes effect  prospectively, NEET-2017 shall be counted as the first attempt for this  purpose irrespective of the previous attempts in AIPMT/NEET, subject to  the upper age limit. CBSE has been advised to make necessary corrections  in the information bulletin and on their website cbseneet.nic.in ¬so  that any application is not rejected on this ground. Data pertaining to  applications already rejected will be erased so that rejected  applications can be filed afresh.

**State was approved 4 Dialyis machines previously. 2 functional in Aizawal and 2 would be functional in DH Lunglei.
 
The Guidelines for Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme envisage provision of dialysis services under NHM in PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode.
 
As per the guidelines, the private partner is to provide medical human resource, dialysis machine along with Reverse Osmosis (RO) water plant infrastructure, dialyzer and consumables, while the space, power, and water supply within District Hospitals is to be provided by the State Government.
Immediately after announcement in Union Budget 2016-17, based on study of relevant models on dialysis services being operated under PPP mode in States and consultation with experts in this field as well as private service providers, the guidelines including model Request for Proposal (RFP) were developed and released on 7th April 2016 itself. Thereafter all States were requested to incorporate proposal in their NHM Programme Implementation Plans. As on date, approval has been provided to all States.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

The  proposed Medical Technology Assessment Board (MTAB) in the Department  of Health Research would recommend technologies (drugs, devices, method  of treatment, etc.) in the area of health after evaluating them on their  efficacy, appropriateness and cost effectiveness. This would serve as  an important tool in prioritizing national health spending and help  achieve universal health coverage by providing affordable   health care. Accordingly, MTAB would facilitate:
 
(i)  the process of decision-making in health care at the Central and State  policy level by providing reliable information based on scientific  evidence;
(ii) develop systems and mechanisms to assess new and existing health technologies by transparent and inclusive processes;
(iii)  appraise health interventions and technologies based on available data  on resource use, cost, clinical effectiveness and safety;
(iv)  collect and analyze evidence in a systematic and reproducible way and  ensure its accessibility and usefulness to inform health policy; and
(v) disseminate research findings and resulting policy decisions to educate and empower the    public to make better informed decisions for health.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare),  Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here  today.

A study has been conducted by University of Maryland and National Council for Applied Economic Research to assess whether the JSY scheme has been successful in addressing disparities in providing maternal healthcare services to the marginalized and poorer communities, by utilizing the data from the India Human Development Survey-1 (IHDS-1, 2004-05) i.e. pre-JSY period and India Human Development Survey-2 (IHDS-2, 2011-12).
 
The findings of the study establish that JSY has led to increased utilization of health services among all groups but especially among the poorer and underserved sections in the rural areas thereby reducing the disparities in maternal care. The results of the study indicate that during the two IHDS rounds, institutional deliveries almost doubled, full ANC increased by 6 percentage points, proportion of deliveries being assisted by trained health personnel increased by 22.3 percentage points  and post natal care check-ups (within 2 weeks) increased by 19 percentage points.
 
 
The results of the study also indicate that the gap in access to healthcare between the marginalized group of women and those who are financially better-off has declined since the advent of the JSY program. As per the study, the JSY scheme led to increase in utilization of maternal health care services by women with little or no education while the change in utilization of services was generally lowest among the highest asset households. 
 
JSY scheme has been implemented in all the States and UTs including Madhya Pradesh. JSY guidelines have been issued to all the States and UTs including Madhya Pradesh and the same are in public domain at the Ministry’s website i.e. www. nhm.gov.in.
 
The budget approved for JSY during the last three years is enclosed given below:

In his Independence Day speech on 15th August, 2003 the then Hon’ble Prime Minister had announced the setting up of six AIIMS type hospitals under Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). The scheme was approved in March 2006.
 
The primary objective of PMSSY is to correct the region imbalances in availability of affordable/reliable tertiary level healthcare in the country in general, and, to augment facilities for quality medical education in under-served or backward States, in particular.
 
In addition to setting up of AIIMS, PMSSY also envisaged up-gradation of several existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions in different states in the country. 
 
Apart from declaration of six AIIMS in 2003, the PMSSY scheme has been enlarged to encompass setting up of many other AIIMS at different states and also upgradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs) in different states. At present, setting up of 19 AIIMS and upgradation of existing 71 GMCIs has been undertaken under PMSSY.Under PMSSY scheme various activities have been undertaken since its inception without any discontinuation of the process.
The State-wise details of works undertaken under PMSSY is given below:

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that in a recent study conducted by Pal et al. in 2015, on 386 participants, it was found that 81.8% mobile phones and 80% hand swabs showed bacterial pathogen growth.
 Directorate  General of Health Services has informed that, there is risk of spread  of infection by handling same mobile phone set by different people  without taking proper precautions of hand hygiene.
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued guidelines, on “Hospital Infection Control” to reduce  infections in hospitals in general. The said guidelines are available on  the website of ICMR.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh  Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha  here today.

There are various estimates for world average for number of beds per 1000 population.  As  per High Level Expert Group for UHC, it is 2.9 beds per 1000 population  while higher estimates in the range of 3.5 are also quoted.  In January 2016 as reported by CBHI, about 7.71 lakhs beds are available in public healthcare facilities.  In addition, there are IPD beds in private healthcare facilities too.  
 
There is unmet need of specialized care and large number of people has no or poor access to specialized care.  Unmet need and poor access can lead to mortality.  As per SRS 2015 death rate in India is 6.5 while it was 6.7 in 2014.
The Government of India has implemented PMSSY with the primary objective of correcting the imbalances in  availability of affordable/reliable tertiary level healthcare in the  country in general and to augment facilities for quality medical  education in the under-served States.  Several new AIIMS are being set up and existing medical institutions are being upgraded under PMSSY.
 
The Govt. of India launched the National  Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the  State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality  healthcare to the citizens.  The  National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has now been subsumed under the  National Health Mission (NHM) as its Sub-Mission, along with National  Urban health Mission (NUHM) as the other Sub-Mission.  Under  the NHM, support is provided to State/UTs to strengthen their health  systems including support for setting up/upgradation of health Centres  on the basis of requirements posed by the States in their Programme  Implementation Plans.  492 MCH Wings with bed capacity of more than 30000 have also been approved under NHM.

                In a recent study ‘Health Information System  in India Challenges and way forward’ the National Institute of Public  Finance and Policy  stated to understand data quality issues and Health Information System at a systemic level, both  at a national and sub-national level with  Andhra  Pradesh as a case study and explored possible solutions for India from  International experience. Quoting various Study/Reports and comparing  data of various sources the above study highlighted the issues of lack  of private sector data, limited disaggregation of data, lack of training  on probing skills, shortage of staff, errors in data entry, data  aggregation, duplication of data, methodological issues, inconsistent  data definitions and data triangulation issues etc. It is observed the  study compared survey data (NFHS) and service statistics (HMIS data)  which are not strictly comparable.
 
Difference may arise due to differences in  definition of data elements, reference point, periodicity, change in the  program, response bias, investigators bias, etc. The steps taken by the Government to strengthen  quality of data in terms of completeness, timeliness and accuracy  include the following: 
 
Ministry of Health and Family  Welfare (MoHFW) had launched a web based monitoring system i.e., Health  Management Information System (HMIS) in 2008 to monitor its health  programmes and provide key inputs for policy formulation and  interventions. Currently, around 200,000 health facilities across all  districts of the country are uploading facility wise data on monthly  basis directly on HMIS web portal.  For  ensuring quality of data on HMIS portal, system for doing  verifications, comparison, validation, scrutiny, feedback exercise and  inspection drills is in place and is also available for all States/UTs.
 
MoHFW has taken a decision to  carry out an integrated survey replacing all health surveys of similar  nature being carried out earlier with varying periodicities, covering  all districts in the country to provide estimates of health indicators  i.e. data on reproductive, child health, nutrition, gender violence,  HIV/AIDS etc., at the District, State, and National level with a  periodicity of three years. Accordingly, the Ministry had launched  National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -4 (2015-16) as an integrated  survey. The field work of the survey has been completed and key results  for 26 States/UTs are published.
 
MoHFW has introduced web based  name based tracking system called Mother & Child Tracking System  (MCTS) across all the States & UTs to facilitate timely delivery of  antenatal and postnatal care services to all the pregnant women and  immunization to all the children. 
 
RCH portal (upgraded version of  MCTS) has been designed for early identification and tracking of the  individual beneficiary throughout the reproductive lifecycle. RCH portal  has also been designed to promote and support the reproductive,  maternal, new-born and child health (RMNCH) schemes / programme delivery  and reporting. This portal will facilitate all the stakeholders with  readily available information at one place.
 
To improve the data quality,  MoHFW has introduced a tablet based application, called ANMOL (which  stands for ANM On Line), for RCH application. ANMOL enables ANMs to  enter and update data for beneficiaries of their jurisdiction. This  ensures more prompt entry and updation of data as well as improves the  data quality since the data is entered “at source” (by providers of  health services themselves). 
 
An online data entry portal (www.cbhi.nic.in) is used   for  reporting of certain Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases from  District and/or State/UT level in co-ordination with Directorate of  Health Services (DHS)/State Bureau of Health Intelligence (SBHI) of  respective State/UTs. The data reported in this portal is crosschecked  and analysed before being published in Annual Publication “National  Health Profile (NHP)”.   Revised  National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is using web based  reporting system called Nikshay and is periodically validated.
The  Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste  stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                There has been an increase  in the antibiotic resistance in the past few years. There are many  publications from various institutions in India showing high level of  resistance to antibiotics.
Government of India has  launched the ‘National Programme on Containment of Antimicrobial  Resistance (AMR)’ under the 12th Five Year Plan under which a  surveillance lab network of ten labs has been established to monitor  trends of AMR in the country. The trends from AMR data gathered in the  year 2015 from these tertiary care centres show high resistance to  commonly used antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.
Through various studies  conducted in various institutions in India, it is a known fact that  over/ mis-use of antimicrobial drugs are responsible for rising  antimicrobial resistance in human, animal and food sectors. Other  factors are inadequate sanitation and infection control practices in  health care settings and also in the community.
The Schedule H1  notification of the Government of India on Aug 30, 2013, as an amendment  to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules of 1945, came into force from Mar 1,  2014 to control the misuse of 24 antibiotics (falling under third and  fourth generation) through over-the-counter (OTC) dispensing of  antibiotics in India. The packaging of these drugs will have mandatory  Schedule H1 warning printed on the label in a box with red border and  the Rx symbol in red. They can be sold by pharmaceutical chemists only  on production of a valid prescription. Government drug inspectors can  conduct surprise checks on these registers.
The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare),  Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here  today.

The  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has notified Medical Devices  Rules, 2017 on 31.01.2017. The new Rules have been framed in conformity  with Global Harmonisation Task Force (GHTF) framework and conform to  best international practices.  Only  15 categories of medical devices are, at present, regulated as drugs  and to that extent, the current regulatory practices in India were not  fully geared to meet the requirements of medical devices sector in the  country.  The new Rules seek to  remove regulatory bottlenecks to make in India, facilitate ease of doing  business while ensuring availability of better medical devices for  patient care and safety. 
Medical  devices will, under the new Rules, be classified as per GHTF practice,  based on associated risks, into Class A (low risk), Class B (low  moderate risk), Class C (moderate high risk) and Class D (high risk).  The manufacturers of medical devices will be required to meet risk  proportionate regulatory requirements that have been specified in the  Rules and are based on best international practices.
With  a view to bring in the highest degree of professionalism in regulation  of medical devices, a system of ‘Third Party Conformity Assessment and  Certification’ through Notified Bodies is envisaged.  The  Notified Bodies will be accredited by the National Accreditation Board  for Certification Bodies (NABCB). The NABCB will, before accrediting  Notified Bodies, assess their competence in terms of required human  resources and other requirements. These Bodies will undertake  verification and assessment of Quality Management System of Medical  Device Manufacturers of Class A and Class B category and may, on as  required basis, be called upon to render assistance for regulation of  Class C and D medical devices also.  
The  Rules also seek to evolve a culture of self-compliance by manufacturers  of medical devices and, accordingly, the manufacturing licences for  Class A medical devices will be granted without prior audit of  manufacturing site. The manufacturer will, in such a case, be required  to do self-certification of compliance with the requirements and based  on such certification, the licence will be issued. However, post  approval audit of manufacturing site will be carried out by the Notified  Bodies to check conformance with Quality Management System. Manufacture  of Class A and Class B medical devices will be licenced by State  Licensing Authorities concerned after Quality Management System audit by  an accredited Notified Body. For all manufacturing sites, Quality  Management System will need to be aligned with ISO 13485. Manufacture of  Class C and Class D medical devices will be regulated by the Central  Licensing Authority and, where required, assistance of experts or  notified bodies will be taken. Import of all medical devices will  continue to be regulated by CDSCO. A network of NABL accredited  laboratories will be set up both, by the Government and by other  entities, for testing medical devices. 
Separate  provisions for regulation of Clinical Investigation (clinical trials)  of investigational medical devices (i.e. new devices) have also been  made at par with international practices and, like clinical trials,  these will be regulated by CDSCO. Conduct of clinical investigations  will, while following the international practices, be conducted in a  manner that ensures realization of the twin objectives of patient safety  and welfare and discovery of new medical devices. Medical management  and compensation will be provided to the subjects of clinical  investigation in accordance with the predefined and objective criteria  laid down by the Government.  
The  new rules have many other unique features. It will be for the first  time that there will be no requirement of periodic renewal of licences.  Accordingly, manufacturing and import licences will remain valid till  these are suspended or cancelled or surrendered.  Further,  the entire process starting from submission of application to grant of  permission/licence will be processed through online electronic platform.  Timelines have been defined for most activities at the regulators end.  The issuance of licences for Class A medical devices on the basis of  self-certification coupled with a system of checks and balances for  ensuring compliance is a departure from the inspection based regulatory  regime. Risk based audit of manufacturing units will be carried out to  assess conformance with standards and quality parameters. These Rules  envisage creation of a robust eco-system for all stakeholders including  innovators, manufacturers, providers, consumers, buyers and regulators. 
The  Rules will provide a conducive environment for fostering India specific  innovation and improving accessibility and affordability of medical  devices across the globe by leveraging comparative cost advantage of  manufacturing in India. The objective, transparent and predictable  regulatory framework will boost the confidence of investors and, as a  consequence, the quality and range of products and services will improve  and business burdens will be reduced. The new Rules will help in  developing a quality standardization framework in India at par with  international standards. The implementation of these Rules will provide  the assurance of the best quality, safety and performance of medical  devices. These Rules coupled with other measures,  taken by the Government in the recent past, are expected to sharpen the  competitive edge and provide incentives to firms to become more  efficient, innovative, and competitive. All this will support  entrepreneurship, market entry and economic growth that, in turn, would  produce high-paying, high-quality jobs.

A landmark budget was presented today by the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley with the agenda of “Transform, Energize and Clean India’ with the intention of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.” This was stated by Shri J P Nadda while hailing the Union Budget for the year 2017-18. Thanking the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji and the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, Shri Nadda further said that this is an inclusive budget which is pro-poor, pro-farmer, pro-downtrodden and for the development of all the sectors and the country at large.
 
Shri J P Nadda stated that the budget estimates for health show an appreciable increase of more than 27%. From Rs. 37061.55 cr in 2016-17, the budget estimate for 2017-18 has been increased to   Rs. 47352.51 cr (Net). “This will help to attend tertiary care, human resources for health and medical education and to strengthen NHM,” Shri Nadda added.
 
The Health Minister further informed that the Ministry has spent 73.25% of 2016-17 budget till now.  “With this pace I am hopeful of spending the remaining budget for 2016-17,” Shri Nadda said. The Health Minister also stated that the Ministry will also create 5000 Post Graduate seats per annum to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to strengthen secondary and tertiary levels of healthcare. Furthermore, two new AIIMS will be set up in Jharkhand and Gujarat, Shri Nadda mentioned.
 
Shri Nadda stated that the Government has prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by 2017; to eliminate Leprosy by 2018, Measles by 2020 and to eliminate Tuberculosis by 2025 is also targeted. Moreover, action plan has been prepared to reduce IMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019, and MMR 167 in 2011-13 to 100 by 2018-2020.
 
The Union Health Minister stated that steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big District Hospitals and to encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start DNB courses. Steps will also be taken to strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal Corporation Hospitals.
 
Shri Nadda said that as part of the Budget announcements, the Government is committed to take necessary steps for structural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical Education and Practice in India. There is a proposal to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure availability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic medicines, and New Rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated. These Rules will be internationally harmonised to attract investment in this sector. This will reduce the cost of such devices.

The country has 472 medical colleges and close to a million  registered doctors. However, there is a shortage of doctors as per WHO  norm of 1 doctor per 1000 population. To facilitate the setting up of  more medical colleges, the Government had rationalized the requirement  of faculty in July, 2015. Infrastructural requirements are further being  rationalized. Recently, companies have been allowed to set up medical  colleges. There is also a centrally sponsored scheme for establishment  of new medical colleges in underserved areas.
The expansion of postgraduate medical education is a priority as the  shortage of PG medical seats in the country affects not only the  availability of specialist doctors but also the ease of getting faculty  for medical colleges.  A 100 seat medical college requires 58 faculty at  the permission stage and 105 faculty at the recognition stage. The  country has about 18,000 PG medical seats in clinical subjects. Assuming  100 new medical colleges are set up in the next 4-5 years, additional  faculty members numbering six to ten thousand will be required.
At the behest of the Central Government, the MCI has revised the  teacher student ratio to increase PG seats in clinical subjects.  As per  the notification dated 31.01.2017 issued by MCI under its PG  Regulations, the teacher student ratio shall be 1:3 for Professor and  1:2 for Associate Professor, who is a unit head.  The relaxation shall  be available only to public funded Medical Colleges in all clinical  subjects.
The measure is expected to yield about 5000 additional PG seats in  clinical subjects in the coming years.  A meeting was convened with all  States/UTs on 24.01.2017 and they have been advised to take action for  starting/increase of seats in PG courses in Government Medical Colleges  immediately.
The increased availability of PG seats along with a centralized  entrance exam viz. NEET (PG) is a major step in reform of medical  education in the country. The admission process to medical courses has  been made transparent with many States adopting combined counselling at  State level for under graduate admissions including for private medical  colleges/ Deemed Universities in the academic session 2016-17. The  Ministry vide letter dated 05.12.2016 has requested for combined  counselling for PG admissions in session 2017-18. Most of the States  have agreed.

So far as the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under the  Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) is concerned, they are incurring  losses due to number of factors such as poor order book, shortage of  working capital, surplus manpower, obsolete plant and machinery and  difficulty to adjust to changing market conditions etc. 

The details of concessions and exemptions in r/o of CPSEs under DHI are as follows: 

•	Cement Corporation of India (Rajban Unit in Himachal Pradesh) has been  availing 100% excise duty exemption since 2010. It has availed excise  duty concession amounting to Rs.7.37 crore and Rs.9.02 crore in the year  2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. 

•	Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd. was in receipt of grant for meeting  its additional operational costs on account of transportation. It has  availed grant amounting to Rs.83.50 crore and Rs.50.00 crore during  2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. 

This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of  Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a  written question in the Rajya Sabha today.

              After  coming into force of provisions on Corporate Social Responsibility of  the Companies Act, 2013, all companies, including CPSEs fulfilling  threshold limits are required to spend at least 2% of their average net  profit made during the three preceding years to undertake CSR  activities/ projects as listed in Schedule-VII to the Companies Act,  2013. 
No  specific guidelines have been issued by Department of Public  Enterprises (DPE) to the CPSEs to donate funds for construction of cancer hospitals/ up gradation of hospitals/ constructions of shelters, etc. 
As  per information furnished by 120 CPSEs an amount of Rs. 2450.31 crore  has been incurred during 2014-15 and an amount of Rs. 4100.93 crore has  been incurred by 106 CPSEs during 2015-16 for undertaking CSR activities  / projects. Details are given in Annexure. 
As  per first proviso of Section 135 (5) of Companies Act, 2013, CPSEs  shall give preference to the local area and areas around it where they  operate for spending the amount earmarked for CSR activities. However,  CPSEs may decide to undertake CSR activities in any part of the country,  including backward, rural areas of the country.  DPE  is the nodal Department for CPSEs and the companies operating in  private sector do not fall within the purview of this Department No  guidelines have been issued by DPE regarding CSR work areas for CPSEs.

Mr Anant Geete, Minister for Heavy Industries and  Public Enterprises, today assured Indian manufacturers that the  Government would take concrete steps for re-energizing the capital  goods, automotive and heavy industries. He was speaking at the  prestigious International Engineering and Technology Fair (IETF) held by  the Confederation of Indian Industry every two years.  
“The Budget contains a number of proposals to give a  critical push to the manufacturing sector and Indian industry must take  advantage of these for higher investments,” stated the Minister,  calling for focused inputs from the private sector for meeting the  Government’s targets of Make in India.   
The Minister added that technology should play a  major role in revamping the manufacturing sector.  The industry should  adapt state-of-the-art technology developed elsewhere and, at the same  time, should encourage more indigenous innovation and R&D.   Countries like Japan could provide the relevant technologies and  investments in the core sectors of Indian industry. Japan is the partner  country for the IETF for the fifth time. 
Referring to the  Capital Goods Fund, the Minister said  that it would work as a growth engine particularly for engineering,  automotive and capital goods sectors to spur employment. 
Japanese Ambassador to India, Mr. Kenji  Hiramatsu, said that Japan is keenly interested in transferring  technology to India. The Ambassador stated that Japan would  skill/reskill 40,000 technical people in 10 years by collaborating with  engineering colleges and other institutions. 
Mr Sumit Mazumder, Immediate Past President, CII  said that it should be the effort of all stakeholders to take investment  in the capital goods sector to US$ 150 billion from the present level  of US$ 48 billion.  The capital goods industry employs around 8.5  million people.  He added that the proposed GST will be a force  multiplier for Indian industry, which can ride on the back of Make in  India Program.

The  Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of  North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances  & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh and the  Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju felicitated the  sportspersons of North-Eastern States, who participated in Rio Olympics,  2016, at a function organized here today. 
The  sportspersons who were felicitated by the Ministers at the function  included Ms. Dipa Karmakar (Gymnastics), Ms. P. Sushila Chanu (Hockey-  Women), Ms. H. Lal Ruatfeli (Hockey- Women), Ms. L. Bombayla Devi  (Archery), Shri K. Chinglensan Singh (Hockey- Men), Shri K. Kothajit  Singh (Hockey-Men) and Ms. Saikhom Mirabai Chanu (Weightlifting). Two  more Olympians from North East who were to be felicitated today by the  Ministry and could not attend the function included Shri Shiva Thapa  (Boxing) and Miss T. Anuradha Devi (Hockey-Women). Each sportsperson was  presented with cash award of Rs 2.00 lakh and given a memento. 
While  interacting with the sportspersons from North East, DoNER Minister Dr  Jitendra Singh said that the North Eastern Region is on a high priority  for the Central Government. It is evident from the fact that three  months after taking over as the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  announced the setting up of a Sports University in Manipur, he added. He  said that the Central Government is making all efforts in materializing  this project and pursuing with the Manipur Government. 
Dr  Jitendra Singh said that youth are an important part of the society and  can contribute to the development of nation. For this to happen, their  energies should be channelized in the right direction, he added. The  Minister said that the Central Government has given special focus on the  education and sports activities of the youth. He said that the  Government had announced the setting up of a Center for Brahmaputra  Studies in the Guwahati University. He said that ‘Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam  Center for Policy Research and Analysis’ was formally launched in  October 2016 at the Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management (RGIIM),  Shillong. The Centre will provide strategic policy support on  livelihood, Act East Policy, Biodiversity, Organic Food Basket, Bamboo  Mission and Horticulture. 
While  interacting with the sportspersons, the DoNER Minister said that the  youth from the North East have huge potential to excel in the sports and  can bring laurels to the country if promoted and trained adequately. He  said that the youth are mostly getting training on voluntary and  informal basis, but they need institutionalised training to excel at the  international stage. He said that the performance by Ms. Dipa Karmakar  in Gymnastics at Rio Olympics has encouraged youth from the North  Eastern states. The Minister said that the youth can excel in other  sports also and for that, the Ministry of DoNER is always ready to  cooperate with Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry in this regard. The  Minister said that there is lot to learn from North East for the rest of  India.
Speaking  on the occasion, Shri Kiren Rijiju said this is a small symbolic  gesture from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Shri Rijiju said that the  players participated in the Games with full dedication. Winning and  losing did not matter, he added. While the MHA deals with security  matters, the felicitation ceremony is an effort to encourage people of  the NER to participate in sports activities, he added. Shri Rijiju said  the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has already drawn up a big plan  for the Olympics, preparing to boost India’s medals tally in the next  two Olympics. He congratulated the players for earning name not only for  the North East, but for the country. 
Shri  Kiren Rijiju and Dr Jitendra Singh later conveyed their best wishes to  the players and said that the Government is always there to help them  and encourage them in their efforts. 
The  Members of Parliament from NER and senior officers from Ministry of  Home Affairs and Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region were  also present on the occasion.

                The two-day national workshop on Preparation of Heat Wave Action Plan in Hyderabad ended on a high note today with all stakeholders resolving to work towards mitigating the adverse impact of the imminent heat wave this year. The workshop was organised by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with the Government of Telangana. 

Addressing the workshop, Shri R.K. Jain, Member, NDMA said the focus of all our efforts should be on reducing the number of deaths. We should work towards translating available data and research into specific actions to reduce the impact of heat waves, he added. 

At the technical session on Effective Governance Tools for Increased Resilience to Heat Wave, the need to bring about some fundamental changes in our built environment to augment heat wave preparedness was underlined. 

The session on Monitoring, Review and Updation of Heat Action Plan was chaired by Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, NDMA. The session discussed the importance of coordination amongst all agencies and regular monitoring of the heat wave situation. It highlighted the significance of reviewing and updating Heat Action Plans to suit the changes in an environment. 

Discussing the need for spreading awareness on heat wave, its ill effects, symptoms and simple mitigation measures, Shri Jain emphasised on the need to extensively use IEC (Information, Education and Communication) campaigns to reach out to the masses, especially to weaker sections of society as they form the most vulnerable segment of population. He reiterated that efforts towards heat wave preparedness would mean something only if our collaborative efforts are able to save lives. 

Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA, underlined the need to fine-tune Heat Action Plans right up to the village level so that traditional knowledge and indigenous practices are integrated in their plans to enhance the efficacy of their mitigation measures. 

Heat waves often lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion, stress and even a fatal heat stroke. With advance planning and preparedness, heat wave induced deaths and illnesses can be brought down. In 2016, with NDMA's ‘Guidelines for Preparation of Action Plan – Prevention and Management of Heat-Wave’ and the pro-active approach of some of the most vulnerable States, the number of deaths in the country came down significantly. 

Three technical sessions - Heat Wave Action Plan and Risk Reduction, Experience Sharing of Heat prone States and Implementations of Mitigation Measures and Early Warning and Forecasting of Heat Wave - were held on the first day of the workshop. 

Senior officials from NDMA, experts on heat wave, early warning and forecasting agencies, State governments and research institutions participated in the workshop.

The National Workshop on Preparation of Heat Wave Action Plan began in  Hyderabad today. The two-day workshop is being organized by the National  Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with the  Government of Telangana in a bid to effectively tackle the onslaught of  heat wave this year. 

The workshop is aimed at sensitising States to the need of preparing and  implementing their Heat Wave Action Plans in line with NDMA’s  ‘Guidelines for Preparation of Action Plan – Prevention and Management  of Heat-Wave’ formulated and circulated last year. 

This timely workshop will help heat wave-prone States in drawing up  their plans for 2017 as heat wave onslaught in various parts of the  country typically starts by the latter half of March. Last year, the  effective implementation of Heat Action Plans by some of worst affected  States brought down the number of heat wave-induced deaths in the  country by about 50 per cent. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri R.K. Jain, Member, NDMA, said, “In 2015,  the number of deaths recorded due to heat wave was higher than deaths  caused by any other disaster. In this background, NDMA came up with a  set of guidelines for managing heat waves in 2016. We closely reviewed  and monitored the preparedness and actions taken by heat wave prone  States and with the combined efforts of all stakeholders, especially the  State Governments, were able to bring down the number of deaths  drastically.” 

Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA, said that with advance planning and  preparedness, and active participation of all stakeholders, not only  deaths but also illnesses induced by heat waves could be brought down. 

Giving a presentation on prevention and management of heat waves, Dr. V.  Thiruppugazh, Joint Secretary, NDMA, emphasised on the importance of  Heat Action Plans and a robust database. He added that awareness  campaigns were needed to sensitise communities to take measures to  reduce the impact of heat waves. 

Dr. K. Tirupataiah, ADG, Dr. MCR-HRD Institute, Hyderabad, spoke about  the importance of reviving indigenous traditions and knowledge to  mitigate the impact of heat waves. He also talked about the need to  involve children and Panchayati Raj Institutions in spreading the  message of awareness. 

The first technical session on Heat Wave Action Plan and Risk Reduction  focused on the development of Heat Action Plans for prevention and  management of heat waves. It discussed the nuances of fine-tuning Action  Plans to cater to localized needs and solutions. 

During the second session, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana, Odisha  and Maharashtra shared their experiences and best practices to help  other States prepare their Heat Wave Action Plans. These States, which  are among the most vulnerable, have been able to largely mitigate the  impact of heat waves with better preparedness and timely intervention. 

The session on Early Warning and Forecasting of Heat Wave was chaired by  Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA. It focused on the importance of  area-specific short-range forecasting along with extended forecasting to  help authorities to understand the immediate requirements of a region  as well the most suited mitigation measures for the entire heat wave  season.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a  two-day national workshop in Hyderabad on heat wave risk reduction  through sharing of best practices beginning tomorrow. The workshop, to  be held at Dr. MCR-HRD Institute, Hyderabad, has been organised in  collaboration with the Telangana Government.

In India, heat waves typically occur between March and June, and in some  rare cases even extend till July. It may result in dehydration, heat  exhaustion, stress and even a fatal heat stroke. As recently as 2015,  more than 2,000 people died due to heat wave in the country.

Noticing the intensity of heat wave in the country, NDMA formulated and  circulated the ‘Guidelines for Preparation of Action Plan – Prevention  and Management of Heat-Wave’ last year. It significantly brought down  the number of heat wave-related deaths in 2016.

In this backdrop, this workshop aims to further sensitise the States to  the need of implementing the salient features of the Guidelines. Some of  the most vulnerable States which have done a commendable job in  mitigating the impact of heat waves will share their experiences and  best practices to help others prepare their Heat Wave Action Plans. 

It also aims to provide an opportunity for community capacity building  and awareness generation among populations who are at risk of  heat-related illnesses in places where extreme heat conditions are  imminent. The workshop will also discuss the plan for managing the  adverse effects of heat wave in the country this year.

Three technical sessions - Heat Wave Action Plan and Risk Reduction,  Experience Sharing of Heat prone States and Implementations of  Mitigation Measures and Early Warning and Forecasting of Heat Wave -  will be held on the first day of the workshop. 

Two more technical sessions - Effective Governance Tools for Increased  Resilience to Heat Wave and Monitoring, Review and Updation of Heat  Action Plan - will be held on the concluding day of the workshop.

The workshop will be attended by experts on heat wave as well as other  stakeholders such as early warning and forecasting agencies, State  governments and research institutions apart from senior officials from  NDMA.

The laying of foundation stone of NIDM is just a beginning, he  added. Shri Rijiju said that NIDM is an institute of national  importance. He assured that the Ministry of Home Affairs will provide  all the support to NIDM for taking the capacity building forward. 

Speaking on the occasion, Member Secretary, NDMA, Shri R. K. Jain said  that for any institute to give its best, a building of its own has to be  there. It will further boost the morale of the staff and officers, he  added. Shri R K Jain said that National Disaster Response Force (NDRF),  National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and NIDM work as a team in  the field of disaster and at the same time he stressed upon the  participation of community.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju addresses  the seminar on ‘Indo-Pacific Region: Converging India-Japan interests’,  organised by Observer Research Foundation (ORF) here today.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Kiren Rijiju said that the relation  between India and Japan are rooted in long history and both the  countries share common values such as commitment to democracy, supremacy  of law, human rights and global peace. Sixty four years have passed  since both India and Japan established their diplomatic relations and  during this period, they have been able to build a very robust  partnership based on mutually convergent strategic and economic  interests, he added.
On Strategic ties, the Minister said that India and Japan have signed  a Declaration on security cooperation and taken several steps to  strengthen the cooperation in defence production and civil nuclear  energy. He also highlighted Japan’s participation in the Malabar joint  exercises for maritime security.
On economic ties, Shri Kiren Rijiju said that Japan is supporting  several mega-infrastructure projects like the Delhi-Mumbai Freight  Corridor, Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, Chennai-Bangalore Industrial  Corridor and Mumbai-Ahmadabad high speed railway. He said that both  countries have also entered into a comprehensive economic partnership  agreement to boost trade and investment. Japanese private investment has  made a great impact particularly on the automobile sector in India, he  added.
Shri Rijiju said that India has been the biggest recipient of Japan’s  Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans since 2003. He said that  Japanese aid has flowed into several critical sectors such as power,  transport, communication, irrigation, connectivity projects in Northeast  India, modernization of railways and ports.
ORF began its journey in 1990 and brought together leading Indian  economists and policymakers to present the agenda for India’s economic  reforms. From primarily looking inward and engaging with domestic  reforms, to gradually forging global partnerships, ORF today plays a  seminal role in building political and policy consensus that enables  India to interact with the world. It provides non-partisan, independent,  well-researched analyses and inputs to diverse decision-makers in  Governments, business communities, and academia and to civil society  around the world. ORF seeks to lead and aid policy thinking towards  building a strong and prosperous India in a fair and equitable world.

                Marking the beginning of a series of ceremonies at the National Police  Memorial here today, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren  Rijiju was the Chief Guest at the Band display and retreat ceremony at  National Police Memorial.  The Minister and other distinguished guests  paid rich tributes to the Police Martyrs at the Memorial.  The Border  Security Force (BSF) put up a mesmerizing band display and a perfectly  orchestrated retreat ceremony in a befitting homage to the Martyrs.  The  somber yet spectacular display was highly appreciated by Shri Kiren  Rijiju and all guests present at the venue.   

In a charged atmosphere, the memorial site came alive with the  outstanding band display by BSF. The martial tunes played and different  formations display by the Brass and pipe band teams of BSF was followed  by crisp retreat ceremony by the Seema Praharees who stand as the  impregnable wall of India’s first line of defence on Pakistan and  Bangladesh Border. 

On February 1, 2017, with the initiative of Special Secretary (IS),  Ministry of Home Affaris (MHA), Shri Mahesh Kumar Singla, it was decided  that every Saturday a band display as well as retreat ceremony will be  conducted at National Police Memorial site.  It is a monthly event for  all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs). BSF has the distinguished  honour of initiating this solemn ceremony for times to come. 

Mandated to serve motherland and to save the society from external and  internal vices, Police forces of India have proven their mettle braving  all odds. Every year, 21st October is observed as Police Commemoration  Day. On this fateful day in 1959, 20 brave police men stood as rock  against external aggression and gave supreme sacrifice on the altar of  duty at the altitude of 16000 feet at Hot springs Ladakh.  This legacy  of selfless service to nation is carried on with great responsibility  and selfless zeal by all Police Forces of India. A Memorial service is  conducted every year at Hot springs Ladakh by representatives of all  police forces.  Since 2012 the same is being observed at a National  level at National Police Memorial, Chankyapuri, New Delhi. 

Retired and Serving Senior Police Officers, Officers and family members  of CAPFs and security agencies, MHA and other Ministries were present  during today’s ceremony. The ceremony to be held on every Saturday is  open to the public.

                The Air Wing of Border Security Force (BSF) added a new chapter with the  induction of its own pilots and crew today. Minister of State for Home  Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju became the first dignitary to be flown by  “all BSF” aircrew, aboard the MI-17 V5 helicopter from Guwahati. This is  a significant achievement and shows the confidence and capability of  managing its resources and expanding the operational envelop of recently  inducted modern MI-17 V5 choppers. Wing Commander H.D. Lohani (Retd.)  and Wing Commander S. Malik (Retd.) both appointed as Commandant/Pilot  recently, were part of the crew for this historic occasion. Till now the  BSF aircrafts were being operated by Aircrew from the Indian Air Force.   

Since its establishment in 1969, the Aviation Wing of MHA under BSF is  touching new milestones with each passing day. Based at Safdarjung  Airport in New Delhi, its span has now expanded to Ranchi &  Guwahati.  With this development, the BSF helicopters are now covering  the entire length and breadth of the country, - from hills and forests  of Arunachal Pradesh to the vast expanse of the “Rann of Kutch”.  Their  service has provided the much needed impetus in fight against the  Naxals, as a result their activities have significantly reduced.  This  is due to a new synergy between aviation assets of MHA and its troops on  ground.

                The Minister of State for External Affairs Shri M. J. Akbar addressed at the ongoing 17th International NSG Seminar here today. 
Speaking  on the occasion, Shri M. J. Akbar said that terrorism is a biggest  threat to prosperity and peace will prevail when terrorism is  eliminated. Shri M. J. Akbar said that terrorism challenges the  architecture of stability. The objective of terrorism is not about the  casualty count/ number of deaths, but to incite fear in pluralistic  societies, he added. 
Shri  M. J. Akbar said that India is strongly committed to fight against  terrorism. He said that the nations which support terrorism should be  held accountable. He also said that freedom of faith & religion,  economic equity and democracy are important to defeat radicalisation and  regressive ideas. The Minister said that India is geo-politically at  the centre of East and West Asia and the future of Asia will be  dependent on what happens in India. He said that India will continue to  march forward in peace and stability.
Shri  M. J. Akbar said that there should be more such seminars for knowledge  sharing and capacity building and he commended NSG for strong deterrent  against terrorism and terrorist activities. 
DG,  NSG, Shri Sudhir Pratap Singh said that NSG is organising seminars on  counter terrorism for last 16 years and the participation has increased  rapidly.  He said that this  seminar is being attended by representatives from 12 countries, 2 UTs  and 17 State police force, Army and paramilitary forces. He said that  terrorism is cutting across boundaries and there is a need to change the  mindset from fighting terrorism to defeat terrorism.
During the day, two sessions were held to  discuss the trends and developing threats of terrorism and capacity  building & international cooperation. 

The  MoS for Information and Broadcasting Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore  inaugurated the Seminar yesterday in Manesar, Haryana. The two-day  seminar is organised by National Security Guard (NSG).

                Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah  Naidu today urged real estate developers to take up affordable housing  projects in a big way while stressing that therein lies the future of  the real estate sector. Elaborating on his statement, the Minister said  that “ The Government’s focus on ensuring Housing for All including the  Middle Income Groups offered immense opportunities both at the bottom  and the middle of the pyramid which needs to be seized by the developers  who have seen ups and downs  in recent year”. He spoke at a Conference  on “Real Estate Sector-Post Remonetisation and RERA” organized by PHD  Chambers here today.
Shri Venkaiah Naidu further said that the Government has paid more  attention to the real sector than any other sector by announcing more  than 20 supporting measures to revive real estate sector over the last  two years including announcing the long awaited infrastructure status  for affordable housing besides several tax concessions and exemptions.  He further said that under Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana(Urban), people  belonging to Economically Weaker Sections, Low Income Groups and Middle  Income Groups with incomes up to Rs.18 lakh per year have been made  eligible for central assistance up to Rs.2.35 lakh per each beneficiary.  “Low cost long term financing under infrastructure status, tax  concessions and central assistance under PMAY and the scale of housing  needs of these sections make affordable housing the best investment  opportunity and developers are left with no further excuses for not  seizing this opportunity” Shri Naidu stressed.
Shri Naidu said that various initiatives of the Government including  the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, the Benami  Properties Act and  note withdrawal have enabled a new real estate  eco-system based on 4 ‘Cs’ viz., Character, Credibility, Confidence and  Cash that would help revive the sector. He said that while the Real  Estate Act removes the taint restoring the character of the sector  leading to credibility and enhanced confidence of buyers, central  assistance, reduced interest rates and tax concessions keep more cash in  the hands of buyers.
Stating that the Ministry of HUPA has so far approved construction  of over 16 lakh affordable houses for urban poor with an investment of  about Rs.90,000 cr and central assistance of about Rs.25,000 cr, Shri  Naidu expressed concern over private developers not taking up any  projects so far. He urged them to change their mindsets and outlook and  take up affordable housing projects given the business logic that goes  with it in the changing context.
Shri Naidu said that his Ministry would soon convene a Round Table  with real estate bodies and representatives of banks and Housing  Financing Companies and others concerned to deliberate on the road ahead  for promoting affordable housing so that the target of ensuring Housing  for All by 2022 would be met.
On the effects of note withdrawal, the Minister noted that it was  only a temporary interlude and the process of remonetisation is almost  completed. Shri Naidu noted that “For various reasons, real estate  sector over the years has come to be seen as the villain in the theatre  of corruption and note withdrawal was expected to address flow of  unaccounted for money in to the sector by about 20% to 30% which in turn  would bring down prices substantially”.

Push for affordable housing to ensure social justice and equality, says Minister
Budget enhanced realization of Housing for All target
Shri Naidu asserts that housing boom will return with people with income of up to Rs.18 lakh per year getting support from government
Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has said that “Budget for 2017-18 has made the house buyer the King by incentivizing the developers and catalyzing investment flows through several concessions and incentives to affordable housing sector”. He spoke to media elaborating on the thrust given to housing sector in the Budget and their implications by way of increased options to buyers to own a house.
Shri Naidu said that the government’s thrust to affordable housing is an indication of its commitment to ensure social justice and equality under its inclusive development approach.
The Minister noted that fulfilment of the long standing demand of infrastructure status to affordable housing encourages builders by making them available low interest and long term finances, ultimately benefiting the buyers with reduced cost of houses. Infrastructure status makes lending institutions look positively at housing loans as it reduced the risk weightage of such loans.
With affordable housing getting infrastructure status, “Large public sector investors like Employee Provident Fund Organisation and Insurance Firms will now invest in housing as they are mandated to invest specified portion of their funds in infrastructure projects”, he stressed.
Shri Naidu further said that various other incentives announced in the Budget for next fiscal will incentivize producers in the form of low interest loans, tax benefits etc., besides increased availability of resources to housing sector which will increase the options of owning a house and thereby making the house buyer the king.
Shri Naidu asserted that with substantially increased thrust on housing by the Government, the housing boom will return further to large scale interventions both on supply and demand side. He elaborated on this saying that Government is providing central assistance in the range of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.2.30 lakh per beneficiary belonging to Economically Weaker Sections, Low Income Groups and Middle Income Groups with incomes of up to Rs. 18 lakh per year under Prime Ministers Awas Yojana(Urban) and similar support for housing in rural areas.
Shri Naidu informed that under PMAY(Urban), 15,61,000 affordable houses have been sanctioned in urban areas with an investment of Rs.84,150 cr with central assistance of Rs.24,670 cr. Of these, construction of 4,32,063 houses has begun and tenders are being called for construction of another 8,50,000 houses.

EPFO launched Employees Enrolment Campaign 2017  offering opportunity to the employers to voluntarily declare details of  all employees hitherto deprived of social security benefits under EPFO.  The declaration scheme is operational between January 1st 2017 to March 31st 2017. Under the Scheme: The  employees’ share of contributions if declared by the employer as not  deducted shall stand waived. The damages to be paid by the employer in  respect of the employer in respect of the employees for whom declaration  has been made under this campaign shall be at the rate of Rupee One per  annum. No administrative charges shall be collected from the employer  in respect of the contribution made under the declaration. A declaration  can be made under the Campaign for the period for which no inquiry  under Section 7A has been initiated.
 
EPFO  has provided facility for online declaration under the Principal  Employer section of EPFO portal which facilities the implementation of  the Employees’ Enrolment Campaign. After declaration, the payments are  to be remitted by the employer through month-wise ECRs for the entire  past period of enrolments.
To  facilitate enhanced services, furnishing of Aadhar has now been made  mandatory for members and pensioners of the Employee’s Pension Scheme.  Furnishing of Aadhar seeded bank accounts as well as Aadaar by EPF  members would facilitate better identification as well as consolidation  of EPF accounts linked with various spells of employment of EPF members.  This would allow offering any time anywhere services to EPF members.
ECR  2.0 has been operationlized and the principal employer can view details  of contractor establishment’s compliance status. This will help all  employees, particularly contract employees, becoming aware of any  non-compliance by their employer/contractor as they shall be immediately  receiving SMSs whenever a contribution is credited into their account.
In  January 2017, EPFO settled 19,114 grievance leaving 2,556 as pending.  Out of the pending grievances, 2,206 were pending for less than seven  days.
As  a part of next phase of computerization, EPFO is moving towards a  centralized receipt and payment, system. EPFO has entered into banking  arrangements with multiple banks. Once operationlized, this would also  facilitate automation of compilation of financial information as  required for compiling the organizational balance sheet and other  monitoring reports.

Making Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contribution optional for  employees, inter-alia, envisages amendment to the   EPF & MP Act,  1952 and Schemes framed thereunder which has not been done. Further, it  has not been decided to raise the present wage ceiling for coverage  under the EPF& MP Act, 1952.

                Reforms  in labour laws are an ongoing process to update legislative system to  address the need of the hour and to make them more effective and  contemporary to the emerging economic and industrial scenario. The  Second National Commission on Labour which submitted its Report in 2002  had recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped  into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis.  Accordingly, the  Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages;  Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare and Safety and  Working Conditions, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the  relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. These  initiatives will reduce the complexity in compliance due to multiplicity  of labour laws and facilitate setting up of enterprises and thus  creating the environment for development of business and industry in the  country and generating employment opportunities without diluting basic  aspects of safety, security and health of workers. 
        Conventions  of International Labour Organization (ILO), on ratification create  legally binding obligation for ratifying country. Ratification of a  convention is a voluntary process. India ratifies a convention only when  our national laws and practices are in full conformity with the  Convention.  So far, India has ratified 45 Conventions and 1 Protocol.

It is a  self supporting scheme which provides legal services to the middle  income group citizens i.e. citizens whose gross income is not exceeding  Rs.60, 000 per month or Rs. 7, 50, 000 per annum.

As per the Supreme Court rules it is only through advocates on record cases can be filed before it.

A sum of Rs.500/- shall be payable to the Supreme Court Middle Income  Group Legal Aid Society (SCMIGLAS) as service charges. The applicant  shall have to deposit the fee indicated by the Secretary, which will be  in accordance with the schedule attached to the Scheme. It is the  Secretary, who will register the case under the MIG Legal Aid Scheme and  proceed to forward the papers to the Advocate-on-Record/Arguing  Counsel/Senior Counsel on the panel for opinion.

If Advocate-on-Record is satisfied that it is a fit case to be proceeded  with, then the Society will consider that the applicant is entitled to  legal aid. The view expressed by the Learned Advocate-onRecord will be  final insofar as the eligibility of the applicant for obtaining the  benefit of the Scheme is concerned. 

Under the scheme, middle class people who can`t afford the expensive  litigation in the Supreme Court can avail the services of the society  for a nominal amount.  The person desirous of availing the benefit of  the Scheme shall have to fill up the form prescribed and accept all the  terms and conditions contained therein. 

As per the scheme, contingent fund will be created to meet the  miscellaneous expenditure in connection with the case under the Scheme  by requiring the applicant to deposit upto the stage of admission, a sum  of Rs.750/- in addition to the charges required to be deposited with  the Society, out of this contingent fund. 

In the event of the learned Advocate taking the view that the case is  not fit one for an appeal to the Supreme Court, then the entire amount  after deduction Rs.750/- towards minimum service charges of the  Committee shall be refunded to the applicant by way of cheque.

As the next step, further, if the Advocate who is appointed under the  Scheme is found negligent in the conduct of the case entrusted to him,  then he will be required to return the brief together with the fee which  he may have received from the applicant under the scheme.   Further, the Society will not be responsible for the negligent conduct  of the case but the entire responsibility will be that of the Advocate  vis-a-vis the client. The name of the Advocate will, however, be struck  off from the panel prepared under the Scheme.

A large number of poor people would approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court  for aid to sort out their cases, file cases on their behalf and get  justice, but could not afford the expenses. To make filing petitions  easy for the underprivileged strata of the society, the Hon’ble Supreme  Court decided to introduce this scheme.

Union Minister of State (IC)for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy andMines, Shri Piyush Goyal presided over the launchingof the Transparency, Auction Monitoring and Resource Augmentation (TAMRA) Portal and Mobile Application, developed by the Ministry of Mines, here today. It was simultaneously launched across 12 mineral rich States.Shri Goyal also made an important announcement that the Government is planning on bringing amendments to mining rules to bring transparency in award of exploration and mining licences for the 100 identified off-shore mineral blocks soon. 
Informing the gathering about the salient features of TAMRA, Shri Goyal said that with an objective to enhance transparency and accountability, as a part of the Ease of Doing Business in the Mining sector, TAMRA is a step to speed up mining activity in India and facilitate all the stakeholders to track the status of the statutory clearances associated with mining blocks for getting mines to reach till operationalisation for the same.It will be an interactive platform for all the stakeholders to compress the timelines for statutory andother clearancesas it would help minimize the gestation period for commencing production. 
Stressing on TAMRA’s features that would enhance transparency and accountability in Mining, Shri Goyal stated that in case ofdelay in obtaining any clearances, TAMRA will send triggersto the concerned authority so that the remedial steps can be taken immediately by those responsible.The Ministry of Mines will also receive triggers generated by TAMRA,which willfacilitate in expeditingclearancesin case the timelines set against each of the statutory clearances are not met. Further, the status of each of the clearances will be reflected on the portal. This portal also enables the successful bidder to give suggestions and other inputs for improving the current process of issuing Statutory clearances in the Mining Sector which would help to establish a participative and informative network among all stakeholders, the Minister added. 
Shri Balvinder Kumar, Secretary, Mines, earlier in his address, informed that TAMRA covers block-wise, state-wise and mineral-wise information of the mines to be auctioned, monitors various statutory clearances, and also highlights the additional resources generated through e-auction. Further, he also informed that e-auctions havesuccessfully been concluded for 21 mineral blocks put up for auction byvarious State governments with a total resource base of Rs. 93,190 crores. The total estimated revenueto the State governments through the process of e-auction stands at Rs. 73,359 crores.  Out of this, the cumulative Royalty, District Mineral Fund (DMF) and National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) contribution works out to be Rs. 15,825 crores (Rs. 14,130 crores, Rs. 1,413 crores and Rs.283 crores, respectively). 
Dignitaries present on the occasion included senior officers of the Ministry of Mines and stalwarts from the mining industry.
 
The Flowchart of TAMRA is as follows:

Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines chaired a meeting of the parliamentary consultative committee attached to the Ministry of Coal and the Ministry of Mines on the issues of “mines safety in coal mines’ and ‘initiatives in exploration regime’ respectively in New Delhi last evening. The Secretary Mines Shri Balvinder Kumar and the Secretary Coal Shri Susheel Kumar presented their reports for the information of the members on the respective subjects of their ministries. 
The Members of the Committee were apprised of the ‘Initiatives in Exploration Regime’ in the Mines Ministry after it brought about far reaching changes in the mining sector since January 2015 when the Amendment Act of 2015 made the amendments to the MMDR Act 1957. The most important feature of this amendment is the grant of Mining Leases (ML) and Prospecting License-cum-Mining Lease (PL-cum-ML) only through an auction process. The Rule also specifies that for auction of mining lease, at least general exploration (G2) is required to be completed and for auction of composite license, at least preliminary exploration (G3) is to be completed. The Amendment Act removed the earlier provision of Reconnaissance Permit (RP) and provided for Non-Exclusive Reconnaissance Permits (NERP). The holder of such NERP would not be entitled to make any claim for the grant of any PL-cum-ML or a ML. To encourage exploration, the amended Act abolished the restriction on lease transferability and allowed the transfer of mineral concessions held by leaseholders to any person eligible to hold such lease. 
Further, amended MMDR Act has established National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) and the holder of a Mining Lease or PL-cum-ML would pay to the Trust, a sum equivalent to 2% of the royalty paid in terms of the second schedule. The Trust is aimed to support regional and detailed exploration and related activities for development of exploration.  The Act also has provisions for notifying organizations by the Central Government for exploration without licences. As of today, 13 such organizations and PSUs have been notified under this provision. The Act further has provisions for easy transferability of concessions obtained through auctions so as to attract private investment and FDI.
The compelling need to provide an impetus to exploration activity in the country at this juncture has prompted a thorough review of the Government’s Exploration Policy and strategy. Keeping in view the immense untapped mineral potential of the country, it was realised that there are many areas that need further facilitation and added emphasis is required for attracting investments and private exploration agencies in regional exploration. Accordingly, the new National Mineral Exploration Policy has been notified in July 2016 with a view to provide a new set of objectives, sense of purpose and direction within the amended legal framework. It is aimed at attracting private exploration agencies, and has the following main features:
(i)     The Government will make available pre-competitive baseline geoscientific data free of charge. Geological, geochemical and geophysical data and maps on 1:50K will be provided in public domain.
(ii)   Aero-geophysical survey of the country with a flight height of 80m and line spacing of 300m will be carried out in a mission mode under the National Aerogeophysical Mapping Project (NAGMP). Initially, the potential areas will be covered in three years and the data placed in public domain.
(iii)  A National Geoscientific Data Repository (NGDR) will be set up.  It will comprise all baseline and mineral exploration information generated by diverse exploration agencies. 
(iv)  Regional exploration of identified blocks by private exploration agencies through competitive bidding on an attractive revenue sharing basis.   
(v)   Government will launch a special initiative to probe deep-seated/concealed mineral deposits in the country aimed at characterizing India’s geological cover, resolving the metallogenic evolution, and detecting the distal footprints of deep-seated ore deposits.
The organizations under the Ministry of Mines engaged in mineral exploration viz. the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd. (MECL) are actively working towards fulfilling these objectives. 
On the issue of ‘Mines Safety in Coal Mines’, Mines Act 1952 is the mother Act to ensure regulation of labour and safety in mines. To match the pace of technological advancement in various aspects of mining and related safety issues the Directorate General of Mine Safety (DGMS) takes care by issuing circulars and emphasising incorporation of Risk Management process in the mining activity. The members were informed about the measures taken by the Coal Ministry after the recent accident in Rajmahal Open Cast project of Eastern Coalfields Limited on 29.12.2016. A number of issues concerning safety in coalmines were deliberated upon and members contributed their useful suggestions.   
The Members of Lok Sabha who participated in the meeting included Shri Hari Manjhi, Shri Kaushlendra Kumar, Shri Lakhan Lal Sahu, Shri Laxmi Narayan Yadav, Shri Midhun Reddy, Shri Ram Tahal Choudhary, Shri Ramchandra Paswan, Shri Ravindra Kumar Pandey, Shri Santosh Kumar and Shri Vishnu Dayal Ram.     The Members of Rajya Sabha present in the meeting were Dr. Anil Kumar Sahani         , Dr. Bhushan Lal Jangde, Smt. Chhaya Verma and Smt. M.C. Mary Kom.

The Secretary Mines Shri Balvinder Kumar inaugurated the 56th Central Geological Programming Board (CGPB) meeting of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), Ministry of Mines in New Delhi today. Addressing the members Shri Balvinder Kumar said, India has a huge untapped potential for mineral resources for which CGPB is an important platform for coordination of all activities of geosciences by GSI and other stakeholders. Mining is a core sector of economy and contributes towards growth of GDP of the country.  Mineral sector has seen a big transformation in the last two years since Jan 2015 through MMDR Amendment Act 2015.  The major changes are: 
i)           Allocation of mineral blocks by auctioning only; 
ii)         Creation of District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and use of the funds so collected for the welfare of people affected by mining through PMKKKY 
iii)        Creation of National Mineral exploration Trust (NMET);
iv)        National Mineral Exploration Policy implemented from July-2016, and
iv)        Penalty for illegal mining enhanced.
In 2016-17, 21 Mining leases were auctioned successfully garnering revenues cumulatively in 50 years’ time span of mines to the tune of Rs 94000 crores. The Year 2017-18 may turn out to be watershed year in the mining and mineral sector as many more blocks will be open for auctioning and allocation for mining leases.  About 300 such leases may be available for auctioning in the coming year 2017-18. Further GSI has carved out 100 blocks for Regional exploration, which in turn will be upgraded to higher stages of exploration if merited.
In offshore sector, much wok has not been done till 2015 as no clear cut rules were in force. Presently the Ministry of Mines is planning to redraft the Offshore Mineral Development Act and it should be in ready in another 2 to 3 months. Offshore resources worth of nearly Rs. 30,000 crores can be tapped once the Act comes in vogue. New geotechnical vessels with state- of the art technology is being procured by GSI, Shri Balvinder Kumar said. 
 GSI has launched Project Uncover (India) in two transects one in the northern sector and other in the southern sector in search of deep- seated concealed deposits.
Baseline aero - geophysical survey through outsourcing is going to be taken up to cover the Obvious Geological Potential (OGP) areas of the country of 8.13 lakh sq. km. Initially around 2 lakh sq km is proposed to be taken up in February to April this year and work order has been given to three reputed consortiums of companies after due deliberations for the same. 
Online Core Business Integrated System (OCBIS) is a remarkable and collective achievement of GSI. Although the new Web Portal has already gone beta live in September 2016, it is expected to be operational by April 2017. GSI should endeavor to become fully paperless in all respects with the implementation of OCBIS. Another major achievement of GSI is creation of National Geo-science Data Repository (NGDR). It is to be set up by National Institute of Smart Governance (NISG) on turn-key basis. Data generated by GSI and other stakeholders will be accessible on a single platform. It is worth mentioning that GSI has already uploaded more than 6000 mineral exploration reports in the public domain.  GSI should be more technology driven at par with other advanced geoscience organizations of the world. Restructuring of GSI is needed to be done to meet up the present day challenges, the Mines Secretary added.   
During the 2-day meeting, the board will deliberate and discuss recommendations of all the 12 thematic committees of the CGPB as well as the State Geological Programming Boards (SGPBs) and finalize the Field Season Program of GSI for the year 2017-18.  GSI has drawn up about 817 scientific programs for deliberation and finalization by the Board. This includes about 198 programs under mineral exploration. The finalization will take into consideration the priorities and importance set forth by the Government of India, through its various policy decisions. Last year GSI implemented 803 programs in all, which included 214 programs under mineral exploration. 
Shri Piyush Goyal, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines extended his best wishes for the successful deliberations in all the sessions of the 56th CGPB meeting. 
The CGPB meeting is being  attended by senior level officers of Ministry of Mines, GSI and members from other Central Ministries, State Directorates of Mining and Geology, mining industry, PSUs and other stakeholders.

                The Secretary Mines Shri Balvinder Kumar inaugurated the 56th Central Geological Programming Board (CGPB) meeting of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), Ministry of Mines in New Delhi today. Addressing the members Shri Balvinder Kumar said, India has a huge untapped potential for mineral resources for which CGPB is an important platform for coordination of all activities of geosciences by GSI and other stakeholders. Mining is a core sector of economy and contributes towards growth of GDP of the country.  Mineral sector has seen a big transformation in the last two years since Jan 2015 through MMDR Amendment Act 2015.  The major changes are: 
i)           Allocation of mineral blocks by auctioning only; 
ii)         Creation of District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and use of the funds so collected for the welfare of people affected by mining through PMKKKY 
iii)        Creation of National Mineral exploration Trust (NMET);
iv)        National Mineral Exploration Policy implemented from July-2016, and
iv)        Penalty for illegal mining enhanced.
In 2016-17, 21 Mining leases were auctioned successfully garnering revenues cumulatively in 50 years’ time span of mines to the tune of Rs 94000 crores. The Year 2017-18 may turn out to be watershed year in the mining and mineral sector as many more blocks will be open for auctioning and allocation for mining leases.  About 300 such leases may be available for auctioning in the coming year 2017-18. Further GSI has carved out 100 blocks for Regional exploration, which in turn will be upgraded to higher stages of exploration if merited.
In offshore sector, much wok has not been done till 2015 as no clear cut rules were in force. Presently the Ministry of Mines is planning to redraft the Offshore Mineral Development Act and it should be in ready in another 2 to 3 months. Offshore resources worth of nearly Rs. 30,000 crores can be tapped once the Act comes in vogue. New geotechnical vessels with state- of the art technology is being procured by GSI, Shri Balvinder Kumar said. 
 GSI has launched Project Uncover (India) in two transects one in the northern sector and other in the southern sector in search of deep- seated concealed deposits.
Baseline aero - geophysical survey through outsourcing is going to be taken up to cover the Obvious Geological Potential (OGP) areas of the country of 8.13 lakh sq. km. Initially around 2 lakh sq km is proposed to be taken up in February to April this year and work order has been given to three reputed consortiums of companies after due deliberations for the same. 
Online Core Business Integrated System (OCBIS) is a remarkable and collective achievement of GSI. Although the new Web Portal has already gone beta live in September 2016, it is expected to be operational by April 2017. GSI should endeavor to become fully paperless in all respects with the implementation of OCBIS. Another major achievement of GSI is creation of National Geo-science Data Repository (NGDR). It is to be set up by National Institute of Smart Governance (NISG) on turn-key basis. Data generated by GSI and other stakeholders will be accessible on a single platform. It is worth mentioning that GSI has already uploaded more than 6000 mineral exploration reports in the public domain.  GSI should be more technology driven at par with other advanced geoscience organizations of the world. Restructuring of GSI is needed to be done to meet up the present day challenges, the Mines Secretary added.   
During the 2-day meeting, the board will deliberate and discuss recommendations of all the 12 thematic committees of the CGPB as well as the State Geological Programming Boards (SGPBs) and finalize the Field Season Program of GSI for the year 2017-18.  GSI has drawn up about 817 scientific programs for deliberation and finalization by the Board. This includes about 198 programs under mineral exploration. The finalization will take into consideration the priorities and importance set forth by the Government of India, through its various policy decisions. Last year GSI implemented 803 programs in all, which included 214 programs under mineral exploration. 
Shri Piyush Goyal, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines extended his best wishes for the successful deliberations in all the sessions of the 56th CGPB meeting. 
The CGPB meeting is being  attended by senior level officers of Ministry of Mines, GSI and members from other Central Ministries, State Directorates of Mining and Geology, mining industry, PSUs and other stakeholders.

With an objective to enhance transparency and accountability as a part of the Ease of Doing Business in the Mining sector, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal will launch TAMRA (Transparency, Auction Monitoring and Resource Augmentation) portal and Mobile Application here on 10th February, 2017. Ministers of Mining and senior officers from 12 mineral rich States would also be connected through videoconferencing. 
 
In context of Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi’s Ease of Doing Business initiative, which advocates facilitating overall business activity in India, the Ministry of Mines has developed the TAMRA Portal and Mobile Application which is a step to speed up mining activity in India and facilitate all the stakeholders to track the status of the statutory clearances associated with mining blocks for getting mines to reach till operationalisation for the same. TAMRA will be an interactive platform for all the stakeholders to compress the timelines for statutory and other clearances as it would help minimize the gestation period for commencing production.
 
Further, TAMRA covers block-wise, state-wise and mineral-wise information of the blocks to be auctioned, monitors various statutory clearances, and also highlights the additional resources generated through e-Auction. In case of delay in obtaining any clearances, TAMRA will send triggers to the concerned authority so that the remedial steps can be taken immediately by those responsible. The Ministry of Mines will also receive triggers generated by TAMRA and will facilitate in expediting clearances. This portal also enables successful bidder to give suggestions/inputs.
 
The TAMRA Flowchart is as follows:

                The Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) & Parliamentary Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that some vested interests are creating various obstacles in development of waqf properties and utilisation of these properties for welfare of the society. Shri Naqvi said that serious irregularities in some State Waqf Boards have also come to notice. A high-level inquiry has been going on into these matters and strict action will be taken against those people who are responsible. Shri Naqvi stated it while addressing the 75th meeting of Central Waqf Council in New Delhi, today. 
 
The Minister said that proper utilisation of waqf properties is an important part of our efforts towards empowerment of Minorities. Several State Governments and Waqf Boards have been performing very well in this regard. 
 
Shri Naqvi said that Central Government is making efforts to ensure that all the waqf boards and their records across the country are made digital. Minority Affairs Ministry has been providing all possible help to the state waqf boards. The Computerisation of waqf boards and their properties will help in ensuring transparency. 
 
Shri Naqvi said that a one-man “Board of Adjudication” at the Central level has been established under the chairmanship of retired Supreme Court justice to deal with complaints and disputes regarding waqf properties. Three-member tribunals are being established in the states. About 24 states have established these tribunals so far. Other states should also do this soon.  
 
There are about 4,49,314 registered and non-registered waqf properties across the country. The number of these properties will be increased after computerisation of waqf boards. It has also been come to our notice that some waqf boards are not registering the waqf properties properly during the computerisation process. Strict action is being taken in such complaints.  
 
Shri Naqvi said that in the Budget 2017-18, Rs 3.30 crore has been allocated for computerisation of records of state waqf boards; Rs 9.70 crore have been given for strengthening of state waqf boards while Rs 3.18 crore have been allocated as grants-in-aid to Waqf.  
 
Shri Naqvi said that the Ministry of Minority Affairs under the guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been working towards socio-economic-educational empowerment of Minorities as a mission and commitment. Keeping this in mind, the Centre has increased the Budget of Minority Affairs Ministry in the Union Budget (General) 2017-18. This increased budget will be helpful in socio-economic-educational empowerment of Minorities.  
 
The Budget of Minority Affairs Ministry has been increased to Rs 4195.48 crore for 2017-18. This is Rs 368.23 crore more than 2016-17 Budget of Rs 3827.25 crore with an increase of about 9.6 per cent.  
 
Shri Naqvi said that the Government’s efforts for empowerment of Minorities include “Progress Panchayat”, “Hunar Haat”, “Gurukul” type residential schools, “Garib Nawaz Skill Development Centre”, “Begum Hazrat  Mahal Scholarship” for girls, establishing five world class educational institutes for Minorities and 500 quality residential schools and job-oriented skill development centres.

He called upon all the stakeholders present to make India as the ‘Pharmacy of the World’. The Minister said that the highlights of the 2nd edition of the conference would be the International Drug Regulators Meet and the interface between the regulators and the industry.

It would help both the stakeholders of pharma sector to fine tune the policies governing the sector, the Minister added.
 
Talking about the achievements of the Pharma sector, the Minister congratulated the industry for achieving a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 15% and expressed confidence that the sector would be worth $55 billion by 2020 from the present $32 billion. The Minister also said that India accounts for around 20% of the World’s generic medicine supply chain, exporting to over 250 countries globally. Indian Pharma Industry provides over 60% of global vaccines, he added.
 
Further, Shri Kumar informed that in this fiscal year, the Indian Pharma sector has received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) close to $14 billion and has generated employment for over 2.5 million people across India. The Minister also announced from the podium that Bengaluru, being the hub of Information technology and skilled manpower, would prove to be the ideal location to set up a Pharma and Med Tech Zone and hence the Ministry would work with the State Government to establish it soon. This step would give a boost to domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in India under the Make in India mission, he added.
 
Highlighting the long pending issues addressed by the Government to promote Ease of Doing Business in pharma and medical devices sector, Shri Kumar said that correction of the Inverted Duty structure for medical devices, withdrawal of extension duty on imports to promote domestic manufacturing of bulk drugs and bringing about a fair, transparent, predictable and level playing field in the sector etc., has been done by the Government. The Minister further assured the industry that the Government would maintain this stability for the sector in the future as well. Shri Kumar also mentioned about deliberations being made at the highest levels in the Government to make the Department of Pharmaceuticals into an independent Ministry.
 
Shri Siddaramaiah, Chief Minister, Karnataka said that this is the second time Karnataka is hosting this conference on Medical Device & Pharmaceutical sector, thus giving the State an opportunity to emerge as the desired destination for investments under pharma  & medical devices sector and give a boost to Make in India Mission in this sector. The state pharma industry constitutes 264 manufacturing units that include small-medium, large, public sector and multinational companies. The State stands 5th in Pharmaceuticals exports with 40% of its Pharma produce being exported overseas, he added. 
 
Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Shri Mansukh Lal Mandaviya highlighted that the recent approval of the Pharma and Med Tech zone in Andhra Pradesh has attracted over 30 investment proposals from domestic and international pharma companies which has the potential to reduce the manufacturing cost of drugs and medical devices by around 30% as compared to global prices.
 
The India Pharma exhibition, being held as part of the event, will cover all the segments of the pharmaceutical industry starting from finished formulations, APIs, bio-pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals & intermediates, natural extracts and excipients. India Medical Device exhibition will showcase med-tech innovations in India across segments from preventive to therapeutic care. Leading Pharmaceutical & Medical Device companies will showcase their expertise and products to Indian and International Healthcare community at the exhibition that will result in creating new business opportunities. Sessions on Biopharmaceuticals will include The New Engine of Growth, Scaling Med-Tech Manufacturing and the Investors Meet, which will be a step forward to the ‘Make in India’mission of the Government of India.

                As per the Annual Bilateral Agreement signed between India and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Haj 2017, a quota of 1,70,025 pilgrims (1,25,025 seats for Haj Committee of India and 45,000 seats for Private Tour Operators) has been allocated as against the quota of 1,36,020 pilgrims (1,00,020 seats for Haj Committee of India and 36,000 seats for Private Tour Operators) during previous year. 
 
The quota allotted to Haj Committee of India are allocated to all States/ Union Territories Haj Committees including the States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana, in proportion of their Muslim population as per Census 2011.
 
The Supreme Court while dealing with the Special Leave Petition (Civil) inter alia observed that Haj subsidy is something that is best done away with and directed the Central Government to progressively reduce the amount of subsidy so as to completely eliminate within a period of 10 years. Accordingly, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), which is responsible for making air travel arrangements for Haj Pilgrims identified by HCoI and to provide subsidy towards airfare payable to the airlines, has progressively reduced the subsidy for Haj operations from the year 2012 onwards. An amount of Rs.836.56 crore as subsidy was given by the Government in 2012-13. Progressively, it reduced to Rs.680.03 crore in the year 2013-14 , Rs.577.07 cror in 2014-15, Rs. 529.51 crore in 2015-16 and Rs. 405 crore (approx) in the year 2016-17. 
Every year a Haj Air Travel Committee (HATC) is constituted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to look into the various aspects of air travel arrangements for Haj pilgrimage. For Haj 2017, the HATC has been constituted on 02.01.2017 under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary, MoCA and comprising of Joint Secretary level Officers of Ministry of Minority Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, Director, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Chief Executive Officer, HCoI and a representative of Airports Authority of India.

The responsibilities for making air travel arrangements for Haj  Pilgrims selected by the Haj Committee of India is with the Ministry of  Civil Aviation (MoCA). The Annual Bilateral Agreement between India and  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) provides that as per the instructions  issued by General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), the Saudi air  transport companies will share equally without any exception the  transportation of Hajis with the national carrier of each country.  Further as per the conditions laid down by GACA, no contracts are  allowed to be made with any third party for transportation of Hajis.
During Haj operations – 2014, capacity available with Air India on  its own fleet was not capable of carrying over 50,000 pilgrims from 14  embarkation points. Therefore, Air India sub-contracted the agreement by  utilizing Dynamic Airways for undertaking Haj 2014 operations. There  were some disruptions in the operations by sub-contractors. Keeping this  in view and to ensure that future Haj operations are conducted smoothly  and without inconvenience to the Haj pilgrims, it was prescribed that  the airlines will not be allowed to outsource their operation to any  third party for onward Haj operations. Since Haj 2015, Air India is  operating Haj flights with its own fleet.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh inaugurated a group exhibition of paintings by Jammu artists at Lalit Kala Akademi here today. While inaugurating the exhibition, he said that Jammu has creative talent in abundance, but needs more exposure. 

Speaking to media persons after visiting the various displays at the exhibition venue, Dr Jitendra Singh said that wider exposure has dual advantage for the artist. On the one hand, he said, it enables an artist with a creative potential to get the opportunity of reaching out to larger horizons, while on the other hand, it also promotes competitive spirit among the artists. He said that earlier also, he has been encouraging artists and sculptors to put up their displays in the national capital and he would continue to encourage them in future as well. He said that he has suggested them to collectively select some of their best creations which could later be put on exhibition on a wider scale in other cities, like Mumbai and Chennai. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that more updated and latest methods of art propagation should be adopted. Elaborating further, he said, for example, in today’s time, an artist can use social media options to achieve worldwide reach for his creation even without booking a gallery hall or spending much money. Accompanied by artists Mahesh Sharma, Vijay Anand and Sanjay Sharma, the Minister discussed the theme and the colour technique with the respective artists. 

The various displays put up in the exhibition included abstract paintings with focus on essence of nature, figurative and realistic works representing the magnanimous landscape and paintings with bold palette nice strokes.

                The Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), Hyderabad and the  Central University of Jammu signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  in the presence of the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for  Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public  Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here  today. The MoU enables the two institutes to promote collaborative  academic, research and capacity-building initiatives for a period of  three years and thereafter subject to renewal.  

The MoU was signed by Shri Kalyan K. Roy, Registrar on behalf of ASCI  and Mohd. Iqbal, Registrar, Central University, Jammu. Also present on  the occasion were Shri R.H. Khwaja, Director General, ASCI and Prof.  Ashok Aima, Vice-Chancellor, Central University of Jammu. Secretary,  Department of Personnel & Training, Shri B.P. Sharma and Shri C.  Viswanath, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms & Public  Grievances and Secretary, Department of Pensions & Pensioners’  Welfare also witnessed the MoU signing ceremony. The MoU facilitates  joint activities and synergy in areas such as capacity building,  evaluation studies, executive education and related areas. This includes  activities such as design, development and delivery of teaching and  training programmes; reciprocal recognition of each other’s degrees,  diplomas, certificates etc; exchange of teaching staff and  students/participants for knowledge and experience-sharing and new  learning; policy advocacy and research studies; sharing of academic  materials, literature, publications etc; and knowledge events such as  conferences, seminars, workshops etc. 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said the MoU will send a  message to other Universities, especially in northern India, to build on  such partnerships which provide global exposure. At Independence there  were very few Universities, but now the issue is not accessibility but  quality of education, he said. In times of global synergy, you cannot  live in isolation, he added. Dr Jitendra Singh was later presented with a  book on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam by Shri Khwaja, DG, ASCI. Dr Jitendra Singh  recalled that a state-of-art resource centre, ‘Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam  Center for Policy Research and Analysis’ was formally launched in  October 2016 at the Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management (RGIIM),  Shillong in tribute to the former President. Other faculty members and  Senior Officers of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances &  Pensions were also during the MoU signing ceremony.

Guidelines have been issued to all the Ministries/Departments to set up an internal grievance redress machinery and nominate a Director of Public Grievances for ensuring proper action on grievances. The names of Director of Public Grievances are available on http://www.pgportal.gov.in. 
 
            Regular review meetings are held in the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances for monitoring pendency of grievances including grievances received in Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) through Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).  During the meetings, some of the disposed of cases are also reviewed on sample basis. Further, a Grievance Analysis Study has been conducted in respect of top 20 Ministries/Departments/Organizations receiving maximum number of grievances for identifying the root cause of major grievances and systemic reforms necessary to address them. The reports, based on review of grievances which have been disposed of or pending, have been duly circulated to the concerned Ministries/Departments. 
 
            The Grievance Redress Mechanism of the PMO was integrated with the online CPGRAMS in January, 2015.  As per data available in CPGRAMS relating to grievances lodged in PMO, the following number of grievances from very important persons and other applicants have been received and disposed:-
 
2015
Total Receipts:   725112         Disposal:  558247

2016 
Total Receipts:   1029523       Disposal:  752635
 
2017 (As on 29.01.2017)
Total Receipts: 92652             Disposal:   49196
 
This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Shri Ram Vichar Netam in the Rajya Sabha today.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the award of 31 contract areas as part of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Bid Round 2016. These fields were offered under new policy for small fields known as Discovered Small Field (DSF) policy, 2015, which offers improved fiscal terms with the aim to enhance Oil and gas production and reducing import dependency of the country.
 
These fields were offered through an open and transparent international competitive bidding process. The bidding was open to all, including National Oil Companies (i.e. ONGC & OIL) and other central and state PSUs.
 
Currently, there are 03 operational Exploration Blocks (Approximately 1461 sqkms)  under Production Sharing Contract System in Tamil Nadu where hydrocarbon exploration is going on. Under Nomination regime, 31 Mining leases (approximately 3500 sqkms) have been granted in the State from where 600 tonnes of Oil and 30 lakhs cubic meter of Natural Gas are produced per day.  Till date, more than 700 wells have been drilled for extraction of Oil and Gas in the Tamil Nadu. These active operations are not hampering agriculture in nearby areas and do not pose any known environmental impact or health hazards on living beings of the operational area.
 
The two contract areas, Karaikal (10.4 Sqkm) located in Puducherry and Neduvasal (10.0 Sqkm) located in Tamil Nadu awarded under DSF bidding round have an in-place volume of 4,30,000 metric tonne of oil and oil equivalent gas.
 
In the past weeks, some concerns have been raised over the impact of E&P activities proposed to be undertaken in these oil and gas fields on agriculture & soil condition in the region, contamination of ground water table, effect of Methane generation, etc.
 
Extraction of Oil and Gas from sub-surface is a well-established practice and the E&P industry uses state-of-the-art technology for the operations and takes maximum care for environmental effects. The operators also get Environment Impact Assessment done before carrying out any drilling activities and other activities.
 
Process of drilling and production requires very limited surface land area (generally 120X120 square meter) which will not affect agriculture or the soil of the entire lease area. Additionally, operators are required to follow strict environmental norms for the use of operational land.
Oil and gas extraction are being carried out from deeper earth area (generally > 1000m), and thus doesn’t affect ground water aquifers which are located at much shallower levels. Hydrocarbon extraction method is being used worldwide which has not seen any direct impact to water resources of the mining area. Also, while drilling for oil & gas, cement casing is used; hence, there is no impact on groundwater as such. As the principal component of Natural Gas, Methane is being used as house hold fuel globally in the form of PNG.
 
Others concerns about adverse environmental impact on nearby areas and the people living there are also misplaced, as all petroleum operations require prior environmental clearances from Ministry of Environmental and Forest, wherein public hearing is an integral part of obtaining these clearances.
 
As per the contract terms, these fields are to be put on production within three years from the date of Mining Lease (ML). Hydrocarbon production from these fields will result in several economic benefits to state and its people in the form of royalty, VAT, additional employment generation and economic development of the state. As per estimates, the two contract areas are expected to generate gross revenue of INR 300 Crore, royalty to State Government of INR 40 Crore and additional employment for about 500 persons.

                 The Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan is on an official visit to Myanmar to enhance regional cooperation in the Hydrocarbon sector with the neighbouring country. 

India and Myanmar have historical and close relations which have withstood the test of time. We both share a long land and maritime border. As an important element of our Look East Policy, India considers Myanmar as the friendship bridge to ASEAN countries. 

The visit of Shri Pradhan is a follow up of the visit of State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar to India in October, 2016. His visit is also the first Ministerial level visit between the two countries since October last and also first visit by Indian Petroleum Minister in the last 12 years. 

During the visit, Shri Pradhan met with his Myanmar counterpart H.E. U Pe Zin Tun, Union Minister of Electricity and Energy, Myanmar. He discussed issues of bilateral engagement in the hydrocarbon sector. In the Upstream sector, both leaders discussed the current and future participation of Indian Oil and Gas companies in the Upstream sector of Myanmar. Presently, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and GAIL have invested in gas producing blocks in Myanmar. OVL and Oil India Ltd have invested in exploratory blocks. The interest of Indian Upstream companies in participating in the forthcoming bid round in Myanmar was conveyed to Myanmar side. 

The Minister put forward various proposals on participation by the Indian Oil and Gas companies in the Mid-stream and Down-stream sector of Myanmar, including in refurbishment and upgradation of refineries in Myanmar, developing downstream market though supply of petroleum products, LPG, wax, petrochemicals, etc., integrating the Indian Natural Gas grid with Myanmar for developing their cities through CGD network and also in the area of sourcing LNG. Energy Minister Mr. U Pin Zin Tun expressed his keenness to deepen the relations and invited India to invest in all streams of Oil and Gas. Shri Pradhan visited the Shwe gas production facility in which OVL and GAIL have joint stake. He also extended proposals to assist Myanmar in training and capacity building its hydrocarbon officials. 

Both Ministers expressed their keenness to work towards further strengthening the bilateral engagements in the hydrocarbon sector and make it one of the important areas of bilateral cooperation between both the countries.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production
 
 
 
Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:
 
1.1        Crude oil production by ONGC during January, 2017 was 1916.25 TMT which is 5.07% lower than the monthly target but 4.63% higher when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 18545.34 TMT which is 1.83% lower than target for the period and 0.88% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
 
·       Delay in deployment of MOPU-Sagar Samrat. 
·       Delay in implementation of “Development of Western Periphery of MHS (ZC)” Project. 
·       Natural decline & increase in water cut in matured fields of Western Offshore.
 
1.2        Crude oil production by OIL during January, 2017 was 274.06 TMT which is 14.83% lower than monthly target but 5.26% higher than production in January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 2704.51 TMT which is 4.60% lower than target for the period and 0.24% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Greater Chandmari fields & Naharkatiya fields on account of rise in water cut and less than envisaged contribution from newly drilled wells. 
 
1.3        Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2017 was 885.10 TMT which is 3.42% lower than the monthly target and 6.33% lower than January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 8870.89 TMT which is 2.58% lower than target for the period and 7.24% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
 
·       RJ-ON-90/1: Liquid cut back in Mangala wells for rectification of 14"" MPT to CPF feed water line leak from 27-28 January, 2017. NI wells shutdown for 3-phase separator line modification on 27-28.01.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.
·       Natural Decline in Ravva & CB-OS/2.
·       Closure of 1 well in MA field in KG-DWN-98/3.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

 
 
2.1        Natural gas production by ONGC during January, 2017 was 1922.15 MMSCM which is 5.80% lower than the monthly target but 25.56% higher when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 18342.44 MMSCM which is 2.25% lower than the cumulative target but 3.03% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to decline in reservoir pressure in Bassein field and less production from Daman & C-26 Cluster due to evacuation constraint as export lines to TCPP platform are not yet completed.
 
2.2        Natural gas production by OIL during January, 2017 was 248.79 MMSCM which is 6.15% higher than the monthly target and 1.25% higher than January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 2460.35 MMSCM which is 1.38% lower than the cumulative target but 4% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. 
 
2.3        Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2017 was 567.43 MMSCM which is 26.71% lower than the monthly target and 15.41% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 5820.97 MMSCM which is 16.15% lower than the cumulative target and 16.55% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
 
·       Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3.
·       Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block extended dewatering hampering production in Raniganj East CBM block.
·       Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.
·       RJ-ON-90/1: Liquid cut back in Mangala wells for rectification of 14"" MPT to CPF feed water line leak on 27-28.01.2017. NI wells shutdown for 3-phase separator line modification on 27-28.01.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam etc. 
·       RJ-ON/6: Increase in Water cut in few wells.
 
Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)
 
3        Refinery production during January, 2017 was 21108.06 TMT which is 0.22% higher than the target for the month but 1.52% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative production during April, 2016-January, 2017 was 204994.09 TMT which is 1.96% higher than the target for the period and 6.78% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - January, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production 

 
3.1     PSU Refineries’ production during January, 2017 was 11760.82 TMT which is 1.57% lower than the target for the month and 2.90% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 114517.58 TMT which is 0.99% higher than the target for the period and 10.04% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:
·       IOCL, Gujarat: Planned shutdown from Dec’16 to Jan’17wherein the replacement catalyst failed & new catalyst had to be procured. 
·       IOCL, Paradip:  Throughput is lower due to coke upliftment issue. 
·       IOCL, Haldia:  Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up.
·       IOCL, Digboi / Guwahati: Lower availability of Assam crude. 
·       BPCL, Mumbai: Throughput lower than target due to failure of DHDS- RGC motor
·       BPCL, Kochi: Throughput lower than target due to total power failure on 10.01.2017.
·       MRPL, Mangalore: Throughput lower due to load restrictions in CDU -1 heater and CDU-3 Vacuum heater.
3.2    Production in JV refineries during January, 2017 was 1519.98 TMT which is 15.06% higher than the target for the month and 7.09% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 14216.89 TMT which is 11% higher than the target for the period but 0.85% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. 
3.3    Production in private refineries during January, 2017 was 7827.26 TMT which is 0.44% higher than the target for the month but 0.96% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 76259.62 TMT which is 1.87% higher than the target for the period and 3.66% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.
3.4    Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - January, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2015 - January, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.

Special drive initiated to expedite process of handing over ROs to such candidates
 
Approx 600 ROs identified across country; Drive likely to benefit 500 SC/ST candidates, widows amongst others
 
Minister  of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan  reviewed the existing policy concerning allotment of Retail Outlets to  candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe communities.   
The  Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)IOCL, BPCL and HPCL have a laid-down  policy for promoting social inclusion and economic empowerment of the  weaker sections of the society.  As  part of the strategy, the OMCs allocate 22.5% of the new Retail Outlets  in favour of candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe  communities.  Apart from such  regular allotments, the OMCs also have a well laid-down framework for  allotting existing Retail Outlets to candidates belonging to Scheduled  Caste/Scheduled Tribe communities.  It is done through divestment of company owned temporary Retail Outlets. 
It was observed that there was a huge shortfall with respect to meeting the social commitments of the OMCs.  In  accordance with the directives issued, the OMCs have initiated a  concerted effort on procuring land from various State governments.  The  land obtained from State governments will be exclusively used for  facilitating establishment of Retail Outlets by the SC/ST candidates.   
Shri  Pradhan has also directed the OMCs to expedite selection process of  SC/ST locations advertised in 2014 -15. For SC/ST applicants, additional  time has been allowed to the applicants to submit land to the OMCs for  consideration of their applications for RO. 
It  was also observed that there was a large number of Letter of Intent  (LoI) holders who were awaiting allotment of Retail Outlets which is  primarily done by divesting the temporary company owned Retail Outlets.  The LoI holders since 2004, belonging to SC/ST community were also awaiting such allotment.  A special drive has been initiated to expedite the process of handing over Retail Outlets to such candidates. 
As part of this initiative/special drive, approximately 600 such Retail Outlets have been identified across the country.  The  process of allotment has been initiated in a transparent manner by  putting in the public domain the details of LoI holders as well as the  details of the Retail Outlets which are to be divested.  The process is likely to be completed by 31.03.2017.  It is likely to benefit more than 500 SC/ST candidates, widows and unmarried women (above 40 years) without earning parents.  This will provide necessary employment opportunity along with economic empowerment.

 The Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Rajya  Sabha in a written reply today that as part of Phase I of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) programme, SPR facilities are at  three locations viz. Vishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total  capacity of 5.33 MMT. On 25 January 2017, the Definitive Agreement on  Oil Storage and Management was signed between Indian Strategic Petroleum  Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) of UAE  for filling up one of the two caverns at Mangalore SPR facility. The  other cavern at Mangalore has already been filled by Government. He also informed that the  Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) which is the SPV for  construction of SPR facilities invited preliminary Expression of  Interest (EoI) from reputed international parties for filling up of  Padur SPR facility. 
 Shri Pradhan informed in his reply that there is 63 days of existing storage based on estimated commercial reserve of crude oil, petroleum products and gas.  The total 5.33 MMT reserve of Phase-I of the SPR programme is currently  estimated to supply approximately 10.5 days of India’s crude  requirement according to the consumption during 2015-16.

                The Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Lok Sabha in a written reply today that implementation of PAHAL has resulted in identification of 3.34 crore and 3.56 crore ghost/fake/duplicate accounts during Financial Year 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. The total subsidy / under recovery on domestic LPG during the financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16 was Rs. 40569 crore and Rs 16074 crore, respectively.  Lower subsidy during the last year is due to various factors, including introduction of direct transfer of subsidies into the accounts of consumers (PAHAL Scheme) and fall in international crude oil prices.
 
As on 29.01.2017, 1,05,46,090 LPG consumers have voluntarily given up/ surrendered their LPG subsidy. Government has also issued a circular stating that the benefit of the LPG subsidy will not be admissible for the LPG consumers, if the consumer or his wife/her spouse had taxable income of Rs. 10 lakh and above during the previous financial year computed as per the income Tax Act 1961.

Bio- Remidiation technology deployed to manage oil spill at Chennai Port 
  

On  the advice of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of  India, Indian Oil’s R&D Centre is taking action in the containment  of the oil spill that occurred near Ennore Port at Chennai recently,  where two ships had collided. 
The R&D Centre has deployed an effective and non-hazardous bio-remediation process named Oilivorous-STM which was developed by the Centre to deal with such onshore oil spills.  The  technology involves use of identified microbes, which when administered  to the oil spills with specific nutrients, eat away the oil and sludge,  leaving the soil completely oil-free and harmless.  In  the past, this technology was successfully employed to remediate oil  spills that occurred on Mumbai coast in the year 2010 due to collision  between two ships. 
On  advice from the Ministry, two expert scientists from Indian Oil’s  R&D Centre were sent to coordinate with the local agencies  ie  Ennore Port Trust and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to effectively  deal with the spillage through the bio-remediation process. The  requisite quantity of identified microbes and nutrients prepared at the  R&D Centre have already been air-lifted and positioned at the  treatment site. 
A  pit of size 15 metres x 200 metres x 1 foot is under preparation at an  identified location at Kamarajar port. Work is underway to treat the  recovered oil and sludge from the spill. It is expected that, with this  treatment, the recovered oil sludge will be completely bio-remediated  within a span of 6 to 10 weeks.

The Government of India and the State of Sikkim signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under the Scheme Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) today, for operational improvement of the State’s Power Distribution Department. With the signing of MoU, the total number of States covered under UDAY has reached twenty-two. Sikkim would derive an Overall Net Benefit of approximately Rs. 356 crores through UDAY by way of cheaper funds, reduction in AT&C and transmission losses, interventions in energy efficiency, etc. during the period of turnaround.
The MoU paves way for improving operational efficiency of the Power Distribution department of the State. AT&C losses and transmission losses would be brought down through compulsory distribution transformer metering, consumer indexing & GIS mapping of losses, upgrade/change transformers, meters etc., smart metering of high-end consumers, feeder audit etc., besides eliminating the gap between cost of supply of power and realisation. The reduction in AT&C losses and transmission losses to 15% and 3.50% respectively is likely to bring additional revenue of around Rs. 328 crores.
Demand Side interventions in UDAY such as usage of energy-efficient LED bulbs, agricultural pumps, fans & air-conditioners and efficient industrial equipment through PAT (Perform, Achieve, Trade) would help in reducing peak load, flatten load curve and thus help in reducing energy consumption in the State of Sikkim. The gain is expected to be around Rs.25 crores.
While efforts will be made by the Power Distribution Department of the State to improve their operational efficiency, and thereby reduce the cost of supply of power, the Central government would also provide incentives to the State Government for improving Power infrastructure in the State and for further lowering the cost of power. The Central schemes such as DDUGJY, IPDS, Power Sector Development Fund (PSDF) or such other schemes of Ministry of Power and Ministry of New & Renewable Energy are already providing funds for improving Power Infrastructure in the State and additional/priority funding would be considered under these schemes, if the State/DISCOMs meet the operational milestones outlined in the scheme. Further, with improved efficiency, the State Power department would be in a better position to borrow funds at cheaper rates for Power infrastructure development/improvement in the State.
The ultimate benefit of signing the MOU would go to the people of Sikkim. Reduced levels of transmission and AT&C losses would mean lesser cost per unit of electricity to consumers. Further, financially and operationally healthy State Power Distribution department would be in a position to supply more power. Higher demand for power would mean higher PLF of generating units and therefore, lesser cost per unit of electricity which would again mean lesser cost per unit of electricity to the consumers. The scheme would also allow speedy availability of cheaper power to households in the State that are still without electricity. Availability of 24*7 power to hitherto unconnected villages/households etc. would boost the economy, provide more employment opportunities for the people of the State and thereby, improve the standard of living of the people of the State.

The Consultative Committee attached to Ministries of Power and New &  Renewable Energy met here yesterday evening under the chairmanship of  Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable and  Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal . The committee reviewed the functioning of  NHPC Limited and Small Hydro Power. 

The Consultative Committee meeting started with a presentation on NHPC  by its Chairman and Managing Director, Shri K.M. Singh. The presentation  outlined the evolution of NHPC since 1975, achievement of Mini Ratna  status in 2008, its listing on NSE and BSE in 2009 and performance of  financial parameters, the challenges ahead and the way forward. 

All members congratulated the Government and the Ministry of Power on  the efforts being made on the front of ensuring 24x7 Power for All and  the role played by the net profit making PSU NHPC Ltd in this mission.  Members gave their valuable suggestions to further improve the  efficiency and viability of thermal and solar power projects being set  up by NHPC as a step towards diversification of its portfolio. Some  members suggested that the quality of power distribution infrastructure  needs to be monitored and accountability needs to be fixed on the ground  level so as to prevent corrupt practices and ensure that there is last  mile coverage of beneficiaries. 

Responding to the suggestions and queries raised by the Consultative  Committee members, Shri Piyush Goyal directed the officials of the Power  Ministry to make available all the details of funds sanctioned and  disbursed to State Governments and the status of project implementation  to all the Members of the Committee. It would help create accountability  on the part of the States, he added. Shri Goyal assured Hon’ble Members  that their valuable suggestions would be adopted by the Ministry &  NHPC. 

The second half of the meeting consisted of the Presentation on the  Small Hydro Power (SHP) development programme in India, under the  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).

ABOUT SLNP
Prime Minister Shri Naremdra Modi, has launched the Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) on 5th January, 2015 to attain significant savings by promoting LED based lighting. The scheme is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture company of four Public Sector Undertakings under the Ministry of Power. There is no element of Government of India subsidy in the scheme. EESL has evolved a service model to enable municipalities to replace conventional lights with LEDs at no upfront cost. The resultant reduction in Energy and maintenance cost of the municipality is used  to repay  EESL over a period of time. The target is to  install 3.5 crore LED street.
lights in all the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) of the country by March, 2019, which will result in avoided capacity generation of 1500 MW and save 9 billion KWh per year. The benefits likely to be accrued to the country as a result of implementation of SLNP programme is as follows:

Union Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal while addressing the media here today, said that the allocations have been increased for social sectors across the board including affordable housing, infrastructure, rural development.
 
Further, the Minister added that the Budget 2017-18 promotes the ‘Make in India’ mission by correcting inverted duty structure in many areas the budget and has provided impetus to transformative changes happening in the Ministry of Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines. Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises are back bone of the sector and have been made competitive with reduction of Corporate Tax to 25% up to turnover of Rs. 50 crores, he added. 
 
In the New & Renewable Energy Sector, Shri Goyal informed that the Budget has affirmed target for Solar Power of additional 20,000 MW capacity during next year. Further, the budget has provided renewed thrust on renewables, with 
·         Removal/ reduction of customs/ excise duty on Solar tempered glass 
·         Reduction of Customs duties on various raw materials would further bring down the cost of clean energy
·         Railways to contribute to solar energy by powering 7,000 stations through solar power
 
Regarding the allocation for Ministry of Power, Shri Goyal said that it has been increased by 33% to Rs 13,881 crores, due to major thrust on flagship rural electrification scheme Deen Dayal Upadhayaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The allocation for this scheme has been increased by 44% from Rs. 3,350 crores to Rs 4,814 crores, while the contribution to urban areas scheme Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) has been increased by 29% from Rs 4,524 crores to Rs 5,821 crores. The Budget document has confirmed that “We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by 1st May 2018”, Shri Goyal added.
 
In the Coal and Mines sector, Shri Goyal said that the Budget lays special emphasis on conservation, safety and infrastructure in coal mines. A number of steps taken are as follows:
·         Allocation for Ministry of Coal increased by 34% from Rs 556 crore to Rs 745 crore
·         Allocation for Ministry of Mines increased by 12% from Rs 1,083 crore to Rs 1,213 crore
·         Conservation, Safety and Infrastructure Development in Coal Mines increased by 43% from Rs 350 crore to Rs 500 crore
·         To benefit domestic aluminium manufacturers, export duty on other aluminium ores including laterite has been imposed at 15%.
·          
Talking about the huge boost provided in the Budget to domestic LED companies, Shri Goyal counted a number of steps taken, which are:
·         Customs duties reduced for parts to promote domestic value addition
·         The budget has provided for reduction in Basic Customs Duty (BCD) from 10% to 5% for all parts used to manufacture LED luminaries, drivers etc. Thereby promoting domestic value addition
·         On importing semi-finished inputs for LEDs that includes driver assembly and other such products, BCD of 5% is levied. This will make the LED products of those manufacturers who assemble the LEDs in India cheaper whereas those who are importing semi-finished products would witness increase in costs
·         Excise duties on all parts used in the manufacture of LED lights or fixtures reduced to promote domestic manufacturing

Fairy Queen locomotive
 
The locomotive was constructed by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson at Leeds, in England, in 1855, and reached Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, in the same year. On arrival, it was given fleet number ""22"" by its owner, the East Indian Railway Company, not receiving a name until 1895. Initially, the 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) gauge locomotive was used to haul light mail trains in West Bengal, operating between Howrah and Raniganj, and during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 hauled troop trains. It was later consigned to line construction duty in Bihar, where it served until 1909.

It was restored and given a special spot in the newly built National Rail Museum at Chanakyapuri, in New Delhi which was opened to public 40 years back on 1st February, 1977. The locomotive was restored to full working order in 1997, in preparation for its first mainline journey in 88 years and its return to commercial service on 18 July. It was certified by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the world's oldest steam locomotive in regular operation. The following year, the train received a National Tourism Award for the most innovative and unique tourism project from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India.

                A pilot project of deployment of doctors in Duronto Trains was  undertaken for a period of two years. During the Pilot Project, it was  noted that serious patient could not be treated on board and had to be  de-trained for medical treatment at a hospital only because the medical  equipments, such as ECG machines etc. do not function properly on the  trains due to noise/ vibration etc. Further, First Aid Boxes containing  essential drugs and dressing materials are provided with the guards of  all passenger carrying trains. In addition, Augmented First Aid Boxes  with wide range of medicines, disposable medical material, etc. have  been provided with the Train Superintendents/ Guards of  Rajdhani/Shatabdi Express trains and some nominated trains. Front line  staffs deployed on trains are also trained in rendering First Aid. The  Station Masters of all stations have details of doctors, clinics and  hospitals, both Government and Private, in the vicinity of the station,  so that their services could also be availed, in emergencies. Ambulance  services of both Railway hospitals and State Governments are utilized  when required.

                Occupancy  of the trains varies during peak, non-peak, festivals seasons, special  occasions and weekends etc. Therefore, sometimes the trains run with  higher occupancy (more than the berth potential) and sometimes during  non-peak times some berths remain vacant. Therefore, loss due to vacant  berths in trains cannot be quantified. However, the average occupancy of  all reserved accommodation on Indian Railways during 2015-2016 was 101%  which has gone upto 102% in 2016-17 upto December, 2016. 
           Some passengers plan their journey at last moment and have the option  to travel through different modes of transport. Therefore, to promote  such passengers to avail train services in which berths are vacant after  the preparation of first chart, w.e.f. 01.01.2017, 10% rebate in basic  fare on vacant berths/seats after preparation of first chart is given in  the reserved class of all trains. 
           W.e.f. 20.12.2016, 10% rebate in basic fare on vacant berths/seats  after preparation of first chart is given in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and  Duronto trains on an experimental basis for six months. No assessment  has been made till date. 
           Apart from above, w.e.f. 20.12.2016 discounted fare has been offered  for the passengers of Jaipur-Ajmer and Ajmer-Jaipur in 12015/12016 New  Delhi-Ajmer Shatabdi Express and for the passengers of Bengaluru  City-Mysuru and Mysuru- Bengaluru City in 12007/12008 Chennai  Central-Mysuru Shatabdi Express.

It is the  endeavour of  Railways to eliminate all unmanned level crossings(UMLCs) in a phased manner  by either of the following:
·           Closure – Closing unmanned level crossings having NIL/Negligible Train Vehicle Unit (TVU).
·           Merger – Merger of unmanned level crossing gate to nearby manned or unmanned gates or subway or Road Under Bridge (RUB) or Road Over Bridge (ROB) by construction of diversion road. 
·           Provision of Subways/ RUBs
·           Manning – Phased manning of unmanned level crossings which cannot be  eliminated by above means.  
            Ministry of Railways has announced a specific sub-mission to eliminate all unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge in next 3-4 years.
Research Designs and Standards Organization (RDSO) is developing vandal proof rugged Train approach based warning system for unmanned L.C. Gates in association with IIT/Kanpur and Space Application Centre /Ahmedabad. Besides, various measures taken by Indian Railways to prevent accidents at unmanned level crossings are as under:
·           Social awareness campaigns to educate road users with the use of various print and electronic media for observance of safe practices prescribed in Motor Vehicle Act and Indian Railways Act and joint ambush checks along with civil police to counter misadventure in front of approaching trains. 
·           SMS Campaigns to create awareness amongst road users.
·           Zonal Railways have also been advised to deploy Gate Mitras/Gate Counselors at identified vulnerable unmanned level crossings to counsel the road vehicles users for observance of safe practice while negotiating unmanned level crossings.
 
Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continual basis including upgradation of technology to prevent accidents and to enhance safety. These include complete track circuiting of stations, Axle Counter for Automatic clearance  of  Block Section Counters (BPAC), Electrical/Electronic Interlocking System, Interlocking of Level Crossing Gates, Auxiliary Warning System (AWS), Vigilance Control Device (VCD) in locomotives, Colour Light LED Signals,  Train Protection Warning System (TPWS), Train Collision Avoidance System(TCAS),  Fog Safe Device (FSD), use of 60kg rails and Pre-stressed Concrete Sleepers, long rail panels, better welding technology in the tracks,  digital types of machines for Ultrasonic Flaw Detection (USFD), electronic monitoring of tracks using Track Recording Cars (TRC) and portable Oscillation Monitoring System (OMS), progressive use of Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, Centre Buffer Couplers in Integral Coach Factory (ICF) design coaches, Remote Monitoring and Management of  Locomotives and Trains (REMMLOT), Air Conditioning (AC) of locomotive cabs, Installation of video/voice recording system on locomotives.
Enhancement in technology in Indian Railways is a continuous process. The above mentioned technologies are being proliferated in Indian Railways progressively depending upon codal life of equipments and availability of resources, traffic density of routes etc.

Indian Railways intends to redevelop ‘A-1’ and ‘A’ category stations on ‘as is where is’ basis, by inviting proposals from developers with their designs and business ideas.  The facilities envisaged in redeveloped stations, inter alia, include improvement to approach infrastructure and segregation of arrival and departure of passengers which shall help in reducing congestion at stations and their approaches.
Countries like Belgium, China, France, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea have shown interest in participating in the redevelopment of railway stations in India.
Station redevelopment projects are intrinsically complex in nature and require detailed techno-economic feasibility studies to work out the cost.  Therefore, cost of station redevelopment cannot be indicated at this stage.

With a view to further promoting cashless transaction, it has been decided to install 10,000 Point of Sale (POS) machines in association with State Bank of India at various locations of Indian Railways in the following order of priority :- 
1.      PRS locations 
2.      UTS locations at suburban stations
3.      Parcel/Goods locations where cash is accepted
4.      Other UTS locations
 
As the POS machines are GPRS-based, the communication system of Railways is not required for operation of these machines.
 
This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on 03.02.2017 (Friday).

An  expert committee was constituted by Ministry of Road  Transport and Highways to review the format for reporting of road  accidents.  The committee headed by Senior Adviser of the   Transport Research Wing  and consisting of experts from IIT Delhi, IIT Kharagpur, WHO, senior officers from the Police and Transport Departments  of States, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, submitted its recommendations, which have also been accepted by Ministry of  Road Transport and Highways.
 
Briefing the media in the capital today, Mrs Kirti Saxena, Senior Adviser of Transport Research Wing  and Chairperson of the  committee said that  FIRs at police station suffer from under reporting of data from the accident site, which are therefore inaccurate and incomplete.  She informed that the committee  met  a number of times to look into the weaknesses of the existing format for reporting accidents.  After studying  the way  accidents are reported in various states and also in other countries, the new format was recommended to the Ministry.  She also  stated that the main role would be that of the police for whom workshops would have to be held.   
 
Prof. Geetam Tiwari from IIT Delhi  and member of the committee  elaborated on the salient features of the new format.   She informed that at present reports are collected from police stations and State Governments send their report to the Centre. She expressed the hope that the new format would fill in gaps in reporting of accidents by minimizing subjectivity.
 
Prof. Sudeshna Mitra of IIT  Kharagpur and  member of the committee said that recording of the accident site will play  crucial role  in the task of reporting.  She added that the GPS detail will enable to understand the road design at site.  Besides, vehicle analysis and also person related details would help in analyzing the accidents. 
 
The recording of accident data is done in FIRs at police stations. These records are liable to be subjective as the police personnel fill it up according to their understanding and assign reasons for accidents as per their  interpretation. There are apprehensions that due to limited technical understanding, the police persons recording the data are not able to recognize the role of road engineering defects, the nature of impacting vehicles and other such technical details that may have caused the accident. As a result, these aspects that are so vital for ensuring road safety but remain unreported or under reported. 
 
After a series of deliberations the committee has developed a uniform accident Recording Format to be adopted by the police in all states and UTs.  The accident Recording Form has five sections designed to capture all relevant information like accident identification/location, road condition, vehicles involved and victim details. Section A contains accident identification details like location, vehicle type etc. Section B captures road conditions and features like culvert, gradient, pothole etc. Section C would capture details about vehicle – both motorized and non motorized, overloading etc. Section D would capture traffic violations by drivers and Section E would capture details about persons other than drivers involved in the accident. The form is simple and would be easy for the police persons at thana levels to understand and fill up. It also minimizes subjective elements.
 
In addition to the above, the committee has also developed  a set of corresponding annual road accident data Reporting Format consisting of 17 forms in which the states/ UTs would be required to furnish the annual road accident data to TRW of the Ministry within one month of the completion of a calendar year.
 
This development is important as the data forms the basis for analyzing the cause of accidents, identifying black spots  and taking corrective steps to eliminate the same. This is also the data that gets compiled by the Transport Research Wing of the Ministry in its annual publication Road Accidents in India.  Over a period of time the data will reveal patterns which will provide solutions and enable action to be taken.

The Minister of Road Transport &  Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin  Gadkari has welcomed the thrust accorded by the Union Budget 2017-18, to  multi modal transport planning and   synergizing  investments in  railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. Terming the budget as   revolutionary, Shri Gadkari said that development of multi-modal  transport hubs would help ease traffic congestion to a large extent and  also bring down pollution. 

The Budget 2017-18 has made a provision of Rs 2,41,381 Crores for the   transport sector as a whole. This includes rail, roads and shipping.  It  is expected that an effective multi modal logistics and transport  sector will make the economy more competitive. Work is already being  done to develop a programme for building  multi-modal logistics parks,  together with multi modal transport facilities.  

The Budget allocation for Highways has gone up from Rs 57,976 crores in  BE 2016-17 to Rs 64,900 crores in 2017-18. 2,000 kms of coastal  connectivity roads have been identified for construction and  development. This will facilitate better connectivity with ports and  remote villages. 

For the Shipping Ministry the allocation has gone up from Rs 1531 crores  in BE 2016-17 to Rs 1773 Crores . Rs 600 crores have been allocated for  Sagarmala programme. 

Shri Gadkari has also expressed hope that tax exemption  on Masala Bonds  will help mobilize more investments. He also lauded  the top priority  accorded by the Budget to the growth of Agriculture and Rural sectors,  and to the weeding out of corruption and black money.

The  Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr. Harsh  Vardhan released the Special Edition of “Atlas for Visually Impaired  (India)” in English Braille today in New Delhi.  This Braille Atlas has  been prepared by National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation  (NATMO) under Department of Science & Technology.
The Minister expressed happiness at the production of these  Atlases.  He said these atlases will be distributed to various schools  across the country for educating the students with visual challenges.
Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that all departments of Government will work  to implement this.  Efforts are being made to make these atlases more  cost effective than the current price of Rs.600/- per atlas with 20 maps  now.  Silk screen printing used to prepare these atlases is unique to  India, he added.
In the Braille Atlas, maps are raised and embossed with simple  lines and point symbols to facilitate its users to realize the location  and area coverage easily distinguishable in terms of shapes and  textures.  The legend and reference is placed on the map in Braille  script to navigate the map.  About 20 maps on different themes of  physical, socio-economic and cultural aspects such as river system,  natural vegetation, Metropolitan cities, Roads and Railways, Food crops  and cash crops have been incorporated in the atlas with write-ups on  every map as ready reference.  This Atlas has been bestowed with  National award for S&T intervention in empowering the physically  challenged by the Prime Minister on 3rd January, 2017 in Indian Science  Congress held in Tirupati.
NATMO has recently walked ahead to prepare Braille atlases for  visually impaired persons.  NATMO’s long effort from metallic tactile  maps to silk-screen printing technology to prepare a full volume of  atlas is perhaps unique in the World.  NATMO’s aim is to transmit  scientific information in the form of maps and atlases in a  cost-effective manner, as more than 50 lakh visually challenged citizens  of our country are mainly from low-income group. Till date their  knowledge is constrained within books and literatures.  Enriched with  this experience, they will be able to understand the Indian geographical  contours and will be empowered with wealth of knowledge.
National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation (NATMO) is the  premier agency of applied Geo-Spatial technology and pioneer in Thematic  Mapping and Atlas Cartography under Department of Science &  Technology(Ministry of Science & Technology) engaged in preparing  different thematic maps and atlases and other documents on national,  state, district, block level and many other monograms.   The  contribution made by NATMO in developing the thematic maps/ data is  being regularly used by the decision makers in the entire country at  districts and sub-divisions levels for implementing the developmental  schemes as well as by the researchers, students and common people.

                Two vessels namely, M.T. BW MAPLE and M.T. DAWN KANCHIPURAM while crossing each other collided at 03.45AM on 28th January, 2017 outside the Kamrajar harbour.  The Oil Tanker, M.T. DAWN KANCHIPURAM, which was carrying 32813 Tonnes of POL, suffered a rupture which led to engine oil spill (and not the POL being carried as cargo).  There was no casualty or injury to the crew members. 
Kamarajar Port had immediately deployed oil boom around the vessel after bringing it to a safe location at 07.00 AM on 28th January, 2017 to contain seepage if any.  No further seepage was discovered.  The situation was closely monitored by top officials of the Port from the time of accident and the required assistance was rendered to both vessels. Since the oil tanker M.T. Kanchipuram was loaded with a huge amount of POL cargo, it was critical to ensure that this vessel is safely berthed and its cargo discharged to obviate the possibility of any further catastrophic accident and a major oil spill.  
Immediate steps were taken to assess the damage to the vessel. The diving team of Kamarajar Port carried out under-water inspections. The port officials consulted the respective Classification Societies and DG, Shipping officials who carried out inspection of the vessels internally and externally.  After examining the stability of the vessel, it was decided to berth the M.T. Kanchipuram at the port to immediately discharge cargo to prevent any environmental damage.  The Kamarajar Port carefully brought this vessel to the port which was a very challenging task since the main engine of the vessel was not in operation and the berthing movement had to be carried out as a cold move. This major step averted the possibility of a major oil spill disaster.  This vessel has now completely discharged the POL cargo. 
The National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan provides that while the port is responsible for responding to an oil spill within the port area, the Coast Guard is responsible for acting as the Central Coordinating Agency for combating oil pollution in the maritime zone and the State Governments are responsible for shore line response.  Equipment required to handle Tier-1 Oil Spill Response was available with the Kamarajar Port and was also deployed.  
The Coast Guard was informed by 06.15 AM on 28.01.2017 soon after the collision of the incident by the Kamarajar Port.  The Coast Guard deployed their ships and helicopters by 07.15 AM on the same date to survey and keep a watch on the oil spill.  
As soon as the oil leak was tracked, the Coast Guard started mobilizing equipment and manpower for clean-up at various locations and coordinated these operations. A massive clean-up operation was launched in Tiruvallur, Chennai and Kancheepuram Districts by engaging more than 2000 persons at various sites including Ernavur, Chennai Fishing Harbour, Marine Beach, Besant Nagar, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai and Injambakkam beaches.  The Coast Guard has been coordinating the cleaning operations jointly with personnel from the Chennai Port and Kamarajar Port, the State Government and its agencies, Indian Oil Corporation, NGOs, Cadet Trainees from maritime educational institutions, student volunteers and fishermen. Groups were formed and cleaning work was undertaken at different places of the shoreline.
Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan Minister of State for Shipping visited the accident site on 30th January, 2017 and inspected the area where the vessels were anchored and gave directions to the Kamarajar Port to keep a close watch on the situation. Additional Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Joint Secretary (Ports), Ministry of Shipping, and Additional D.G. Shipping were sent for an on the spot inspection of the affected areas and to coordinate and review the oil spillage cleaning operations.  They also met the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Tamil Nadu who has also held review meetings and is regularly monitoring the remedial measures being taken. The District administration is actively involved in the clean-up operations.  The Chennai Port and Kamarajar Port have set up Control Rooms. Kamarajar Port has Tier-I Oil Spill Response Equipment, which was deployed by the Port. National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, an autonomous centre of MoEF&CC, has been engaged by Kamarajar Port to study the impact on the environment.  
At Ernavur, which had the maximum drift of sludge, booms have been deployed along the shore line to contain the oil spread. More than 1000 people were deployed here with portable pollution cleaning equipment for shore line cleaning.  The required logistics and equipment support has been provided by the Chennai and Kamarajar Ports.  Sufficient gum boots, gloves, buckets, mugs, liquid hand wash and drums have been provided to facilitate manual cleaning.  In addition, 3 Super Suckers and submersible pumps have also been deployed to remove the oil spill. Coast Guard has also sprayed Oil Spill Dispersants for removal of oil slick. ICGS Varad with TC-3 and Oil Spill Dispersant (OSD) sailed out and neutralized remaining Oil slick near Chennai Lighthouse.
The total quantity of sludge (mixture of oil, water, ocean material etc.) which was removed till 2nd February,2017 was 65 tonnes.  In addition, Super Suckers had removed 54 tonnes which contained 70% water. On 3rd February, 2017 about 21.1 tonnes of additional sludge was removed from Ernavoor. Sludges at R.K. Nagar 3.40 tonnes, Marina 7.50 tonnes, Sakthi Nagar & Gandhi Nagar 5.40 tonnes, Elliot 0.62 tonnes were recovered.  This quantity includes water and sand also. It is observed that there is a vast difference between quantity of oil spilled and sludge recovered due to the fact that the oil gets coagulated and becomes puffy when it is mixed with water, sand etc.  More than 90% of the work has been completed and most of the residual work is expected to be completed in a couple of days.  
Chennai Port and State Govt. have organized medical camps from 31st January,2017  at Ernavoor and Kasimedu fisheries harbour.
The Indian Oil Corporation has provided special bio-remediation material for treatment of the collected oil sludge for its safe disposal. HPCL has arranged for Trailers and manpower for transporting collected sludge to Kamarajar Port area for bioremediation treatment under the expert guidance of IOC R&D experts where 2000 Sq.M. pit has been created for the purpose.  The bioremediation will be undertaken by IOCL under supervision of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board which will be completed within six to eight weeks
The Coast Guard ship and helicopters are carrying out regular sorties for continuous monitoring of oil slick. If oil spillage accumulation is spotted anywhere, manpower and material under the overall supervision of Coast Guard will be deployed.       
Directorate General of Shipping has instituted a statutory inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act to ascertain the causes and contributory factors that led to the accident. Both the ships have been restrained from leaving the Port. D.G. Shipping is also holding discussions with the owners of the ships and the mechanism of distribution of compensation and payment of claims by the insurers will be shortly in place.  The P&I insurers of M.T. DAWN KANCHIPURAM are in the process of establishing a local ‘Claims Desk’ and specifying the procedures for submitting and handling claims.  The representative from the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (a specialised international agency on ‘Oil Spill Response’ – arranged by the owner / P&I insurers of M.T. DAWN KANCHIPURAM is already in Chennai.
Government is taking all the measures to manage the situation. Authorities involved in the operations are confident that the situation is under control and the entire cleaning up operation will be completed in a couple of days. Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan, Minister of State for Shipping is in Chennai today to take stock of the situation.

The Ministry of Shipping, as a part of its ‘Green Port Initiative’ has been emphasizing on use of renewable sources of energy to power Major Ports across the nation. The Ministry aims to set up 91.50 MW of solar energy capacity at the twelve Major Ports and 45 MW of wind energy capacity by the two Major Ports of Kandla and V. O. Chidambaranar. Major Ports have started the process of setting-up renewable energy projects by investing Rs.704.52 crores (Solar–Rs. 412.02 Cr and Wind–Rs. 292.50 Cr) in these projects.
When completed, these renewable energy projects will help in the reduction of carbon dioxide emission by 136,500 MT annually. These projects will also help to reduce cost of power purchased by utilization of renewable energy for power generation, resulting in estimated saving of Rs 75 crores annually, when fully commissioned.
The wind energy projects will be executed by two Major Ports namely Kandla Port and V.O. Chidambaranar Port. The total capacity of the wind energy projects is 45 MW out of which 6 MW has already been commissioned by Kandla Port.
A total of 15.20 MW of solar projects has also been commissioned with Visakhapatnam Port leading the way with 9 MW, while the other ports in which solar projects have been commissioned are Kolkata Port (0.06 MW), New Mangalore Port (4.35 MW), V.O. Chidambaranar Port(0.5 MW), Mumbai Port (0.125 MW), Chennai Port(0.1 MW), Mormugao(0.24 MW) & JNPT(0.82 MW). The remaining solar power projects will be commissioned phase wise and is expected to be completed by 2018.
It may be recalled that a MoU was signed between Indian Ports Association (IPA) and Solar Energy Corporation of India on the 15th of October, 2015 for the development of solar power projects at Major Ports. This is a new initiative by Major Ports which has been taken in line with the ‘Green Port Initiative’ policy of the Government of India.

                 Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh has directed that a High-level Coordination Committee comprising CMDs and top Ministry officials be constituted for pooling and sharing of resources among PSUs. He said, “This will lead to aggregation of demand and economies of scale among the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under the administrative control of the Ministry. Formation of such a mechanism and committee would minimize areas of overlap, duplication & communication gaps and help in harnessing the potential for financial savings. In today’s fast-paced business world, it is essential to work together to retain the competitive edge.”  The idea emerged from a comprehensive joint review meeting held recently, which was chaired by the Steel Minister.
 
The objective of the Committee is to derive benefits of economies of scale by pooling of resources, as also sharing of best practices. ‘Terms of Reference’ of the Committee will, inter-alia, include :
·         Common procurement portal using MSTC Metal Mandi (M3)
·         Common marketing and distribution/storage facilities
·         Common R&D facilities & projects under SRTMI
·         Common Employee Welfare issues
·         Common Consultancy
·         Payment Settlement mechanism among MoS CPSEs.
·         Common platform for knowledge sharing
 
Shri Chaudhary Birender Singh has issued instructions for immediate action to be taken on formalising a mechanism of coordination among PSUs, which include industry leaders like SAIL, NMDC, RINL, MOIL, MSTC and MECON. AS&FA, MoS will be designated as the nodal officer from Ministry of Steel to facilitate and oversee the coordination mechanism.

Following is the text of the address by Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh at the ‘Make in Steel’ Conference in New Delhi today:
 
“Dr. Aruna Sharma, Secretary, Steel
Shri P.K.Singh, Chairman, SAIL
Shri Prashant Ruia, MD, Essar
Madam Rita Singh, CMD, MESCO Steel
Distinguished delegates
Friends from the Media
Ladies & Gentlemen;
 
I am glad to be here at this conference on a very relevant theme- ‘Make in Steel’. My compliments to the organisers for choosing this topic for the conference. 
 
It has been over six months since I took over as Steel Minister. I have met different stakeholders and visited steel plants and mines. I have come to the conclusion that steel industry is a vibrant and dynamic industry where employees work hard round the clock to produce steel which is the building block for a strong economy. 
 
International linkages for raw materials and markets make the industry dependent on changing trends in world steel market. 
 
Steel industry is important for the country because it has one of the highest economic linkages in overall GDP. Steel has an output-multiplier effect of around 1.4 times on GDP, so if steel industry grows by 1 per cent, its proportionate impact on GDP would be 1.4 %.
 
Employment-multiplier effect of steel is around 7 times, that is, with increase in output, steel industry has the potential to create 7 times the job opportunities, in upward and downward industries.
 
In 2016, India retained its position as the fastest growing major steel economy in the world. We are all proud of it, and we are confident that India would continue to lead the growth trend in world steel industry. All of us will have to work together for it. 
 
In my view, there are five important thrust areas we need to focus on and to make it easy to remember, we have coined an acronym ‘PRIDE’ that aptly sums up the way forward for the steel industry. 
 
P stands for production & productivity 
 
R for Research & Development 
 
I for Indian-made steel 
 
D for Demand of Steel 
 
E for excellence in quality 
 
Each of these areas is important from the perspective of ‘Make in Steel’, which I understand as maximising usage of steel in different segments of industry. 
 
I would go one step further and add another element to the theme, which is ‘Why Steel’. We need to ask this question to ourselves and then convince the potential customers about the advantages of using steel. Our message will be clear when we are ourselves clear about what we want to achieve. 
 
Steel industry needs to join the drive to demonstrate benefits of steel. Through Life Cycle Analysis, we need to showcase that steel structures are highly cost-effective and have shorter lead time for erection. Steel has greater durability with high design comfort. 
 
At Ministry level, we have directed all concerned to utilize every possible opportunity to showcase prototypes and exhibits of steel for this purpose. 
 
We must use all marketing, branding avenues to push this message. That is the only way to meet the challenge of product substitution by aluminium, concrete, plastic, glass etc. 
 
As far as the first letter P in PRIDE is concerned, India is on its way to become world’s second largest steel producer. 
 
The gap between India and Japan was 16 million tonnes in 2015, which has come down to 9 million tonnes in 2016. 
 
India’s share in global steel production was 5.5 % in 2015, which has increased to 5.9 % in 2016. So as far as production of steel is concerned, we are on the right path. 
 
In draft National Steel Policy that was put up in public domain recently, we aim to more than double the capacity to 300 million tonnes. That means an investment to the tune of Rs. 10 lakh crore. 
 
We definitely need to create demand in line with the planned increase in capacities. Our target is to increase per capita steel consumption to 160 kilogram. 
 
We should work towards meeting the entire domestic demand of high-grade automotive steel, electrical steel and special steels from domestic production. These products constitute a major portion of the steel imports in India. 
 
We are examining the feasibility of setting up scrap-based steel plants in India. These will be on the lines of ‘Melt & Manufacture’ steel technology in USA. 
 
Scrap-based steel plants are environment-friendly, energy-efficient and cost-effective. These will have the capability to produce special high-quality steels, a pre-requisite for Make in Steel. 
 
I would like you to deliberate on the cost-benefit analysis of setting up scrap based steel plants in North and West India. 
 
These  regions  are  important  from  the  perspective  of scrap-availability and steel import hubs.
 
MSTC-Mahindra Intertrade state-of-the-art Auto Shredding Plant is likely to be functional in 2018. 
 
Indian market has huge potential for auto-shredding. As per reports, there are more than 7 lakh cars and over 4 lakh trucks and buses which have reached end-of-life stage. By 2025, around 28 lakh cars and 12 lakh trucks and buses will reach their end-of-life stage. 
 
India imports around 6 million tonnes of scrap steel every year and is the second largest importer of scrap after Turkey. By 2025, we will be able to generate 7.5 million tonnes of scrap every year. 
 
So far as productivity is concerned, we are lagging behind the international benchmarks of performance. At country level, PSUs need to catch up with the productivity and efficiency levels achieved by Private steel companies. 
 
At international level, all Indian steel companies need to aim high and work towards achieving international levels.
 
Research & Development in Indian Steel industry is dismal. Whatever little R&D is being done is scattered and isolated. At one hand, there is overlapping & duplication of research efforts, at the other, no research is being done on future requirements of the industry. We are happy and contented with token R&D here and there. 
 
I went to Luxembourg last year and was apprised that they are trying to explore for mineral resources in space. 
 
If a small country like Luxembourg can dream that big, what stops us from aiming high and working on out-of-the-box solutions and technologies for steel making using indigenous resources. 
 
We are still dependent on imported raw material and high-end steel products. We have the potential to enhance usage of domestic coking coal by setting up more coal washeries, 
 
we are capable of producing auto-grade, defence-grade and other special steels in India. What we need to do is to push ourselves and to come out of our comfort zones. Then and then only can we be self-sufficient and strong.
 
We are trying to bring together all R&D efforts under one umbrella of SRTMI (Steel Research & Technology Mission of India) with public-private partnership. 
 
Ministry of Steel is in constant touch with different user ministries to ensure that steel-intensive structures are promoted through regulatory, advisory and other measures. We are in the process of talking to hill states to increase use of crash barriers to minimize fatalities due to road accidents on hills. Rural Development Ministry has already recommended use of steel-intensive structures in rural housing. 
 
We  are  trying  that   “Indian  Made  Steel”  can  be defined in the light of existing Public Procurement Bill.
 
This will provide for mandatory procurement from domestic bidders on the grounds of promoting domestic industry. Basically the aim is to emphasize lower life cycle costing while evaluating projects, rather than just looking at the upfront cost alone. 
 
Demand of steel is most important factor from the Make in Steel angle. I am happy that you have devoted most part of the conference to this aspect. There is no dearth of potential for steel demand. You name a core sector and steel is an integral part of it. The need of the hour is to channelize our resources in harnessing this demand. 
 
At Ministry level, we are constantly working to think of and work on ways for increasing steel demand in India. 
 
We  had  the  meeting  of  newly  constituted  Steel Consumer  Council  last  month,  in  which  concrete feedback has come from different stakeholders. We invited suggestions on increasing steel consumption in India on MyGov platform and Ministry is working on implementable suggestions.
 
We have constituted four task forces and committees of experts and users of steel to formulate strategies to increase steel consumption in India.
 
The importance that we are giving to this area can be gauged from the fact that we discussed ways and means to increase steel demand in Parliamentary Consultative Committee and urged the members to use their good offices to propagate the message. 
 
We all know that a record allocation of around Rs. 4 lakh crore has been made for infrastructure sector in the recent budget. 
 
Focus on areas such as ports, roads, affordable housing, physical infrastructure should provide the steel sector necessary impetus to meet its growth targets. 
 
The budget has given infrastructure status to housing and enhanced budget for housing, which is expected to revive domestic steel demand as it will push up demand for construction grade steel particularly those for roofing purposes. 
 
At present around 40 % steel consumption is from construction and infrastructure sectors, and we want to take it to 60 percent in long-term. 
 
In the budget, the Government has waived basic custom duty on nickel and reduced custom duty on specific-use grades of hot-rolled and cold rolled steel coils. The decision to cut down customs duty to on LNG (liquefied natural gas) will boost domestic steel companies that rely on imports to run gas-based steel plants. 
 
All these decisions will go a long way in ensuring that Make in Steel drive is successful in India. 
 
Lastly, all these efforts will mean nothing, if we are not able to produce steel of high quality. If we want to compete at international level, we will have to perform as per international benchmarks of efficiency and quality. 
 
It is my firm belief that Indian steel industry needs to move to a 100 % quality regime, for health and safety of end users. That is why we are going ahead with making BIS certification essential for most of the products. 
 
All the measures we discussed will have to be taken as a part of comprehensive strategy to generate steel demand in the country. 
 
I am sure you will all use PRIDE as your guiding principle for Make in Steel Roadmap for the industry. 
 
My best wishes for the Conference.”

The Union Budget 2017-18, presented in the Parliament on 1st  February 2017 is a forward looking budget directed towards raising the  productivity in the economy with a focus to transform, energize and  clean India. With a keen focus on infrastructure and all round development, the budget - under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi – will strengthen economic fundamentals – a focus of the government since 2014. 
Minister of Steel Shri Chaudhary Birender Singh said, “In my experience, this is one of the finest budgets ever. It focuses on raising  overall productivity of the economy with an emphasis on complete  transformation of India. This budget has laid a foundation of steel to  the India Growth Story.”  
Ministry  of Steel will largely benefit from the outcome of the budget. Through  affordable housing, a giant boost has been given to real estate and  infrastructure sector. This will boost real estate construction  activities and will increase the demand of steel products as will the government’s investment plan of Rs. 64,000 crore in National Highways and Rs. 27,000 crore on Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Further  budgetary outlay in infrastructure and railways & creation of new  airports will create a tremendous demand in the sector. The target of 100% village electrification by May, 2018, will also benefit many steel  producers. The reduction in duty on imported LNG will benefit standard  gas based steel plants and encourage more sponge iron producers to adopt  the gas based production route which is more environments friendly.
In terms of taxes, basic custom duty has been reduced in some steel products that will largely benefit the sector.

Basic Customs Duty reduction on Nickel, too, may lead to reduction in cost of production of stainless steel.
The budgets intention to put  aside Rs. 10,000 crores for re-capitalization of Public Sector Banks  will increase their ability to partially withstand the current NPAs in  the steel sector and in all likelihood will also generate a scenario  where they will be able to lend more to the distressed companies. 
With substantial focus on  infrastructure spending, railways, aviation, defence and housing the  Union Budget 2017-2018 will revive the demand for steel and steel-based  products in the following months and years.

IHGF- Delhi Fair Spring 2017, the 43rd edition of the world’s largest  handicrafts and gifts fair, will open on 16th February, 2017 at India  Expo Centre & Mart, Greater Noida Expressway in the NCR of Delhi.   The Limca Book of World Records has recognized it as the world’s largest  congregation of handicraft exhibitors under one roof. The fair will be  held from February 16 - 20, 2017, spread over an area of 1,97,000 sq.  metres, informed Executive Director, EPCH, Shri Rakesh Kumar.  

More than 3,000 exhibitors including 900 permanent marts from all over  the country will be showcasing a wide range of products belonging to  fourteen product categories, namely houseware, home furnishing,  furniture, gifts and decoratives, lamps and lighting, Christmas &  festive décor, fashion jewellery & accessories, spa and wellness,  carpets and rugs, bathroom accessories, garden accessories, educational  toys & games, handmade paper products and stationery and leather  bags.  

Over 6,500 foreign buyers from more than 80 countries, buying agents  based in India and domestic retail volume buyers are expected to visit  the mega fair to source their requirements. The increase in the  exhibition space and in the number of exhibitors and visitors indicate  how important this event is for India as well as for the international  buying community. It also demonstrates that it is an indispensable event  for overseas buyers for sourcing home, lifestyles, fashion and textiles  products, all provided under one roof.  

The world’s largest show for home, lifestyle, fashion and textiles will  bring comprehensive selections with a choice of over 2,000 products made  out of different raw material bases such as wood, metal, cane and  bamboo, textiles made of natural fibres, wool, silk, jute, coir, stone,  leather, terracotta, lacquer and vegetable dyes.  

One of the main highlights of the show will be a thematic display of  products from North Eastern Region and Jodhpur Mega cluster. A theme  pavilion on wooden handicrafts items produced from legally procured wood  and certified under Vriksh – an indigenous Indian Timber Legality  assessment and Verification scheme, will also be set up to showcase the  best of wooden handicrafts items. Informative seminars related to  production techniques, skill development, GSP scheme, trends and  forecast, discussion on union budget and the forthcoming GST would also  be held.  

Realizing the phenomenal growth in the domestic retail market, the  Council opened the doors of IHGF-Delhi Fair for domestic retail volume  buyers and e-commerce companies during Autumn 2014. Since then, major  retail brands and e-commerce companies such as Good Earth, Furniture  Republic, Fab India, West Side, Archies Ltd, DLF Brands Ltd., @home,  Shoppers Stop, Lifestyles Group, UrbanLadder.com, Pepperfry.com,  Ajio.com, FabFurnish.com, Shopclues.com and others have become regular  visitors to the fair.  These companies have registered to visit and  source their requirements at the 43rd edition of the Fair as well.  

Interacting with the media, ED – EPCH, Mr. Rakesh Kumar said that since  its inception in 1994, the IHGF- Delhi fair has made significant  contribution to the handicrafts trade from India.  It has not only  enabled Indian exporters to participate in the show in large numbers and  secure orders but has also enabled foreign buyers to source their  requirements from India at one place, one time and under one roof.  He  said that one of the most important roles played by the IHGF has been  the increase in the foreign exchange earnings of the country, besides  generating employment.  

Chairman, EPCH, Mr. Dinesh Kumar said that despite the fact that USA and  Europe have been major buyers of India, the focus of EPCH is now on new  emerging markets in hitherto unexplored and under-explored regions like  Latin America, Central Asia (CIS), Africa and South East Asia.  

The exports of handicrafts during April 2016 - December 2016 has  registered a growth of 12.10% in rupee terms and stands at Rs. 17,937.05  crores. The growth in dollar terms is 8.25% with exports of US $  2673.48 million. ED, EPCH said that the export target for the year  2016-17 is US$ 3600 million (Rs. 23,560.00 crores) and that the Council  hopes to achieve the target.  

EPCH is a nodal agency for promotion and development of handicrafts exports from the country.

In  order to assess the living conditions of jute workers, a study on the  Socio-Economic Conditions of Jute Mill Workers was conducted in 2015-16  by National Jute Board (NJB). The findings of the study, inter alia,  indicate that 96.4% workers have electricity in their houses; that 91%  of the families have piped water supply; that 99% of the workers have  access to toilets; and that the mill workers have health coverage under  ESI.  
Government of India provides an assured market to the jute sector under the Jute Packaging Materials Act (JPM), 1987. Under  this Act, Government has mandated that 90% of foodgrains and 20% of  sugar be packed in jute bags. The annual subsidy for this amounts to  Rs.5,500 crores approximately. Apart from this, the National Jute Board (NJB) has been implementing several measures for the benefit of workers, artisans and small producers and for promotion of the jute industry.  These include: 
(i).     Workers’ Welfare Scheme (SulabhSauchalaya) for improvement of sanitation, health facilities and working conditions of jute mill workers. 
(ii).   Incentives to Children of Jute Mill Workers for extending support to the Workers' families towards education of their children through a scholarship scheme.
(iii). Export Market Development AssistanceScheme to facilitate  registered manufacturer exporters of jute products to participate in  international fairs and take business delegations abroad for export  promotion of lifestyle and other diversified jute products.
(iv). Retail Outlet of Jute Diversified Products Scheme for providing assistance to jute entrepreneurs for  opening of outlets of jute lifestyle jute products in Metro Cities,  State capitals, District Head Offices and Tourist spots; and
(v).   Focused Market Initiatives for organising and  participation in Jute Fairs, National Fairs / Regional Fairs, Export  oriented fairs in India & abroad to extend marketing support to the  artisans, small and micro entrepreneurs:

As a result of an initiative launched by the Ministry of Textiles on  the second National Handloom Day (7th August 2016), the traditional  hand-woven products of West Bengal Handloom clusters have been  transformed into high-profile fashionable fabrics. Due to the  involvement of a reputed fashion designer (identified by MoU partner IMG  Reliance) in training and product development, “Beyond Boundaries”, a  garment range produced from the handloom products of West Bengal  Handloom Clusters in Coochbehar and Udaynarayanpur, is being showcased  in the Lakme Fashion Week, being held in Mumbai from February 1-5, 2017.
The engagement of the fashion designer was done under a pioneering  initiative taken by the Ministry of Textiles, to engage reputed  designers in handloom clusters for product development/diversification,  improved marketability and better returns. MoUs were signed with IMG  Reliance and other similar organizations on the 2nd National Handloom  Day i.e. 7th August 2016, in Varanasi.
Ministry of Textiles has sanctioned a large number of projects for  comprehensive development of handloom-concentrated blocks across the  country.  273 such projects have been sanctioned with 2,30,133 weavers  as beneficiaries. These include Coochbehar and Udaynarayanpur Handloom  Clusters in West Bengal, which respectively cover 505 and 640 handloom  weavers.  Financial assistance has been provided for various  interventions, including design development. In order to develop new  designs/products in the clusters, an MoU was signed with a group of  designers in partnership with IMG Reliance.  Among them, Shri Sayantan  Sarkar, Fashion Designer has come out with a range of garments, which is  being showcased in the Lakme Fashion Week. It is expected that the  products developed will go a long way in supporting handlooms, with the  weavers getting higher wages. Mr. Sayantan Sarkar worked in association  with Weavers’ Service Centre, Kolkata in Coochbehar Handloom Cluster in  Coochbehar district and in Udaynarayanpur Handloom Cluster in Howrah  district.
Bengal is known for its Jamdanis and Balucharis but a larger number  of weavers presently produce in plain weaves and basic “Tangail” or  plain weave sarees with jacquard borders or even the local towels  “gamchas” and the “Lungis” which constitute a large segment in Bengal.
This initiative has introduced Linen yarn to weave the “gamchas”,  colour palette was changed to pastels instead of the stark contrasting  combinations and the check formation was changed to an uneven gradation  according to the forecast which all of a sudden made the same weave look  like an upmarket fabric with extreme drapability and also difficult to  replicate in powerlooms.

                Senior tribal leader from Chhattisgarh and ex parliamentarian Shri  Nand Kuamr Sai assumed charge as the chairman of National Commission for  Scheduled Tribes (NCST) today in New Delhi.
Speaking on the occasion Shri Sai said it will be his endeavor to  protect rights of tribal living in far flung areas of the country. He  said a large percentage of tribals in our country are still not aware of  their rights guaranteed to them by the constitutions. Shri Sai said he  will see to it that NCST is converted into an important tool for the  overall social economic development of STs in the country.
Earlier on his arrival to the office of NCST, Shri Sai was greeted  by Vice Chairperson of NCST Miss Anusuia Uikey, Members Shri Bari  Krishna Damor and Shri Harshadbhai Chunilal Vasava and Secretary of the  Commission Shri Raghav Chandra.

Shri Sai was elected  to Lok sabha in 1989, 1996 and 2004. He was also elected to Rajya Sabha  in 2009 and 2010. He also served as member of Parliamentary Standing  Committee on Coal and Steel and member of the Parliamentary consultative  committee of Ministry of Urban Development and Ministry of Social  Justice and empowerment.
Shri Sai has been actively involved in spread of education in tribal  areas. An ardent supporter of prohibition Shri Sai has been in the  forefront of various movements to oppose atrocities and exploitation of  tribals.
NCST was established by amending Article 338 and inserting a new  Article 338A in the Constitution through the Constitution (89th  Amendment) Act, 2003. By this amendment, the erstwhile National  Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was replaced by two  separate Commissions namely- (i) the National Commission for Scheduled  Castes (NCSC), and (ii) the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes  (NCST) w.e.f.  February 19, 2004.
The term of office of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and each member  is three years from the date of assumption of charge. The Chairperson  has been given the rank of Union Cabinet Minister and the  Vice-Chairperson that of a Minister of State and other Members have the  ranks of a Secretary to the Government of India.
NCST is empowered to investigate and monitor matters relating to  safeguards provided for STs under the Constitution or under other laws  or under Govt. order. The Commission is also authorized to inquire into  specific complaints relating to rights and safeguards of STs and to  participate and advise in the Planning Process relating to  socio-economic development of STs and to evaluate the progress of their  development under the Union and States.
The commission submits its report to the President annually on the  working of safeguards and measures required for effective implementation  of Programmers/ Schemes relating to welfare and socio-economic  development of STs.

                Five major transformational reforms to be implemented  based on report of Group of Secretaries
Cities to grant approvals first and verify later; Credit Rating, Value Capture Financing, Land titling on agenda
Reform incentive fund to be increased from Rs.500 cr to Rs.3,000 cr per year over next 3 years
Reforms and 6 related new initiatives to be discussed with States/UTs tomorrow
            Ministry of Urban Development has evolved a new reform matrix to enable State and City Governments go beyond the present incrementalism of taking small steps towards implementing transformational reforms over the next three years, for a turn around in urban governance, planning and finance.
            The Ministry will discuss a set of five major reforms with States and Union Territories at a ‘National Workshop on Urban Development’ to be held here tomorrow. Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu will chair the deliberations on the reforms and six other new initiatives that promote these reforms since huge private sector investment is envisaged under five of these initiatives..
            The concerned Group of Secretaries in their report on urban sector have recommended that “After a review of the schemes over the years,  the Group felt that instead of an incremental approach, the time has come for ushering in transformational reforms in Governance, Planning and Finance”.
            Major reforms recommended by the Group of Secretaries are;
1.Moving to a Trust and Verify Approach: Instead of the present practice of verifying first and approving later, it has been recommended that trust needs to be reposed in the citizens and approvals may be accorded first and to be verified later, inverting the model of verifying first and approving later which is resulting in huge delays. This ‘Trust and Verify’ approach has been recommended in respect of Permissions for building construction, Change of title in municipal records (mutation) and Birth and Death registration, involving the largest number of physical interactions between city governments and citizens.
2.Formulating Land Titling Laws: The Group quoting a study by McKinsey noted that over 90% of the land records in the country are unclear and land market distortions and unclear land titles are costing the country 1.30% of GDP per year and accordingly recommended enactment of Land Titling Laws and their implementation in a specific time frame.
3. Credit Rating of Urban Local Bodies
4. Value Capture Financing
Noting that the total revenues of the municipal sector accounts for only 0.75% of the country’s GDP as against 6% for South Africa, 5% for Brazil and 4.50% for Poland, the Group recommended Municipal Bonds further to Credit Rating of ULBs and Value Capture Finance tools for meeting the capital expenditure needs of cities.
5.Improving Professionalism of ULBs: Quoting investment bank Goldman Sachs report, the Group of Secretaries noted that a bureaucracy that is based on merit rather than seniority could add nearly a percentage point annually to the country’s per capita GDP growth. It also expressed concern over shortage of qualified technical staff and managerial supervisors in ULBs preventing innovation, the Group recommended induction of professionals in city governments by encouraging lateral induction and filling top positions in cities (Commissioners and Heads of Finance and Revenue) through open competition.
            In pursuance of these recommendations of the Group of Secretaries, the Ministry of Urban Development has come out with the following implementation framework in respect of the five major reforms:

            To incentivize, implementation of these five transformational reforms, the Ministry of Urban Development has proposed to increase Reform Incentive Fund from Rs.500 cr during 2017-18 to over Rs.3,000 cr per year over the next three years of implementation period. Cities will be ranked based on performance under each reform category for providing reform incentive. Rs.400 cr was distributed during 2016-17 for those who pursued reforms indicated in AMRUT Guidelines.
            Ministry will also discuss with States and UTs new initiatives viz., Transit Oriented Development Policy, Metro Policy, Green Urban Mobility Scheme, Livability Index for Cities, Value Capture Policy and  Fecal Sludge Management Policy.

Third National Dam Safety Conference organized by Central Water Commission in association with Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam and IIT Roorkee concluded at Roorkee today. The conference focused on key challenges in dam safety field that are being encountered in the on-going Dam Safety Rehabilitation and Improvement Project ( DRIP) implementation. Sharing of the knowledge, experience, innovations, novel technologies etc. by different national and overseas experts  further helped in reshaping the strategies for effectively managing the uncertainties associated with dam design, construction, operation, and maintenance. 
 
The conference received an overwhelming response with over 400 delegates attending and submission of over 70 technical papers from experts within and outside India. About 40 national and overseas organizations  showcased their technologies, products and services through Exposition organized at the conference venue. The professionals from USA, Australia, Japan, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and Germany attended this event. 
 
The Conference was inaugurated by Dr Amarjit Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, Govt. of India in the presence of Sh S Ramaswamy, Chief Secretary, Government of Uttarakhand, Sh U P Singh, Director General, NMCG, MoWR, RD&GR, Prof. Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi, Director, IIT Roorkee, as well as other senior Central, State Government and DRIP implementing officials. 
 
The interactions among the participants, with the organizations showcasing their technologies and products and with the experts presenting the papers  will help dam safety professionals and managements in further determining the strategies for improved monitoring, operation and maintenance and rehabilitation of dams. The key recommendations emerging from the deliberations of the conference will be circulated to stakeholders as well as policy makers for implementation. Select technical papers received for the onference will be published as a Compendium to provide a permanent reference in the libraries of the State Agencies responsible for design, construction, operation and maintenance of dams.
 
Dams have played a key role in fostering rapid and sustained agricultural and rural growth and development, which have been key priorities for the Govt. of India since independence. Over the last seventy years, India has invested substantially in the critical infrastructure required to manage and store limited surface water resources in reservoirs to ensure food, energy, and water securities. Globally India ranks third after China and the United States of America in terms of number of large dams with a total storage capacity of about 283 billion cubic meters. Close to 80% of large dams have surpassed the age of twenty-five years, and many of them face the challenges of deferred maintenance. Many of these dams are considerably old (about 170 dams exceed the age of 100 years) and built in an era whose design practices and safety considerations do not match with the current design standards and the prevailing safety norms. 
Several of these dams may be experiencing distress and are in urgent need of attention for ensuring their structural safety as well as operational efficiency. Large dams’ failure may seriously affect the lives, property and the environment in addition to disrupting the services provided by the dam. Realizing the importance, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation embarked upon the six year Dam Safety Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) with World Bank assistance in the year 2012 having provision of comprehensive rehabilitation and improvement of 225 large dam projects in seven States of India coupled with institutional reforms and strengthening of regulatory measures pertaining to safe and financially-sustainable dam operations. The project is being implemented in the seven States (Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand). 
                   
The DRIP has been successful in bringing greater awareness on dam safety issues and addressing the serious problems by introducing novel solutions and technologies. Since Project covers only 5% of large dams and seven States, to share knowledge and experience in dam safety areas with professionals of non-DRIP States, academician, industries as well as global experts, National Dam Safety Conferences (NDSC) are organized in different States as an annual event. These Conferences propagate the concepts, techniques, instruments, materials, etc. for design and construction of new dams, as well as for monitoring, surveillance, operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of existing dams.

                The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has expressed deep concern about the increasing trend of hospitals forcing expecting mothers to undergo C-section surgery for delivery of their babies. The World Health Organization, in their recommendations, has stated that C-section surgeries normally constitute 10-15% of the total deliveries. However, the National Health Family Survey-4 reports indicate that this percentage is much higher. In Tamil Nadu, this percentage has been found to be 34% and in Telangana 58%. The situation in private hospitals and nursing homes is even more alarming. In Telangana, in private hospitals ,the number of women who undergo C-section deliveries is as high as 75% of the total deliveries. 

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi today received a petition in this regard from Subarna Ghosh through www.change.org. This petition has been signed by over one lakh women. 

Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has taken up the matter with the Health Minister, Shri J.P. Nadda. She has suggested that one of the methods to curtail this alarming trend is to mandate public disclosure of information regarding C-section surgeries as compared to the normal deliveries which take place in all hospitals and nursing homes. She has also suggested that the Health Ministry, in collaboration with WCD Ministry, could take up an outreach campaign with the medical community as well as the prospective mothers on this subject. 

In her communication to the Health Minister, Smt. Gandhi has pointed out that C-section surgeries have serious impact not only on the health of the mother but also on her ability to continue work after delivery. In most cases, C-section surgery also affects the reproductive health of the woman.

                A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Care and Protection of  Children in Street Situations for their rehabilitation and safeguarding  was released by Minister for Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka  Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi today. Earlier the SOP was launched at a  function attended by Delhi High Court Judge, Hon’ble Justice Mukta  Gupta; NCPCR Chairperson, Ms. Stuti Kacker; Noted Bollywood actor and  Ambassador, Save the Children, Ms. Dia Mirza, Chairperson Save the  Children in India,  Mr. Harpal Singh and CEO, Save the Children  International, Mr.  Thomas Chandy were present during the launch. NCPCR  collaborated with the Civil Society Organization (CSO), Save the  Children to develop this much needed strategy for street children.
The NCPCR decided to outline a detailed intervention framework for  care and protection of children living in street situation as the  problems faced by these children are multi-dimensional and complex.  The  SOP aims at streamlining the interventions within the current legal and  policy framework. The purpose of the SOP is to identify processes that  should be set in motion once a child on the street has been identified  as a child in need. These processes would be within the existing  framework of rules and policies and would create a convergence of the  various agencies. Besides it also provides a step-by-step guideline for  all the stakeholders for care, protection and rehabilitation of these  children.
Speaking about the release of the SOP, Smt. Maneka Gandhi said, “Our  government is committed to the well-being of every child in India. This  initiative will help the Government to ensure that health education and  protection mechanisms are made available to children living on the  streets.’’
The SOP was drafted after taking into consideration a detailed field  research study with inputs received from regional consultations held at  Patna, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Mumbai from 35 NGOs. Children who survived  from the street were also consulted in Delhi at NCPCR before drafting  of the SOP.
Children living in the streets are among the most vulnerable groups.  Most of these children have little or no adult supervision and  protection. They also do not have access to education and basic health  care living a life of struggle for survival. The lack of basic care and  protection exposes them to abuse, exploitation and neglect depriving  them of the most basic human rights.
Cities in India are witnessing rapid urbanization.  By 2030, 40% of  India’s population is expected to be living in urban areas which mean  that child population in streets will continue to grow. Therefore, it is  important to integrate the needs of children in street situations into  urban policies and planning. A 2016 survey by Save the Children in  Lucknow, Mughalsarai, Kolkata- Howrah, Patna and Hyderabad found 84,563  children living on the streets. An older study by the same organization  in Delhi put their number at 50,000.

                            The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has urged schools to strictly observe Guidelines for Eliminating Corporal Punishment, issued by the National Commission of Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) of WCD Ministry.
The WCD Ministry has asked the Ministry of Human Resource Development for wide spread circulation and implementation of the Guidelines for Elimination of Corporal Punishment in schools.
            This was done in the light of the recent disturbing incident of girl students who were meted out tormenting corporal punishment in the school for not completing their homework. The incident was widely reported in the media, thereby bringing to public attention the issue of corporal punishment used in schools.
            The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) under the authority of Ministry of Women & Child Development has developed and issued Guidelines for Eliminating Corporal Punishment in schools.
            In her letter to the HRD Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has expressed concern at the disturbing incident of corporal punishment in UP. “Corporal punishment has been banned under Section-17 of the RTE Act”, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said. She has urged the HRD Minister that the government as well as private schools may be suitably directed to ensure that these guidelines are strictly observed.
The Guidelines state constitution of Special Monitoring Cells to take prompt action in cases of physical punishment or harassment of children. They also suggest that Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells (CPMCs) should hear grievances related to corporal punishment within 48 hours of the occurrence. The guidelines suggest that school teachers should provide a written undertaking that they would not engage in any action that could be construed as amounting to physical punishment, mental harassment or discrimination. It also says that schools should have annual social audits of physical punishment, harassment and discrimination. 
The guidelines of NCPCR on corporal punishment are available on: http://www.ncpcr.gov.in/showfile.php?lang=1&level=1&&sublinkid=234&lid=153

The Ministry of Women and Child Development held a National Consultation  to discuss issues related to India’s accession to Hague Convention on  the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, in New Delhi today.  The consultation was chaired by the Minister of Women and Child  Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi.   

The consultation was attended  by Hon’ble Justice Mukta Gupta and  Hon’ble Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva of Delhi High Court,  Hon’ble Justice  Inderjit Singh  and Hon’ble Justice Anita Chaudhury of Punjab and  Haryana High Court, Hon’ble Justice (Retd) Rakesh Kumar Garg, Chairman  of Punjab NRI Commission; Hon’ble Justice Ravi R. Tripathi, Member of  Law Commission, Smt. Pinki Anand, Additional Solicitor General of India,  Smt. Stuti Kacker, Chairperson, NCPCR, members of legal fraternity as  well as  parents who have been affected. Representatives of MEA, MHA,  NHRC and NCW were also present.  

Addressing the participants, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that a  large number of women married to Indians abroad are compelled to return  to India with their children when they undergo violence in their  marriages. She expressed concern at the difficulties being faced by the  affected parent, whether men or women and their children as a result of  breakdown of marriages abroad. However, the women who have suffered from  violence in marriages abroad far exceed men, she added. After listening  to the viewpoints expressed by all the stakeholders , the WCD Minister   opined that the problems being faced by the parents  must be addressed  and an effective mechanism for the same must be created. A model  legislation to safeguard not only the interests of the child but also of  the parents, especially  women must also be developed, Smt Maneka  Gandhi concluded.  

Accordingly, based on the discussions and guidance given by the Hon’ble  Judges, it was decided that the Chandigarh Judicial Academy Chandigarh  along with NRI Commission of Punjab  to examine in detail the legal  issues involved by taking all viewpoints into account including those of  suffering women. They will give recommendations as to how the problems  of parents and children involved in such situations can be addressed.  They will also study the draft Protection of Children (Inter-Country  Removal and Retention) Bill, 2016 . It was also decided that if a model  legislation is required to safeguard the interests of parents and  children, the same will be drafted. It was decided that this exercise  will be completed in four months.  

Hague Convention is a multilateral treaty which came into existence on  1st December, 1983.  The convention seeks to protect children from the  harmful effects of abduction and retention across international  boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return.  The convention is intended to enhance the international recognition of  rights of custody and access arising in place of habitual residence, and  to ensure prompt return of the child who is wrongfully removed or  retained from the place of habitual residence.  It seeks to return  children abducted or retained overseas by a parent to their country of  habitual residence for the courts of that country to decide on matters  of residence and contact. The convention shall apply to any child, up to  the age of 16 years who is a habitual resident of any of the contacting  states.  

Currently, there is no specific Indian legislation addressing issues  related to abduction of children from and into India. However Law  Commission of India had submitted the 218th Report titled “Need to  accede to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International  Child Abduction 1980” on 30th March, 2009.  In view of this report,  before acceding to the Convention, the Ministry of Women and Child  Development prepared a draft Bill titled “The Civil Aspects of  International Child Abduction Bill, 2016”. The draft Bill was placed on  the Ministry’s website for comments and suggestions from various  stakeholders.  

The Law Commission of India has recently suggested some modifications  in the above mentioned Bill and re-named it as the “The Protection of  Children (Inter-country Removal and Retention) Bill, 2016”.

                 The Ministry is implementing the scheme for setting up One Stop Centre since 1st April 2015 to support women-affected by violence. The scheme aims to facilitate access to an integrated range of services including medical aid, police assistance, legal aid/case management, psycho-social counselling, and temporary support services to women affected by violence.
Under the scheme, it has been envisaged that One Stop Centres would be set up across the country in a phased manner. In the first phase, one Centre was sanctioned per State/UT. Further, 150 additional Centres are taken up in second phase during 2016-17. The Ministry has approved all the proposals received from States/UTs. Out of these, 68 Centres have become operational.
 
Funds of Rs.1102.49 lakhs and Rs.3555.87 lakhs have been sanctioned to States/UTs during 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively for the setting up One Stop Centres.
 
As these Centres have become operational recently, data regarding number of women assisted have been received only from States of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Haryana, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Bihar and Uttarakhand. The details are as under:

                The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) have started collecting data on the Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act, 2005 using Ministry of Home Affairs approved revised proforma of ‘Crime in India’ since 2014. A total number of 426 cases and 461 cases have been registered under the Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act, 2005 during the year 2014 and 2015 respectively.
 
As per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, “Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects and, as such the primary responsibility of prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of crime lies with the States/UT Administrations.  State /UT Governments are responsible for implementation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005. The Act provides for an inbuilt mechanism to facilitate the entire system of access to justice. It identifies specific functionaries such as the Protection Officers and Services Providers whose primary duty is to assist women in accessing reliefs provided under the law. All the States/UTs are required to appoint the Protection Officers, registration of Service Providers and notification of shelter homes and medical facilities. As on date, all State Governments have appointed Protection Officers.
The Central Government has been emphasising upon the need to impart training to First Class Judicial Magistrates/Metropolitan Magistrates to deal with cases under Domestic violence Act through National/State Judicial Academies. Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories for combating crimes against women which are available on www.mha.nic.in. Continuous awareness creation among men and women in the society through workshops, seminars, street plays, Nari ki Chaupals, Beti Janmotshav are being undertaken at the district level. Further, advertisements in the press and electronic media educating peoples about issues of domestic violence are also being published. Through Sabla programme of this Ministry, adolescent girls in the age group of 11 to 18 years are imparted training with regard to legal rights of women.
 
Different states have different assistance/ ex – gratia norms for such victims of violence.  Ministry of Home Affairs has informed that no ex-gratia assistance is provided to the women victims of acid attack or any act of violence, under the new revised Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) guidelines dated 13th July, 2016 one time grant of Rs. 200 crore has been released to all the States/UTs to compensate victim women including acid attack. Additional compensation of Rupees One Lakh to the victims of acid attack under PM National Relief Fund (PMNRF) in addition to the compensation to the victims is also given by the Prime Minister’s Office.

Driven by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi´s vision of making  football the sport of choice in India, Mission XI Million, the biggest  school sport outreach programme was launched here today by the Minister  of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel in the  presence of President of AIFF Shri Praful Patel. A first of its kind,  the programme will encourage children to play the beautiful game of  football, gain healthy habits and learn important life lessons in  teamwork and sportsman spirit. The approach is to work with school  principals and sports teachers and encourage and incentivize them to  make children play football games on regular basis. 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Vijay Goel said, over the past year, his  Ministry has made many bold strides towards developing a sporting  culture in the country. He said, Projects like Khelo India are helping  towards developing sport at the ground level while our TOPS scheme and  Olympic Task forces look to help our elite athletes bring glory to India  in the international arena.  And with the FIFA U-17 World Cup being  held in India in October this year, we are building our infrastructure  and showcasing our ability to organize and execute global sporting  events. 

The minister said, but it is not just the stadiums and grounds that need  to be built. In his ‘Mann Ki Baat address on March 27th, our Prime  Minister, Shri Narendra Modi described the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 as a  great opportunity for youth that can start a revolution in sports  throughout our country. In his words, this whole year there should be an  atmosphere of football in the schools and colleges and around our  country. The Mission XI Million programme that we are launching today  was inspired by this vision. 

Referring to Mission XI Million, Shri Vijay Goel said, it is a massive  school engagement programme for football. Designed with international  sporting expertise, but keeping in mind the ground realities of our huge  and varied country, it aims to instill the passion for football in 11  million children from every part of the country. 

He said, the key idea of Mission Xi Million is that every child should  have the opportunity to play the world’s most popular sport. To make  that happen, schools and parents must be equally involved in children’s  physical well being. Shri Goel said Mission XI Million equips parents  and schools with the equipment and the knowledge about how to make  regular play a reality for their wards. 

The Minister said, the program will be rolled out in every state of the  country, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari from Kutch to Imphal. The initial  activity has already started, and he is extremely encouraged by the  response government is getting from the schools and children. 

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has spoken encouragingly about  MXIM. In a message to the nation on an earlier occasion, he remarked,  “Mission XI Million will take the beautiful game of football to at least  11 million boys and girls around the country. Children in every state,  from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Arunachal Pradesh will get a  chance to learn, play and enjoy football.” 

Vying to reach out to over 37 cities and 12,000 schools across all 29  states of India, the initiative will focus on games that can be adapted  to different field sizes and conditions, with special emphasis in small  sided games (4 vs. 4 and 5 vs. 5). It is divided into three phases:  seminars for teacher and educators, in-school activities and football  festivals, which will run up to September 2017.

The scheme encourages the States/UTs to focus on sports,  cultural activities, activities based on learning, exposure to life  skills with respect to health, nutrition etc.  The annual school grant  of Rs.50,000/- per annum per school provided under the scheme, has  provisions among other components, for sports equipments and uniforms.  

In the written reply he said, the Right of Children to Free and  Compulsory Education under Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, has been  enacted, making elementary education a Fundamental Right, which,  inter-alia, provides for 

(i)      Access to a play ground for each school; 

(ii)     A part time instructor for physical education in upper primary 	school; 

(iii)    Supply of play material, games and sports equipment, as	per			requirement of the schools. 

Further, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made it  mandatory for all schools affiliated to it to provide one compulsory  period for sports upto 10th class and two periods in a week for 11th and  12th classes.

The  Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel  said in the Lok Sabha today that the government recognizes one National  Sports Federation (NSF) for each sport discipline at the National Level.  NSFs  are responsible for judicious selection of national team for  participation in various international events based on merit following  the guidelines issued by the Government.
In  the written reply he said that with a view to ensuring fair and  transparent selection of athletes, Government has issued instructions to  all the NSFs & IOA to place on their websites various details  relating to international events held in India and abroad such as  notification of selection criteria for such events well in advance along  with the details of time and venue for selection, list of core  probables and basis of their selection, details of coaching camps  organized including venues, dates and lists of participants, list of the  athletes selected, performance criteria which formed the basis of  selection, actual performance in terms of timing, distance, etc. and the  position obtained by each athlete / team etc.
All  the sportspersons having potential to excel at international level are  treated equally irrespective of their caste, religion, financial status  etc. The provisions of the Scheme of Assistance to NSFs are inclusive  and equally applicable to sportspersons belonging to weaker section. 
However,  Government through Sports Authority of India(SAI) is implementing the  Special Area Games (SAG) Scheme to select sports talent mainly from the  tribal, rural, coastal and remote backward and hilly areas.  The trainees in the SAG centres are being trained  and provided expert sports coaches, required playing facilities,  consumable and non-consumable sports equipment, expenses towards  boarding and lodging, sports kit, competition exposure, educational  expenses, medical and insurance and stipend for day boarders as per the  approved scheme norms.
Although Sports is a State subject, Government of India is  running a number of Schemes for promotion of sports through which  Government extends requisite support and financial assistance for  promotion and development of identified Sports in India through its  various schemes in the country.
  Government is  providing full assistance to the identified sportspersons/teams for  intensive coaching through national coaching camps organized by the  Sports Authority of India besides providing Foreign Exposures /  Competitions and State-of-the-art equipment and Infrastructure.  Government  is also providing financial assistance to meritorious sportspersons  under the National Sports Development Fund for personalized  training/coaching under national /international coaches, participation  in international tournaments held in India and abroad, purchase of  sports equipment etc. 
In addition to above, Government of India is running a  number of Schemes for the sportspersons such as Pension Scheme, Special  (Cash) Awards, Sports Awards etc. which encourages younger generation  to take-up sports as career.

The  Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel  said in the Lok Sabha today that a Scheme called “Khelo India – National  Programme for Development of Sports” is being implemented by this  Ministry as a Central Sector Scheme from the current financial year  2016-17. This Scheme, inter-alia provides for holding of sports  competitions in two age groups of (i) under 14 and (ii) under 17 all  over India to encourage mass participation of both boys and girls in  Sports as well as creation of sports infrastructure, viz., Synthetic  Athletic Track, Synthetic Hockey Field, Synthetic Turf Football Ground,  Multipurpose hall, Swimming pool, etc.  The Scheme caters to the entire  country, including tribal areas. 
      In the written reply he said, the Sports Authority of India (SAI), an autonomous organization under aegis of the Ministry, also implements the following sports promotional schemes:
                    i.            National Sports Talent Contest Scheme (NSTC) - for Sub-Junior level trainees
                  ii.            Army Boys Sports Company Scheme (ABSC) - for Sub-Junior level trainees
                iii.            SAI Training Centres Scheme (STC) - for Junior level trainees
                iv.            Extension Centre of STC /SAG
                  v.            Special Area Games Scheme (SAG) - for Junior level trainees
 
SAI  schemes envisage induction of talent from 8-25 years, therefore, the  children from 9-14 years are covered under SAI schemes. The majority of  the sports persons selected under the above schemes are identified from  the rural and backward and tribal area of the country and provided  regular training under residential and non residential basis. The  Special Area Games Scheme of SAI is, however, implemented to select  sports talent mainly from the tribal, rural, coastal and remote backward  and hilly areas.
Sports  being a state subject, the responsibility to set up sports Centres/  sports academies in the respective states lies with the concerned State  government.  
 
However, in order to promote sports on single discipline basis, SAI  has introduced National Sports Academy (NSA) scheme with state of the  art sports facilities.  The scheme is implemented in collaboration with  concerned National Sports Federations and possibly through Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) partners. 10 such Academies in Swimming,  Cycling,  Athletics (Sprints), Cue Sports and Hockey in Delhi, Athletics  (Middle and Long distance) at Bhopal, Athletics (Sprints and Jumps) and  Golf at Thiruvananthapuram, Boxing at Rohtak, SAI Gopichand Badminton  Academy at Hyderabad have already been established.

It has been 58 days since the launch of NITI Aayog’s two incentive schemes – Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana to promote digital payments and the public response has been quite encouraging.  
The initiative to make Digital Payments a mass movement in India through the two schemes has made a headway across the country with more and more people adopting digital transactions.  
According to the latest figures released by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which has been executing the schemes, nearly 10 lakh consumers and merchants have been disbursed over Rs.153.5 crore as reward money till 20th February, 2017. 
Highlights:
·         Among the 9.8 lakh winners are more than 9.2 lakh consumers and 56,000 merchants.
·         120 consumers have won prize money worth Rs. 1 lakh each
·         4,000 merchants have won Rs. 50,000 prize money each
·         Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi have emerged as the top five states/ Union Territory(s) with maximum number of winners
·         Active participation was seen among females and males across regions
·         Winners belong to diverse socio-economic backgrounds, from farmers, merchants, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives, students to retired persons.
·         While majority of the winners are in the age group of 21 to 30, a significant number are also above 60 years of age.
·         The diversity in age of winners is from 15 to 66 years, challenging the notion that the old find it difficult to embrace technology to adopt digital payments.
The winners have their own stories to tell it all as to how the switch over to digital payments has been le and how it has made the life easier for them. Sabir, a 22-year-old cab driver from Delhi won Rs. 1,00,000 under Lucky GrahakYojana for consumers. Digital payments are a blessing in disguise for him because he has to take care of his mother and differently-abled sister after the demise of his father and doesn’t have time to stand in lines at the bank. Bhim Singh, a 29-year-old wheat farmer from Hissar in Haryana  and winner under this initiative, now uses digital payments for buying supplies from wholesalers. Jayanthi SF, from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, a 29-year-old engineering student and mother to a six-year-old, is a proud winner of Rs. 1,00,000 under the scheme.
 
Among the merchants, Damodar Prasad Khandelwal, a 42-year-old grocery store owner from Alwar in Rajasthan, won Rs. 50,000 in the weekly prize under Digi-DhanVyaparYojana for merchants. Manju R Gowda, a 32-year-old fast-food restaurant owner in Mumbai is another winner of Rs. 50,000 under this scheme.
An analysis of the reward data also reveals winners as belonging to a wide geographical cross-section, including rural and urban areas spread across every State.   
NITI Aayog has been organizing DigiDhanMelas at 110 cities across India, beginning December 25th, 2016.. It will go on every day until April 14, 2017. Till date, 59 DigiDhanMelas have been organized to take the digital payments movement to the masses across the country.
Background:

The two schemes shall remain open till April 14, 2017. There are 15,000 daily winners qualifying for total prize money of Rs. 1.5 crore.

                The initiative to make Digital Payments a mass movement in India through NITI Aayog’s two incentive schemes – Lucky Grahak Yojana and DigiDhan Vyapar Yojana – has reaped huge dividends in just 45 days since its launch.
 
Latest data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which has been executing the schemes, shows that Rs.117.4 crore has been disbursed as reward money to over 7.6 lakh consumers and merchants, as on February 7, 2017. In addition to the daily cash backs to 15,000 consumers, 90 additional consumers and 3,000 merchants have won Rs1 lakh and Rs.50,000 each as weekly prize money for adopting digital mode of payments.
 
The schemes have seen active participation from both males and females. The latest data shows that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have emerged as top five states with maximum number of winners. While majority of the winners are in the age group of 21 to 30 years, the diversity in their age group ranges from 15 to 66 years of age. The involvement of the elderly in the mass movement challenges the notion that they find it challenging to embrace technology to adopt digital payments.  
 
The winners of the two schemes are also seen as belonging to diverse socio-economic backgrounds, from farmers, merchants, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives to retired persons. An analysis of the reward data also reveals winners as belonging to a wide geographical cross-section, including rural and urban areas.  It is interesting to note that the benefits of using digital payments have reached every part of India, with winners being spread across every State.  
 
Isham Singh, a 66 year-old farmer from the municipal committee of Assandh in Karnal, for instance, is a winner of Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers. He was introduced to digital payments only a month before he won the lucky draw. Anshul Gangwar, a 23 year-old technician from Ahmedabad too won Rs 1,00,000 under the scheme. Mangesh Anantrao Jadhav, a 27 year-old police officer and proud supporter of digital payments from Nashik  is another consumer who has won big for employing user-friendly methods of Digital Payments.
 
Among merchants, R Durairaj, a daily needs store owner from Dharampuri district in Tamil Nadu, won Rs 50,000 as part of the weekly prize under Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana for merchants. Yashpal Darbi, a 37 year-old merchant of a small clothing store owner from Solapur, in Maharashtra too is a proud winner of Rs 50,000 under our Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana.
